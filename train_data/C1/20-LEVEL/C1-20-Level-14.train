I've just squeezed that for you.
You need all the vitamins you can get with your cold.
And you can't manage that broccoli as well?
Alright.
"I don't mind you leaving your chicken, but I'd rather you ate your vegetables please."
As much as you can.
And plotting them?
Mm.
Have you been erm
Speed-type graphs.
Mhm.
Good.
"Aha, have you been asked, erm what is this?"
"Here's a graph, now guess the equation?"
No.
No.
Okay.
"You don't really need to, but it's, there usually isn't time to cover it, cos you've got other things, but it gives you a much better feel for it if you, if you see the other side of the picture all the time."
"That you're not just in isolation, looking at one little thing, because you can miss a lot."
"Erm you might think that all graphs always look like that, or bits of graphs are always like that, or where does it all tie in?"
Distance time graphs.
One of those on every exam so far.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you happy with those?
Er I think so yeah..
Okay.
"What's, what's happening here then?"
This is a good way
We do them in physics.
Oh lovely.
Thanks very much.
Okay.

But he looked so little.
Looked so raw round his rear end.
"But she, she's restructured his insides."
The muscle had wasted with the pressure of the double hernia.
The muscle had sort of disintegrated almost.
She's had to use what muscle she can to restructure his bowel.

Well the bill's nearly three hundred pound.

Being what?
Well I've been holding it to save it.
Yes.
That's why you should have aspirin to relax it.
Cos it helps it mend.
Ooh.
I feel as if I want to  it hurts and I feel as if I want to move it.
Yes.
He's told me be very bloody careful cos it can go out just like that.
But he did tell you to move?
Oh yes but very very gently.
He said tell it you're going to move.
Don't do anything sudden.
Tell it you're gonna move.
I like the way he puts it.
Yeah.

You haven't even watched the tape.
When have I had an opportunity to watch the tape?
Oh!
You must have been able to squeeze half an hour sometime or other.
"Anyway, I'm going to get ready or we'll never get the shopping done before you go to work."
Will we?
"Right, I'm ready."

"And it's covered in a, in a  po polythene would you say?"
Plastic  or what it is covered?
Cloth.
Cos you couldn't put that by the fire.
Yeah.
It would melt.
It's a cloth cover on it.
But I bet it's plastic inside it.
It's like these cushions isn't it?
It's foam.
Yes.
Foam.
But why was it so damp and cold here then?
Because it's wet and it's damp.
Well plastic doesn't hold the damp.
"It isn't plastic, it's foam!"
"Well the foam, it doesn't"
"Oh god, yes."
Well you couldn't put them in the car could you?
What?
The mattresses.
Mm?
Well I've put the big one in but I know that the rest wouldn't go in.
Mm.
But then the little bedroom wasn't so  didn't seem so damp.
"But you didn't try it did you, really?"
"In that caravan  a caravan's a caravan, call it what you like  but in that caravan that Mark is in  there was that little  room where the w hot water heater is"
Mm.
and there was a hole er on the floor over there with a grating on it that was  you could see through to the ground.
Mm.
"Well if  through the winter months  when there's no fire in there, no nothing in there  the damp is bound to be coming through there."

No it won't
Think about it
"Yeah, I know I did."
Well it's not bad for seventy shillings  see that

It's one pound
"Two pound, I beg your pardon"

I thought you were a mechanic.
I am.
Well get rid of your little red light then!
I've done it now .
It'd cost a lot of money.
"What, to get rid of a little red light?"
Yeah.
"Well I would do, I'd walk back for , me."
I'd say it's not on now.
Well me dad's needs an oil pump on it.

He never ever puts them down.
Or is it his C B aerial?
The C B one  says I've only just let you have it!
He's forgot it's there .
"He's not had much sleep though, poor sod."
You've got a spare bedroom you know.
He won't sleep in it cos I won't sleep in it.

Well
It was emptying but it's started filling up again.

"Now we got our drier other day, it come through."
Ah did it?

"We can dry  dry now, I just leave it, I leave both doors shut and it keeps kitchen warm."
Yeah they do.
Yes.
"But you've gotta watch the con mind you it won't make no difference, condensation, will it?"
Yeah they don't half make kitchen warm though.
Mm.
I used to have one but he got fed up of me using it so he cut plug off
Ah
and we ended up selling it .
Yeah.
"And what you will have to do, you will have to tell  each other what  you would like to buy or what you would think of."
"Because, if you scrub them off then I'll know that you're gonna buy them."

Anyway that's that's my letter.
"Draft letter which I have not got, it's very very rough, for the press."
Sorry I've only got four.
That's alright.
"Actually some friends of mine were quite confused about what, why they shouldn't be able to throw their cooking oil away in their bin."
Because they said they'd always done it and they had nowhere else to put it.
Somebody else said oh you should throw it down the sink but I didn't think you were supposed to do that either.
What?
Cooking oil.
Cooking oil?
Yeah.
"If you have got one of those deep  fat fryers you, you have quite a bit to throw away."
Well don't put it in water.
But I think he's  I don't think he's misformed at all.
Misformed?
That's not quite the way to say it !
Deformed.
Deformed.
Misformed !
He is!
You think he's deformed don't you?
"No, I don't think he's deformed!"
Of course he's not deformed!
He's lovely!
"Very, very  actually I think."
Did you see him dive yesterday?
"The bit where he like jumping on the lake  they've cut away  a bit of the platform so the only way you can do it is jump onto this bit of wood then fly, and literally he was like that, just going  in mid air and landed right in the water!"
He's nuts!
Blinking !
Bit cold for that innit?
"No, it was gorgeous yesterday wasn't it?"
Yeah.
And it's very
You and Brian  were loving it!
"Brian said not too much today Matt,I thought bloody hell what do you think I am!"
Telling me to walk across!
Is that what he said ?
Yeah.
He's worse that I am !
"Both of you, you're both saps!"
Don't let him go in the water it's too cold!
That's rubbish!
Dogs don't feel that!
At night  see he can't leave him alone he sits there and he goes  or something like that and jumps on him and gives him a    I can't keep my hands off that dog!
Ah ah ah!
"Now, it is down to interpretation i er er and, it, on your next courses you may do a more in-depth conditions of carriage quiz which will ask you to study the conditions of carriage at night and produce a bit more detailed answer in the morning, but we're not gonna expect you to do that on this course."
"Erm, number five erm  can you read that out for me Mandy?"
"What, sorry, go on."
Go on.
When would you cube a consignment?
What did you put Bill?
What did Bill put?
That's a very good answer then.
It's one I could think of.
Gets me out of trouble that one.
I got one.
Did anybody get that one right?
"No well I, I"
I thought when the mass
I sa er
is greater than the weight.
You know
Yes.
That's right.
Cos I put like
I put
if you're taking six foot of film it won't weigh much but it'll take a lot of room up.
That's fairly accurate that.
I just put if you've got
Oh you're having that one are you?
"if you've got a load , if you"
It's a good point.
if you've got a er
More consignments on it.
dead we or  gross weight
Yes.
Well
But we don't even measure yet .
"I, I've yet, I've got a, a major job on my hands to reeducate people and bring in systems for much more accurate measurement of our work."
It's a very difficult job to measure is M and E.
Mm.
Well a lot of them are just
because
lump sums aren't they?
Well I mean a lot of it can't be measured you know?
Mm.
Mm.
"Hundreds of miles of, of cables"
Cables
on a site
Trunking
for example.
Yeah.
You know we we are not geared
S s
up to measure yet properly.
And we need to be.
Right.
So I'm saying we're wa way off what the procedures are currently saying.
A and all I'm saying is that and I rest my case
Mm.
is that
If we came to be audited
"procedures should be  what is happening, not what our aspirations are."
No.
I'm sorry.
Particularly when they're long way .
No.
"But, but when you're measuring something"
That the caravan is cleaned.
It's got to be he says.
He said because people  leave their dirty things and beds and all this kind of thing.
He said we cannot allow that.
Well you can understand that.
"Yes, well he knows from experience."
Yes.
He said we can't allow people .
"He said if something like this got out, he said, we'd be out of business."
He said and do you know that we're a multi- million pound organization.
"Of course, of course ."
Mm?
He said we're not .
So I said well  a couple approached my wife here on  on Saturday.
I said and they're very happy and ninety nine percent of the people on this site are happy.
Solid like.
And I said I  you tell me if I'm happy.
"Cos you've gotta convince me now, this morning, or my caravan's going off here."
"I said and before you start  that the caravan can't go for four years,on this tape."
Did he listen to it?
Oh yes.
Bring that here.
chicken or is it
It's chicken.
"I don't want no chicken, I just want the chips."
Do you want some lamb then?
No I just want some chips.
If you'd rather have the lamb I'll have chicken.
No no.
I just want some chips.
Do you want tea?
I'll have coffee please.
"You know, use that as an excuse."
Yeah.
fine okay.
"Right okay I think that's it then,er  Okay"
Right.
so  one's really the one where I need to involve you.
Basically i if you can.
Yeah.
The rest I'll let you know
I hear.
Erm I I'm also I also quite
Ooh
would like to know what's going on with  and .
Whether  actually has any er control over what  's doing in the marketplace.
Okay yeah yeah.
"I know it was Andy  last time and he's a  guy so yeah, I'll find out."
Well  you find out I might be able to find out to .
Well  yeah okay.
"Erm that was a point,, I er  spindle bearings and I want to take the business off 'em."
"Now with it being , we're not gonna look at a high margin straight away cos I know that's a waste of time."
Er but we can make a reasonable margin including spacers.
It's a set of three bearings with a pair of spacers.
"So you have two bearings in tandem, a pair of spacers and a third bearing."
And it's their normal machine centre range.
They use like about forty pairs a month.
Yeah.
"Erm  sell for about eighty seven pound including spacers so I was gonna go in at about eighty three, eighty four but it's the new pricing company so I've got to ask your permission haven't I?"
". It's a new product, I'm gonna make reasonable It's about thirty five per cent margin"
It's a new product?
No it's it's a new size for us to supply.
We've never b
Well
I will say that.
"It, it, perhaps there's something wrong with the dumper."
Was it
Doesn't it say whether it's the same dumper?
Was it the same dumper?
Yeah.
No.
It isn't.
what are the recommendations?
"What are the report, what, what's in clauses what used to be thirty seven and thirty eight?"
Recommended course of action and stuff like that.
We're not
That's a good question Terry.
Were these dumper drivers certificated?
Why it happened?
I mean
I've   of watching brief jobs for which we are not responsible.
Oh.
It's nowt to do with us then isn't it?
Well.
I'm I mean
I'm not being facetious but what is the bloody point
No.
It's s
in telling us
I don't know why you're clogging our meetings up with somebody else's accidents.
Because I'm supposed to report all accidents
Yeah.
to here.
Yes.
He is.
It's it's my
I mean how often do you use six?
"Well we do, there's five of us in the family see"
Oh I see
Yeah so
we had four kids   I mean now it's only when we get visitors you know when
Yeah.
"there's only two of us, you get two visitors we're alright as a four"
Saying that we don't
"We keep ours in the garage, the extra  two carvers"
Oh yes.
"and they come down when you know, if we've got any"
When you need them.
Mm.
Otherwise it's just a waste really.
Well that's probably what I'm gonna have to do.
"You can get, you can get sets of four can't you?"
Oh yes
But six  hard to get.
I'll just try and get two carvers to match
"Yeah, that's, that's the answer really and er if they're not quite the same you can get away with two carvers can't you?"
"But er  oh well  Yeah this is what got me, I like the er the legs you know, the the backs I, I didn't like at all because you've got this blue"
Well
"You've got no  no m no wood that's showing you see, that's the trouble."
"Yes, yes."
Yeah
"Erm but I'm hoping they'll  put them on a, on the table when we sell them in here and there's  that's the first thing that'll hit them is the turned legs you see?"
Nice.
This is a su survey.
finished at one point but it's veneered
Mm
But erm
"this, but this was exposed then?"
Well how do you get through the gates?
Loads of water get up through the gates.
So.
"Yeah, so up to the gates, just push yourself off the gates"
.
"How quick can you get to the surface, must be strong ,, two, three  riding down to the  and you're gonna push it out the way, it's like, it's like the tide, it comes in and then goes back out,."
Should be two in there.
Why?
I don't see .
"No if, cos there seemed a  pair."
.
At this work experience .
In .
Do they?
I asked for some once.
You did?
"No, I never pick up the phone, they do that, pick up one phone and speak for a minute, while that ones ringing they say hold on a minute, and pick up the other one."
What's it about then?
", it's only about this erm, I have to do the practice."
Huh?
Have to do the practice.
Know how to do them now?
You should  at Peter's.
I don't know Peter's .
"No, I don't actually."
Cos I don't know his  can't do it.
Quit easy though isn't it?
"All you do is, stick it through, phone your number, push the button, it's gone through."
I get fed up doing the .
"Yeah, but, even when you leave school that's what happens don't it?"
"I, I mean you usually start off with the boy  everybody has to start at the bottom,."
.
Yeah.
You have your paper  you have your  bottles
"you know alright  initially as you say  it take, it costs  but"
To set it up
"it does , to set it up,yo you have  you have, you'll have to have three, three what's his names?"
"Three, three bin men  to come and collect it."
Mm.
"Or no, you have to have three containers."
But they do it in Canada!
Well this is what I'm saying!
Yeah.
But I mean
Even even got one
you see
for plastic!
"but, but there  well yo , you could have four, you could have as many as you like"
Mm.
"but I mean  surely, in the long term"
Course!
but that co
"idea he doesn't drink beer, so you can have his for"
"Well no,but I mean like"
But that's the key word is the long term Ken!
"like you sell, you sell that back  to them  that that pays  the man's wages that is doing it!"
Mm.
Mm.
"But it's the short term isn't it, with them?"
They just thinking well we haven't got the machinery to cope with this!
It's easier for us
No the
to buy the new raw material and process it
Yeah I said
Are you?
Has your mum been bad to you?
No?
Have a wee look at your nose first.
better.
Throat now.

Yes.
Have you got any swollen glands in your neck?
"Yes, they're up."
Okay?
Mm
It's
"It's taking awful long Doctor,."
"Oh well it's, she's got sinus after this flu."
"It's er just what's been happening to a lot of folk, sinus trouble."
Do you like nice medicine or do you prefer those?
Don't know.
You're not bothered ?
She'll say that and then give you the
horrible stuff.
in a bottle.
"Er I can put it in, in a bottle or I can give you tablets."
In tablets.
You prefer tablets alright then.
Now this is this quite a common thing after the flu to get a problem.
Most times it's both but it's mainly the the left hand side with Jenny.
The skin from here's swollen right
Mhm.
"across and it's touching that hole in the middle and she's getting all blocked up and the stuff's running all the way down the back of your throat, that right?"
"And you're coughing all night, keeping everybody awake?"
"Aye, she doesn't bother but us in the next room, ah,bother us ."
you know?
They never asked me
if they could  or the flue in so it's
"That's right, say it like that!"
never been  repaired.
neglecting the .
"Well having said, what, what is it all about?"
"It's because  the  no, no water heater should be in the bathrooms!"
So where's that gonna go then?
"Well it must either go in the kitchen or in the cupboard somewhere, but you know?"
That's what they've er  put it to.
what you said to me.
Oh yeah.
Oh well we'll have to move won't we?
Yeah.
"It's working, like gas-wise, like I say, it is  it's virtually, it's just the ventilation clearing out the  the fumes  which are given"
Mm.
off from it.
Do you see what I mean?
"Well it is  isn't there a, there's a chimney above there isn't there?"
Yeah.
"That's right, yeah, but  but now  like I said, you're gonna have to , to have your certain pipes."
"Like, have you seen them all going round?"
They got long poles on the back step.
Will it'll be longer than that ?
No  cos they haven't done this one  because it shouldn't be in here!
Even in the fire?
Yeah.
Right.
"Yeah, I mean, it shouldn't be in here, like, that's why they haven't  that's why they've put it there."
That's why they hung on the to the shipment cos these aren't supposed to be in  the bathrooms.
Right.
Yeah but well you look that  that jaguar  four litres!
. Four litre car!
Yeah but what are you gonna do with four litres?
I dunno.
Well quite.
It does about  eighteen miles to the gallon.
How many miles do we do to the gallon?
I hope we do something like thirty six.
Thirty six!
Don't think it's much more than that.
"How can his, well  if ours is one point six  there's three times"
No it doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work like that?
No.
So what  how long will it take him to get eighty miles filling up every ?
Well I mean do they have huge tanks?
"I mean they take  if you, if you filled up you could put I think it's about twenty six gallons in that car."
And how many can we put in?
Nine?
Eleven?
Cor.
Eleven.
"It was eight, nine."
I think this might take eleven.
So how much do they spend if they filled it ?
"Don't forget if you've got all that weight, you've got that you're gonna lose even more petrol."
"So if you filled that up, how much would that cost them?"
"Well, twenty six  I think it's something like  isn't it something like two pounds a gallon now?"
"You don't, they do it all by litres now so it's really hard"
About fifty P?
"About fifty, fifty pounds?"
Fifty pounds to fill up!
", but he died soon after that but he'd realised that he'd worked hard all his life"
Mm.
you know
Yes.
really worked hard
Yes.
"and at the end of it, see you always think that you're going on don't you?"
"Mm, mm."
and you think oh well I'll get my prize at the end.
Mm.
Mm.
"But, but, you don't know whether or not."
You never think this is my last day .
"No, it can be can't it?"
". Go and enjoy every, every minute of it."
"Yeah, every days a bonus."
"Yeah, get, get the best out of it anyway ."
"Yeah, you're quite right, or he's quite right."
You don't have to worry too much about money do you really so long as you can manage with it.
"Ha Harry, Harry Secombe is said after his heart attack there's no pocket in the shroud."
No.
"Well he's right, there are no pocket's in a shroud and he's seemed much happier since."
"Yeah, oh yeah."
It's a shame with .
"That's what annoys me with erm these big company's you know, opening on Sunday's really, because er, you can only get the money, I mean they've only got a certain amount"
Yeah.
"I mean if they could open nine days a week, they couldn't get any more money out of me because"
"No, you haven't got it."
No.
No.
"They're, they're ,"
"No, me neither ."
I suppose
We've still got all day Monday off as well.
True.
"She ain't got all, to rush back for anything, has she?"
No.
This is nice.
Nice.
Mm.
"They're nice, aren't they?"
Now you know why you eat so many of 'em.
"I wanted to get the wholemeal ones, bloody out in Tescos."
"The only thing, their bread's a bit crap in there."
Yeah.
"Never get, you know, as big a selection as I'd like to get  in there."
"But, still beggars can't be choosers, they are cheap, they had loads of offers on them."
Mm.
"Tins of baked beans, fourteen P."
"Do, what do they taste like, though?"
"Well, I should imagine they're just the same as their normal ones, and they've stuck a, a whacking great white label on them, but I mean, you know, perhaps they're of an inferior quality, I don't know."
I haven't tasted them yet.
Julia's had them and she said they were fine.
"Erm, well, rice pudding."
Only
I don't like anything like that.
"I, I wouldn't buy it, but,"
Emily eats it for breakfast.
With jam on it.
Mm.
Why don't you like it?
"Not that I'd ever tried it, but, that sort of thing, semolina, and all that,"
"I hate it, urgh."
"Yoghurt, you like yoghurt, though."
Right.
Right.
Next one.
What is the customer obliged to provide da to load and unload a consignment?
"Who di , who got the answer?"
Not exact.
"I, er I said suitable lifting or moving equipment."
I'd accept that.
"Plant, power or labour."
Moving equipment then.
Yeah
That's
I got that one.
what I said to you.
Ah!
I got that.
Did you accept it Paul?
It got one.
Yeah.
"Yeah, you did?"
Yeah about  lifting equipment?
About power lifting equipment.
Yeah I'd accept that.
Cup of tea for the driver.
What we actually put
"Cup of tea, sustenance , yeah."
"What we actually put is, er, it is the responsibility in the conditions of carriage."
It is a responsibility.
Where would you find the conditions of carriage.
On the back of every erm  contract out there.
On the back of every contract.
Because  it is subject to the conditions of carriage  that we accept their business and therefore we have to provide them with written information.
Yes we'd have to check.
erm I should first check.
"Check with them, yeah quite."
"So I I do, you do Tesco."
I'll do the swimming pool.
"I, I, I  would check who actually  is responsible for that"
.
But of course all paper now is
All paper?
All paper.
What about this  chap then?
It's in the library th with his number.
"Well, you ring him but if he, if he gets upset or, or"
Oh I see.
it's it's strange  you can give that as an address.
Any Uttlesford  town of some size has got a comprehensive recycling centre now that takes any paper
Do you have to sort it?
Do you have to take it sorted?
No.
No.
It's just a big skip?
And it says
at Stanstead
Do they then sort it?
the car park
"No, they it's  the council collects it and  in Uttlesford, that's why I said we should get at the same time  an Uttlesford councillor because I would"
"Yes, yeah"
"like to know a, whether their new scheme is only temporary, is about to break down."
Mm.
Or whether they actually get the disposals cost incorporated into this skip collecting cost.
Because the  money they can get for this  mixed paper must be a pittance.
Mm.
How am I gonna get them in the van?
What van?
"In, back into the caravan."
On me own.
Oh.
"It's a double mattress, a double bedded mattress."
I can't bloody lift that.
So the only thing that I would suggest is to
Well still Mark will be  there.
Or he could come down with you on Saturday?
Or Sally maybe would be able to come down with you Saturday and help you?
Unless we went over the same day that Susan went over.
And kept the mattresses till Susan goes.
But the understanding is  that like Mark has got the caravan this week.
Mm.
"But if they had a booking to go into it, Mark's gotta get out."
Oh well he could ring you up and you could take them back down but at least they would be dried.
Cos if anybody  who could they come on if they caught cold and and
Well I dunno.
You or him?
I dunno.
It's like fighting a losing battle isn't it?
If someone else
I wouldn't worry at all.
I wouldn't hesitate.
It's an embarrassment for people to come in and catch cold and think it's your mattresses that's done it.
Mm.
"If those men were not working on the gas I would go over there now, and I'd switch the fire and I'd leave it on."
Mm.
Yes.
The thing is old Mark is there to see to it.
Mark won't be there to see to it?
"Yo you can't put it in that he said, it's brand new!"
"That'll be alright  so cos he slid his  my brief case  and er I got all the way home, no problem at all, I'd got newspaper under the back, so it didn't scratch the back  when I come to  come down Mill Road  this lorry's go , I mean I got the tail gate up  and er  I sort of looked in the mirror, I thought oh my goodness my tail gate, I could hear it so   and I braked a bit sharp and that slid down  and scratched along the dash board!"
Oh dear!
"Trying to get it out , sort of plastic dash went creeeh!"
Cor!
This  lintel!
That went right across there  but   well I suppose  .
Well I imagine there is.
Yeah.
Mum?
I wanna play a game.
Alright then  I'm sorry that's not in there.
Mum!
Well it don't matter we'll probably be able something out the sale anyway.
"Yeah you can get it, yeah."
"Mum,"
Yeah that's right.
take up.
What?
Er
No.
.
Oh  oh  didn't look.
"Anyway I'd better go, I'll see, well if I don't see you before I'll see you next Wednesday"
For my birthday.
then won't I?
"Yep, so what time is it, half past six is it, or do you want me  quarter past six was it, or half six, what time do you want me?"
Is quarter past six too early?
"No, I'm home till quarter past eight."
Is that alright?
Yeah.
That'll be better for me really if you don't mind.
"oh right, oh I didn't realize, there were just two parcels on the erm"
Yeah look
"on the thing and, and I picked them both up"
you see.
I thought they were both for me.
Oh dear.
Ah!
Oh well erm
Yeah I didn't fancy
let's see
going up to the senile
No I don't I don't blame you.
Erm
I sort of started to feel a bit ill before so
Yeah.
Well do er do come in er  well did you have a pleasant trip down?
"Erm yeah it was okay, it wasn't too bad."
Mm.
Alright  cos I think we've been sent these on approval to see if we want to adopt them for course material
Yeah.
you see so erm
They seem quite nice.
Yeah.
"Erm well I, I don't know quite what erm they'll be teaching you out of in your er abnormal course but erm er I do find the, the  the sort of current generation of American textbooks quite erm"
Mm.
"quite a nice, quite exciting erm I tell you what, swivel that swivel chair round and, and sit on that"
Okay.
Do you have a drink please or
Yes of course.
Now erm what sort of flavours appeal?
"Now we've got ordinary tea, we've got herbal tea, we've got coffee out of a coffee machine, we've got Lapsang Souchong, we've got ordinary tea  I've mentioned that already haven't I?"
Erm
Was Bleep in?
Yeah  he had a big do with the council man.
Why?
The council bloke come down
"Oh, what is Val's accent?"
Well west
is it?
Yeah.
to be exact.
"Well  I don't know  well that'll be on there if they want to know anyway now, you've just said it."
Mm  erm  yeah the council bloke come down and went in while his father was there
I see you've got no carpets down anywhere  the door's not painted  and he said you've been living here for two years!
Well what's the council man got to do with that?
Well they got a grant you see.
Well carpets ain't got nothing to do with it surely?
Yes they have  that's when I  the house is finished.
Oh.
"When your carpets were down, you moved in  so he's coming back December the eighth."
I thought he would have to tell them  got his carpets down.
He had a carpet just put down in his lounge.
Well he's got a lot to do then.
He was belly aching .
Cor!
How's how's the thing between Blue and
Completely  by now.
Good heavens!
Even the first day back  there was hardly any atmosphere at all very serious mood they were  but Kim keeps well out of it.
Oh I think she's the trouble maker there myself.
Yeah  she'll just keep well out of it.
I think  that's what started it all off I think she's running off.
Yeah.
Oh whatever you done?
Yeah?
"So in a way yo you're doing  different hours and all  so your pay, was that based on forty hour week?"
Or was that just based on  you being there whenever  you had to be there.
"Don't forget he's only started th , the job's only started a week!"
I'm just asking dear!
I'm paying for supper.
Yeah.
They're paying me for forty hours.
And anything you do above forty hours you can extra for?
Yeah.
"But, saying that  means you got a lot"
You don't have forty hours only to do.
I have.
"Because  the hour, the hours  forty  but   there's loads to be done ."
Yeah.
I'm getting them sorted out with Roy
"Well erm  have you had your pay yet from them, no?"
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
"So you, well then you'll still not know what you're going out with because you still have a few days from last week to get ."
"So you don't know what you'll start with, you'll actually bring in."
I will do.
Do you?
On my pay slip.
It doesn't make any difference  .
Do you remember the  form David got with the tax form and all?
"He's gonna give it into  Mericlean and Mericlean , just said we'll have to send it off  to the tax office to get your tax code changed."
"It's er, the tax code on his P forty five is ."
Well
His
it's like I'll get
twenty five.
Yeah.
Bye.
See ya.
Bye.
See you later.
"Oh no, she's got to walk round with him."
"The thing is, you can't really, you couldn't sort of see this jagged mess."
He's made a right mess of it.
"He shaved up the back, hasn't he?"
It's odd and even.
"Yeah, but, yeah"
"And you get this, this bit here"
"he's all shaved, his hair come back over it."
"See like, long hair here, so it's hanging down, scraggily,so you've got like a shaved head, with all these bits here ain't ya?"
"So it covers it up a little bit, but it looks like he's gone bald."
No.
"Because he's like, long bits of hair, like this thick, hanging over, a shaved head,and you know, you know Tina, you know Tina Turner, you know her husband kept on going like this all the time  yeah  mine does that all the time  yeah, I go oh pack it in."
"Like Peter, you know, he does all this, like he keeps going, oh show it to me, I can't I'm trying to grow it."
"I'm trying it down, like, so it's round here."
"Do you think it'd be good like that, and I went, yes Ryan it'd look much better."
"Cos he keeps growing his hair, to sort of there, and then he has it cut off, don't he, he's shaved."
"Cos he has to have it undercut, cos that's hard."
"He's full of being hard, isn't he, Ryan?"
"He is, ain't he, just full of it."
"Oh  I've got something, erm, Peter's in prison,"
"Oh no, really?"
Three years.
You're joking.
No.
Really?
"I  when I went, you know when I went down, do you remember I told you that I got caught up with him?"
Yeah.
You want a change?
How
Yeah.
was you thinking of having it cut?
Short.
What short short?
Yeah.
"Actually I think it suits you, I mean really i like  it's not on her face anyway isn't it?"
No  so short
So I think
No.
short hair would suit you cos you haven't got it all over your face have you?
Cos I saw erm  a photo when I was eighteen and I it was  sort of short in the neck  over my ears  short in there and then sort of fuller there and then just a bit of  you know a light fringe not a heavy fringe  and I thought I might have it like that so
Yeah.
That'll be nice  I can't really remember
Well I think if that was me  I'd have that done now  in case you don't like it by the time you  you get married and that could be growing again.
Oh no I wouldn't have it cut until after I got married.
Oh
No.
you'd have it cut after?
Yeah.
Oh.
Cos I definitely want my hair long for when we get married.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah  so that I can either have it  up or down really.
Yeah.
I've got the choice then.
Yeah  I do do you know I don't like to see brides with their hair down  if you've got long hair i
Oh.
but I don't think  sometimes I think  well if it looks nice  but some of them brides on there that just hangs   don't it?
"Oh yeah, I'm not having it like that."
Yes.
"That was er  that, yeah well it's not out yet is it?"
Looks like a  looks like the front of a B M W to me.
I think that's what they're trying to emulate.
Oh that one.
How much is it?
Supposed to be.
Don't know how much it costs.
"Should think it starts at about sixteen, seventeen thousand  ."
Yeah .
A three's heavy isn't it?
Look.
Yeah.
"So you got any ideas what you're gonna get, what you should get mum for ?"
Er.
We could just  fall back on a bit of sweets and chocolate or something in the end but I'd like to get some
What  what sort of thing are you gonna get her?
there's some funny little weird shops down Thornton Heath aren't there?
What sort of thing are we talking about?
Well I dunno.
Something  I'm not  I've no idea until I see it.
Well something like soap or what?
"Could get her some, some toiletries or something."
I dunno.
I was hoping for something even more er
a Moss chemist might be able to get her some Bromley don't they?
There is a Moss chemist on the way.
Oh yes she did tell me that she'd like some of that.
Yes there is one isn't there?
By  shops.
"Right we, we'll  we'll treat that as a fail safe then."
If we can't see anything more unusual suppose we could always fall back on  the bubble baths or the  anyway I think that's a bit more than  but there you go.
"Funny way of writing it, but you ca you could write it that way."
Ten X.
Erm  people might say oh well we'll take it from minus five to plus five.
Yeah.
And you'd get some sort of shape.
But you'd miss a lot of important points.
Yeah.
Erm if they took it from minus ten to plus ten
Yeah.
you'd see a lot more things of interest and maybe  say oh I'll take it from minus fifteen to plus fifteen.
"But you're still missing out a big, very important part of the graph, because for a lot of its range it actually, you know, looks something like well what would that look like?"
When X is gigantic.
Ten times.
"If, if X was a million say, you could forget about a million minus ten, let's just call it a million,"
times ten
Ten.
"minus a million, we'll forget about the ten, just think of the minus a million."
So it's a million times minus a million.
Roughly.
A million times minus a million?
Ah.
Minus.
"What's, okay, let's come down a bit."
What's plus three times minus three?
Three.
What's plus three times plus three?
Nine.
Right.
"And, minus three times minus three?"
Minus nine.
No.
Minus three times minus three?
And she said well it does take a time for the vans to dry out.
Mm.
Not until the sun comes hot and heavy on it.
"So whoever goes there, to anybody's van, that's what they're getting."
"Oh well, I should take advantage now Mark is in, bring the damn things from there."
Then you can get him to help you take them back on Friday.
I think we'd have to ring them up and let them know what we're doing.
Well go in office and tell them.
You can talk  personally better than on the phone.
Cos they are your mattresses aren't they?
When you take them back they're there for their inspection.
Unless you  you  take electric blanket down?
"Put it on, oh  You can't put that on a damp bed can you?"
Not really.
Don't think so.
Not
Well they are protected.
What?
Er er electric blankets.
Don't know.
"They're built er pretty, pretty good that way I think."
I don't know what about the lags for the wall
"And another thing, I didn't even look in Mark's room."
Was there pillows and blankets and quilts in his  caravan?
I didn't look.
Well perhaps Sally had a hunt
Dunno.
Oh well   Well I dunno I think I'll go and wash me hair.
It's desperate for it.
I've gotta have a bath in the morning.
tomorrow.
Is it?
Well I still
I think
think
"you, you know you feel safe ."
"that even in something like the choir  it's somebody that you should of struck up a, er a relationship  you know, over several"
The
intervals.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And you suddenly, you thought to yourself  well  you know I actually quite like this chap."
Mm.
"You know, wouldn't it be nice if he had asked me out."
And then suddenly the day
Mm mm.
comes along.
"Not to sort of well you, you can't be blamed because I mean  yo , in the innocent you were actually going because of the concert."
I know.
You see I ne
"But he didn't , you know, he, he can't believe his luck that somebody"
No.
as attractive as you
said yes
he's got this goat beard and this hairy bottom lip!
"You know, breathe that smells of moth balls, I mean who would have thought of that."
"And he, and"
If he were taking several of you out why didn't you say to one of the other girls  why don't you come?
Did he have a pair of tickets?
Cos it was when we were walking down
Michael can I have a look please?
Oh  sorry !
Thank you.
Have we got any in ?
Mm.
No.
No I didn't think we had.
"No, I don't think so."
Sorry?
Do you own your
No!
Do you?
We we have acquired a large chunk of the the  yes.
"So you should, you should nominate that as a"
site of the interest shouldn't you?
Erm  it's valuable but not that valuable.
"But it says here, written written to Linda Chalker about the I T P O."
"Now I, I rang, I sent a postcard  which was ready written."
Do you think that counts?
Promoted the .
Well we did try.
"Yeah, put that we did do that."
Didn't get very far though did we?
Actually that seems to have fizzled out.
Haven't heard anything about that for a while.
Erm  written to the government in U K  bank about the bank propose new foreign  policy.
I think we might have done that.
I think we might have done that.
I know that I've written to British gas.
And I think I wrote  world bank.
"That was, thing is that was quite a long time ago."
I'm sure it wasn't this year.
This is February ninety one.
it's alright but you get to the bottom of those stairs and sometimes .
"Er  check locally for claims of environmentally or sustainable tropical hardwood it's not really, I mean I do look when I go  to all these D I Y places to see what they've got."
But there is something about you that is a bit different to  politicians.
Apart from that but Well th that's true that's true .
Trouble.
Trouble.
And you've had plenty of that.
Plenty of trouble.
And yet you keep bouncing back or
Yes.
swinging back.
"I mean, er"
"I wrote a book called, Where there's a will."
Precisely.
You resigned over over Westland you er er you were defeated for the leadership.
"You've had your heart attack, you've been out of action for three months and yet, when you talk to people, when the pollsters go out with their clipboards, they say, Who do you think is most likely apart from the Prime Minister, to lead the Tory party?"
"And they say, you."
Still.
So what is it about you?
Trouble.
It's got to be a bit more than that.
Ambition ?
Long hair.
"Long hair, tall."
You know.
Been around a long time.
"Erm I  what is it, who knows, who cares?"
"You know, if I'm president of the board of trade, I'm a loyal member of John Major's cabinet."
I intend to go on doing that as long as he wants me.
And the inevitable qu you'd expect me to ask this to you.
"If John Major fell under a privatized train, would your hat still be in the ring?"
Or
Well
"would you say, I've had it all now, I do"
I thought it was you?
No.
No.
"He and, erm a the other bloke are still there."
"The chap who tried to call, the one watching it?"
"Behind, yep."
"Yeah, he's still there."
I was gonna say er  somebody told me that he'd left and I thought it was you cos nobody would .
"No, he's still here."
"I got it wrong, yeah."
"Yeah, could have been me Marg."
Could have easily been me.
Do you think you'd better aim for the winter now?
"I would, definitely."
Yeah.
"Personally, maybe we just"
Did I tell you what's happened?
They sent you all notes on
Well it's quite naughty
and then you won't
cos Goodwood's sorted isn't it?
"you'll expect that they  The coach was burnt out down in Beatmore , if you remember  and then the  the police  took them August there"
"Di , no,th October."
police took him in that night cos they thought he'd burnt it out himself.
"And it's taken all this time, it's gone to court and all the rest of it, and they haven't got a case."
"So, they couldn't do anything in the meantime."
I should think
Well they
that was genuine.
the banks wo wouldn't let me have extra money or anything like that.
Oh!
They're trying to get somewhere now  with the police but  it could have happened anywhere!
an O S and just  well within our sites and everything
But don't give it a drawing number.
No.
It's just attached to the letter.
Yes.
"Now you get your, you've got your list of who you want to write to?"
Yeah.
"If you check with erm  Dennis   because they're doing all, you know, doing the contract documents, he could  confirm all the, the current addresses."
Okay.
That alright?
Yeah.
You're sounding a bit weary .
No that's alright
"There's no rush about this, I mean er you know, you've got well"
Well there is up to a point because you know how bad they are at responding.
Yes there is.
I mean er what I mean is it needs to be done this week sort of thing.
Yes.
Oh that's okay I'll get all them off  .
"I'll do a, I'll do a draft letter this afternoon, you can have a look at it, erm  we'll knock a plan up  and her get the addresses and then that's  it's easy then innit?"
Yeah.
I wonder if we do want to put it in
Oh sshh
You've finished your mi meeting already Mike?
"Right, well let's, okay."
"Er, yes."
Sorry about that.
"No it's alright we're only trying to work somewhere, somewhere quiet."
I suddenly thought that on the advert that's gone in
Yeah  there's a chair here.
On the advert that's gone in I did wonder whether to put  please respond by  such and such a date?
Don't worry about it.
We well yes she's
why's she crying?
she's obviously in it for the bet.
She must be the cameraman's dau
Here it comes Chris.
Mum's favourite.

Three bottles.
Not gonna show you mum.
Ah they'll show it on the news later on.
"Cos that'll be, that'll be the bit they show on the news."
About Senna retiring.
"Oh, you saw the first"
I want to see all the exciting bits I missed.
"Well, won't they have highlights on later?"
This is the highlights.
"You mean, they didn't show the full race?"
The full race was run at some obscure time today so
When I listened to the six o'clock news
I was hoping you wouldn't come
on the radio
running through and tell me
"No, oh  do I ever?"
They said it was half way through
"Yes, well that's a"
at the six o'clock news.
"well, yes sh yes well, this, well this was only the highlights unless the last two or three, no the last two or three parts have been live."
"Yeah, on the six o'clock they said it was half way through and Nigel Mansell was the lead and I thought you were watching it live, so I wouldn't just come through and"
Mm mm.
Right.
"Chrissy go outside and shake the grass off you now please, off your back."
David!
"a matter of about, er, I think I think the mortgage now is ten point nine, and we'll be paying eleven point something,"
Yeah.
So it's only a matter of a
"Yeah, but one per cent 's a hell of a lot you know."
It's a penny in the pound.
"Yeah, but I mean it, it will drop, it will drop again."
"But the thing is, also what I thought of once we gotta us a mortgage and got established, you could always remortgage and go into er like Bradford and Bingley, and come out like that"
"Yeah, once you get it back up to"
Yeah.
"Yeah, well that's"
"Well, I thought once we get"
It'll not be a dodgy one.
"Put it in there, then."
"It won't be, it's not forced to be a building society."
"No, it isn't."
It gonna  to be a building society.
"Oh, well, it might be Abbey National."
"No, it's come back, it's got Target Finance on it."
Ah.
Well that's o that is a finance company  and not a building society.
"If it says finance, it doesn't mean a building society."
"Nine times out of ten, it's a finance company."
"Same as er, Mercantile, and"
"Well, 'cos I mean, we dealt with Mercantile, we dealt with Key Finance,"
Yeah.
Er
We've dealt with summat Wagon.
"Key, that, when we first bo when we first bought our car through that Scottis that bloody bank."
Scottish Amicable.
Scottish Amicable.
Like Widows.
They're always ringing up.
"At the same time it, I mean the countries wo , have been crippled by the  the burden of er  defence if you like  and we'll call it defence."
And they have!
"Erm, but in fact it's probably for some of the state that we're in now!"
But er
"I would I wouldn't sa , I wouldn't of said"
There's a price to pay for everything.
that you see  they have created the jobs!
"Yes  yeah  but I don't know, it seems crazy to me when they've"
Well that's false economy that!
There's such  you know  sort of appalling need
"Yes, but that was the get,"
that was your get out!
"Or the  or the er  boost in the, in the economy  you know but erm"
"Yeah, but I don't think"
but I mean they were mo they were making
"Might work in our economy, but not in theirs I don't think!"
Well it hasn't!
But instead
Oh no!
of getting on with the  five years plans they've put too much effort into producing  war machines!
"Well and this is it  I mean, where we could afford it they couldn't!"
Well can we?
Look at America!
Well
"They've got greater means, I know"
"No, they, they could of they could of  afforded better than the"
Oh yeah!
you know?
Yeah.
Only just.
"So, and unfortunately erm  well"
"I mean they, they were exploiting  or they had  they had the potential exploit more countries  than Russia did."
Oh they call it
oh I thought you did
"No I didn't, no"
"cos I say cos erm Bill never got a bag, and it four pounds something now"
Where'd he get it from?
"Oh I don't know, but it was"
I don't know
"her last ones, about two pound something a bag"
They're two fifty a bag in there
ain't you?
Yeah
Weather I suppose got something to do with it  had a weekend down there with her and Ant
Oh yeah
cos she weren't very well really
"No, no, they broke down didn't they?"
Ah?
They broke down
Oh I dunno she didn't say nothing about that
"Yeah, no, she and Colin they broke down they, they broke down at the"
"Oh she didn't, no"
"Yeah, they got they'd got half hour's drive from Minehead and that their car broke down, they had to go up, they had to call the, was it the A are they?"
Oh yeah
They got there but they had to go in second gear look
"Oh dear, oh I wonder how they'd got down there, I wonder whether they sort of"
No they got down
got down at their own steam I suppose
"Yeah they went down in convoy car and I think they, four or five cars went down there"
Oh yeah
"there were sixteen of them, sixteen of them all there"
Sixteen?
"Yeah sixteen of them, well the more of them you see the cheaper it is"
Yeah  she said that er they walked into Minehead on Sunday
So I would think that we're working on a five minute schedule .
"Don't forget that when they first did this, people would not have had personal watches."
And there may only have been one clock in the town where they worked and that would have been on the  town hall or the church.
Clocks are a very  recent er  introduction as far as ordinary er working conditions are concerned.
What might have they have had to measure the time as it passed?
Egg timer.
Sundial.
"Sundial, yes."
But that might not have been too convenient.
Egg timer.
Say it was night for instance.
Pardon?
One of them sand things.
One of them sand things.
Who knows what they're called?
Egg timer.
An egg timer is what we use them for now.
Do you know what the traditional name for them is?
Anybody know?
It's called an hourglass.
Have you heard that before?
No.
Sir.
You scratched your nose and you've got acid on them gloves.
Right.
I did didn't I?
Yeah.
But I  I should come out in great welts soon and start looking like an American werewolf in London.
"Right, my face will start falling off."
Quite right.
You must be careful not to unconsciously  touch anything with  even the gloves.
And you should wash the gloves  as soon as you've touched the acid.
Is it Brian?
"No, this one's driving a car."
He were looking at that bus.
He might be another one of them from the er   from the council.
"Yeah, well it's, they've done nowt but look at it for last three month."
I like his registration .
Well he parked car there
Mm.
"walked up there right to your house, eyed bus up  and then walked back again."
"Yeah because what they did they  they've done it a few a times though different people, look and see how far it is before it's a blind spot."
Your Bill nearly hit it other week he were telling me.
"I dunno but like er  say the d a driver's coming this way, he wants to see how far down the road it is before it's a blind spot again."
"And if they're from the council or whatever, or whoever does the roads or whatever  they'll probably get in contact with him again."
I should imagine they are from the council.
That weren't too bad that one.
Oh
That was only a oner.
It sounded better.
have a real good do.
Wouldn't mind if I could just bloody bring it up.
And it won't?
No it won't shift.
Mm.
Bloody come up one way or the other.
Oh I could fancy a nice  horse.
I like leg.
"I don't want corned beef, that's, that, I don't want that."
I like leg.
You like leg?
Yeah.
Mm.
"I'm just debating whether to run in that kitchen and put that kettle on again, what do you reckon?"
You can't have  all in cardboard boxes.
It's erm  not easy to organize.
You can't  and keep them open at the same time.
What is the most common problem you've experienced in your dealings with  Street?
It's phoning them up and the person I want to talk to isn't there!
I think.
"Have you had any, anybody else  phone them up or written to them?"
No?
No.
I think they're quite abrupt and rude whenever I've phoned them up.
Are they?
They're not terribly friendly.
"Oh they're usually okay I, I mean what they don't know  ."
I mean I just find it annoying cos you get through  to somebody who then passes you on to somebody else and then they'll talk to you and say well the person you want to talk to isn't here at the moment so you've had all this phone call and then you've got to ring again.
And you have to do it in office hours as well.
What has been your proudest moment this year?
Oh that was Rob.
When he was able er to enter the sub committee.
Oh yes.
"He was really proud of that and he, he made a point of that being"
I'll write that down.
for him  years of struggle  to get any influence to finally find himself
Oh good one.
What sort of committee is it then?
Hearing aid!
"Well I think one does speak a bit louder in public meetings, it's just ."
And I I can only do this work I'm sorry.
Sorry I didn't hear
Oh  I I didn't hear  either.
Turn that thing off.
I was asking what sub committee it was.
Er the environmental.
"So she said, Val said I thought  good for you mate, you didn't get pushed out  he's gone  they're all gone  till the new year innit?"
Well I wouldn't of wanted to go with them myself.
"Well not after that little escapade, nor would I."
"I wouldn't of thought so  I would of sa I would of said well if I bloody ju good enough for living with I bleeding come on a  I don't think she'd want him on holiday with her anyway  and her sister said is she hadn't got enough money, she'd pay for it."
That's right  that's what Val told me.
She don't have time for him.
What?
She hasn't got a lot of time for him now.
Who hasn't  her sister?
Her sister.
No  she just says he's a bloody big head!
Well he is isn't he?
Well yeah.
Ah I mustn't I must admit I don't think I know any worse than him.
But I think he's quite harmless really Geoff  I don't think he
Oh yeah.
"means any harm, that's his way."
Well that's yeah but I I must admit I find it quite tiring.
Well he's always been pleasant to me  you gotta
I can honestly say  he's the sort of bloke I would sort of try not to get lumbered with at a party or somewhere like that   I mean I don't mind I didn't mind talking to her  but I find her
Well I find her  boring.
Yeah.
I find her very boring  although she's a very kind person.
"Yeah, no I could talk to her more than I could talk to him."
"I'm surprised  you know, she isn't stuck for them children mo any more if he'd been"
Oh yeah.
like this  that's it.
Let's face it she erm  I mean she was the one who bloody married him!
Well she hates him!
Yeah.
She literally hates him!
Yeah.
Mhm.
"But erm  and if you listen to the tape long enough you can, I can pick up the tune,"
Mhm.
"as well, and just, and have the words."
And then as long as the pianist or the accordionist know the tune I'm alright
Can you take it off the
Mhm.
music as well though if you had to?
If somebody gave you a bit of sheet music?
No.
No I would have to learn the tune like by listening to the
Aha.
to the person singing.
Aha.
"That's the only way I would  learn a tune, I couldn't sight-read the"
Mhm.
the music off a sheet.
Right.
Do you have you ever had a go at the piano or that?
"No, though I would like to have been able to have played, I can remember saying to my mother once, I would like to have been able to have learnt the piano."
And er but of course they couldn't afford to buy me a piano to learn on so
Mhm.
that was it.
Any other instruments
Mhm.
you particularly like?
I that I like?
"Or would have, to listen to?"
"To listen to, to listen to, mhm."
"I like the guitar, I like to listen to the guitar, not the classical stuff, I'm sorry to say but, I like to listen to the guitar."
"Or er a clarinet, I like the sound of"
"Aha, aha"
I promise you a pound if you
and then they walk in the bin so I suggest you don't give me any hassle
"Oh I'll give you , I'll give you a pound don't worry, make sure you do the job properly, mm  you'd better do it outside, cos the er, the boot polish don't go on the carpet."
ah look at this mum  look I'm wiping for a pound

Cos it's hot
And the frying pan  not really I think the taste is distorted or something
"The taste gone wrong, erm, what you want?"
What shall I put?
"Which part, how do I write"
erm

What?
Oh  and how you
pocket

"Yeah you wanna get some headphones for that as well, then that makes all"
I've got some headphones.
Yeah well they're not made to work are they
They're at work
cos they
No I can't afford this.
"No you don't plug them in, just put the wire in your pocket  then they'll think they can just listen to music."
"Well then they won't talk to me  they won't take any notice anyway, if they do, I've got a letter I can tell them what I'm doing."
Go on  expla a letter will make a
Well drink up!
people if they say what the hell are you doing.

She's stirred him up.
properly!
If people say to you

While you've been away?

Are you on a diet?
No.

I'm ever so considerate.
"Did I tell you Steve's car conked out last week, again?"
The Capri?
Yeah.
Points.
No.
Points?
Yeah he had to put new points in.
"Last night he had to put new plugs in, they were brand new before he crashed it weren't they?"
It's probably cos
Could've been.
They refused point blank and he had to take it to another garage.
Did you send another bill?
Yeah.
"No i I phoned insurance up and told them what they'd said, cos I got Maggie to phone, it were Maggie that said, they told Maggie that they were gonna put a second hand wheel on and everything instead of a brand new one so she told insurance  about it ."
"They went mad, they told us that we'd got to take it to National Tyres, took it there, twenty three pound fifty it cost us."
"What's that for, tracking?"
"Tracking and balancing it, none of it were done."
"They had to do the lot so they give us an invoice, we took it in to insurance and they're gonna write a cheque, deduct it off that thing"
Mm.
and send us the cheque back.
Cos they should've done it.
Send you cheque back?
Yeah.
"So do you want the yoghurt, yoghurt before we go to the  ?"
"I don't think it matters, but  if the weather's still going to be freezing at night"
"And if so does, does"
I've got the
"the,it's outside all the time anyway ."
"I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still."
I got it standing on that brick  so it would drain.
I wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.
"Some of the  erm  stems on it look as if the  not mouldy but they're, they're sort of"
Well we'll just have to dig it up and put
green.
another one in.
Those hyacinths in the cauldron are taking a long time to come out aren't they?
I know.
"I would have thought the tulip  that went in the er coal scuttle  the tulips in the cauldron  I thought they'd had it, they were lying down completely."
I know.
They just straightened
They were
up.
just  grown up again.
"And those  forget-me-nots  that are called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers, they're coming out with erm  tiny  pinkey, purpley flowers."
I know.
"If they're blue, so am I!"
"And then we've got miniature roses gonna come up, one that's on it own, that one with the"
The wha
on the tub.
Is there one in the tub?
No.
Yes.
"Oh ye the one in the tub looks okay, it's the other one."
Mhm.
"I like the other best as well, it's the peach one."
Did you get your milk today?
"No, none at all."
Oh right.
"Ooh I rang the  club and sorted that out, done"
Mm.
that.
Yep.
So she said well don't  don't put them down again I'm  doing it by the computer.
Ah!
So I said well  do I get the things now?
So she said well no cos she said you're  you're in the re in arrears a bit.
"Ooh I said, oh have I?"
It ain't a lot!
So she said I'll do it on the computer and  and I'll let you know  so  we're eighty pound behind  well course we never sent one month at all!
Did you not?
No!
"So we got behind  So I said well we'll tr I'll try and get caught up  sort of, in the new year  you know, get them  a bit ."
Actually I think I'm gonna finish that catalogue anyway I'm just
Which one are we talking about?
Grattan.
Oh yeah.
And just have the other one cos they're such a peculiar funny firm they are!
Mm.
"So I explained to them, I said well that's cos you changed over  and I sort of never put it across through  oh she said well don't worry I've done it now, she said you haven't got anything to worry about now, I said well it did bother me a bit  to think that  I didn't think you had my payment!"
"Oh yes she said, we've had it  I thought well why send me letters,then!"
Well that's a standard letter I suppose and
"Well that's what she said, that's a standard letter."
"Yeah  the only trouble is, you know, standard letters don't always sort of"
Well you get some little old dear what runs the
That's right.
catalogue to
Yeah.
Yes.
activates the lights as it's approaching the crossing.
"Yes cos most,o most of that one barrier, it said on the news that they're o automatic."
That's right.
So
They have er special cameras which  they take the line of the trains both sides.
Mhm.
"And the barriers drop, so if you try and go through when the lights are flashing or if you try and go round the barriers  the chances are the train's getting nearer and nearer and could hit you."
So it's a very silly thing to do.
Yes.
Like if it's one metre away and there's a car going across.
Well if you were that close and the lights started you'd probably get across.
"But if you, like, you know what it's like when we come"
"If, if the barriers were down er and you were still on the railway  er th ah  there's only way you can escape."
Go round by the barrier pole.
"Well yes, but look at the crossings we've got in Driffield."
Yes.
The barriers
Er
.
they've got full barriers you see.
Full barriers.
Double are safe.
"Well, they're different because they have them  they're really controlled by a man in a signal box so they're"
Yes they are controlled.
controlled by a television.
Er
"If they're controlled  well dad, everyone knows that one th the Tackleby's controlled by a man."
Oh yes.
That was good wasn't it?
Yes.
"Yes, you enjoyed that trip into the signal box didn't you?"
No it's alright!
"But this, this bloke has sort of said, ooh he said, apparently one of the blokes  that were working for him said  that he had overheard him saying they were gonna burn the coach out."
Oh!
"And if this chap said, the one that took it that night, he said there is no point in him doing it because he didn't have the coaches insured for enough."
No.
No.
"He took this bloke in, he didn't have a job."
Isn't it mean?
Mm.
You know the er
It is.
"Cou po , could possibly"
Yeah.
going on the what not.
And did this chap do it?
They don't know who did it.
No.
"They tried to make Jim had done his own coach, the one that took us over"
Yeah.
there.
Yeah.
"But he le , they let him go off on holiday in the end."
It wa it was the night before they went on holiday.
How depressing Marg!
"I mean I can understand it in this day and age, people trying to"
Get their money back.
Yeah.
Get their money from insurance policies and try and make their money back
"I suppose what it really amounts to, it's probably someone who's in the same line of business  and they're trying to get the best way aren't they?"
Mm.
But it's a nasty business isn't it?
I know.
You put the word the carrier?
I just put carrier cos
"We , I understand what you're saying because yo , that's what it's used erm"
"I'm looking, I'm from sort of like"
in the conditions.
a legal point of view.
Yeah.
I understand what you mean.
"Danny's point is valid there because when you're reading a legal document, T, the T N T Express U K will hereafter be known as the carrier"
Carrier.
"he's put, so we wrote"
So really that's saying the title
"Yeah, the legal"
actually.
title it does say.
"But I was just gonna say, it's understandable"
Mm.
him thinking in terms and conditions of carriage.
Yeah.
"Yo , you wouldn't have just put the carrier normally would you?"
"That's what I'm saying, so  er, just er interpretation of the question slightly misleading there."
Right.
No worries.
What is a definition of a consignment?
"Now if you get these right, word for word  you'll be er, I do conditions of carriage quizzes on selling skills courses  and the amount of people that get this right I can count on one hand in the last three years."
Who got it right?
David.
Word for word?
What was the bit you did?
"Not word for word, now"
"What did he say, please?"
"He said, one or more items to one address."
"Oh alright then, two now you've pointed them out."
Let's have at me today.
"I'm doing quite well actually, mine are clearing up a bit."
"Yeah, but you see, I'd look at you and I wouldn't even notice!"
"One, two, three, four, only four!"
"It's like, I look at you"
Two.
and I would not even notice one spot!
Not even the one in the middle of my forehead?
No!
"I tell you what I noticed when you first walked in  you got  you got thick eyeliner on, that's what I noticed."
Yeah.
Before anything else.
"Thick eyeliner on the top of my eyes, I don't wear eyeliner on the bottom just in case you think I'm a tart!"
Oh dear!
Oh I'm sad!
I must be bad!
You're talking to a tape recorder now Em !
I know.
I've done it before!
"Oh gee, tomorrow right, mum has gone to me  the other day  oh, there's this woman at bridge she wants someone to baby-sit for her on Wednesday nights."
"Do want, do you wanna, you interested?"
"And I said, yeah alright then, you know, fair enough."
"So she goes  well she reckons it'll be a good idea if you went up to meet the little lad, he's only six, he's called Mark."
"I thought  oh alright, fair enough."
"She's goes, oh she's gonna phone Thursday night, she phoned me tonight  oh I'll pick you up at half four is that alright?"
"I thought, yeah, fair enough  she goes, we can go and pick him up from the child-minder  and then er  you can come for some tea  and you'll be home by about half seven!"
Oh fucking hell!
No way!
"I mean, cor blimey, I've never seen the woman or the kid before in my life!"
Mm.
"I mean, I don't mind going up to their house, sitting down having a cup of tea and biscuit"
I mean we don't need to  imply anything there.
There's no new recycling centre nearby  for plastics is there?
So who mentioned this
The what?
talk about  recycling  mention that.
I just remember it from the .
"Now Bejam have become Iceland they haven't done the  plastic bags collection have they like the, a lot of the ."
They haven't got a provision for plastic bags
Is that worth checking out?
I know a lot of the Iceland  do have a  recycling

"So who, who."
Are you doing the bottle bank ?
Yeah.
Measure  the works
re
"In, in, in, in the past"
words.
the resident engineer has been doing the measure and also agreeing the valuations.
Well I don't think
Now
what Hughie's saying is that that will be done
Th that responsibility
mutually
valuations because we've got this
Mm.
Perhaps you do.
"which, which"
Personally I don't think really there's a need for a great deal of site measurement.
"I think, I think it should all be, you know, basically it should be done from"
The offices.
because they've dug a big hole doesn't mean you measure the big hole.
It's all part of the measuring anyway.
You're paying for the hole they should have dug provided it was at least as big as they
In accordance with the  and the er the
what do you call it?
Yeah well.
The
Preamble.
preamble.
"Can I take it then, that these items will be clearly defined when the project coordinator discusses with the team quantity surveyor at the"
Who does what.
Yes.
Who does what because
Yes.
Have you rung up already?
Yeah.
Can't say owt if you
Tt.
What you tell them?
Slept in?
Told them I had migraine.

"I'm running out of fucking excuses now, I'm going to write book out."
You'll have to remember what you've used.
Your grandma's dead four times.
Poor old grandma .
I'm a rotten bastard aren't I?
No.
Everybody does it.
You're not on your own.
"I tell you summat  I'm getting fed up because every time I don't feel absolutely great, and I go over there and say will you stand in for me, I don't feel well, I don't want to."
"It was an arrangement we had I, I wouldn't phone in  cos you have to wait three weeks for your wages  if I phone in."
"So I says I wouldn't phone in, I'd let you know and you could do it and I'll pay you myself, I don't mind, you know, losing a day's pay."
I said I'll pay you mysen.
"So er  she says yeah fair enough then she won't have to wait three week, cos it's only me that's losing, not her."
Yeah.
Anyway she's been going out on and off for quite a while now.
So I thought well I don't have to wait three weeks for mine so  next time I don't feel great  I'm gonna call in and take a couple of days off.
According to them I have had four weeks off in ten years.
That's it.
That's all I've had off.
"No I'm lying, four weeks in nine years."
Why's she looking at excuses not to do it like?
Er apparently they phone her up or summat and ask her if she'll go and stand in for other people and she turned round and says if I can't have this school I'm not doing any.
That's what she's been doing.
So
Sarah Smith.
And  how long have you been homeless?
About six months.
Why are you homeless?
"Well I used to share a, share this flat with my mate and erm  you know, she got a bit out of hand, she kept bringing  all these people home and she kept having these parties and it was really difficult for me to study cos I used to go  well I still try to go to college, but erm  you know, it was really hard for me to study  and made my life really, really difficult!"
"Isn't it more difficult now though, if you're homeless?"
Ya.
How do you get time to study?
"Well, you know I, just doesn't really matter any more, the point is surviving."
"But I mean, when I was living with her we just had all these arguments cos, you know, I just never got any peace!"
"There are  sometimes I could find this quiet little  place somewhere and just think, you know, it's really nice."
"But, what about your family?"
Can't you go home?
"Well, I could do but I, you see, I haven't got the money to get home and  you know"

"So, what I'm saying is they're just th , they're, they're, it's just for er"
The biggest place near it.
the biggest place near it.
Now what
"I'm saying is, is you ought to get very close to that geographical map  because  it's the logistic  logistics er  difficulty with getting, and you ought to know where there are mountains and where there are valleys and the fact that that, in South Wales they can't just go across country, they have to go back down the valley after the M four and up again."
"Cos we're driving lorries, we're not driving little, you know  trial bikes that go over mountains like the Brecons and stuff, you have to"
But we do use the sheep in some ways don't we?
"That's right, that's right, we do use the sheep ."
But not for
No.
the sake of the .
"No, right."
What
"what I'm saying is, you know, you can't go from Stirling to Aberdeen  in a couple of minutes."
That's big country up there.
"And so there's a big mountain range running up the middle of the country, someone thought once was the English Channel."
Well that's okay cos we've got a tunnel now.
"Yeah, we got a tunnel now."
Yeah.
"The English Channel, not the Pennines."
But they're going where's the Pennines?
Erm what I'm saying is
I'd say I don't know where it is at all.
I am saying to you now folks become familiar with the erm  depots.
Now what about the depot numbers?
No idea.
No.
Forty nine.
Not at all.
Forty six.
Forty nine.
I'm gonna call them out.
Aha.
"she said, why can't you be a normal mother and just want chocolates or perfume?"
"I said, well that's not much good when you're hanging from the end of a  rope ."
And who do you go with?
I go with my husband.
Your husband?
Mhm.
"And whereabouts do you go, just"
"Oh  Glencoe, Skye, Aran, you know just"
Mhm.
up there.
"Do you, do you stay up there, do you have"
Mhm.
a caravan.
"No, a tent, or we've got an estate car if it's just a weekend jaunt, and it's maybe wet, we just sleep in the back of the car"
aha.
"So  complete change from this place anyway,"
"aha, and you meets up with so many wonderful people."
"Aha, aha."
It gives you something else to talk about.
"That's right, aha."
"Instead of just,going to Tescos for some groceries or"
"I mean I, I, I don't drink a lot, I mean maybe after I've been out in the hills you have got to drink something to replace the sweat, but I'm not a great drinker and I don't, I don't smoke and I, I don't like discos or anything like that"
Mhm.
so you've got to find something else to do.
"That's right, a healthy pursuit."
I used to play a lot of badminton and swimming but I've got bored out of my ears so it's something to keep fit.
Mhm.
"So I bought myself a bike, and I've been popping backwards and forwards to my like"
How about
Ah but as I say my daughter thinks I'm mad.
how about nicknames?
"But the problem is the lower level at that,i i i it's at the N C O level where complaints are made by soldiers and because the complaint has to be made through the regiment, then the the pressure is for the soldier to withdraw his complaint  ."
"Rea really brief so how widespread is it in the Army, bullying or intimidation?"
"How how can we tell, because as an officer, and this is this is Richard's point, as an officer how do you know what goes on in the barrack room?"
Nicky can I have a word ?
With wa Andrew I've got somebody else to speak to.
If I
Okay.
get a chance I'll come back to you.
Er where's James ?
James.
Now you're on the run from the Army at the moment?
Mm.
Er why did you run away?
"Er mental torture, I just couldn't handle it no more."
What were they doing to you?
Er I was handcuffed to a radiator in the nude and urinated on.
I was tied into a sleeping bag and hung upside down from a tree overnight.
Er
"Why did they pick on you do you think Andrew, er James ?"
My size.
Yeah.
And you know
Did you s did you te did you say for god's sake stop doing this to me?
"Did you try and stop them, did you try and make them see reason?"
"Th there was no point, the chain of command to make a complaint was blocked."
There was just no way.
Did you see this happening to other people?
Yeah.
What sort of things were they doing to other people?
"Erm two people back to back with their trousers round their ankles, newspaper shoved up their backside, lit in the middle, first one to move got a kicking."
And is this common?
Or were these just a few isolated sadists ?
No.
"The, the  yeah."
What have you told  only you haven't told Gwyllam  anything have you?
"Cos you, what you've told him is  did you talk about chapter eight?"
No.
No.
"I, I just said to him, when he said we've got these census point ahead I said well  we've got certain restrictions, you know, we've certain rules and regulations we've gotta comply with  I mean I didn't reel off any of this  blah."
"But I said oh, are you familiar with setting up roadside interviews and  for this type of thing?"
"Oh yes, we've got such and such a fella out there that does nothing but that out all day long."
And yet they didn't have any signs  so I think he's talking through his hat.
But what he probably means is that they set up signs for
Yeah.
"you know, roadworks and stuff."
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I mean I would have thought they've gotta comply with the same
Yeah.
the same sort of things.
"I think the thing is, actually, just thinking about it, there will be a Welsh version of this  if there is one if you see what I mean?"
Yeah.
"If there isn't one  then we, we er er it  er  oh mind you I suppose there's no hassle to them to put a Welsh thingy, anyway I'll look at that."
"Right, now the other thing is that what Jim's doing which is that programme, how is that coming along?"
Yeah.
What I did  was I got  I went down to the print room and I got a piece of A one paper and  I mean if you want to use  Chris
"Chris  over in Chester office, see if, that one would, oh mind you there isn't a chair there is there?"
Mind you is Jonathan away?
There's this chair here.
Jonathan's not here.
Is Jonathan away?
"Yes, two day a day and a half or something, two days?"
Right.
"So, you know, there's desks around anyway"
they starts running off!
"Well I crapped mesen me, I started running back towards road and they're going Sarah, Sarah come back."
"So I carried on walking and they start going through this bleeding wood, well they had me climbing over three fence things, all like them metal  you know like them metal fences at  wood?"
"Climbing over them, I nearly cut mesen in half."
park.
"Oh yeah we walked past park cos he asked me if I wanted to go on swings  and it led up to his back gate, well, you've never seen me put a sigh of relief on me face, I went"
Is it a longer or a shorter?
It's shorter but it's scarier.
Scarier?
They're on about putting a road round back of there.
Around back of the gardens.
"I tell you something if they put lights up down here I reckon it'd make it even more scary though you know, I don't know why."
Scary.
I hate that road.
Just think there could be dead bodies in
You know what it made me think of?
What?
"Parts of flipping Evil Dead, and they're going ooh there's a house"
Oh I couldn't walk through a wood on a night time.
No way.
We found a tramp in wood once.
Dead?
No.
He were under these covers and erm
Well you were then .
"we walked up we, we thought oh what's this?"
Lifted cover and there were this fella underneath.
"And erm we ran off, I were, we were about sixteen or seventeen  and er  we kept chucking bricks at him."
"He, he was going piss off, piss off."
So you know Dallas?
"He chucked this bit of glass, it cut him so we ran over here."
"And erm  I don't know who it was, he set fire to his quilt"
That's not a moo cow.
Get down.
It is.
It is.
It isn't.
Mooo.
That's it.
That's what moo cows do.
You're crackers.
It is.
It is a moo cow.
"I mean like er, Eileen was saying summat yesterday, she said, she said I don't er, have  at home, she said, I decided to  I said I'm frightened, and sometimes  knows I'm not frightened."
"I said, I'm frightened someone's in the 'ouse, I'm frightened not waking everybody  well, well what do you do, I says, you don't, unless you have a go, you don't, I mean, if I'd turned out  you know, you don't really know."
I know.
"I mean, that"
"You might, and then again, you might be a millionaire inside three months."
"Yes, I said to her, think about it, I I was that frightened, I frightened meself to death, and I I wouldn't I wouldn't."
I hated it.
That's what I used to do every time I thought about selling 'ouse
You just got to do it.
Yeah.
"I thought about it, and thought about it, and then then changed my mind."
But this time I decided it's what I want to do and bugger it.
"If we don't sell it, we we haven't lost anything."
Oh well.
sell it till we move.
I honestly think myself
As long as we're not worse off than what we were before we moved.
"I honestly think meself, that I might have a have a couple of hard months, maybe three, first three months might be a bit difficult for me."
"Oh, it probably will be."
"Well, I think, once he gets established, and once he starts getting work in, I think meself, that work will start, won't say rolling in, but I think the work'll start coming in after about three months and I can get established."
Oh we can always lend you a couple of ten pences.
"Two weeks' time, we've got a week off."
"I haven't even looked, cos I don't even, I haven't even thought about it, you know."
"Everyone else keeps going on about it, and all like, oh, I can't go home, cos there's not enough"
"Last year, reading week was, it seemed for ages, wasn't it?"
"It did, didn't it, yeah."
"It seemed weird, it was so,oh, it's nearly November, I'm getting worried."
That's alright.
It's nearly Christmas.
"Oh, that's alright."
"Half my year's gonna be gone, and I'm sort of, going for the third year, and it's really heavy."
Oh.
It's going so quick.
But erm  I'm sure you're right.
"Maybe I have done, maybe it's just not printing it."
"They normally have one a year, they probably just haven't edited up."
"We had two though, didn't we?"
"Didn't we have one la in the second year,or something, I'm sure we did."
We didn't Rebecca.
"Oh, didn't we  oh, that's what it is, then, you get yours in February."
That's what I'm saying to you.
"Ah, bit silly though, innit, starting"
I'm sure we had another reading week.
"Oh, shit, you're just like me, you are."
"I swear blue in the face that I'm right, and then somebody comes on and goes  oh yeah."
"Well, put it this way, if it isn't on Sunday,"
"it's a bit of a long time, because I come back January the fourteenth, fourteenth, and I've had all Christmas off, haven't I?"
"So I'm gonna be back, like a week, you think they'd make it a bit more  so I've done most of"
"No, I know what I'm thinking of, I'm, if ever, I'm thinking of revision week, cos that was a week, we  wasn't it?"
Yeah.
And then we had another revision week in June.
"See , there's two revision weeks, and a reading week."
"Yeah, and"
"Thanks to Ann Mobbs and to Theresa Smith, to Brenda Thornton and to Barbara Bryan."
"That's it from me, Bill Heine."
Thanks for joining us.
Goodbye.
Kelly.
You are once again doing it completely and utterly wrong.
at the wrong place again.
Kelly you have been using
"Kelly, you've done it again."
"Can you walk the right way, no, now do it right Kelly."
Let's see you actually do something for a change..
How do you do this one down here?
You should have.
What else have you been doing wrong Kelly?
. You've been using a brush instead of a spatula for spreading glue.
The spatula .
Right.
Now  I hope that  only Kelly has been doing things as desperately wrong  as Kelly has been doing them.
Looking around at all the  there are a whole lot of people who have left the same even border all the way round instead of having an even border top and sides and leaving a bigger border at the bottom.
Which you'll remember you were told to do so that there's a space For your name.
Sarah stand up and come over here.
"Sam, will you stop doing that please my love and come across here so that you two don't ."
I'm using a white colour pencil here  in order to  draw a line from  to the work that is being mounted on here.
And you might say that the word has not been mounted on there.
No it hasn't because we .
Can you see what I'm doing without me having to ?
Or are you baffled by what you see?
?
Mm?
No.
"it's a demonstration and the, the line itself  is like framed within a frame."
I know what's coming.
You you know what's coming.
George Miller called this the span of conception.
The capacity of the brain to conceive or hold on to any information.
You'll see there we've got three boxed a six number a ten number and a twelve number.
What I'm gonna do is just speak out a six digit number.
What I want you to do is try and hold on to it in your brain then when I've finished write it down in the appropriate box and see if you can hold on to it long enough to do that.
"So the first number, listen to this the first number and try and hold on to it."
Three eight one five six two.
Just write that down.
. Okay?
Let's try and ten digit number then.
Listen to ten digits try to hold on to them and then write them down.
"Seven, four, two, nine, eight, one, three, four, seven, six."
I've gone wrong
"Okay, try a twelve digit, just for the experiment."
"Try and hold on to twelve numbers, here we go."
Listen to these.
"Nine, O, five, one, six, two, four, seven, three, eight, two, seven."
". Now that's it's interesting what Joanne said that you you lost it in the middle somewhere, yeah?"
I mean er let's just read them just see how you got on.
"Three, eight, one, five, six, two."
"Okay, Seven, four, two, nine, eight, one, three, four, seven, six."
I've got the  mixed up
"Yeah and nine, O, five, one, six, two, four, seven, three, eight, two, seven"
say that one again
"nine, O, five,one, six, two, four, seven, three , eight, two, seven."
Nearly got it .
So but I mean where was it.
Was it generally in the middle or at one end or
"The first, the first two numbers"
yeah okay
And the they'll turn a week about.
"But the the there's not the call in this er place for, for women in the weaving department."
Mhm.
"But our department hasn't changed, the women are just doing the same job as they did sixty"
Mhm.
years ago.
And probably in the picking as well.
In the winding it's just  their lot hasn't changed a great deal.
"Mhm, mhm."
Except I would say the winders are  worse off cos they're doing three shifts .
"Right, mhm."
And I just couldn't hack that I don't think.
Aha.
Mm.
"So, erm have you got, do you have a lot of friends through work do you find, I mean do you sort of organize things after work, do you ever go for a drink ?"
"Well a lot, a lot of people er er do er ju just about three weeks ago two women from our department retired so we had er we had a night out up in , that's where they live, so there is that kind of thing,"
Aha.
"or if on the few occasions that someone gets married, they hold a night."
", aha."
Er and some of the girls do like make-up parties and things like that.
Some
Mhm.
of them go to the weight training at .
Mhm.
"But as I say I don't do that kind of thing, I, I prefer to go away to the hills,"
"Aha, are you a keen climber?"
"and, and do my thing."
Mhm.
My daughter thinks I'm mad.
"When it came to my fortieth birthday she said, what would you like for your birthday?"
"I said, I'd like a really good pair of trainers."
"And I'm no good at tying laces so she got me a pair of Adidas you know with the velcro,"
no.
But she
Ov over a month ago.
"When they came on Sunday, when it were your anniversary, she'd got diarrhoea and sickness, Margaret."
I think she were off work last week.
Yeah.
"I I mean, you're anything like that, but not not for a month, I mean."
I got two toilet papers on .
Oh yeah.
"Well, put one in your pocket then,"
I  Margaret  last night.
"Oh I I bet  if you look at it,"
I don't Pete's been to me mum's for about six months.
Because I can't remembering him going.
He never goes without Margaret.
"She always goes herself, she were down there last night, by herself."
He were at pub.
Mm.
"Well, I said to her, told her about not having nowt to eat from that Wednesday morning, er Wednesday dinner time, till Thursday when they went"
Well she took away fish last night for her supper.
Oh.
"And that she she looked shocked, you know, she didn't didn't know me like, and er, well she was shocked, and then I said I said, right  well we'll have to get together and sort something out about stopping with her, and Pete said straight away."
"Margaret's there every day, she goes out every morning."
Right.
Not that he actually asked her.
years ago about Beryl.
I told you that's what he said.
"And I said, aye up, I don't mean in day-time."
"I says on a night-time, I said, you know, she can't leave her home now, I said, she can't manage to put coal on fire, and she can't manage to get up up to eat and drink and that, I said, I don't mind dropping off and taking me turn on the night-time but I mean, but it's hard, it's hard with me with kids every night."
It's  for you with kids.
"But I don't, certainly don't mind taking her down once a week or twice a week and taking me turn."
"Karen there's no need, no need, you're needed at bloody home."
Betty.
Mm.
Unfortunately there seems to be a resurgence of  of this now doesn't there  in Europe?
Yes.
This right wing element which is
Terrible!
"It's frightening really because you think well  you know, I mean  you said the years well that couldn't happen"
Well
again but  but how long does it take before it does happen again?
"I mean, do the other  do these things happen in cycles and tha you know, is it possible that it'll happen again on a greater scale?"
A grand
Well
"scale, if you like?"
"it er  I mean, it's  having grounds now because of the recession!"
Yes.
"That is, that"
Yes.
is what brought it about er in
Setting the stage for
"in one way, in in"
"Although it hasn't  it hasn't come to that in Germany, I mean we'll probably be the poor man of Europe at the moment aren't we?"
In this country?
"Ah but, I mean it's biting in Germany now because they've got all East Germans!"
"That's  yes, yes, that's true."
Biting before that weren't it?
Where
Erm
"they've had to close down the spi ,and that."
"and of course, when, when they  when"
This of course is exacerbated.
but  the going gets tough it's  it's easy to blame minority groups and this is what happened before wasn't it?
"Like on the ruddy  that's all they're doing now, bringing all these Turks and God knows what!"
"But then again, if, even Kay over there with  she said something about er, oh we've been out, but, I told you I went to a  last Monday."
Yeah.
"and she said something about, oh we've been to that new pub, she said, mind, she said, we had to come home at half past nine, she said, he'd had enough, she said, he were ready for bed, God, she said he's turning into a right old man, and you know what I mean, she didn't, she wouldn't,"
Exactly.
"She didn't realise what she was saying as such, but I thought, and I thought, yeah I know."
"Yeah, well he is, what ten years."
Thirteen you got from 'er.
Thirteen years difference.
"She's, how old am I, twenty-two, so she's twenty-nine."
Same age as our Kim
Yeah.
"Oh she'll be coming at thirty this year, won't she?"
"You see, she's just coming into her prime, and now he's he's just leaving it."
yeah.
He's really forty-three this year.
Don't work.
"He'll be forty-three this year, and she'll be thirty this year."
"The only thing, time that happens is, that is you hear about,"
Look George
"if yo if one's fifty over sixty,"
He's plucking his feathers out.
then it works.
"But when your younger it, or even when you're young, you know, it does."
But when you get into your forties
"Well, it's like, I mean like,"
It works.
I'm  me and Colin are settling down a lot compared to what we were five year ago.
"I mean, like, like now, we were a, say even two and three years ago and  somebody'd said to me, are you going to Spain, and I would have said, yeah, we'll go to Majorca, lovely, we could stop out all night, do what you want."
"Now only three or four years later I'd say of yeah we're go to somewhere a bit quieter, so that kids can go to bed of a night time, we could have a  apartment."
"Yeah, that's right, yeah."
Yeah.
"And that, I'm changing that way, but, if our kids have to be home with the, a group, when I went to see Squeeze."
That's right.
I think you did send this is  intending it to be a postal application  Mr ?
"I did, yes."
"But er, your worships  to do it by your colleagues until today  because er  Mr   indicate on the  application form  that er  he will not be  in fact, operating the bar himself but it would be somebody else."
"In fact they, your colleagues wanted more information about"
Yeah that's a
Who will be operating bar Mr ?
Well  I'm I'm on er Mr Martin .
Actually I did  operations between the village hall and the Crosskeys and Mr Martin  is on the  pub for the last sixteen years you see.
Well that concerns this this gentleman to extend the licensing.
"Oh yes sir, definitely."
I'll I'll be going to the village hall  but I me I have to
"The Crosskeys that's why I put Martin , perhaps I've put the wrong thing on you see."
I'll be in charge of the bar actually.
So physically you will be exercising something degree of supervision in the
"Oh that, yes!"
Will you be there when it's time to close Mr ?
"I will, yes."
You see there   in particular to young people.
You are aware of that?
"Oh yes, that, that's why !"
Then this application be granted.
"Right, thank you very much."
Thank you.
Er
"Thank you, thank you very much."
"Application number fifty four your worships, the  a temporary authority in respect of Quick Save Supermarket."

Are you representing ?
Right.
Could you take the oath please?
Yeah.
"Oh yeah fifty, sixty pounds."
And how long would it last them?
About the same time as us?
Yeah.
I suppose you have to be able to afford all that if you can afford the car in the first place.
Right.
Yeah if you have to moan about that you shouldn't be driving it in the first place.
"Motto, what?"
"Motto of the story is er  er don't, don't buy expensive cars if you're gonna want to run the thing though."
You've spent all your money on this car.
All of a sudden you realize
"Well like that new advert for the Rover he says don't, I keep thinking my back  my back tailgate's  flapping or  I keep hearing, you keep hearing creaking don't you?"
"A creak here and you think what's that, what's this, what's that?"
"So that new Rover has been built so everything fits perfectly, right?"
So nothing rattles.
What do you mean nothing?
No toleran er the tolerance is you know minimal.
Whereas the tolerance here'd be  I dunno eighth of an inch here eighth of an inch there he says  the advert says as soon as you have tolerances like that then thing work loose and start rattling and creaking and
E E.
you can hear it go E E er E.
Yeah.
"you imagine cruising in a car, lovely car like that  and it makes no noise."
"Just cruising away and it just like glides, and you glide you know  like, like Papa's Citroen type  that kind of suspension."
Yeah.
Is this a new Rover?
Crikey what was that?
A Rover.
Was it that Rover?
Yeah.
"Was this a new, is this a new Rover ?"
Carving everybody up.

Yeah he's
That's surprising he don't have such a bad head!
No he said er
Ah  Cor!
Well fancy being a like that all that time  it's bad enough when you've been out on a binge and you get that headache then.
"Chris  Ivan said to me, he said  Cliff wanted us to go and have a drink he said when we've finished work on a Friday  he said last night, I tell you, I said   I said no, no I didn't!"
Well how are you all gonna get home?
"Oh yeah he don't mean that he had a lot of drink, just have a drink and come home."
I said well I hope you enjoy .
"Well it isn't worth it, you can't afford to drink and drive can you?"
I know.
"Mel's got her lights up, did you see them?"
Yeah well   yeah.
"Mm  yeah talking about that now he's out the way  basically what he was gonna say was, as simple as this"
.
well it don't matter does it?
Oh alright then.
Yeah  no he was just saying that head office  they'll dictate to them like anybody else  so he said  I've got to have  erm  the mortgage up to date for a start before I can consider anything.
"I thought you'd done that, you was gonna do that?"
"Yeah but I haven't  that's what he saying, but he said what I wouldn't do is ju , don't just say right phrum  there's"
What do you mean?
"there's a thousand pound he said, you know, if you can make it right  sort of over the next month  but he said basically I cannot do anything until  erm  the end of February, he said you come in the end of February he said and then we can start to sort it out, he said I can't do anything for you until then."
Did you tell him that?
Who?
Malcolm.
So  he's seventy eight now  she's probably about the same I think.
Mm.
But they had a Mini before the Metro and er  the day they bought the Mini they saw an advert in the paper saying that if you buy a Mini in the next few days
give you a free colour portable with it.
Oh.
"Of course they didn't get the portable with this, they rang them up, said where's my colour portable    said I'll put you on to the manager  anyway  they had some deal that night that erm to launch this Mini Mayfair or whatever it was  wine and cheese thing  so he went to the wine and cheese thing  and  worried he was gonna kick up a fuss  so they gave him a telly anyway ."
yeah.
"He's a penny pinching old bugger he is, god!"
I can't quite imagine
No.
coming back in a minute.
Yeah   What about ?
"The dust wagon came up to the warehouse today, the usual   they'd got halfway to emptying the first dustbin in the back"
Oh yeah.
and the hydraulic hose on the back of the dustcart broke  there was hydraulic fluid all over the
all over the car park.
So the driver said can I use your phone?
He came in  and trampling this brake fluid all over the carpet.
He got through to the  base camp to find out when the  chap was coming to fix it.
"Five minutes later he came in trying to tell  tell us jokes and each time he'd been paddling through this brake fluid and the carpet is just  you know, brains"
Mm.
Hand picked for the job I should think.
Well we didn't notice the footprints until he'd left.
Mm.
Yeah  of course once they get to know where you are
This is it
and you don't o do you open weekends?
You don't open Saturdays now?
"We don't, no."
No.
Are you going to?
No we don't.
I noticed they had some Philippine mahogany doors in  Do It All
Mm.
"on Saturday and yet, that you have to be careful because  they they have that I've forgotten what her name was on on Wogan saying next time you go into a D I Y store and you see a mahogany toilet seat  you know don't boy buy it think of the forest."
Well if you go into a D I Y store you'll find it's a mahogany stain  I don't know if they really make mahogany .
It would be very expensive
Yes you'd probably gauge by the price I would think.
Yeah.
Plastic
plastic.
plastic one.
Erm  oh
Yes actually  this cycle thing .
Cycle parking is actually  I wish they'd actually pay a bit more places to actually put your bike and you didn't have to sort of tie it up to some lamppost or something
"Yeah, yeah."
There's hardly anything
I mean they could give you a decent stand to put it in cos I hate those ones at Sainsbury's.
"Cos if you've got anything heavy in the bag, the bike falls over."
The ones at the library  as well.
Er and they ought to have a little shelter over it to stop your saddle getting wet  if it rains .
"I've got, I mean I've got my spots where I park it, I, it at Woolworth's and outside the post office  because it keeps it dry."
And out of the way.
All the roads into town are just awful.
"I mean the Dunmow Road, Hockerill"
Oh yeah.
You know  really scary.
You know you get asphyxiated with petrol fumes and then you get the danger of being  thrown off your bike.
cycling
Yeah  they squeeze you off the road if you go up that hill to Hockerill lights.
I
You must to  cat.
Just walk  slowly in the middle of the road.
So that there's no way they can take overtake on the right or on the left.
"Many would say that as George the Sixth, he succeeded where Edward had failed."
George had discipline.
"A sense of duty, a loyal wife and children."
"Affection bringing with it devoted support, brought success from a role undertaken reluctantly."
Edward said he could not fulfil the role without the support of the woman he loved.
Some family black sheep are making a bid for affection.
"Edward had the attention of the whole world, but without adequate personal affection, it was of no avail."
"On December the eighth, nineteen thirty-six, time of the ab abdication, the Times published a singularly apt quotation from  A Hopeless, Throneless King, Loathsome to Men Below To God's Above a Sad Example of the Slights of Life."
What is your view of the way Edward was treated after his  abdication.
"And none of us admits to being alive when all this happened, we, that goes without saying."
Absolutely.
I did see him as a six year old child.
"So  yes, as a"
"Visited our town, our  town."
He was a six year old child.
"Erm, I was a six year"
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah."
So wh wh what do you think of the the attitude that was displayed towards him after the abdication?
"He was very, very, generously treated."
Far too generously.
"I mean, he he could  five hundred thousand pound on a Christmas present to his bride."
My God.
Mm.
"He was more or less paid to go away and keep his head down, wasn't he."
Yeah.
No matter what the cost.
Most of the cr
"Now it's all over,attitude, push it all away."
Yeah.
"All the here , a lot of the hereditary jewellery never, never got found."
No.
No.
"your letters look nice and neat, mine are always scraggy, I can never understand them."
"Dear Helena, I don't really  rea really know how to put this but I've had  I'll have a go."
I'm sorry about being in a mood on Saturday but I wasn't really in a mood with you.
I'll now tol t no  I know I told you that I was  that I was feeling
"That, that's"
sorry for someone not Emma or
he's done a sentence wrong there.
one like that .
Yeah.
I care for Emma more than I can say but I also care for you and I'm really sorry if you were hurt.
At the moment everyone has been talking about other people behind people's backs.
I didn't tell you what Emma thought because I  don't   is that a blank page?
Yeah.
I don't think a person told  I don't think a person told to  apologize isn't rea really an apology so I think there must be a reason why you didn't and so told me on Sunday why you didn't .
What a load of waffle.
"Oh I know, he just waffles."
I was going to apologize for being  stupid on Sunday when you both disappeared.
"Me and Andy looked all over, looked for both of you."
Last night I had a few things on my mind to be able to  apologize.
I'm sorry and hope we can still be friends .
I read it and I just went  what! for a start and then
"I went, and then I went  well he can't have looked around for us too well because we were walking by the side of the road."
But  yeah he probably come past  no he probably went up there as we come down that corner  by erm Ipsleigh and when they come back we'd probably gotten here by then.
"But we, I mean we were walking by the side of the road all the way up Greenlands Drive."
"What did I say, Scott then had the cheek to something me?"
"Wish me, that was it wasn't it?"
Scott's not your best friend at the moment then?
"Oh you may not have, you may have gathered that like anyway."
Erm enough  enough  of slagging   slagging  the little shit I think
The little shit .
shit stirrer.
"No, yes, shit ?"
"It's a way of life, they've lived together that long, like, they don't want to"
"If when you and Pete had that trouble, if our Margaret had er been working, I honestly think she would have left Pete."
I know.
"But the only thing that our Margaret could come up with, was why should I, why should I leave me home and sell up, she said, when all my life, he's had money from the house."
"He'll have the money from the house, plus a wage every week."
"She said, and what will I have, she said, just the money from the house."
"She said, and where do I live."
"You know, he can move back home with his mum, she said, I suppose I can go back home to me mum, well then I've got to look for a job, you know."
Mm.
And I honestly think that was the only reason that she stopped for Pete.
Yes.
"Because, she's she, he he were gonna get a wage every week."
Yeah.
"You know, and she worked all them years, and then when she weren't working, she have no money coming in every week."
"Yeah, but she's got all the shares."
"She hasn't, she got rid of them all."
"Aye, not with Bl not with"
"Yeah, but you could see, you could see, that, I mean Pete were getting about hundred and twenty pound a week."
Yeah.
"We'll he had his money he won't have to touch, he could live on that hundred and twenty pound a week."
"Oh, aye,"
And he could start again.
Find another woman and buy another house and start again.
Mm.
"I mean like Jeremy and Kay, I mean, they're not happy."
"They pretend they are, but I mean like, he's he's"
"They've got to do, aren't they, I mean, after all bloody  harm they caused."
"Yeah, you know, you know how flaming miserable and mardy he is."
Yeah.
He's another one.
"But you see when he living with Ange, maybe he were younger then, but I mean like, when he were living with Ange, he had all the women as you know, plus he had Kay, plus he had, you know, Ange, he had everything, there was Kay,as well, weren't he, now he can't."
No.
And I should imagine that the  light paper's the backing paper and that I've already glued my work on the   paper and my  my picture is already glued just there.
Can I have my sellotape back?
And I'm now drawing
Sorry.
a white line about half a centimetre from the edge of the  work being put on.
Right this is a  decorative line round the sides of .
Does that make sense?
Just a white line.
Now you can make that look even smarter by making a second white line on the outside.
And then moving the erm ruler slightly away from the border  for the second line  over the top of it which makes it thicker.
So you've got a thin white line on the inside and a thicker white line on the outside.
That's point one.
"Point two is this, that I made the bottom border there  er  about  be exactly five centimetres."
And I'm going to  put a guide line which is one erm er half  a centimetre from the side there .
"Yes Christine, can I help you?"
I've put two very  faint white lines there in white.
"You could use ordinary pencil, are you alright Bruce?"
Have you lost something?
Aye I was just
You then write your name in block capitals.
What's your name?
Jane?
J A Y N
?
Yeah.
"So imagine you were writing Jayne here  J  now it's a very long name, Jayne  and you have to put the title on there too, so I couldn't put it all in capital letters on this occasion could I?"
"Probably that was a little bit on the, the large side anyway so  I would use lower case as well on this one, a bit like, a bit like junior school writing."
Do you know what I mean?
Then it'll fit on very easily.
You have to use your common sense.
"But you can see how a white pencil on that paper, that's going to look quite smart."
"Without, without the picture."
Yeah.
"I said do you, do you think there'd be any discount  er with it being a block booking?"
"And she didn't say no full stop, she said oh she said I'm not sure she said, I'd have to enquire about that."
"So  I just thought she's gonna  yeah if it was out of the question she could have said oh no that's it, there's a flat rate so I"
Yeah.
think she's gonna ask
thing is with them Welshies they probably haven't tried to bloody  they haven't got the sense.
No.
"If somebody else was trying to book it, one of those Welshy types, they haven't got the sense to  ask"
"No, I said well I said that  I'd appreciate it cos it's worth a go and she said oh yes I agree with you there."
Which field's Min in?
Not any of these.
So that was good.
Ooh  I can't stop yawning.
"So then I thought oh I'll go and find  er the  offices again, Church Street."
"And we'd gone a roundabout way the last time we were there and I thought oh I'll give it a go, anyway I walked straight down this road, have a look oh yes, turn up here  anyway I, I sort of got me bearings and I thought oh yes it's just down here  he's in the field just down there."
Is he?
Do you wanna go or not or go straight to your nan's?
"Go straight to nan's, call on the way back."
If it isn't too late.
Couldn't see him.
"Erm  so I went straight to this place and there was a fella downstairs, his secretary was  erm out on her lunch."
"Anyway I said oh  I said you're not expecting me, said who I was and where I was from."
"I said I called in to see either Michael or the secretary, Mirelda her name is."
Mm.
And er so he said alright.
"I said I'm also gonna be che cheeky and see if I can use your toi he said oh yes he said, go and help yourself he said there's a kettle down there, make yourself a drink, make yourself at home."
So anyway I thought I won't have a drink cos if  this secretary wasn't there I didn't know how long she'd be  so er but I di I went upstairs to where we had the meeting with Mike the other week.
And erm  Joe his partner was there so I had a really good chat to him.
What do you mean his partner like?
Is it just like a little firm?
And this Michael's one of the partners in the firm?
And did you
"So erm  I was feeling a bit edgy about this when we were in the pub after the concert cos I thought maybe he's  reading things into it and I, you know, I was just going along for the music."
"So I thought, oh maybe I'm  reading too much into it."
"So I met him on Wednesday evening  Tottenham Court Road tube station  and er  chat, chat, chat."
"He, he talked so much we missed our stop."
In a very loud voice!
Did you?
Yes.
"Erm, and he kept touching me as well which really annoyed me!"
Oh oh!
"Well, I'm a bit of toucher myself and I, I don't mind if it's friends or family or someone I'm keen on"
Oh yeah.
"that doesn't bother me, but considering it was only the second I'd spoken to him  and I did not fancy him in the least  erm, it really made my skin crawl."
"And erm  first couple of times I kind of didn't respond, and the next few times I was literally flinching"
Mm mm.
"and moving away, like, hint, hint."
"But he liked gripped me on the arm and then  his hand would appear from nowhere during the concert, he like kind of rubbed my arm and are you alright?"
. Oh it was just a nightmare!
"I, I know I'm a real bitch saying all this."
"But, you know  I think it, I thought it was his  dingy grey suit to begin with that smelt of moth balls but it, it was his breath."
"It was, I don't know how it smelt"
of moth balls.
"And he kept guffaw and going,"
and get this awful blast of moth balls !
Really?
"It was, it was a complete nightmare !"
Oh.
"And I, I wasn't prepared"
I wasn't prepared for   for it at all
Go on.
"because afterwards I, he had his arm round me when we were leaving  and said oh well, I've really enjoyed this evening, we'll do it again won't we?"
"And I pulled away and I said, well erm  I so enjoyed the Mozart I've always wanted to hear it."
Oh!
in in a will or something
Yeah.
so they have the house and move into house
Then they pay a lot
but they're gonna taxed so heavily that they can't afford to live in it  under this new tax!
They've just gotta sell it!
I thought well  how  what a bloody shame!
Terrible isn't it?
"Mm  I mean er why don't they do it on like the square, how big your house is because that way you could  I know it's not far when  people who live in a great big old house  don't have to pay as much cos if this  I mean Uncle Trevor and Aunty  they've got a massive great house  haven't they?"
Have yeah.
But if this  because it's old or something they don't have to pay so much   the
the
rates
"The rates, yeah."
you know?
Yeah.
"But if you only went on the square foot it don't matter how big it was  well that's like, surely that'd be fairer?"
That's right  it wasn't
"Yeah but ah then again why I mean like a lot of people have  don't have actual  they haven't got money  but they they sort of choose to have money tied up in property ,though it don't mean to say you're wealthy just because you've got a big house does it?"
If
No.
"you've got no money  we haven't got any money  but, you know"
Doo doo doo doo
I mean why should I I
Why should you be condemned just because you've put your money into your house?
"Yeah that's right, I mean some people don't"
Alright fair enough they want you to buy your own property but now .
Yeah.
Oh!
And if you go a spend if you in if you've got a big house and you tend to spend thirty thousand pound on a new car you don't get taxed on that
Phone!
Oh I seem to remember something like that.
"Erm and the car just broke up in half and that was, that had been  er  welded but like the police are saying as  well as soon as they sort of get wise to what they're doing and they find a way to  er you know, get on to them, they devised something else."
"And the people doing it in these garages erm, you know like respraying and  doing all the welding and everything, really he said some of the things they were doing  if they did it legally they'd make a  good go of it"
Mm.
they were that good at what they were doing.
"Tell me was I dreaming  or did I see a sketch on T V where there's a car driving round, down the road being chased by the police  and the driver said to the passenger er here take this  and he says what's that for and he says it's to steer the car, presses a button  and the car splits"
It's an advert for Malcolm.
the car s the car split in two.

A yellow car.
It's an advert for that film called Malcolm
Is that what it was?

Yeah.
retarded lad that invented all these strange  and he did bank robberies with a remote control car.
"It was an advert, it wasn't"
But I did see it on the T V?
Oh you did.
Oh that's fine.
Straight after er  the advert for Del-boy when he says and you know what you can do with that.
Even talking about  trailers now.

Yeah.
Woodrow Wilson

But I know that  such a talented writer.
"You know, I mean, I was convinced that there was no such thing as religion after I'd read the book  I mean, anything I read about, I immediately say, oh yes, of course that's true, you know."
So.
"Well, next week, will be telling us about another one of these very controversial books, won't you?"
Yes.
"In which we shall be looking at, er another famous figure, but, but, er an even more remote and one, some people might say,mytho mythological one, namely Moses."
"So having done Woodrow Wilson this week, we will do Moses, next week."
We'll look forward to that.
"Is anybody Jewish, by the way?"
Right.
"Well, one year, I must admit, somebody in the class stormed out."
"The person started to read their paper on Moses, and I thought she was doing a good job of it, this guy suddenly got up and said, I'm Jewish, I'm not listening to any more of this, and stormed out."
"Oh, I don't see that."
"Erm, what is the most,"
Right.
"Er, that is in,that is in er, Hampstead,."
If you wanna get there
I'm just
"the easiest way to do it, is to take the underground to Finchley Road Station"
Finchley Road Station.
Mhm.
"And when you come out of Finchley Road Station, it's in a place called ."
"I may be able to give you a thing about it actually, if I've still got one."
"You can visit it, it's open  it's best to phone up and find out when they're open, because they're not open every day."
And they  interesting?
"Well, there's  I mean it's interesting, erm, it's Freud's you know, collection of, of classical and antique ."
"They, they give the impression that the house is the way it was when he lived there, but it's not quite true, actually, it was earlier on."

"We know what the Conservative party thought of Michael Heseltine this week, they cheered him to the echo when he strode on to the platform at Blackpool."
But what does Michael Heseltine think of the party?
And of the direction it has now taken.
"In today's programme he gives us an exclusive interview, the first since his heart attack four months ago."
And then you'll need a P S V
Well

"but, but that's, that's  that's easily remedied if you could get a er  a driving licence holder  to take them  oh a volunteer driving licence holder among one of the parents  or somebody who could take the children, er, periodically in the bus to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing."
So that was a possibility.
But I haven't seen Miss  about all these sort of things.
"But I did also say  to Mrs , that a new head would be appointed to take the imports from the first of September, that it might be better to discuss it with them  after I've discussed with Miss ."

"I think, I, I would query that anyway, that just"
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition
No.
and just drive
Oh aye
eighty five points.
"We've done er eighty, eighty something points I think, we've done the fucking"
"I know but er that's what I mean, we get all the, a lot of them, about four of them topics worth, we're being given the equivalent of one of the topics you may be do next year you know."

"Next year, year's topic will be nuclear, nuclear physics, it's fucking massive,it's about a hundred topics"
"Seriously next year boy you're gonna get one major  awakening, you think this year's bad for physics, wait to you start next year."

"And then it twists, and like a small office, and when when I were there, after Michael had shown it me and Colin, he says oh, he says, er I'm come in here to get get out of way, and you know, he was like telling me, I thought I don't want to be a fiddle, because it's alright telling Colin, the boys"
"telling yeah,"
Yeah.
"ain't it, yeah, it's not like a woman telling you problems."
Don't knock my dusters off.
"Anyway, I just said, well, summat about  about what I said, I says, yeah,nice to get away from it all, ain't it, to be by yourself, and that's all I said, and I think he knew that I I didn't want to"
"but, and he said to Colin"
Eh
But certainly the main co-ordinators er
"Almost like the burglar alarm  you just have scheme, head co-ordinators, you know deputy co-ordinator, number of 'ouses and that just a basic so you go in"
We we don't want really is street co-ordinators because
No
that'd be a mammoth task
If you have somebody like  somewhere like that
"I'm not talking about that, I'm now talking about Tollerton but it's eight hundred properties, it's a small village but there are twenty seven street co-ordinators, so you know"
Erm yeah so say all you need is just access to that field so if they do change you can just
At the moment you do I take it you're recording people who sort of ring up say I'm interested you send out a package to them you record them
Yes
"I would think about giving up that, send the package out and forget about them"
"Well, this is something I've just done myself"
Yeah
"but I mean you send the package out and you get a phone call er it's Mr Davies, and then you get card out and then you send him the questionnaire it's merely a record duplicated on the form but"
"it's, I can't see any other way to do it at the moment, I mean probably when I"
Yeah
"think about it, but"
I mean you don't start a file at that stage do you?
No just a card in er a pending tray and that's it
"So you know who they are, yeah"
Er a sheet of paper for Tracy to get the initial erm  out and then they just go through the system
And you also get sometimes two people off the same street
Well that's it
It's just a reference they want you  Mr Smith two doors away
Well I've had one for Basingfield or Basingfield
"Oh I spoke to her, yeah"
"yeah, I've had three applications all for the it's only a small village albeit it's spread"
and that's a
You know for the er village
"Well have you spoken to Sergeant  to alleviate all the paperwork, and"
yeah yeah
"and just, I hid under my sleeping bag, er, then, I thought er the mon what would happen to the monster and so he might of stayed there on, you know, all, all night"
John
"Well he did say that the monster was rather large, he looked like a bird"
with some feathers plucked out
What else could you bring in his bag?
Anything else he could of put in the hat Liam?
"He vaguely saw the monster and then he ran back to the camp where he was camping, but he didn't describe"
"Where, where"
"Yeah, where"
So he could of put a little bit in about how he ran back
Yeah
"and what he went through in, in"
that couldn't he?
Yeah
"Right, the people who have not read an essay out yet, I want you to sit, just a minute Michael, next to somebody and I want you to read your essay to them and see what they think about it and how you could maybe improve it and I want Michael and John to go and show Steve your books as well now please, right boys do that now then, yes, could you take yours to show"
please
Do we have to show both?
Not sure  it's still working.
It's still working
The thingy
Is it recording us?
Is it recording?
Yeah
My dad's got all this
"Sorry Steve, erm,"
that you're not going to read your essay and
and that isn't
"essay, either work your book or, and get it"
"er, yes, well it has to be up"
and when you've finished it you can then do a picture about your
"Right erm, can I start by asking you, can you tell me your full name please?"
"Well,actually  and it might be based on a true story, don't know if it"
"Do you remember when Vaughan was, Vaughan was doing his meditation"
Yeah.
"and he was trying to get in touch with a North American Indian, that a, thingamy in Wales was fixed up"
.
Wonder what ever came of that.
"Always very hard to talk to Vaughan about things like that, because you asked a straight forward and he goes way, way, over the head"
"Yeah, I know , he does versify."
and within three seconds my brain just switches off .
Well I try to
.
"I, I just ask him if, and it, the question that I'm interested in the answer to, like how did it go? and, now he talks at me for an hour until Diane comes in and says enough Vaughany,cos she can see I sort of trying to edge away"
"suddenly cross your legs, ouch ."
That's a good idea.
"She said to me just say to him like I do enough Vaughany, don't want to hear any more."
"I said no, I, I would hate to offend him because it's all so well meant  being a mother in law you have to watch it."
", honestly you couldn't be much worse than ."
Oh  mother in law is.
.
She's just .
"I'm not buying her a present, I mean I'll chip in with a present for you for her and Mark if it comes, but we'll have to go to , but erm, you know, she,."
"As a person, you know, I'd never have any time ."
"Yes, yes, I mean you never, she lives in that great place and she's got no money"
", they're not, they're not her presents are they, they're from Diane."
"No, of course, of course ."
"So, I tell you what, if, if we do end up spending Christmas at  gonna give me the present I got to Di and said thank you Di for giving Stella the  Christmas present ."
It so .
I mean as an acquaintance I could tolerate her but I .
I couldn't I'm afraid.
"Well, could do, what I can't forgive is that she was so spiteful to my daughter, she's a sun shiny little sole and she's so full of love for everybody she's so generous"
Why was she?
she didn't want Vaughany to get married again.
"There you can see the staging, and that is where the er wagons came in along here."
More pictures of the roof timbers.
"Outside, that was some stabling I think there."
And er internal roof-work of the stabling.
Just er recessed there to avoid it getting damaged with things passing on the side.
And we're now now walking round the back and er sort of now pointing towards the  Arms.
And you'll notice the er er again the brickwork and the buttressing along there.
"Now having just walked away er up towards erm  er  crossing end, there's the ."
And that's the remains of the cattle dock here.
Er I'm afraid a lot of it had gone by that time.
That was to hang Mr  on.
Or Dr .
"In fact there're two of them, there and one there."
And that's erm  crossing house up there.
And you can see that's where the main tracks where and this is of course where we had er sort of sidings and er other things and er and the main yard.
"Erm odd pictures of the engine shed, taken from somebody's back garden I suppose now."
Er but you can see the er the the engine shed as it was.
Single road.
Accommodate er one locomotive only.
"They normally had here, er just the one erm locomotive  little O four four tank engine, Johnson."
Erm built before the turn of the century.
And and er they also had er normally a little O six O tank er which was er spent a lot of it's time at er a at  at the what is what is now  er Castle.
Er shunting there.
"As I say, that er train would nip off to Nottingham I think every Monday I think it was, and get vacuum cleaned out."
Er and then return.
"what I've never seen, there's the that's the er tank, water tank at the top."
"What I've never seen, is a photograph from the other end."
"If anybody can tell me what was at the other end, apart from a hole, then  not carefully, er I'd be very grateful."
I I guess there was probably a lean to or something like that.
"But er i just don't know, maybe erm a sand store."
"But as I say, I've never seen anything, and I've never been able to find anybody who can provide that answer for me."
"There is a coal truck, that was parked there, and they would load up coal er from there as as necessary."
"my Lord do, do we agree to that now or by tomorrow morning?"
well I would think if it could lodged during the course of the next ten days or so
"certainly, it'll be done by tomorrow morning"
"I'm, I'm, if there any question over it, the reason why I said ten days I'm already sitting in London for, until the end of next week and therefore if there were any question, it's obvious that it came before me, and that"
it'll be done by tomorrow morning
yes
thank you
"yes, yes, that can be prepared and erm a copy of that to doctor  and"
certainly
"doctor  if you don't agree with what it says, erm, you can obviously mention that to  and  er  er along speedily say in the course of this week, the matter can be mentioned in formal to me, erm one morning at ten o'clock next week I would of thought."
In terms of I need to appeal this one
"oh yes, leave to appeal, erm  it doesn't seem to me that this is an appropriate case for leave, or at least for me to grant leave, doctor"
All court rise
And don't put your greasy little hands  ha?
Oh hi Warren!
You alright Shel?
What are you doing here you cunt?
Don't call my boyfriend a cunt !
That's my dad you're talking about.

Cor!
Look at that bum now!
You should relax
I think you're really
Teacher!
Teacher!
Teacher!
I think you're really sexy Warren!
"Too late, he's mine."
"Alright, too late, he's yours."
What are you going out with Warren?
"Manhom believes that, believes what basically?"
"They look, er round that line, two three five  two three six  and Face is saying  you're very right sir."
She is a very rare scholar
"describing Doll Collan here, a whore who is seen wandering around the stage most of the time,she is the most rare scholar and has gone mad with studying Brampton's works."
And here but name a word such in a Hebrew she falls in her fit and will discourse her learned genealogies as you would run mad too to  to hear her sir .
"Now, so, Face is trying to sort of put off Sir Epicure Manhom by saying, you know, this a mad woman who's done too much learning  nice little attack on women here by Johnson, who, who  is one of the biggest misogynists in the world, erm  a woman who's gone crazy with learning  and who knows nothing because er she's just a prostitute and therefore she's thick."
Okay?
That's the joke.
"But th again, the funny thing is, even funnier, is that  Manhom lusts after her, gets distracted from this idea of getting all this money and sa saying,how am I going to have conference with her, Lungs ?"
"Erm  and Face said,Oh!"
For a mad woman   acceptance of her .
Okay?
"So, Face promises to get an introduction  to this woman who Manhom fancies and erm  and Manhom, okay."
That is the background.
"Next time we see them  they, they have met and  and Face sends them off to have a private conference."
Okay?
"So you now have act four, scene five."
Enter Doll and th they're talking.
"Will you please try and act it out like we did the Twelfth Night  the bit with Mrs , and see whether you can revive your idea of why  Johnson, what is the nature of, of Johnson's comic art."
Okay.
But hear guffaws  within minutes.
Right.
Do you want me to divide you up?
"Are you,do you want  class ."
You ne need four in a group.

"I'd love to do th I'm really unfit, I mean like totally unfit."
Sitting here I've got a pot belly and no fucking muscles
"That's what Robert wants then, to do a bit of training and start like getting"
"I'm not like overly fat or anything, I'm the right weight for what I'm, for my height like but I've just got a pot belly"
"They've got a spare room in my mum's flat so  I just took it over and put a weights bench in and, what else, a rowing machine  and I started to do some weights"
I never knew you had all those.
Have you ?
I've had those for years.
Expensive!
"sort of like what happened is that Robert was sort of like, the three of us sort of chipped in and bought it between us and stuff like that you know, so that all three of us would get the benefit of it"
Yeah
"but er  I was the only one that ever  used it  and I used it about once or twice and then, like  like, I used it for about"
Hi there.

Or er
"We've got, you know the"
"All the worst stuff comes at the start of next year   electro-magnetic induction, electron physics,stuff, all the shitty stuff I think"
course but
"Get down, get down oh yeah, yeah."
I got through quite a few bits and pieces that was
Have you?
All the jobs you've been meaning to do
"Yeah, yeah"
Yes I know
Hello there
Good afternoon
how's the family?
Abnormal
"Yeah   At one time we couldn't get Jessy to talk, he'd got a little girl with er and"
"I noticed the little girl with her, yes."
She waved as she came towards me and she said oh can't stop today
Huh
"said I've got to get this one back for her mum or whatever  said I'm in a hurry  then I met some guy on the field, talking to him and er"
Who you don't know from Adam
"A spaniel  which was off the lead, covered in mud a young one and of course these, this fellow went straight up to it E T"
Off the lead like?
"Off the lead and it was er, so boisterous up and down like this, well he didn't like it straight away he got the old aggro blade up his back about two inches wide"
then he was watching him like this then he ran
Away from it or
"ran away from it you see and then when he came back he came to us and he growled a few times at it, so, but erm, backed off you know"
"I said he  he doesn't mean any harm I said but he's a bit nervous, hoping to god he didn't bite the, bite the other one"
"Spaniel , yeah."
"he said in all that, we got two he said the other one cut itself badly this morning  on er a piece of glass obvious he said managed to come back to me you know being on a lead all his leg was cut so he sort of been down to the vet and had two stitches"
Stitches
"so he said I've had to, they'd have to keep him in for ten days or more you know"
Mm
stop him getting dirt
keep going
in it or whatever
Yeah
And what struck me was that the costumes were all sort of like you see portraits of Elizabethan dress.
"Now I don't what Italy and those  Middle Ages would have been like, that the sort of clothes that were worn."
Mhm.
But  the clothing in that film struck me very much as being like Elizabethan dress.
"Yeah, I mean  now plays  of  Shakespeare and  they're wearing modern dress like those worn at Richard the Third or something and they're wearing  well either First or Second World War  uniforms."
Yes.
It was very different then.
"Yeah, well it's just different  directors have different  things they want to emphasise in a play and if they want to bring something home or  they think that using a certain  well like say the way the people are dressed and everything will  will have more of an impact, you know will"
"One thing I was wondering about you know they  they talk about erm  in  Shakespeare's works is the language the words he uses, the  the sort of poetry of it and the symbolism that's used."
Erm do they talk about that at all in your English Literature
Yes.
"Do they show you how you can learn about this, there's a book you know the book I bought you it's got notes in it."
Does that help with it?
I suppose
Pardon?
Well you should do.
And what about  I bought some  revision books and things study aids or something for Amanda for her English literature
Well I bought them for Amanda and she was doing  Romeo and Juliet.
So if you look in those you may find there's some help there.
Yeah.
"Come in, good morning."
"Hello, well what's your mum been doing to you this morning ?"
.
Well she's just after the
"Freeze her, freeze her tongue."
"having the flu, near a fortnight ago now, she's on these pills and she's  as bad as ever, and not sleeping again."
"She's finished them now, she"
She's finished those .
Let's have a look and see what you've one to your your poor old inside.
Dearie me.
Driving your mother up the wall?
"Yeah, seen that"
and then for   there's this thing  treating people who'd ruined this guy's marriage
Did you tape it?
Yeah.
"the apocalypse and all the people  atheists and   one where ah the Christians, Christians over there please   well I'm sorry to tell you but the jews were right"
Er do you remember the one where ?
"No, he'd gone up to the traffic lights and this cyclist sort of like cycled up, jumped off his bike and wheeled it round the corner so he"
"Yeah, he jumps out"
I like the one  car park
Yeah he got trapped in a car park and he couldn't get out for ages and ages and then as he got out he crashed into another car.
"Ah that's, that's it there."
Well did you see the one where he's getting changed
What's that?
he was getting changed in the car and he put a brick on the pedal and all
"Yes, yes he was going to work and he put the brick on the pedal while he's  jumped in the back pulling on his trousers  and st st steering with"
And cleaning his teeth
steering with his foot.
He gets into the back seat and he's got his feet over the fr the front seat steering with his foot
"Ah that's the same one he's making a lunch or something in, in the park"
Yeah.
The bit where he's on the beach
he's just down to the beach
Yeah.
"and there's this guy sitting  sitting beside him, you know sunbathing and stuff, and er  he doesn't know what to do"
Oh the teacher told us this one.
"he sticks, he sticks the, the"
Trunks.
"the trunks on top of his trousers, unbuttons himself and pulls them down, and he gets, he's er really, really awkward the way he does it and all the rest of it and gets, he finally gets his trousers off, pulls up his er trunks and your man gets up, pulls off his towel, gets out his white stick and"
"Oh he, he went swimming one time and that was pretty good"
"I can't remember what that bit was, I think he just stood on top"
"Yes he crawled, crawled to the edge of the"
Oh that's right and then this wee kid got up and jumped off didn't he?
"There was not the money, we were forced to."
As I say the present day er premier just now is actually trying to do the same thing as a repeat performance
"So sort of erm what was, was there erm any victimizations or anything like that, from the bosses when you went back to work?"
"Oh immediately there was a victimization in the pit,o the pit was out."
Mm.
It was er taken there .
"The grievance was taken to the union, the union just say er told the steward who belonged to that particular pit there, right, just call the men out, that's it."
S so erm did  presumably are quite strong like that then?
Oh oh yes oh yes it was one of the be it still is one of the best unions.
Still is one of the best  for sticking
mm.
Was there erm I've forgotten what I was going ask you.
Er mm were there erm many strikes at the time?
"Oh no, oh no, oh there were all v very few and far be there may have been local strikes but, such as one day er a grievance been put in and the men struck work just for it."
But immediately the  get a result.
"So all our lads are more or less, that was lightning strikes and finish off."
Mm.
One day and it was finished you know?
"Because that would  union, you see?"
Did you work in the pits for a long time?
I was five years in the pits.
Mhm.
"Er eh in er in Lanarkshire and Motherwell, and er at that time, being a young lad  no more between er f er fourteen and twenty, I realized then  that wasn't going to be a life for me."
So I then decided that I would join the army.
Now I joined the army.
"I served my time in both India, Palestine, Gibraltar, Egypt and these sort of places abroad and when I, I  nine months of my colour service to finish, which were a twelve year service,when war broke out in nineteen thirty nine."
I then went er across to France with the B E F. Was in France about nine months approximately when the big invasion started in Poland and through France.
I was taken prisoner of war at Saint Valerie for a few of my friends in from Edinburgh who were taken prisoner of war.
I was taken to a main camp called Lamstor camp in er Polish er German border.
"And er you, you know what happened then?"
I was back down hole again.
"For another five years work, so I served five years in Germany too as a, as a miner."
Let er let's hope it'll mm  won't be like that er mm this er this year.
Now he says deep intake of breath don't have a puppy for Christmas.
Do as I do have turkey instead.

Er B B C radio York you are not in the South of France but as it is persistently snowing around the county at the moment I thought you know a little French flavour.
Was it the Beaujolais Nouveau wasn't it this week was it?
Everybody seems to be nodding around here I thought it was Thursday it was wasn't it?
Could anybody bring us a bottle down here  you know because that would be nice wouldn't it on a on a cool Saturday afternoon here as we sit overlooking the grand metropolis of York.
It would be nice to have just a little swig of the erm of the new grape.
Has anybody tasted it?
I haven't tasted it anybody taste give me a call.
I cos quite frankly I have never heard such an exciting R S P C A man as that last one so I don't expect to get much response to that.
"Er so let's talk about the, can't hear can he he's not up in this area?"
No he doesn't know does he?
Er stuff it.
Ah anyway so erm I don't think anybody's bothered about er fish and chips arrived have they?
Everybody's in there.
"Thing about this programme it is so it is so crucial to everything that goes on at Radio York while it is happening, they eat in the other room that's how much er interest there is they eat in the other room."
Tour buses around York.
Should they be banned?
Should we get rid of them?
Is York a big enough city to have them?
You know the open topped buses where they go round they hold up the traffic.
I know the tourists are very important to York but for goodness sake it isn't a huge city can't they walk round?
Why can't they walk round?
"I think if we got rid of all those open topped tour buses in York, traffic would be a lot easier."
What do you think?
Give me a call you know the number O nine O four six four one six four one.
You can ring now.
Also on the A one in the Leeming area the inside lane of the south bound carriageway's closed at Holby Grange for emergency gas repair works and delays are likely as a result there.
In Selby there's a demonstration taking place this afternoon it starts at half past one and will go via Barlby Road and Scott Road and some traffic delay delays are likely as a result.
Also in York today traffic near to the Knavesmire could be slow due to an event taking place there.
In the Ripon area weekend roadworks mean the  Road will be closed as it passes under the A one bridge delays are likely as a result.
At Stockton on Forest Stockton main bridge over the A sixty four is closed for resurfacing work through to six o'clock on Monday morning.
And finally in the Thirsk area there are no further reports of snow on the high ground there but some moorland routes may still be a little slippery.

The same building.
If you look at the look at that building.
It's the same building.
"The gates, they only had a single er they didn't have gates on either side here, they just got the one set of gates."
Erm plus this er er for for passengers.
But there wasn't there wasn't another set this side.
Wasn't room.
In fact it's a very narrow er er roadway there.
It still is.
Little er signal box at .
I managed to go in and have a chat with the signalman.
"Erm pretty little thing, the  er boxes are very standard er in design, they're they were varying in size, but erm the er sort of double hipped roof, the finials erm the angled corners, of the windows erm the er er the rails erm and the er sort of platform there, er very very standard er all over the place."
"They've got quite a few of these at erm at , at the  Railway Trust, they've er they've got a number of these signal boxes."
"They reckon they've probably got more than B R now, there."
Er but a pretty little box that is.
That's another view of the of the same box.
"Now a little bit further up the line, whoops, is junction."
"Now used to be er a link line between erm this er track here, and round the back, erm under  Road, there's still a bridge there, er and joined up near where the rubbish tip is."
"Erm and er so trains could er instead of going towards Lincoln having to perhaps back up to, they would go round er a triangle basically, and be facing towards , equally if they're coming back, they didn't have to go towards Lincoln, and then back, they could erm could erm go round and er take their wares to  sidings and marshalling yards."
"Er inside, er is a wheel which with which the erm signal box, or signalman, er could er open and shut the gates as necessary."
"And er a line of levers for points, for signals, and some spares inside."
"And that was er duly inside, you've got a fair number of spares on that."
"The reds where the home signals, yellow, the distance, and I this the black were points were they not."
"That's looking up er towards er Nottingham,."
". Long time ago,."
"An old, a very old photograph and a bit grainy."
But erm a train just coming in er from Lincoln to Nottingham.
. That's gone now.
"The signal box and the gates have gone, taken now probably five or six years or so ago."
"Again typical er  box, erm rather attractive, has now got the er normal lifting barriers."
There you can see the er  box.
"Erm and er the er  whatd'youcallit, the the er er the level crossing er and house."
And that's how we got them.
"And I di in the end they   the same for them, but"
He and Geoff went over there and loaded them on the trailer .
we would of done it by ourself  sorted out.
"Yeah we do a  we went over there and loaded them all on and then got a puncture in the trailer,!"
"Put them on a  didn't they, then load them  load"
Yeah.
them on  yeah.
Used be able to sit in the car   would be   go up the back don't they?
Yeah.
"And I used to load the boot up  and bring them  and load home like in the boot of my car  my Sales Manager said to me the other day, how the hell did you get bright red dust in your boot?"
I dunno!
There's all like red brick dust in your boot!
Oh no!
Geoff was getting the bricks.
"And I had Avenger estate, and I done the same with that  and I got away with it for ages and I   what you want a do, I know what you wanna do  he erm, I mean that's that's really sort of pushing it over the top  but he got a great big sheet of polythene, he went down to ready mix  and had a load of ready mix in the back of this  Avenger estate, brand new he'd only just got it!"
And course
Well we didn't do that but
and then on top of that he took the battery off  Pat's car  and it fell over in the front so all the acid burnt the carpet!
"Come back dinner time  and they were saying well no you see you can't just a borrow a car to go to dinner in, yeah that'll be alright man  and I hadn't even been in it  since Roy bought it back!"
Absolutely went spare you know !
"Sent memos all round, you know  and he called me in the office that day, to say I'm really disappointed in you, I said, what do you mean?"
"He said well I give you that Avenger estate he said cos I thought you were building your house, that'll be handy for you you know  yeah you did  and you let me down badly!"
"So I thought now what do I say, do I drop myself in it or do I say well that wasn't , that was Roy, I said well you know I said I must admit I said I  I'm sorry  so erm  then Roy said well that battery he said was me he said I, I borrowed Geoff's car again and look the battery fell over in it so I'm gonna help him  er  then I sa , a piece of that bloody great  went across our French doors and  this, there's a  went across"
Cor!
"there  and I went down to the   at    and he said    we got your lintel in mate, do you want to take it?"
"So I said yeah I can do  so he said bring your van down, so I never said nothing  so Bob said, got any  like your dad had"
Oh yeah.
"It's for our new one again you see  so I rolled the front seat down  put my brief case on the front seat  so he says, where's your van then mate?"
I said it's here!
"No, where is it?"
I said that is it!
Erm o a barrow crossing er between platforms there.
There's a engine or carriage co er couple of carriages in there.
The gates are shut over there.
Signal box there.
"Er the er station master's house, the line disappearing off towards  over there."
"Erm  's Mill along here, and actually, you can actually just see there's a wagon there which says, L B S C."
"Now that's London, Brighton and South Coast."
What on earth's that doing there?
Er but er maybe it was erm collecting or delivering a load or something.
Er there you have the weighbridge.
"Er or weigh office, and again pretty little building, er the steeply pitched roof, the barge- boarding on it, erm and er multi-coloured er brick, there's a sort of whitish brick with erm er sort of pinkish er brick work er put in to er b by way of decoration."
And again you've got the same sort of thing.
That's the coal er th the the coal offices.
"There were three, well there we were in fact four coal merchants in the in the town."
"there was er  's, erm  's who were probably the biggest, Samuel  's, erm  's and  s."
"Erm I think that  's had gone out of the coal merchanting business erm probably by nineteen twenty or earlier, I think."
I haven't been able to trace anything er later than that.
"There you've got er a line of coal wagons, and so that's those'll be coming that is a more sort of general merchandise wagons which would be parked in there, loaded or unloaded, erm er shunted across the lines and er into that goods yard, goods shed for er loading and so on."
"Erm lamps, kerosene, wicks and all the rest of it would be kept there."
"Gentlemen's toilet, there."
"Erm and the driveway, er over there."
And again as I say it's rather a nice erm picture which erm er was given to me some time ago.
"A close up really, just showing you er more detail on er that wagon turntable, the buffer stops, rail built buffer stops, or just across there, fire buckets."
Erm and er there's the er loading gauge and there of course is the whitewashed erm cattle dock.
"Er and er so there's  the goods shed and the er door, the wooden door to provide excess er trucks into there."
"Er another picture I say really just erm closer up, erm and giving perhaps better detail."
You can see the er the pattern of the darker brickworks.
There's the sort of pinkish bricks.
"And again you can see the barge-boarding erm and rather attractive roof designs, er which er reflect er the rest of the architecture."
"Some of the some of the railways were very very functional, not and didn't bother too much about er what places looked like."
Railway was.
"Er they perhaps spent too much money that way, but to be fair, the  Railway was the biggest Well the  Railway  er on amalgamation in nineteen twenty three, was the biggest company, and biggest employer in this country."
"No, he did that."
Ah!
"I suppose if you get, when you get there  everything'll be alright."
But  it was your idea of erm  entrances that got me a bit scared.
From the top more  from the top.
Top.
"Yeah, but just sa say, if you come from th the top you, you're like a  a waist thing round you and if you fall off that'll catch you."
So what do you think?
About the entrance?
Can I have a ?
You could come down on the  the first half and I can jump   and that's like   Wrestle Mania.
Mm.
Mm.
But our feet will come down like that.
Put it this way Trace  I am more petrified than  about this than you are.
That would be a nightmare!
Will it?
Rod Stewart on the  ooh!
"Notices for you, first of all those of you who are on the Committee ."
"Any er ideas you've got  you've got, please pass on to the Committee member  Thursday dinner time."
The only other er notice I've got for you is that tomorrow I forgot to put it on the notices  tomorrow we've got a lot of visitors in school  there's about er thirty five of them coming over who are likely to be joining us in the lower sixth next September er  lessons with the lower sixth to find out what erm  what  lessons are like you know okay.
"Now do welcome them, do make them feel at home, especially those of you who are new to the place you will know and remember what it's like when you first come into a strange building that feels like home."
"Okay, so erm do  them and then if they're lost on practical things like they don't know where the toilet is will you help them."
and er
Thank you the only  is that you will have seen  organised  generally supported that although I think we could support it a lot better than we have.
So er think about that and remember
"It's a different format Mr Dexter this time, we're not having maths we're having a ten minute  and that will be followed by a concert ."
"It's a completely different format, so you might  might like to come to that  okay."
Erm  this morning we have er another visitor and  who actually was a teacher and works at  at a very senior position er heading er very interesting projects to technical location educations  and I would like to er introduce you to Mr
Good morning everybody.
It's about er ten years ago nearly that I er stopped being a teacher and when I was a teacher er  up having to do assemblies er it was always something that I did with great reluctance and er was er pleased if I could get other people to do it er it seems rather odd then er that I've actually said yes coming to do er an assembly here today and it's perhaps a sign of mental instability on my part.
over to you Mike
"Er, hello there, my name's Mike, well let's go over to the weather with Winsy, no Winsy, oh Rita's dropped dead, she's jumped off a cliff we think, we think"
and now we'll go over to Winsy.
"Hello my name's Winsy  insy spider climb up the spout, down came the rain and washed Winsy out, when the sun came out it dried up the rain, insy, winsy spider climbed up again  thank you, oh thank you, oh thank you, I know, thank you, well, today, at midday today it's going to be tipping down with rain and winsy, winsy, winsy, spider will fall down the rain,"

"came up to me  and he did, do you want a game of footy, I said oh"
"sorry about that love, well I'll go"
"and I tore this paper and I said if you're gonna have a wee wee then do it wee on me, so I said, up your"

Oh.
"She used to say what Diane, I've never heard of a Diane, after they were married this"
.
"And when anyone treats my daughter like that I find it very hard to forgive, I know it hurts my kids, I'm much more up in arms than if they hurt me."
"Remember that first Christmas when she put the cat among the pigeons by saying to me your husband told me that he can't really afford he's flying because you spend all his money, when I, when I've been backing him, saving money for his aeroplane and his lessons and"
What did you say to dad?did you say that to dad didn't you say it  .
But I thought she was stirring it you see and so did Diane.
What did you tell .
I didn't believe her
"You didn't, you never ."
"But he said, I said it as a joke when she was asking me about my flying and I said I don't do as much flying as I'd like to, I've, I've got a wife to support and she takes all the money."
"But I said I am the money  I gave him his first flying lesson, I paid for it, like I bought his first three cars."
.
"I excused myself and went to bed I think  but she repeated it so solemnly you see not as, say somebody saying a joking sort of way."
"Yeah, good stirring ."
And it was just after Frank had left her and gone to live in that place in .
"Does, does anybody know what he's doing,."
"Don't know, last time I asked Diane she said oh he's, he's living with this machine he's got in"
What machine?
some magic machine.
What machine?
Magic machine?
Yes.
What kind of machine?
"A machine he's designed, I don't know for what purpose, I didn't dare ask, I was going to ask Vaughan ."
"It's not to, it's not to isolate gamma rays ."
"Probably, but he was hiding he wouldn't come out because he said that the men from outer space were after him."
"It's funny you know, I've reading, I'm reading Silence of, Silence of the Lambs at the moment and er, you know, it's got in there, a lot of er, er, mentally ill patient's have got this idea that, men, men from Mars have ."
"Well I said to Diane you know, I didn't laugh, I didn't think it was funny, I thought it was sad and I said but he needs help, if Vaughan's you know, he's got two sons, but Mark's a bit hopeless and he was at Oxford anyway, I said surely somebody should go and get him some  some treatment, sanitation."
Yes.
"You can get cranks, you just believe in flying saucers and a quite happy harmless, but, I think they need checking on to make sure that they are  happy with the life they're leading  it bothers me a lot"
So where is he now?
Exactly.
And Oakes I do like your tie.
I'm glad you mentioned that cos it was given to me by the wife of the steeplechase handicap a very important man today cos for more than
She didn't whisper
and Melinda his wife runs Simply Delightful which is wh that's one of the things she has a shop
in Malton and that's something
Didn't whisper anything that's well in today in the Mackeson did she?
No.
What's on today?
It's a busy old day.
Well it's lacing there's racing all over the all over the country and except at Ayr in Scotland it's raining everywhere I'm sorry to say.
"Racing at Ayr up in Scotland where it is dry, Nottingham, Cheltenham where the Mackeson Gold Cup is, big card at Windsor with a lot of runners and finally the all-weather racing at Lingfield."
Well as John said wet and windy everywhere unless you go very far north but those people up at Ayr it's gonna be cold so you can't have everything.
Main meeting as we've said is Cheltenham let's have the news from there .
First race there twelve fifty the going at the moment is good but they have had a quarter of an inch of rain overnight so of course I suppose there's every chance it could go to good to soft by this afternoon.
"Two important non runners there in the twelve fifty, number seven Far Senior and in the two o'clock number thirteen the I wouldn't say old timer but Panto Prince anyway shame he's not going to get a run."
It is raining at the moment and it's gonna be wet and windy but quite mild for the rest of the day.
No hazards but there'll be a good crowd so get there in plenty of time.
"Actually there's a race at eleven thirty it's a running race between members of the Press and the jockeys, people like Peter Scudimore, Deckland Murphy, Ben Newton for the press he could be the dark horse."
It's over hurdles as well that could be good for a laugh especially if er you don't clear them as well as you should do.
Erm
Scu's Scu's for the press.
Scu's running for the press.
Scu's yeah
Yeah
Yeah is that a help or a hindrance ?
I don't  anyway this is just one of the highlights of what has been two marvellous days at the Mackeson meeting sponsored of course by Whitbread and the big race today is the fifty thousand pound Mackeson Gold Cup confirming fifteen runners over two and a half miles.
Panto Prince is out and General Pershing is now new  favourite and clear favourite.
"Neil Doughty eleven to two, Bradbury Star that has to be the favourite easing slightly this seven to one with General Idea."
Just looking at those prices on the screen I suppose Oakes General Pershing is a worthy favourite or is he?
Well it's a very very competitive race I I I suppose he may have the best chance but there are an awful lot with good chances.
I think he's got a great chance.
"They were, first of all, there were  and  's buses, direct and the  bus."
"And then, of course, come along and er for while there was a competition with chasers over the forest, you know one running either just in front, or just behind the other, sort of thing."
"And then, tt er Reynolds took ove er Reynolds went and er Trent took over and then Duttons went, and Trent took over again."
What about?
Did many people have cars in Hucknall?
"No, very few, erm in  Lane, which is now  in an estate agent's parlance, erm a desirable part of the town, they used to be Mr  the local the solicitor, of Castlegate, and his wife used to drive him to the station, to catch the train to Nottingham."
"She also meet him m met him at lunchtime, because the steam coach used to come out from town, and bring the business men, the wealthier one, out."
Mm.
"And I suppose, seeing as it was so short, it was worth coming home?"
Yes.
In that sort  ?
"Oh yes, er he could er he could still have an hour lunchtime, and er only be out of the office, say, an hour and three quarters."
"Erm moving on a l a little bit, what was your social life at the time?"
"My social life, I suppose, ticked round chapel, then it ticked round er cycling and er walking."
"My brother tt he er had a bicycle and then he joined up, er we did have a hectic time, he could make anything go."
Mm.
"He built a motorbike out of scrap bits he found on the tip, which didn't endear him to Grandma, or anyone else."
"And then joined so he joined the army, and I was left with this bicycle, and a friend of mine said, How about coming with us on Sunday, you can skip chapel this Sunday, and we'll go out er we're going into Derbyshire, and I finished up on Ack's Edge."
"I'd never ridden a bike, hardly, before."
"But then they had a cycling club, at chapel, and so we tended to go Saturdays, and then I started walking and youth hostelling."
"We went youth hostelling for m the sort of the chapel choir, after When you grew up in chapel, then you were either found a job teaching, in the Sunday School, or you went into the choir."
"Well I went in a choir, I could never sing, and I still can't, and er the choir used to go out quite a lot, and er we cycled and we youth-hostelled, even as w or in on working parties, at some of the peak hostels."
"What about erm, you were involved in the amateur dram dramatics  ?"
"Well this er came through the same thing, the Youth Hostels Association, we had a visit from Gyp some German ones who did m play reading in hostels, and er some of ours went back there, and the Youth Hostels Associations, they had a play reading group, and er I joined that."
"As I say, I'd al been in things at chapel, Silas Marner and things, but er this was another thing, and of course, that's where I met my wife, at  er Row, which is the boys' clu was the boys' club's Headquarters."
And er we did one or two plays there and
Mm.
"in the old S St  's Church hall on  Street, which has now gone."
"Would Robin  have acted with you, then?"
"Robin , er William    was at school, one year behind me and I played with him, but Bill wasn't very er big."
"Erm I'm amazed now when I see him on television as to how big he is, because he wasn't as a youngster, and he was fragile and er we ribbed him because, in those days, you had an attache case for a school bag, and your initials were put on it."
"And er, he had the lot, W H M B, you see, and er he wasn't Robin, then."
Er as an original project.
"Erm the  er In eighteen thirty nine, the  the railway came to Nottingham, er from Derby, and er there were three companies, the , the  er Railway I think it was, and the er  Railway or er sorry  Railway."
And they amalgamated in eighteen forty four to become the  Railway.
And er a certain
"George  known as the Railway King was very keen to to get er across into to Lincoln and certainly in various other parts of East Anglia, to sort of spike other people's guns and to erm er to obtain the traffic for his own er benefit, and for his shareholder's benefit perhaps."
"Erm and erm the  Railway, er opened the Nottingham, Newark, Lincoln railway line in eighteen forty six."
"he whole thing was built in a year, quite incredible."
In in those days.
"Erm because it crossed the Trent quite a number of times, and quite a number of trestle er wooden bridges were involved in that construction."
"But the whole lot was done and opened I think it was er in August, eighteen forty six."
"And  one of the say one of the proposals was that there should be this er line from , and through this town, and over to join the er Nottingham, Lincoln line er at ."
"What was built in eighteen forty seven, and opened in eighteen forty seven, was merely a small branch line, of two and a half, three miles, from this town, to , where it say er er made a er a connection and and a small junction there."
There was no station actually at  at that time.
Erm the station was opened er and trains began to run in eighteen forty seven.
But very quickly it was er all all the promises of much traffic.
"Say the town had only got three and a bit thousand people anyhow, three thousand people, erm there was very very little actual passenger traffic."
"Er even in the early eighteen well late eighteen forties, early eighteen fifties."
"And after a matter of a couple of years of use, er the service had already been curtailed, from nine trains down to five per day, erm and er shortly the passenger service was completely withdrawn."
Or at least it was withdrawn as far as er railway engines were concerned.
"They did in fact get a horse erm and er they had a small carriage, er and er a horse made the odd er visit up the line, from time to time."
"Er but erm the So the railway line erm still carried a little bit of er of freight traffic, but erm it wasn't quite abandoned, but even some of the er station buildings were removed erm to er to ."
"So that's that's really what happened, and it wasn't until eighteen sixty, or eighteen fifty eight, fifty nine in time, that the  Railway directors agreed to reopen this branch line, as they'd been basically promised a lot more traffic."
"Erm it was still pretty marginal er but er at least it was opened and erm in eighteen er it carried on until, in eighteen seventy, seventy one, the line was extended back to  or a station roughly halfway between the two."
"Then er through to erm , and on to."
"In those days there wasn't a great deal of of mining, I mean  wasn't open, and er there was a tremendous amount, well there's a fair amount of of traffic agricultural traffic, and I mean one had to accept that virtually everything came in, all coal, road stone, erm  goods required er for well  's who were going at the time, they er they used the railway."
"Erm and the various er food s food stores er again, virtually everything came in."
"And of course in due course er  time er the town had a gas station, erm or a gas, not a gas station, erm  er a gas works ."
Erm and so again coal was was brought in erm for that.
Erm anyhow so that is sort of the background.
"And the railway er it operated, I suppose, pretty marginally, certainly for the rest of er last century."
"Erm in nineteen O two I think it was, I've got the details at home, erm sidings were put in for  's."
They paid a bit and the  Railway paid a bit.
What is your date of birth please?
Er  twenty ninth.
And
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
"Yeah, er guilty."
Right.
"And you're also summoned that on that same occasion you  not having given your name and address to any person requiring it at the time, you failed to report the accident at a police station, or to a constable as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case within twenty four hours of it happening  again, that's an offence under section twenty five of the road traffic act  to that effect do you plead guilty or not guilty?"
Yeah.
You're pleading guilty?
Yeah.
"And finally, that at Worley on the twenty fifth of July nineteen eighty eighty, you being the driver of a motor car  you failed to afford precedence to a foot passenger on the carriageway within the limits of uncontrolled zebra crossing on King Street  that's an offence under the pedestrian crossing regulations  and the road traffic regulation act of ninety eighty four  to that  do you plead guilty or not"
Yes.
guilty?
"Yes, guilty."
"Right, now listen carefully to the prosecution."
Do you have difficulty hearing?
"Yes, I'm aware"
that  be needed.
"Alright, well perhaps  lu turn, turn that way  listen to lady speaking here."
Just stand as close to her as you like  as long as you can hear what's she's saying that's the important thing.
your worships Mrs  appears before the court today as a result of an accident which occurred on the twenty fifth of July at about four thirty in the afternoon  it was on King Street at Worley and  there was only her vehicle involved  and a young girl who was using the pedestrian crossing.
"Apparently at this particular time  there was a considerable amount of traffic on the road in question  and  traffic from one direction had halted  in order to allow that the young girl and her friend to cross the road  they began to cross on the zebra crossing  but, as she reached the centre of the road  Mrs  was driving her vehicle in the opposite direction and she failed to stop  the young girl, in her teens, was unable to  take, avoiding acci action  and she was knocked down as she crossed the road."
Apparently she then  picked herself up and in fact  ran from the scene  but  Mrs  didn't stop and didn't make  enquiries as to who the girl was  and neither was the matter reported by her to the police in due course.
"However, the whole incident was witnessed by another driver who took a note of the car number and in turn, of course, reported it to the police and eventually Mrs  was interviewed on the eleventh of August of this year  she agreed that she was the driver at the time  and she replied  it's okay, but if the little had stopped after the accident  I would of sorted things out  I couldn't do anything after she ran off."
"And that it says, the brief facts, I would ask  to consider cost of ten pound."
"Alright then, yeah."
You heard ?
"Ya, you did alright."
Mr  was going to speak for you now.
"Yes, your worships I wonder if I may assist the court o on behalf of er  M Mrs   erm  Mrs   er  has told me that she thought at the time of the incident again was in fact, nearer to five o'clock than  than, than four thirty  and  she was  driving  from Billington towards Clitheroe  she had come through the traffic lights at the bottom of Accrington Road in Worley and she was proceeding along King Street  in Worley er, towards  towards Clitheroe  and sh she has told me that at the time there was a considerable amount of traffic on the road and yo i in fact had that confirmed to you by  er, my friend  er the  the traffic was  sufficiently heavy that in fact, the the traffic travelling in the direction of Blackburn  er was wai was backed up to the traffic lights as far as the zebra crossing and beyond it  and so  as Mrs  erm  was travelling towards Clitheroe her view of the children on the footpath at the  opposite side of the road was obstructed by the cars that were  er, travelling towards Blackburn."
"And so  erm, it wasn't as though these children ran across an open zebra crossing and she could see the children travelling  er, walking or running all the way across the er  er er er the  pedestrian crossing  the two children one was  estimated by her to be about six years old, and the one who was actually knocked down was estimated by her to be about  er, nine years old  and  she wasn't travelling at any significant speed at all, she was travelling slowly because of the amount of traffic  and she says that er  the first she saw them was  erm, appearing from  the  behind a car and dashing across the front of her car, and in fact, it was only the the  the  one who ran first the  the older of the two children that she actually hit, she hit hit her with the  near side front of er  of her vehicle."
"She  hit her and at the same time as she hit her she virtually came to a  er, a stop  because of the fact she wa she started to brake as soon as she saw the  the children appear  er, but  ne never the less contact was made but  thankfully for her and for the child the the contact was a a at no significant speed, the child was just knocked off her feet  and  she got up  and  waved to Mrs  and said I'm alright and she ran off  and she was away before Mrs  had time, even to undo her safety belt to get out of the car."
Alan shook his head .
"`` No , that has nothing to do with it . ''"
`` And you wo n't come back ? ''
`` It is not a question of will .
I can not -- must not go . ''
"`` Lynde will break her heart then , '' said Emily in a tone of despair ."
`` I think not .
She is too strong and fine for that .
Help her all you can with sympathy but do n't torment her with any questions .
"You may tell her if you like that I advise her to confide the whole story to you , but if she can not do n't tease her to ."
Be very gentle with her . ''
`` You do n't need to tell me that .
I 'd rather die than hurt her .
I came here full of anger against you -- but I see now you are not to blame .
You are suffering too -- your face tells that .
"All the same , I wish you 'd never set foot in Four Winds ."
She was n't happy before but she was n't so miserable as she is now .
"Oh , I know Anthony is at the bottom of it all in some way but I wo n't ask you any more questions since you do n't feel free to answer them ."
But are you sure that nothing can be done to clear up the trouble ? ''
"`` Too sure , '' said Alan 's white lips ."
* * * * * The autumn dragged away .
Alan found out how much a man may suffer and yet go on living and working .
"As for that , his work was all that made life possible for him now and he flung himself into it with feverish energy , growing so thin and hollow-eyed over it that even Elder Trewin remonstrated and suggested a vacation -- a suggestion at which Alan merely smiled ."
A vacation which would take him away from Lynde 's neighbourhood -- the thought was not to be entertained .
"He never saw Lynde , for he never went to any part of the shore now ; yet he hungered constantly for the sight of her , the sound of her voice , the glance of her luminous eyes ."
"When he pictured her eating her heart out in the solitude of Four Winds , he clenched his hands in despair ."
"As for the possibility of Harmon 's return , Alan could never face it for a moment ."
"When it thrust its ugly presence into his thoughts , he put it away desperately ."
The man was dead -- or his fickle fancy had veered elsewhere .
Nothing else could explain his absence .
"But they could never know , and the uncertainty would forever stand between him and Lynde like a spectre ."
But he thought more of Lynde 's pain than his own .
"All are keeping a sharp look-out in front , but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind ."
This shows how real the island was .
The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys .
"They flung themselves down on the sward , close to their underground home . '"
"I do wish Peter would come back , ' every one of them said nervously , though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain . '"
"I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates , ' Slightly said , in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite ; but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him , for he added hastily , ` but I wish he would come back , and tell us whether he has heard anything more about Cinderella . '"
"They talked of Cinderella , and Tootles was confident that his mother must have been very like her ."
"It was only in Peter 's absence that they could speak of mothers , the subject being forbidden by him as silly ."
"` All I remember about my mother , ' Nibs told them , ` is that she often said to father , `` Oh , how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own . ''"
"I do n't know what a cheque-book is , but I should just love to give my mother one . '"
While they talked they heard a distant sound .
"You or I , not being wild things of the woods , would have heard nothing , but they heard it , and it was the grim song : ` Yo ho , yo ho , the pirate life , The flag o ' skull and bones , A merry hour , a hempen rope , And hey for Davy Jones . '"
At once the lost boys -- but where are they ?
They are no longer there .
Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly .
I will tell you where they are .
"With the exception of Nibs , who has darted away to reconnoitre , they are already in their home under the ground , a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently ."
But how have they reached it ?
"for there is no entrance to be seen , not so much as a pile of brushwood , which if removed would disclose the mouth of a cave ."
"Look closely , however , and you may note that there are here seven large trees , each having in its hollow trunk a hole as large as a boy ."
"These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground , for which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons ."
Will he find it to-night ?
"As the pirates advanced , the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing through the wood , and at once his pistol flashed out ."
But an iron claw gripped his shoulder .
"` Captain , let go , ' he cried , writhing ."
Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook .
It was a black voice .
"` Put back that pistol first , ' it said threateningly ."
` It was one of those boys you hate .
I could have shot him dead . '
"` Ay , and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily 's redskins upon us ."
Do you want to lose your scalp ? '
he said .
`` Dinner ? ''
"`` Ay , sot , '' replied the cook , `` dinner it is , and a dry dinner , too , with neither ale nor bread ."
"But there is little pleasure in the greenwood now ; time was when a good fellow could live here like a mitred abbot , set aside the rain and the white frosts ; he had his heart 's desire both of ale and wine ."
"But now are men 's spirits dead ; and this John Amend-All , save us and guard us !"
but a stuffed booby to scare crows withal . ''
"`` Nay , '' returned the other , `` y ' are too set on meat and drinking , Lawless ."
Bide ye a bit ; the good time cometh . ''
"`` Look ye , '' returned the cook , `` I have even waited for this good time sith that I was so high ."
"I have been a grey friar ; I have been a king 's archer ; I have been a shipman , and sailed the salt seas ; and I have been in greenwood before this , forsooth !"
and shot the king 's deer .
What cometh of it ?
Naught !
I were better to have bided in the cloister .
John Abbot availeth more than John Amend-All .
By ' r Lady !
here they come . ''
"One after another , tall , likely fellows began to stroll into the lawn ."
"Each as he came produced a knife and a horn cup , helped himself from the caldron , and sat down upon the grass to eat ."
"They were very variously equipped and armed ; some in rusty smocks , and with nothing but a knife and an old bow ; others in the height of forest gallantry , all in Lincoln green , both hood and jerkin , with dainty peacock arrows in their belts , a horn upon a baldrick , and a sword and dagger at their sides ."
"They came in the silence of hunger , and scarce growled a salutation , but fell instantly to meat ."
"There were , perhaps , a score of them already gathered , when a sound of suppressed cheering arose close by among the hawthorns , and immediately after five or six woodmen carrying a stretcher debauched upon the lawn ."
"A tall , lusty fellow , somewhat grizzled , and as brown as a smoked ham , walked before them with an air of some authority , his bow at his back , a bright boar-spear in his hand ."
`` Lads ! ''
"he cried , `` good fellows all , and my right merry friends , y ' have sung this while on a dry whistle and lived at little ease ."
But what said I ever ?
"Abide Fortune constantly ; she turneth , turneth swift ."
And lo !
"here is her little firstling -- even that good creature , ale ! ''"
There was a murmur of applause as the bearers set down the stretcher and displayed a goodly cask .
"`` And now haste ye , boys , '' the man continued ."
`` There is work toward .
These terrible moods come on without any cause that we know of .
Even Mother could not do anything with him when he was like that .
You must go away now -- and do not come back until his dark mood has passed .
"He will be just as glad to see you as ever then , and this will not make any difference with him ."
Do n't come back for a week at least . ''
"`` I do not like to leave you in such trouble , Miss Oliver . ''"
"`` Oh , it does n't matter about me -- I have Emily ."
And there is nothing you could do .
Please go at once .
Father knows I am talking to you and that will vex him still more . ''
"Alan , realizing that he could not help her and that his presence only made matters worse , went away perplexedly ."
The following week was a miserable one for him .
His duties were distasteful to him and meeting his people a positive torture .
Sometimes Mrs. Danby looked dubiously at him and seemed on the point of saying something -- but never said it .
"Isabel King watched him when they met , with bold probing eyes ."
In his abstraction he did not notice this any more than he noticed a certain subtle change which had come over the members of his congregation -- as if a breath of suspicion had blown across them and troubled their confidence and trust .
Once Alan would have been keenly and instantly conscious of this slight chill ; now he was not even aware of it .
When he ventured to go back to Four Winds he found the Captain on the point of starting off for a cruise in his yacht .
"He was urbane and friendly , utterly ignoring the incident of Alan 's last visit and regretting that business compelled him to go down the lake ."
"Alan saw him off with small regret and turned joyfully to Lynde , who was walking under the pines with her dogs ."
"She looked pale and tired and her eyes were still troubled , but she smiled proudly and made no reference to what had happened ."
"`` I 'm going to put these flowers on Mother 's grave , '' she said , lifting her slender hands filled with late white roses ."
`` Mother loved flowers and I always keep them near her when I can .
You may come with me if you like . ''
Alan had known Lynde 's mother was buried under the pines but he had never visited the spot before .
"The grave was at the westernmost end of the pine wood , where it gave out on the lake , a beautiful spot , given over to silence and shadow ."
"`` Mother wished to be buried here , '' Lynde said , kneeling to arrange her flowers ."
`` Father would have taken her anywhere but she said she wanted to be near us and near the lake she had loved so well .
Father buried her himself .
He would n't have anyone else do anything for her .
I am so glad she is here .
It would have been terrible to have seen her taken far away -- my sweet little mother . ''
"No captain , sir , would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that ."
"As for Mr. Arrow , I believe him thoroughly honest ; some of the men are the same ; all may be for what I know ."
But I am responsible for the ship 's safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her .
"I see things going , as I think , not quite right ."
And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth .
And that 's all . ''
"`` Captain Smollett , '' began the doctor with a smile , `` did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse ?"
"You 'll excuse me , I dare say , but you remind me of that fable ."
"When you came in here , I 'll stake my wig , you meant more than this . ''"
"`` Doctor , '' said the captain , `` you are smart ."
When I came in here I meant to get discharged .
I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word . ''
"`` No more I would , '' cried the squire ."
`` Had Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce .
"As it is , I have heard you ."
"I will do as you desire , but I think the worse of you . ''"
"`` That 's as you please , sir , '' said the captain ."
`` You 'll find I do my duty . ''
And with that he took his leave .
"`` Trelawney , '' said the doctor , `` contrary to all my notions , I believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you -- that man and John Silver . ''"
"`` Silver , if you like , '' cried the squire ; `` but as for that intolerable humbug , I declare I think his conduct unmanly , unsailorly , and downright un-English . ''"
"`` Well , '' says the doctor , `` we shall see . ''"
"When we came on deck , the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder , yo-ho-ing at their work , while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending ."
The new arrangement was quite to my liking .
The whole schooner had been overhauled ; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after-part of the main hold ; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side .
"It had been originally meant that the captain , Mr. Arrow , Hunter , Joyce , the doctor , and the squire were to occupy these six berths ."
"Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion , which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round-house ."
"Very low it was still , of course ; but there was room to swing two hammocks , and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement ."
"Even he , perhaps , had been doubtful as to the crew , but that is only guess , for as you shall hear , we had not long the benefit of his opinion ."
"We were all hard at work , changing the powder and the berths , when the last man or two , and Long John along with them , came off in a shore-boat ."
"The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness , and as soon as he saw what was doing , `` So ho , mates ! ''"
says he .
"I never shall forget it , and I 'll do anything for you ."
Yes !
I 'll write and ask Mrs. Piper to lend us her ermine cloak for the king .
See if I do n't ! ''
"Shrieks of delight hailed this noble offer , for no one had dared to borrow the much-coveted mantle , but all agreed that the old lady would not refuse Jill ."
"It was astonishing how smoothly everything went after this , for each was eager to help , admire , and suggest , in the friendliest way ; and when all were dressed , the boys found a party of very gay ladies waiting for them round the couch , where lay the brightest little Princess ever seen ."
"`` Oh , Jack , I 'm to act !"
Was n't it dear of the girls to choose me ?
Do n't they look lovely ?
Are n't you glad ? ''
"cried Jill , as the lads stared and the lasses blushed and smiled , well pleased at the frank admiration the boyish faces showed ."
`` I guess I am !
"You are a set of trumps , and we 'll give you a first-class spread after the play to pay for it ."
"Wo n't we , fellows ? ''"
"answered Jack , much gratified , and feeling that now he could act his own part capitally ."
`` We will .
"It was a handsome thing to do , and we think well of you for it ."
"Hey , Gus ? ''"
"and Frank nodded approvingly at all , though he looked only at Annette ."
"`` As king of this crowd , I call it to order , '' said Gus , retiring to the throne , where Juliet sat laughing in her red table-cloth ."
"`` We 'll have ` The Fair One with Golden Locks ' next time ; I promise you that , '' whispered Ed to Mabel , whose shining hair streamed over her blue dress like a mantle of gold-colored silk ."
"`` Girls are pretty nice things , are n't they ?"
Kind of 'em to take Jill in .
"Do n't Molly look fine , though ? ''"
and Grif 's black eyes twinkled as he planned to pin her skirts to Merry 's at the first opportunity .
`` Susy looks as gay as a feather-duster .
I like her .
"She never snubs a fellow , '' said Joe , much impressed with the splendor of the court ladies ."
"The boys ' costumes were not yet ready , but they posed well , and all had a merry time , ending with a game of blind-man 's - buff , in which every one caught the right person in the most singular way , and all agreed as they went home in the moonlight that it had been an unusually jolly meeting ."
"So the fairy play woke the sleeping beauty that lies in all of us , and makes us lovely when we rouse it with a kiss of unselfish good-will , for , though the girls did not know it then , they had adorned themselves with pearls more precious than the waxen ones they decked their Princess in ."
Chapter XI .
"`` Down Brakes '' The greatest people have their weak points , and the best-behaved boys now and then yield to temptation and get into trouble , as everybody knows ."
Take me in straight or I 'll break your arm . ''
"And he gave it , as he spoke , a wrench that made me cry out ."
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` it is for yourself I mean ."
The captain is not what he used to be .
He sits with a drawn cutlass .
"Another gentleman -- '' `` Come , now , march , '' interrupted he ; and I never heard a voice so cruel , and cold , and ugly as that blind man 's ."
"It cowed me more than the pain , and I began to obey him at once , walking straight in at the door and towards the parlour , where our sick old buccaneer was sitting , dazed with rum ."
"The blind man clung close to me , holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry ."
"`` Lead me straight up to him , and when I 'm in view , cry out , ` Here 's a friend for you , Bill . '"
"If you do n't , I 'll do this , '' and with that he gave me a twitch that I thought would have made me faint ."
"Between this and that , I was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of the captain , and as I opened the parlour door , cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice ."
"The poor captain raised his eyes , and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober ."
The expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness .
"He made a movement to rise , but I do not believe he had enough force left in his body ."
"`` Now , Bill , sit where you are , '' said the beggar ."
"`` If I ca n't see , I can hear a finger stirring ."
Business is business .
Hold out your left hand .
"Boy , take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right . ''"
"We both obeyed him to the letter , and I saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain 's , which closed upon it instantly ."
"`` And now that 's done , '' said the blind man ; and at the words he suddenly left hold of me , and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness , skipped out of the parlour and into the road , where , as I still stood motionless , I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance ."
"It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our senses , but at length , and about at the same moment , I released his wrist , which I was still holding , and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm ."
`` Ten o'clock ! ''
he cried .
`` Six hours .
"We 'll do them yet , '' and he sprang to his feet ."
"Even as he did so , he reeled , put his hand to his throat , stood swaying for a moment , and then , with a peculiar sound , fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor ."
"I ran to him at once , calling to my mother ."
But haste was all in vain .
The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy .
"It is a curious thing to understand , for I had certainly never liked the man , though of late I had begun to pity him , but as soon as I saw that he was dead , I burst into a flood of tears ."
"It was the second death I had known , and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart ."
"They rode as for their lives , in complete disorder ; some of them were wounded ; riderless horses galloped at their side with bloody saddles ."
They were plainly fugitives from the great battle .
"The noise of their passage had scarce begun to die away towards Shoreby , before fresh hoofs came echoing in their wake , and another deserter clattered down the road ; this time a single rider and , by his splendid armour , a man of high degree ."
"Close after him there followed several baggage-waggons , fleeing at an ungainly canter , the drivers flailing at the horses as if for life ."
These must have run early in the day ; but their cowardice was not to save them .
"For just before they came abreast of where the lads stood wondering , a man in hacked armour , and seemingly beside himself with fury , overtook the waggons , and with the truncheon of a sword , began to cut the drivers down ."
"Some leaped from their places and plunged into the wood ; the others he sabred as they sat , cursing them the while for cowards in a voice that was scarce human ."
"All this time the noise in the distance had continued to increase ; the rumble of carts , the clatter of horses , the cries of men , a great , confused rumour , came swelling on the wind ; and it was plain that the rout of a whole army was pouring , like an inundation , down the road ."
Dick stood sombre .
"He had meant to follow the highway till the turn for Holywood , and now he had to change his plan ."
"But above all , he had recognised the colours of Earl Risingham , and he knew that the battle had gone finally against the rose of Lancaster ."
"Had Sir Daniel joined , and was he now a fugitive and ruined ?"
"or had he deserted to the side of York , and was he forfeit to honour ?"
It was an ugly choice .
"`` Come , '' he said , sternly ; and , turning on his heel , he began to walk forward through the grove , with Matcham limping in his rear ."
For some time they continued to thread the forest in silence .
It was now growing late ; the sun was setting in the plain beyond Kettley ; the tree-tops overhead glowed golden ; but the shadows had begun to grow darker and the chill of the night to fall .
`` If there were anything to eat ! ''
"cried Dick , suddenly , pausing as he spoke ."
Matcham sat down and began to weep .
"`` Ye can weep for your own supper , but when it was to save men 's lives , your heart was hard enough , '' said Dick , contemptuously ."
"`` Y ' ` ave seven deaths upon your conscience , Master John ; I 'll ne'er forgive you that . ''"
`` Conscience ! ''
"cried Matcham , looking fiercely up ."
`` Mine !
And ye have the man 's red blood upon your dagger !
"And wherefore did ye slay him , the poor soul ?"
"He drew his arrow , but he let not fly ; he held you in his hand , and spared you !"
"'T is as brave to kill a kitten , as a man that not defends himself . ''"
Dick was struck dumb .
`` I slew him fair .
"I ran me in upon his bow , '' he cried ."
"The little wild creatures peeped at him from beneath the bushes , and he nodded and smiled , and wished them ` Good-morning . '"
After he had been walking for some time he met an old white-bearded man who was coming along the footpath .
"The boy would not step aside , and the man was determined not to do so either , so they ran against one another with a bump ."
"` It seems to me , ' said the old fellow , ` that a boy should give way to an old man . '"
"` The path is for me as well as for you , ' answered young Hans saucily , for he had never been taught politeness ."
"` Well , that 's true enough , ' answered the other mildly ."
` And where are you going ? ' '
"I am going into service , ' said Hans ."
"` Then you can come and serve me , ' replied the man ."
"Well , Hans could do that ; but what would his wages be ?"
"` Two pounds a year , and nothing to do but keep some rooms clean , ' said the new-comer ."
"This seemed to Hans to be easy enough ; so he agreed to enter the old man 's service , and they set out together ."
"On their way they crossed a deep valley and came to a mountain , where the man opened a trapdoor , and bidding Hans follow him , he crept in and began to go down a long flight of steps ."
When they got to the bottom Hans saw a large number of rooms lit by many lamps and full of beautiful things .
While he was looking round the old man said to him : ` Now you know what you have to do .
"You must keep these rooms clean , and strew sand on the floor every day ."
"Here is a table where you will always find food and drink , and there is your bed ."
"You see there are a great many suits of clothes hanging on the wall , and you may wear any you please ; but remember that you are never to open this locked door ."
If you do ill will befall you .
"Farewell , for I am going away again and can not tell when I may return ."
"No sooner had the old man disappeared than Hans sat down to a good meal , and after that went to bed and slept until the morning ."
"At first he could not remember what had happened to him , but by-and-by he jumped up and went into all the rooms , which he examined carefully ."
"` How foolish to bid me to put sand on the floors , ' he thought , ` when there is nobody here by myself !"
I shall do nothing of the sort . '
"And so he shut the doors quickly , and only cleaned and set in order his own room ."
"And after the first few days he felt that that was unnecessary too , because no one came there to see if the rooms where clean or not ."
"At last he did no work at all , but just sat and wondered what was behind the locked door , till he determined to go and look for himself ."
The key turned easily in the lock .
"Hans entered , half frightened at what he was doing , and the first thing he beheld was a heap of bones ."
That was not very cheerful ; and he was just going out again when his eye fell on a shelf of books .
"Here was a good way of passing the time , he thought , for he was fond of reading , and he took one of the books from the shelf ."
"It was all about magic , and told you how you could change yourself into anything in the world you liked ."
I never expected this !
I must stay with the student . '
"The little fellow thought it over , for he was a sensible Goblin ."
"Then he sighed , ` The student has no jam ! '"
And on that he went down to the grocer again .
"And it was a good thing that he did go back , for the tub had nearly worn out the tongue ."
"It had read everything that was inside it , on the one side , and was just going to turn itself round and read from the other side when the Goblin came in and returned the tongue to its owner ."
"But the whole shop , from the till down to the shavings , from that night changed their opinion of the tub , and they looked up to it , and had such faith in it that they were under the impression that when the grocer read the art and drama critiques out of the paper in the evenings , it all came from the tub ."
But the Goblin could no longer sit quietly listening to the wisdom and intellect downstairs .
"No , as soon as the light shone in the evening from the attic it seemed to him as though its beams were strong ropes dragging him up , and he had to go and peep through the key-hole ."
"There he felt the sort of feeling we have looking at the great rolling sea in a storm , and he burst into tears ."
"He could not himself say why he wept , but in spite of his tears he felt quite happy ."
"How beautiful it must be to sit under that tree with the student , but that he could not do ; he had to content himself with the key-hole and be happy there !"
"There he stood out on the cold landing , the autumn wind blowing through the cracks of the floor ."
"It was cold -- very cold , but he first found it out when the light in the attic was put out and the music in the wood died away ."
Ah !
"then it froze him , and he crept down again into his warm corner ; there it was comfortable and cosy ."
"When Christmas came , and with it the jam with the large lump of butter , ah !"
then the grocer was first with him .
"But in the middle of the night the Goblin awoke , hearing a great noise and knocking against the shutters -- people hammering from outside ."
The watchman was blowing his horn : a great fire had broken out ; the whole town was in flames .
Was it in the house ?
or was it at a neighbour 's ?
Where was it ?
The alarm increased .
The grocer 's wife was so terrified that she took her gold earrings out of her ears and put them in her pocket in order to save something .
The grocer seized his account books .
and the maid her black silk dress .
"Everyone wanted to save his most valuable possession ; so did the Goblin , and in a few leaps he was up the stairs and in the student 's room ."
He was standing quietly by the open window looking at the fire that was burning in the neighbour 's house just opposite .
"The Goblin seized the book lying on the table , put it in his red cap , and clasped it with both hands ."
"The best treasure in the house was saved , and he climbed out on to the roof with it -- on to the chimney ."
"I was dead weary , deadly sick and full of pains and shiverings ; the chill of the wind went through me , and the sound of it confused my ears ."
In this poor state I had to bear from my companion something in the nature of a persecution .
"He spoke a good deal , and never without a taunt ."
`` Whig '' was the best name he had to give me .
"`` Here , '' he would say , `` here 's a dub for ye to jump , my Whiggie !"
I ken you 're a fine jumper ! ''
And so on ; all the time with a gibing voice and face .
"I knew it was my own doing , and no one else 's ; but I was too miserable to repent ."
"I felt I could drag myself but little farther ; pretty soon , I must lie down and die on these wet mountains like a sheep or a fox , and my bones must whiten there like the bones of a beast ."
"My head was light perhaps ; but I began to love the prospect , I began to glory in the thought of such a death , alone in the desert , with the wild eagles besieging my last moments ."
"Alan would repent then , I thought ; he would remember , when I was dead , how much he owed me , and the remembrance would be torture ."
"So I went like a sick , silly , and bad-hearted schoolboy , feeding my anger against a fellow-man , when I would have been better on my knees , crying on God for mercy ."
"And at each of Alan 's taunts , I hugged myself ."
`` Ah ! ''
"thinks I to myself , `` I have a better taunt in readiness ; when I lie down and die , you will feel it like a buffet in your face ; ah , what a revenge !"
"ah , how you will regret your ingratitude and cruelty ! ''"
"All the while , I was growing worse and worse ."
"Once I had fallen , my leg simply doubling under me , and this had struck Alan for the moment ; but I was afoot so briskly , and set off again with such a natural manner , that he soon forgot the incident ."
"Flushes of heat went over me , and then spasms of shuddering ."
The stitch in my side was hardly bearable .
"At last I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther : and with that , there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with Alan , let my anger blaze , and be done with my life in a more sudden manner ."
He had just called me `` Whig . ''
I stopped .
"`` Mr. Stewart , '' said I , in a voice that quivered like a fiddle-string , `` you are older than I am , and should know your manners ."
Do you think it either very wise or very witty to cast my politics in my teeth ?
"I thought , where folk differed , it was the part of gentlemen to differ civilly ; and if I did not , I may tell you I could find a better taunt than some of yours . ''"
"Alan had stopped opposite to me , his hat cocked , his hands in his breeches pockets , his head a little on one side ."
"He listened , smiling evilly , as I could see by the starlight ; and when I had done he began to whistle a Jacobite air ."
"It was the air made in mockery of General Cope 's defeat at Preston Pans : `` Hey , Johnnie Cope , are ye waukin ' yet ?"
And are your drums a-beatin ' yet ? ''
"And it came in my mind that Alan , on the day of that battle , had been engaged upon the royal side ."
"`` Why do ye take that air , Mr. Stewart ? ''"
`` What can he do ?
He hath but a handful .
"Alack , if it were but to-morrow -- could I but keep a certain tryst an hour before noon to-morrow -- all were , I think , otherwise ."
But now there is no help . ''
"`` Well , '' concluded Lawless , `` an ye will stand to it for my innocence , I will stand to it for yours , and that stoutly ."
"It shall naught avail us ; but an I be to hang , it shall not be for lack of swearing . ''"
"And then , while Dick gave himself over to his reflections , the old rogue curled himself down into a corner , pulled his monkish hood about his face , and composed himself to sleep ."
"Soon he was loudly snoring , so utterly had his long life of hardship and adventure blunted the sense of apprehension ."
"It was long after noon , and the day was already failing , before the door was opened and Dick taken forth and led up-stairs to where , in a warm cabinet , Earl Risingham sat musing over the fire ."
On his captive 's entrance he looked up .
"`` Sir , '' he said , `` I knew your father , who was a man of honour , and this inclineth me to be the more lenient ; but I may not hide from you that heavy charges lie against your character ."
"Ye do consort with murderers and robbers ; upon a clear probation ye have carried war against the king 's peace ; ye are suspected to have piratically seized upon a ship ; ye are found skulking with a counterfeit presentment in your enemy 's house ; a man is slain that very evening -- '' `` An it like you , my lord , '' Dick interposed , `` I will at once avow my guilt , such as it is ."
I slew this fellow Rutter ; and to the proof '' -- searching in his bosom -- `` here is a letter from his wallet . ''
"Lord Risingham took the letter , and opened and read it twice ."
`` Ye have read this ? ''
he inquired .
"`` I have read it , '' answered Dick ."
`` Are ye for York or Lancaster ? ''
the earl demanded .
"`` My lord , it was but a little while back that I was asked that question , and knew not how to answer it , '' said Dick ; `` but having answered once , I will not vary ."
"My lord , I am for York . ''"
The earl nodded approvingly .
"`` Honestly replied , '' he said ."
"`` But wherefore , then , deliver me this letter ? ''"
"`` Nay , but against traitors , my lord , are not all sides arrayed ? ''"
cried Dick .
"`` I would they were , young gentleman , '' returned the earl ; `` and I do at least approve your saying ."
"There is more youth than guile in you , I do perceive ; and were not Sir Daniel a mighty man upon our side , I were half-tempted to espouse your quarrel ."
"For I have inquired , and it appears ye have been hardly dealt with , and have much excuse ."
"But look ye , sir , I am , before all else , a leader in the queen 's interest ; and though by nature a just man , as I believe , and leaning even to the excess of mercy , yet must I order my goings for my party 's interest , and , to keep Sir Daniel , I would go far about . ''"
"`` My lord , '' returned Dick , `` ye will think me very bold to counsel you ; but do ye count upon Sir Daniel 's faith ?"
Methought he had changed sides intolerably often . ''
"About a mile from Kettley , Dick came to one such break in the plain line of causeway , where the reeds and willows grew dispersedly like little islands and confused the eye ."
"The gap , besides , was more than usually long ; it was a place where any stranger might come readily to mischief ; and Dick bethought him , with something like a pang , of the lad whom he had so imperfectly directed ."
"As for himself , one look backward to where the windmill sails were turning black against the blue of heaven -- one look forward to the high ground of Tunstall Forest , and he was sufficiently directed and held straight on , the water washing to his horse 's knees , as safe as on a highway ."
"Half-way across , and when he had already sighted the path rising high and dry upon the farther side , he was aware of a great splashing on his right , and saw a grey horse , sunk to its belly in the mud , and still spasmodically struggling ."
"Instantly , as though it had divined the neighbourhood of help , the poor beast began to neigh most piercingly ."
"It rolled , meanwhile , a blood-shot eye , insane with terror ; and as it sprawled wallowing in the quag , clouds of stinging insects rose and buzzed about it in the air ."
`` Alack ! ''
"thought Dick , `` can the poor lad have perished ?"
"There is his horse , for certain -- a brave grey !"
"Nay , comrade , if thou criest to me so piteously , I will do all man can to help thee ."
Shalt not lie there to drown by inches ! ''
"And he made ready his crossbow , and put a quarrel through the creature 's head ."
"Dick rode on after this act of rugged mercy , somewhat sobered in spirit , and looking closely about him for any sign of his less happy predecessor in the way ."
"`` I would I had dared to tell him further , '' he thought ; `` for I fear he has miscarried in the slough . ''"
"And just as he was so thinking , a voice cried upon his name from the causeway side , and , looking over his shoulder , he saw the lad 's face peering from a clump of reeds ."
`` Are ye there ? ''
"he said , reining in ."
`` Ye lay so close among the reeds that I had passed you by .
"I saw your horse bemired , and put him from his agony ; which , by my sooth !"
"an ye had been a more merciful rider , ye had done yourself ."
But come forth out of your hiding .
Here be none to trouble you . ''
"`` Nay , good boy , I have no arms , nor skill to use them if I had , '' replied the other , stepping forth upon the pathway ."
`` Why call me ` boy ' ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` Y ' are not , I trow , the elder of us twain . ''"
"`` Good Master Shelton , '' said the other , `` prithee forgive me ."
I have none the least intention to offend .
"Rather I would in every way beseech your gentleness and favour , for I am now worse bested than ever , having lost my way , my cloak , and my poor horse ."
"To have a riding-rod and spurs , and never a horse to sit upon !"
"And before all , '' he added , looking ruefully upon his clothes -- `` before all , to be so sorrily besmirched ! ''"
`` Tut ! ''
Mr. Pryor 's once ruddy face was ashen .
But he turned at bay .
"`` I 'll have the law on you for this , '' he gasped ."
"`` Do -- do , '' roared Norman , making another rush ."
But Mr. Pryor was gone .
He had no desire to fall a second time into the hands of an avenging militarist .
"Norman turned to the platform for one graceless , triumphant moment ."
"`` Do n't look so flabbergasted , parsons , '' he boomed ."
`` You could n't do it -- nobody would expect it of the cloth -- but somebody had to do it .
You know you 're glad I threw him out -- he could n't be let go on yammering and yodelling and yawping sedition and treason .
Sedition and treason -- somebody had to deal with it .
I was born for this hour -- I 've had my innings in church at last .
I can sit quiet for another sixty years now !
"Go ahead with your meeting , parsons ."
I reckon you wo n't be troubled with any more pacifist prayers . ''
But the spirit of devotion and reverence had fled .
Both ministers realized it and realized that the only thing to do was to close the meeting quietly and let the excited people go .
"Mr. Meredith addressed a few earnest words to the boys in khaki -- which probably saved Mr. Pryor 's windows from a second onslaught -- and Mr. Arnold pronounced an incongruous benediction , at least he felt it was incongruous , for he could not at once banish from his memory the sight of gigantic Norman Douglas shaking the fat , pompous little Whiskers-on-the-moon as a huge mastiff might shake an overgrown puppy ."
And he knew that the same picture was in everybody 's mind .
Altogether the union prayer-meeting could hardly be called an unqualified success .
But it was remembered in Glen St. Mary when scores of orthodox and undisturbed assemblies were totally forgotten .
"`` You will never , no , never , Mrs. Dr. dear , hear me call Norman Douglas a pagan again , '' said Susan when she reached home ."
`` If Ellen Douglas is not a proud woman this night she should be . ''
"`` Norman Douglas did a wholly indefensible thing , '' said the doctor ."
`` Pryor should have been let severely alone until the meeting was over .
"Then later on , his own minister and session should deal with him ."
That would have been the proper procedure .
"Norman 's performance was utterly improper and scandalous and outrageous ; but , by George , '' -- the doctor threw back his head and chuckled , `` by George , Anne-girl , it was satisfying . ''"
"CHAPTER XXI `` LOVE AFFAIRS ARE HORRIBLE '' Ingleside 20th June 1916 `` We have been so busy , and day after day has brought such exciting news , good and bad , that I have n't had time and composure to write in my diary for weeks ."
"I like to keep it up regularly , for father says a diary of the years of the war should be a very interesting thing to hand down to one 's children ."
"The trouble is , I like to write a few personal things in this blessed old book that might not be exactly what I 'd want my children to read ."
I feel that I shall be a far greater stickler for propriety in regard to them than I am for myself !
"`` Put up your swords , boys , '' cried the newcomer , `` this man is mine . ''"
Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter .
The others drew back and formed a ring around them .
"For long the two enemies looked at one another , Hook shuddering slightly , and Peter with the strange smile upon his face ."
"`` So , Pan , '' said Hook at last , `` this is all your doing . ''"
"`` Ay , James Hook , '' came the stern answer , `` it is all my doing . ''"
"`` Proud and insolent youth , '' said Hook , `` prepare to meet thy doom . ''"
"`` Dark and sinister man , '' Peter answered , `` have at thee . ''"
"Without more words they fell to , and for a space there was no advantage to either blade ."
"Peter was a superb swordsman , and parried with dazzling rapidity ; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe 's defence , but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead , and he could not drive the steel home ."
"Hook , scarcely his inferior in brilliancy , but not quite so nimble in wrist play , forced him back by the weight of his onset , hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust , taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio ; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again ."
"Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook , which all this time had been pawing the air ; but Peter doubled under it and , lunging fiercely , pierced him in the ribs ."
"At the sight of his own blood , whose peculiar colour , you remember , was offensive to him , the sword fell from Hook 's hand , and he was at Peter 's mercy ."
`` Now ! ''
"cried all the boys , but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited his opponent to pick up his sword ."
"Hook did so instantly , but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form ."
"Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him , but darker suspicions assailed him now ."
"`` Pan , who and what art thou ? ''"
he cried huskily .
"`` I 'm youth , I 'm joy , '' Peter answered at a venture , `` I 'm a little bird that has broken out of the egg . ''"
"This , of course , was nonsense ; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was , which is the very pinnacle of good form ."
"`` To ' t again , '' he cried despairingly ."
"He fought now like a human flail , and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it ; but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone ."
And again and again he darted in and pricked .
Hook was fighting now without hope .
That passionate breast no longer asked for life ; but for one boon it craved : to see Peter show bad form before it was cold forever .
Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it .
"`` In two minutes , '' he cried , `` the ship will be blown to pieces . ''"
"Now , now , he thought , true form will show ."
"But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands , and calmly flung it overboard ."
What sort of form was Hook himself showing ?
"Misguided man though he was , we may be glad , without sympathising with him , that in the end he was true to the traditions of his race ."
The name is DONnell and always has been .
"The woman is crazy , that 's what ."
"She has a pug dog she calls Queenie and it has its meals at the table along with the family , eating off a china plate ."
I 'd be afraid of a judgment if I was her .
"Thomas says Donnell himself is a sensible , hard-working man , but he had n't much gumption when he picked out a wife , that 's what . ''"
"VI All Sorts and Conditions of Men ... and women A September day on Prince Edward Island hills ; a crisp wind blowing up over the sand dunes from the sea ; a long red road , winding through fields and woods , now looping itself about a corner of thick set spruces , now threading a plantation of young maples with great feathery sheets of ferns beneath them , now dipping down into a hollow where a brook flashed out of the woods and into them again , now basking in open sunshine between ribbons of golden-rod and smoke-blue asters ; air athrill with the pipings of myriads of crickets , those glad little pensioners of the summer hills ; a plump brown pony ambling along the road ; two girls behind him , full to the lips with the simple , priceless joy of youth and life ."
"`` Oh , this is a day left over from Eden , is n't it , Diana ? ''"
... and Anne sighed for sheer happiness .
`` The air has magic in it .
"Look at the purple in the cup of the harvest valley , Diana ."
"And oh , do smell the dying fir !"
It 's coming up from that little sunny hollow where Mr. Eben Wright has been cutting fence poles .
Bliss is it on such a day to be alive ; but to smell dying fir is very heaven .
That 's two thirds Wordsworth and one third Anne Shirley .
"It does n't seem possible that there should be dying fir in heaven , does it ?"
And yet it does n't seem to me that heaven would be quite perfect if you could n't get a whiff of dead fir as you went through its woods .
Perhaps we 'll have the odor there without the death .
"Yes , I think that will be the way ."
That delicious aroma must be the souls of the firs ... and of course it will be just souls in heaven . ''
"`` Trees have n't souls , '' said practical Diana , `` but the smell of dead fir is certainly lovely ."
I 'm going to make a cushion and fill it with fir needles .
"You 'd better make one too , Anne . ''"
`` I think I shall ... and use it for my naps .
I 'd be certain to dream I was a dryad or a woodnymph then .
"But just this minute I 'm well content to be Anne Shirley , Avonlea schoolma'am , driving over a road like this on such a sweet , friendly day . ''"
"`` It 's a lovely day but we have anything but a lovely task before us , '' sighed Diana ."
"`` Why on earth did you offer to canvass this road , Anne ?"
"Almost all the cranks in Avonlea live along it , and we 'll probably be treated as if we were begging for ourselves ."
It 's the very worst road of all . ''
`` That is why I chose it .
Of course Gilbert and Fred would have taken this road if we had asked them .
"But you see , Diana , I feel myself responsible for the A.V.I.S. , since I was the first to suggest it , and it seems to me that I ought to do the most disagreeable things ."
"He was feeling stuffier and stuffier , and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose , but he pursued them with the vital question in vain ; the timid creatures ran from him , and even the Lancers , when he approached them up the Hump , turned swiftly into a side-walk , on the pretence that they saw him there ."
"-LSB- Illustration : A band of workmen , who were sawing down a toadstool , rushed away , leaving their tools behind them -RSB- Despairing of the fairies , he resolved to consult the birds , but now he remembered , as an odd thing , that all the birds on the weeping-beech had flown away when he alighted on it , and though this had not troubled him at the time , he saw its meaning now ."
Every living thing was shunning him .
Poor little Peter Pan !
"he sat down and cried , and even then he did not know that , for a bird , he was sitting on his wrong part ."
"It is a blessing that he did not know , for otherwise he would have lost faith in his power to fly , and the moment you doubt whether you can fly , you cease for ever to be able to do it ."
"The reason birds can fly and we ca n't is simply that they have perfect faith , for to have faith is to have wings ."
"Now , except by flying , no one can reach the island in the Serpentine , for the boats of humans are forbidden to land there , and there are stakes round it , standing up in the water , on each of which a bird-sentinel sits by day and night ."
"It was to the island that Peter now flew to put his strange case before old Solomon Caw , and he alighted on it with relief , much heartened to find himself at last at home , as the birds call the island ."
"All of them were asleep , including the sentinels , except Solomon , who was wide awake on one side , and he listened quietly to Peter 's adventures , and then told him their true meaning ."
"` Look at your nightgown , if you do n't believe me , ' Solomon said ; and with staring eyes Peter looked at his nightgown , and then at the sleeping birds ."
Not one of them wore anything .
` How many of your toes are thumbs ? '
"said Solomon a little cruelly , and Peter saw , to his consternation , that all his toes were fingers ."
The shock was so great that it drove away his cold .
"` Ruffle your feathers , ' said that grim old Solomon , and Peter tried most desperately hard to ruffle his feathers , but he had none ."
"Then he rose up , quaking , and for the first time since he stood on the window ledge , he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Put his strange case before old Solomon Caw -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- ' I think I shall go back to mother , ' he said , timidly ."
"` Good-bye , ' replied Solomon Caw with a queer look ."
But Peter hesitated .
` Why do n't you go ? '
the old one asked politely . '
"I suppose , ' said Peter huskily , ' I suppose I can still fly ? '"
You see he had lost faith .
` Poor little half-and-half ! '
"said Solomon , who was not really hard-hearted , ` you will never be able to fly again , not even on windy days ."
You must live here on the island always . '
` And never even go to the Kensington Gardens ? '
Peter asked tragically .
` How could you get across ? '
said Solomon .
"He promised very kindly , however , to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape ."
"asked Sally , all impatience to begin ."
"`` Shut the lower draught of the stove , so that the oven may heat ."
"Then wash your hands and get out the flour , sugar , salt , butter , and cinnamon ."
"See if the pie-board is clean , and pare your apple ready to put in . ''"
"Daisy got things together with as little noise and spilling as could be expected , from so young a cook ."
"`` I really do n't know how to measure for such tiny pies ; I must guess at it , and if these do n't succeed , we must try again , '' said Mrs. Jo , looking rather perplexed , and very much amused with the small concern before her ."
"`` Take that little pan full of flour , put in a pinch of salt , and then rub in as much butter as will go on that plate ."
"Always remember to put your dry things together first , and then the wet ."
It mixes better so . ''
`` I know how ; I saw Asia do it .
Do n't I butter the pie plates too ?
"She did , the first thing , '' said Daisy , whisking the flour about at a great rate ."
`` Quite right !
"I do believe you have a gift for cooking , you take to it so cleverly , '' said Aunt Jo , approvingly ."
"`` Now a dash of cold water , just enough to wet it ; then scatter some flour on the board , work in a little , and roll the paste out ; yes , that 's the way ."
"Now put dabs of butter all over it , and roll it out again ."
"We wo n't have our pastry very rich , or the dolls will get dyspeptic . ''"
"Daisy laughed at the idea , and scattered the dabs with a liberal hand ."
"Then she rolled and rolled with her delightful little pin , and having got her paste ready proceeded to cover the plates with it ."
"Next the apple was sliced in , sugar and cinnamon lavishly sprinkled over it , and then the top crust put on with breathless care ."
"`` I always wanted to cut them round , and Asia never would let me ."
How nice it is to do it all my ownty donty self ! ''
"said Daisy , as the little knife went clipping round the doll 's plate poised on her hand ."
"All cooks , even the best , meet with mishaps sometimes , and Sally 's first one occurred then , for the knife went so fast that the plate slipped , turned a somersault in the air , and landed the dear little pie upside down on the floor ."
"Sally screamed , Mrs. Jo laughed , Teddy scrambled to get it , and for a moment confusion reigned in the new kitchen ."
"`` It did n't spill or break , because I pinched the edges together so hard ; it is n't hurt a bit , so I 'll prick holes in it , and then it will be ready , '' said Sally , picking up the capsized treasure and putting it into shape with a child-like disregard of the dust it had gathered in its fall ."
"`` My new cook has a good temper , I see , and that is such a comfort , '' said Mrs. Jo ."
"`` Now open the jar of strawberry jam , fill the uncovered pie , and put some strips of paste over the top as Asia does . ''"
"`` I 'll make a D in the middle , and have zigzags all round , that will be so interesting when I come to eat it , '' said Sally , loading the pie with quirls and flourishes that would have driven a real pastry cook wild ."
`` Now I put them in ! ''
"she exclaimed ; when the last grimy knob had been carefully planted in the red field of jam , and with an air of triumph she shut them into the little oven ."
`` Clear up your things ; a good cook never lets her utensils collect .
Excuse me for a moment . ''
"Rilla flew upstairs , wishing quite frankly that soup tureens had never been invented ."
"But when Jims , at sight of her , lifted his little arms entreatingly and swallowed several sobs , with tears rolling down his cheeks , resentment went out of her heart ."
"After all , the poor darling was frightened ."
She picked him up gently and rocked him soothingly until his sobs ceased and his eyes closed .
Then she essayed to lay him down in his crib .
Jims opened his eyes and shrieked a protest .
This performance was repeated twice .
Rilla grew desperate .
She could n't leave Ken down there alone any longer -- she had been away nearly half an hour already .
"With a resigned air she marched downstairs , carrying Jims , and sat down on the veranda ."
"It was , no doubt , a ridiculous thing to sit and cuddle a contrary war-baby when your best young man was making his farewell call , but there was nothing else to be done ."
Jims was supremely happy .
He kicked his little pink-soled feet rapturously out under his white nighty and gave one of his rare laughs .
He was beginning to be a very pretty baby ; his golden hair curled in silken ringlets all over his little round head and his eyes were beautiful .
"`` He 's a decorative kiddy all right , is n't he ? ''"
said Ken .
"`` His looks are very well , '' said Rilla , bitterly , as if to imply that they were much the best of him ."
"Jims , being an astute infant , sensed trouble in the atmosphere and realized that it was up to him to clear it away ."
"He turned his face up to Rilla , smiled adorably and said , clearly and beguilingly , `` Will -- Will . ''"
It was the very first time he had spoken a word or tried to speak .
Rilla was so delighted that she forgot her grudge against him .
She forgave him with a hug and kiss .
"Jims , understanding that he was restored to favour , cuddled down against her just where a gleam of light from the lamp in the living-room struck across his hair and turned it into a halo of gold against her breast ."
"Kenneth sat very still and silent , looking at Rilla -- at the delicate , girlish silhouette of her , her long lashes , her dented lip , her adorable chin ."
"In the dim moonlight , as she sat with her head bent a little over Jims , the lamplight glinting on her pearls until they glistened like a slender nimbus , he thought she looked exactly like the Madonna that hung over his mother 's desk at home ."
He carried that picture of her in his heart to the horror of the battlefields of France .
"He had had a strong fancy for Rilla Blythe ever since the night of the Four Winds dance ; but it was when he saw her there , with little Jims in her arms , that he loved her and realized it ."
"And all the while , poor Rilla was sitting , disappointed and humiliated , feeling that her last evening with Ken was spoiled and wondering why things always had to go so contrarily outside of books ."
She felt too absurd to try to talk .
"Evidently Ken was completely disgusted , too , since he was sitting there in such stony silence ."
Hope revived momentarily when Jims went so thoroughly asleep that she thought it would be safe to lay him down on the couch in the living-room .
"` It is behind the oven , ' answered she ."
And again was silence .
"` Mother , dear mother , ' said the young man at last , ' I am almost afraid to ask you ; but I really have grown so stupid of late ."
Where did I hide my own money ? '
"But at this question the old woman flew into a passion , and vowed that if she could find a rod she would bring his memory back to him ."
"Luckily , no rod was within her reach , and the Sodno managed , after a little , to coax her back into good humour , and at length she told him that the youngest Stalo had buried his treasure under the very place where she was sitting ."
"` Dear mother , ' said Lyman , who had come in unseen , and was kneeling in front of the fire ."
"` Dear mother , do you know who it is you have been talking with ? '"
"The old woman started , but answered quietly : ` It is a Sodno , I suppose ? '"
"` You have guessed right , ' replied Lyma ."
"The mother of the Stalos looked round for her iron cane , which she always used to kill her victims , but it was not there , for Lyma had put it in the fire ."
` Where is my iron cane ? '
asked the old woman .
` There ! '
"answered Lyma , pointing to the flames ."
"The old woman sprang forwards and seized it , but her clothes caught fire , and in a few minutes she was burned to ashes ."
"So the Sodno brothers found the treasure , and they carried it , and their sister and the reindeer , to their own home , and were the richest men in all Lapland ."
"Andras Baive -LSB- From Lapplandische Marchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-"
Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and swift of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near him if they were running races in the summer evenings .
"The people of Vadso were very proud of their champion , and thought that there was no one like him in the world , till , by-and-by , it came to their ears that there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp , Andras Baive by name , who was said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff ."
"Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that , and declared that if it made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense , why , let them !"
"The winter was long and cold , and the thoughts of the villagers were much busier with wolves than with Andras Baive , when suddenly , on a frosty day , he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso ."
"The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength , and at once went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour ."
"As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay upon the shore , and his face shone with pleasure ."
"` That is the very thing , ' laughed he , ' I will make him jump over that boat . '"
"Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge , and they soon settled the terms of the wager ."
"He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel was to be the winner , and would get a large sum of money as the prize ."
"So , followed by many of the villagers , the two men walked down to the sea ."
"An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play , and to hold the stakes , and Andras , as the stranger was told to jump first ."
"Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting place , he ran forward , with his head well thrown back , and cleared the boat with a mighty bound ."
"The lookers-on cheered him , and indeed he well deserve it ; but they waited anxiously all the same to see what the bailiff would do ."
"On he came , taller than Andras by several inches , but heavier of build ."
"Sharp as must have been his annoyance , Silver had the strength of mind to hide it ."
"`` Yes , sir , '' said he , `` this is the spot , to be sure , and very prettily drawed out ."
"Who might have done that , I wonder ?"
"The pirates were too ignorant , I reckon ."
"Aye , here it is : ` Capt. Kidd 's Anchorage ' -- just the name my shipmate called it ."
"There 's a strong current runs along the south , and then away nor ` ard up the west coast ."
"Right you was , sir , '' says he , `` to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island ."
"Leastways , if such was your intention as to enter and careen , and there ai n't no better place for that in these waters . ''"
"`` Thank you , my man , '' says Captain Smollett ."
`` I 'll ask you later on to give us a help .
You may go . ''
"I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island , and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself ."
"He did not know , to be sure , that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel , and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty , duplicity , and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm ."
"`` Ah , '' says he , `` this here is a sweet spot , this island -- a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on ."
"You 'll bathe , and you 'll climb trees , and you 'll hunt goats , you will ; and you 'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself ."
"Why , it makes me young again ."
"I was going to forget my timber leg , I was ."
"It 's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes , and you may lay to that ."
"When you want to go a bit of exploring , you just ask old John , and he 'll put up a snack for you to take along . ''"
"And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder , he hobbled off forward and went below ."
"Captain Smollett , the squire , and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck , and anxious as I was to tell them my story , I durst not interrupt them openly ."
"While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse , Dr. Livesey called me to his side ."
"He had left his pipe below , and being a slave to tobacco , had meant that I should fetch it ; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard , I broke immediately , `` Doctor , let me speak ."
"Get the captain and squire down to the cabin , and then make some pretence to send for me ."
I have terrible news . ''
"The doctor changed countenance a little , but next moment he was master of himself ."
"`` Thank you , Jim , '' said he quite loudly , `` that was all I wanted to know , '' as if he had asked me a question ."
And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two .
"They spoke together for a little , and though none of them started , or raised his voice , or so much as whistled , it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request , for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson , and all hands were piped on deck ."
"`` My lads , '' said Captain Smollett , `` I 've a word to say to you ."
This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for .
"Mr. Trelawney , being a very open-handed gentleman , as we all know , has just asked me a word or two , and as I was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty , alow and aloft , as I never ask to see it done better , why , he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck , and you 'll have grog served out for you to drink OUR health and luck ."
"If she said ` Peter ' again , he meant to cry ` Mother ' and run to her ."
"But she spoke no more , she made little moans only , and when he next peeped at her she was once more asleep , with tears on her face ."
"It made Peter very miserable , and what do you think was the first thing he did ?"
"Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed , he played a beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe ."
"He had made it up himself out of the way she said ` Peter , ' and he never stopped playing until she looked happy ."
"He thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening her to hear her say , ' O Peter , how exquisitely you play ! '"
"However , as she now seemed comfortable , he again cast looks at the window ."
You must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back .
"He had quite decided to be his mother 's boy , but hesitated about beginning to-night ."
It was the second wish which troubled him .
"He no longer meant to make it a wish to be a bird , but not to ask for a second wish seemed wasteful , and , of course , he could not ask for it without returning to the fairies ."
"Also , if he put off asking for his wish too long it might go bad ."
He asked himself if he had not been hard-hearted to fly away without saying good-bye to Solomon . '
"I should like awfully to sail in my boat just once more , ' he said wistfully to his sleeping mother ."
He quite argued with her as if she could hear him .
"` It would be so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure , ' he said coaxingly . '"
"I promise to come back , ' he said solemnly , and meant it , too ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Butter is got from the roots of old trees -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- And in the end , you know , he flew away ."
"Twice he came back from the window , wanting to kiss his mother , but he feared the delight of it might waken her , so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe , and then he flew back to the Gardens ."
"Many nights , and even months , passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish ; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long ."
"One reason was that he had so many good-byes to say , not only to his particular friends , but to a hundred favourite spots ."
"Then he had his last sail , and his very last sail , and his last sail of all , and so on ."
"Again , a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour ; and another comfortable reason was that , after all , there was no hurry , for his mother would never weary of waiting for him ."
"This last reason displeased old Solomon , for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate ."
"Solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work , such as ` Never put off laying to-day because you can lay to-morrow , ' and ` In this world there are no second chances , ' and yet here was Peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it ."
"The birds pointed this out to each other , and fell into lazy habits ."
"But , mind you , though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother , he was quite decided to go back ."
The best proof of this was his caution with the fairies .
"They were most anxious that he should remain in the Gardens to play to them , and to bring this to pass they tried to trick him into making such a remark as ' I wish the grass was not so wet , ' and some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry , ' I do wish you would keep time ! '"
Then they would have said that this was his second wish .
"But he smoked their design , and though on occasions he began , ' I wish -- ' he always stopped in time ."
"So when at last he said to them bravely , ' I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always , ' they had to tickle his shoulders and let him go ."
"That was all ; but brief as it was , and to me incomprehensible , it filled the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight ."
"`` Livesey , '' said the squire , `` you will give up this wretched practice at once ."
Tomorrow I start for Bristol .
In three weeks ' time -- three weeks !
"-- two weeks -- ten days -- we 'll have the best ship , sir , and the choicest crew in England ."
Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy .
"You 'll make a famous cabin-boy , Hawkins ."
"You , Livesey , are ship 's doctor ; I am admiral ."
"We 'll take Redruth , Joyce , and Hunter ."
"We 'll have favourable winds , a quick passage , and not the least difficulty in finding the spot , and money to eat , to roll in , to play duck and drake with ever after . ''"
"`` Trelawney , '' said the doctor , `` I 'll go with you ; and I 'll go bail for it , so will Jim , and be a credit to the undertaking ."
There 's only one man I 'm afraid of . ''
`` And who 's that ? ''
cried the squire .
"`` Name the dog , sir ! ''"
"`` You , '' replied the doctor ; `` for you can not hold your tongue ."
We are not the only men who know of this paper .
"These fellows who attacked the inn tonight -- bold , desperate blades , for sure -- and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger , and more , I dare say , not far off , are , one and all , through thick and thin , bound that they 'll get that money ."
We must none of us go alone till we get to sea .
"Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile ; you 'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol , and from first to last , not one of us must breathe a word of what we 've found . ''"
"`` Livesey , '' returned the squire , `` you are always in the right of it ."
I 'll be as silent as the grave . ''
"PART TWO -- The Sea-cook 7 I Go to Bristol IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea , and none of our first plans -- not even Dr. Livesey 's , of keeping me beside him -- could be carried out as we intended ."
"The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice ; the squire was hard at work at Bristol ; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth , the gamekeeper , almost a prisoner , but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures ."
"I brooded by the hour together over the map , all the details of which I well remembered ."
"Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper 's room , I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction ; I explored every acre of its surface ; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass , and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects ."
"Sometimes the isle was thick with savages , with whom we fought , sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us , but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures ."
"So the weeks passed on , till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey , with this addition , `` To be opened , in the case of his absence , by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins . ''"
"Obeying this order , we found , or rather I found -- for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print -- the following important news : Old Anchor Inn , Bristol , March 1 , 17 -- Dear Livesey -- As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London , I send this in double to both places ."
The ship is bought and fitted .
"She lies at anchor , ready for sea ."
"You never imagined a sweeter schooner -- a child might sail her -- two hundred tons ; name , HISPANIOLA ."
"When that is done , come to us and we will give you further directions . ' '"
"I will obey you in everything , dear brothers , ' answered Lyman ; and so she did ."
"It had happened that on this very evening the Stalos had driven in some of the reindeer from the pasture , and had tied them up to the wall of the house so that they might be handy to kill for next day 's dinner ."
"The two Sodnos had seen what they were doing , and where the beasts were secured ; so , at midnight , when all was still , they crept down from their tree and seized the reindeer by the horns which were locked together ."
"The animals were frightened , and began to neigh and kick , as if they were fighting together , and the noise became so great that even the eldest Stalo was awakened by it , and that was a thing which had never occurred before ."
"Raising himself in his bed , he called to his youngest brother to go out and separate the reindeer or they would certainly kill themselves ."
"The young Stalo did as he was bid , and left the house ; but no sooner was he out of the door than he was stabbed to the heart by one of the Sodnos , and fell without a groan ."
"Then they went back to worry the reindeer , and the noise became as great as ever , and a second time the Stalo awoke ."
"` The boy does not seem to be able to part the beasts , ' he cried to his second brother ; ` go and help him , or I shall never get to sleep . '"
"So the brother went , and in an instant was struck dead as he left the house by the sword of the eldest Sodno ."
"The Stalo waited in bed a little longer for things to get quiet , but as the clatter of the reindeer 's horns was as bad as ever , he rose angrily from his bed muttering to himself : ` It is extraordinary that they can not unlock themselves ; but as no one else seems able to help them I suppose I must go and do it . '"
"Rubbing his eyes , he stood up on the floor and stretched his great arms and gave a yawn which shook the walls ."
"The Sodnos heard it below , and posted themselves , one at the big door and one at the little door at the back , for they did not know what their enemy would come out at ."
"The Stalo put out his hand to take his iron mantle from the bed , where it always lay , but the mantle was no there ."
"He wondered where it could be , and who could have moved it , and after searching through all the rooms , he found it hanging over the kitchen fire ."
"But the first touch burnt him so badly that he let it alone , and went with nothing , except a stick in his hand , through the back door ."
"The young Sodno was standing ready for him , and as the Stalo passed the threshold struck him such a blow on the head that he rolled over with a crash and never stirred again ."
"The two Sodnos did not trouble about him , but quickly stripped the younger Stalos of their clothes , in which they dressed themselves ."
Then they sat still till the dawn should break and they could find out from the Stalos ' mother where the treasure was hidden .
With the first rays of the sun the young Sodno went upstairs and entered the old woman 's room .
"She was already up and dressed , and sitting by the window knitting , and the young man crept in softly and crouched down on the floor , laying his head on her lap ."
"For a while he kept silence , then he whispered gently : ` Tell me , dear mother , where did my eldest brother conceal his riches ? '"
` What a strange question !
"Surely you must know , ' answered she ."
"` No , I have forgotten ; my memory is so bad . '"
"` He dug a hole under the doorstep and placed it there , ' said she ."
And there was another pause .
By-and-by the Sodno asked again : ` And where may my second brother 's money be ? '
` Do n't you know that either ? '
cried the mother in surprise .
"` Oh , yes ; I did once ."
But since I fell upon my head I can remember nothing . '
`` B ... b ... but m ... m ... miss ... th ... th ... they 're ... '' gasped Joe in desperation .
"`` Joseph , are you going to obey me or are you NOT ? ''"
said Anne .
A bolder and more self-possessed lad than Joe Sloane would have been overawed by her tone and the dangerous flash of her eyes .
This was a new Anne whom none of her pupils had ever seen before .
"Joe , with an agonized glance at St. Clair , went to the stove , opened the big , square front door , and threw the blue and white parcel in , before St. Clair , who had sprung to his feet , could utter a word ."
Then he dodged back just in time .
For a few moments the terrified occupants of Avonlea school did not know whether it was an earthquake or a volcanic explosion that had occurred .
"The innocent looking parcel which Anne had rashly supposed to contain Mrs. Hiram 's nut cakes really held an assortment of firecrackers and pinwheels for which Warren Sloane had sent to town by St. Clair Donnell 's father the day before , intending to have a birthday celebration that evening ."
"The crackers went off in a thunderclap of noise and the pinwheels bursting out of the door spun madly around the room , hissing and spluttering ."
Anne dropped into her chair white with dismay and all the girls climbed shrieking upon their desks .
"Joe Sloane stood as one transfixed in the midst of the commotion and St. Clair , helpless with laughter , rocked to and fro in the aisle ."
Prillie Rogerson fainted and Annetta Bell went into hysterics .
"It seemed a long time , although it was really only a few minutes , before the last pinwheel subsided ."
"Anne , recovering herself , sprang to open doors and windows and let out the gas and smoke which filled the room ."
"Then she helped the girls carry the unconscious Prillie into the porch , where Barbara Shaw , in an agony of desire to be useful , poured a pailful of half frozen water over Prillie 's face and shoulders before anyone could stop her ."
It was a full hour before quiet was restored ... but it was a quiet that might be felt .
Everybody realized that even the explosion had not cleared the teacher 's mental atmosphere .
"Nobody , except Anthony Pye , dared whisper a word ."
"Ned Clay accidentally squeaked his pencil while working a sum , caught Anne 's eye and wished the floor would open and swallow him up ."
The geography class were whisked through a continent with a speed that made them dizzy .
The grammar class were parsed and analyzed within an inch of their lives .
"Chester Sloane , spelling `` odoriferous '' with two f 's , was made to feel that he could never live down the disgrace of it , either in this world or that which is to come ."
"Anne knew that she had made herself ridiculous and that the incident would be laughed over that night at a score of tea-tables , but the knowledge only angered her further ."
In a calmer mood she could have carried off the situation with a laugh but now that was impossible ; so she ignored it in icy disdain .
When Anne returned to the school after dinner all the children were as usual in their seats and every face was bent studiously over a desk except Anthony Pye 's .
"He peered across his book at Anne , his black eyes sparkling with curiosity and mockery ."
"Anne twitched open the drawer of her desk in search of chalk and under her very hand a lively mouse sprang out of the drawer , scampered over the desk , and leaped to the floor ."
"Anne screamed and sprang back , as if it had been a snake , and Anthony Pye laughed aloud ."
"Then a silence fell ... a very creepy , uncomfortable silence ."
"Annetta Bell was of two minds whether to go into hysterics again or not , especially as she did n't know just where the mouse had gone ."
But she decided not to .
`` Wo n't it cost a great deal ? ''
"asked Merry , who , in spite of her little elegancies , had a good deal of her thrifty mother 's common sense ."
`` Yes ; and I 've got to earn it .
"But I can -- I know I can , for I 've saved some , and I shall work like ten beavers all summer ."
"I wo n't borrow if I can help it , but I know someone who would lend me five hundred if I wanted it ; '' and Ralph looked as eager and secure as if the earning of twice that sum was a mere trifle when all the longing of his life was put into his daily tasks ."
`` I wish I had it to give you .
It must be so splendid to feel that you can do great things if you only have the chance .
"And to travel , and see all the lovely pictures and statues , and people and places in Italy ."
How happy you must be ! ''
and Merry 's eyes had the wistful look they always wore when she dreamed dreams of the world she loved to live in .
`` I am -- so happy that I 'm afraid it never will happen .
"If I do go , I 'll write and tell you all about the fine sights , and how I get on ."
Would you like me to ? ''
"asked Ralph , beginning enthusiastically and ending rather bashfully , for he admired Merry very much , and was not quite sure how this proposal would be received ."
`` Indeed I should !
"I 'd feel so grand to have letters from Paris and Rome , and you 'd have so much to tell it would be almost as good as going myself , '' she said , looking off into the daffodil sky , as they paused a minute on the hill-top to get breath , for both had walked as fast as they talked ."
`` And will you answer the letters ? ''
"asked Ralph , watching the innocent face , which looked unusually kind and beautiful to him in that soft light ."
"`` Why , yes ; I 'd love to , only I shall not have anything interesting to say ."
What can I write about ? ''
and Merry smiled as she thought how dull her letters would sound after the exciting details his would doubtless give .
"`` Write about yourself , and all the rest of the people I know ."
"Grandma will be gone , and I shall want to hear how you get on . ''"
"Ralph looked very anxious indeed to hear , and Merry promised she would tell all about the other people , adding , as she turned from the evening peace and loveliness to the house , whence came the clatter of milk-pans and the smell of cooking , -- `` I never should have anything very nice to tell about myself , for I do n't do interesting things as you do , and you would n't care to hear about school , and sewing , and messing round at home . ''"
"Merry gave a disdainful little sniff at the savory perfume of ham which saluted them , and paused with her hand on the gate , as if she found it pleasanter out there than in the house ."
"Ralph seemed to agree with her , for , leaning on the gate , he lingered to say , with real sympathy in his tone and something else in his face , `` Yes , I should ; so you write and tell me all about it ."
"I did n't know you had any worries , for you always seemed like one of the happiest people in the world , with so many to pet and care for you , and plenty of money , and nothing very hard or hateful to do ."
"You 'd think you were well off if you knew as much about poverty and work and never getting what you want , as I do . ''"
`` You bear your worries so well that nobody knows you have them .
"I ought not to complain , and I wo n't , for I do have all I need ."
"I 'm so glad you are going to get what you want at last ; '' and Merry held out her hand to say good-night , with so much pleasure in her face that Ralph could not make up his mind to go just yet ."
"`` I shall have to scratch round in a lively way before I do get it , for David says a fellow ca n't live on less than four or five hundred a year , even living as poor artists have to , in garrets and on crusts ."
"`` Troth , no ! ''"
"And he laid hold upon the packet and retired into the barn to shift himself , recommending me in the meanwhile to his kinsman ."
"James carried me accordingly into the kitchen , and sat down with me at table , smiling and talking at first in a very hospitable manner ."
"But presently the gloom returned upon him ; he sat frowning and biting his fingers ; only remembered me from time to time ; and then gave me but a word or two and a poor smile , and back into his private terrors ."
"His wife sat by the fire and wept , with her face in her hands ; his eldest son was crouched upon the floor , running over a great mass of papers and now and again setting one alight and burning it to the bitter end ; all the while a servant lass with a red face was rummaging about the room , in a blind hurry of fear , and whimpering as she went ; and every now and again one of the men would thrust in his face from the yard , and cry for orders ."
"At last James could keep his seat no longer , and begged my permission to be so unmannerly as walk about ."
"`` I am but poor company altogether , sir , '' says he , `` but I can think of nothing but this dreadful accident , and the trouble it is like to bring upon quite innocent persons . ''"
A little after he observed his son burning a paper which he thought should have been kept ; and at that his excitement burst out so that it was painful to witness .
He struck the lad repeatedly .
`` Are you gone gyte ? ''
* he cried .
`` Do you wish to hang your father ? ''
"and forgetful of my presence , carried on at him a long time together in the Gaelic , the young man answering nothing ; only the wife , at the name of hanging , throwing her apron over her face and sobbing out louder than before ."
* Mad .
"This was all wretched for a stranger like myself to hear and see ; and I was right glad when Alan returned , looking like himself in his fine French clothes , though -LRB- to be sure -RRB- they were now grown almost too battered and withered to deserve the name of fine ."
"I was then taken out in my turn by another of the sons , and given that change of clothing of which I had stood so long in need , and a pair of Highland brogues made of deer-leather , rather strange at first , but after a little practice very easy to the feet ."
"By the time I came back Alan must have told his story ; for it seemed understood that I was to fly with him , and they were all busy upon our equipment ."
"They gave us each a sword and pistols , though I professed my inability to use the former ; and with these , and some ammunition , a bag of oatmeal , an iron pan , and a bottle of right French brandy , we were ready for the heather ."
"Money , indeed , was lacking ."
"I had about two guineas left ; Alan 's belt having been despatched by another hand , that trusty messenger had no more than seventeen-pence to his whole fortune ; and as for James , it appears he had brought himself so low with journeys to Edinburgh and legal expenses on behalf of the tenants , that he could only scrape together three-and-five-pence-halfpenny , the most of it in coppers ."
"`` This 'll no do , '' said Alan ."
"`` Ye must find a safe bit somewhere near by , '' said James , `` and get word sent to me ."
"Ye see , ye 'll have to get this business prettily off , Alan ."
This is no time to be stayed for a guinea or two .
"They 're sure to get wind of ye , sure to seek ye , and by my way of it , sure to lay on ye the wyte of this day 's accident ."
"If it falls on you , it falls on me that am your near kinsman and harboured ye while ye were in the country ."
"And if it comes on me -- '' he paused , and bit his fingers , with a white face ."
"`` It would be a painful thing for our friends if I was to hang , '' said he ."
"`` It would be an ill day for Appin , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a day that sticks in my throat , '' said James ."
"`` O man , man , man -- man Alan !"
you and me have spoken like two fools ! ''
"In the first place , Miranda , in spite of her dress and veil , was such a flat-faced , commonplace , uninteresting little bride ."
"In the second place , Joe cried bitterly all through the ceremony , and this vexed Miranda unreasonably ."
"Long afterwards she told Rilla , `` I just felt like saying to him then and there , ` If you feel so bad over having to marry me you do n't have to . '"
But it was just because he was thinking all the time of how soon he would have to leave me . ''
"In the third place , Jims , who was usually so well-behaved in public , took a fit of shyness and contrariness combined and began to cry at the top of his voice for `` Willa . ''"
"Nobody wanted to take him out , because everybody wanted to see the marriage , so Rilla who was a bridesmaid , had to take him and hold him during the ceremony ."
"In the fourth place , Sir Wilfrid Laurier took a fit ."
Sir Wilfrid was entrenched in a corner of the room behind Miranda 's piano .
"During his seizure he made the weirdest , most unearthly noises ."
"He would begin with a series of choking , spasmodic sounds , continuing into a gruesome gurgle , and ending up with a strangled howl ."
"Nobody could hear a word Mr. Meredith was saying , except now and then , when Sir Wilfrid stopped for breath ."
"Nobody looked at the bride except Susan , who never dragged her fascinated eyes from Miranda 's face -- all the others were gazing at the dog ."
Miranda had been trembling with nervousness but as soon as Sir Wilfrid began his performance she forgot it .
All that she could think of was that her dear dog was dying and she could not go to him .
She never remembered a word of the ceremony .
"Rilla , who in spite of Jims , had been trying her best to look rapt and romantic , as beseemed a war bridesmaid , gave up the hopeless attempt , and devoted her energies to choking down untimely merriment ."
"She dared not look at anybody in the room , especially Mrs. Dead Angus , for fear all her suppressed mirth should suddenly explode in a most un-young-ladylike yell of laughter ."
"But married they were , and then they had a wedding-supper in the dining-room which was so lavish and bountiful that you would have thought it was the product of a month 's labour ."
Everybody had brought something .
"Mrs. Dead Angus had brought a large apple-pie , which she placed on a chair in the dining-room and then absently sat down on it ."
"Neither her temper nor her black silk wedding garment was improved thereby , but the pie was never missed at the gay bridal feast ."
Mrs. Dead Angus eventually took it home with her again .
"Whiskers-on-the-moon 's pacifist pig should not get it , anyhow ."
"That evening Mr. and Mrs. Joe , accompanied by the recovered Sir Wilfrid , departed for the Four Winds Lighthouse , which was kept by Joe 's uncle and in which they meant to spend their brief honeymoon ."
"Una Meredith and Rilla and Susan washed the dishes , tidied up , left a cold supper and Miranda 's pitiful little note on the table for Mr. Pryor , and walked home , while the mystic veil of dreamy , haunted winter twilight wrapped itself over the Glen ."
"`` I would really not have minded being a war-bride myself , '' remarked Susan sentimentally ."
But Rilla felt rather flat -- perhaps as a reaction to all the excitement and rush of the past thirty-six hours .
"She was disappointed somehow -- the whole affair had been so ludicrous , and Miranda and Joe so lachrymose and commonplace ."
"`` If Miranda had n't given that wretched dog such an enormous dinner he would n't have had that fit , '' she said crossly ."
"`` I warned her -- but she said she could n't starve the poor dog -- he would soon be all she had left , etc. ."
I could have shaken her . ''
"`` The best man was more excited than Joe was , '' said Susan ."
But we must take a brace and see it through . ''
All Rilla 's anger against Susan had evaporated .
"With Ken 's kiss still burning on her lips , and the wonderful significance of the promise he had asked thrilling heart and soul , she could not be angry with anyone ."
"She put her slim white hand into Susan 's brown , work-hardened one and gave it a squeeze ."
Susan was a faithful old dear and would lay down her life for any one of them .
"`` You are tired , Rilla dear , and had better go to bed , '' Susan said , patting her hand ."
`` I noticed you were too tired to talk tonight .
I am glad I came home in time to help you out .
It is very tiresome trying to entertain young men when you are not accustomed to it . ''
"Rilla carried Jims upstairs and went to bed , but not before she had sat for a long time at her window reconstructing her rainbow castle , with several added domes and turrets ."
"`` I wonder , '' she said to herself , `` if I am , or am not , engaged to Kenneth Ford . ''"
"CHAPTER XVII THE WEEKS WEAR BY Rilla read her first love letter in her Rainbow Valley fir-shadowed nook , and a girl 's first love letter , whatever blase , older people may think of it , is an event of tremendous importance in the teens ."
"After Kenneth 's regiment had left Kingsport there came a fortnight of dully-aching anxiety and when the congregation sang in Church on Sunday evenings , `` Oh , hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea , '' Rilla 's voice always failed her ; for with the words came a horribly vivid mind picture of a submarined ship sinking beneath pitiless waves amid the struggles and cries of drowning men ."
"Then word came that Kenneth 's regiment had arrived safely in England ; and now , at last , here was his letter ."
It began with something that made Rilla supremely happy for the moment and ended with a paragraph that crimsoned her cheeks with the wonder and thrill and delight of it .
"Between beginning and ending the letter was just such a jolly , newsy epistle as Ken might have written to anyone ; but for the sake of that beginning and ending Rilla slept with the letter under her pillow for weeks , sometimes waking in the night to slip her fingers under and just touch it , and looked with secret pity on other girls whose sweethearts could never have written them anything half so wonderful and exquisite ."
Kenneth was not the son of a famous novelist for nothing .
"He `` had a way '' of expressing things in a few poignant , significant words that seemed to suggest far more than they uttered , and never grew stale or flat or foolish with ever so many scores of readings ."
Rilla went home from Rainbow Valley as if she flew rather than walked .
But such moments of uplift were rare that autumn .
"To be sure , there was one day in September when great news came of a big Allied victory in the west and Susan ran out to hoist the flag -- the first time she had hoisted it since the Russian line broke and the last time she was to hoist it for many dismal moons ."
"`` Likely the Big Push has begun at last , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she exclaimed , `` and we will soon see the finish of the Huns ."
Our boys will be home by Christmas now .
Hurrah ! ''
"Susan was ashamed of herself for hurrahing the minute she had done it , and apologized meekly for such an outburst of juvenility ."
"`` But indeed , Mrs. Dr. dear , this good news has gone to my head after this awful summer of Russian slumps and Gallipoli setbacks . ''"
`` Good news ! ''
said Miss Oliver bitterly .
`` I wonder if the women whose men have been killed for it will call it good news .
Just because our own men are not on that part of the front we are rejoicing as if the victory had cost no lives . ''
"`` Now , Miss Oliver dear , do not take that view of it , '' deprecated Susan ."
`` We have not had much to rejoice over of late and yet men were being killed just the same .
"Jill had been winding wool for a stripe in her new afghan , and the green ball lay on her sofa ."
"These signs suggested and confirmed what Mrs. Minot did not want to believe ; so did the voice , attitude , and air of Jill , all very unlike her usual open , alert ways ."
"The kind lady could easily forgive the reading of her letter since the girl had found such sad news there , but the dangers of disobedience were serious in her case , and a glance showed that she was suffering either in mind or body -- perhaps both ."
`` I will wait for her to tell me .
"She is an honest child , and the truth will soon come out , '' thought Mrs. Minot , as she took a clean sheet , and Jill tried to study ."
"`` Shall I hear your lesson , dear ?"
"Jack means to recite his like a good boy , so suppose you follow his example , '' she said , presently ."
"`` I do n't know as I can say it , but I 'll try . ''"
"Jill did try , and got on bravely till she came to the word `` permanent ; '' there she hesitated , remembering where she saw it last ."
`` Do you know what that means ? ''
"asked her teacher , thinking to help her on by defining the word ."
`` Always -- for a great while -- or something like that ; does n't it ? ''
"faltered Jill , with a tight feeling in her throat , and the color coming up , as she tried to speak easily , yet felt so shame-stricken she could not ."
"`` Are you in pain , my child ?"
"Never mind the lesson ; tell me , and I 'll do something for you . ''"
"The kind words , the soft hand on her hot cheek , and the pity in the eyes that looked at her , were too much for Jill ."
"A sob came first , and then the truth , told with hidden face and tears that washed the blush away , and set free the honest little soul that could not hide its fault from such a friend ."
"`` I knew it all before , and was sure you would tell me , else you would not be the child I love and like to help so well . ''"
"Then , while she soothed Jill 's trouble , Mrs. Minot told her story and showed the letter , wishing to lessen , if possible , some part of the pain it had given ."
`` Sly old stamp !
"To go and tell on me when I meant to own up , and get some credit if I could , after being so mean and bad , '' said Jill , smiling through her tears when she saw the tell-tale witnesses against her ."
"`` You had better stick it in your book to remind you of the bad consequences of disobedience , then perhaps this lesson will leave a ` permanent ' impression on your mind and memory , '' answered Mrs. Minot , glad to see her natural gayety coming back , and hoping that she had forgotten the contents of the unfortunate letter ."
"But she had not ; and presently , when the sad affair had been talked over and forgiven , Jill asked , slowly , as she tried to put on a brave look , -- `` Please tell me about Lucinda Snow ."
"If I am to be like her , I might as well know how she managed to bear it so long . ''"
"`` I 'm sorry you ever heard of her , and yet perhaps it may help you to bear your trial , dear , which I hope will never be as heavy a one as hers ."
"This Lucinda I knew for years , and though at first I thought her fate the saddest that could be , I came at last to see how happy she was in spite of her affliction , how good and useful and beloved . ''"
"`` Why , how could she be ?"
What did she do ? ''
"cried Jill , forgetting her own troubles to look up with an open , eager face again ."
"`` She was so patient , other people were ashamed to complain of their small worries ; so cheerful , that her own great one grew lighter ; so industrious , that she made both money and friends by pretty things she worked and sold to her many visitors ."
"And , best of all , so wise and sweet that she seemed to get good out of everything , and make her poor room a sort of chapel where people went for comfort , counsel , and an example of a pious life ."
"So , you see , Lucinda was not so very miserable after all . ''"
` Then I sha n't be exactly a human ? '
Peter asked .
` No . '
` Nor exactly a bird ? '
` No . '
` What shall I be ? '
"` You will be a Betwixt-and-Between , ' Solomon said , and certainly he was a wise old fellow , for that is exactly how it turned out ."
The birds on the island never got used to him .
"His oddities tickled them every day , as if they were quite new , though it was really the birds that were new ."
"They came out of the eggs daily , and laughed at him at once ; then off they soon flew to be humans , and other birds came out of other eggs ; and so it went on for ever ."
"The crafty mother-birds , when they tired of sitting on their eggs , used to get the young ones to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating ."
"Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things , just as you watch the peacocks , and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth ."
All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon 's orders by the birds .
"He would not eat worms or insects -LRB- which they thought very silly of him -RRB- , so they brought him bread in their beaks ."
"Thus , when you cry out , ` Greedy !"
Greedy ! '
"to the bird that flies away with the big crust , you know now that you ought not to do this , for he is very likely taking it to Peter Pan ."
-LSB- Illustration : The birds on the island never got used to him .
His oddities tickled them every day -RSB- Peter wore no nightgown now .
"You see , the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with , and , being very good-natured , he could not refuse , so by Solomon 's advice he had hidden what was left of it ."
"But , though he was now quite naked , you must not think that he was cold or unhappy ."
"He was usually very happy and gay , and the reason was that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways ."
"To be easily pleased , for instance , and always to be really doing something , and to think that whatever he was doing was a thing of vast importance ."
"Peter became very clever at helping the birds to build their nests ; soon he could build better than a wood-pigeon , and nearly as well as a blackbird , though never did he satisfy the finches , and he made nice little water-troughs near the nests and dug up worms for the young ones with his fingers ."
"He also became very learned in bird-lore , and knew an east wind from a west wind by its smell , and he could see the grass growing and hear the insects walking about inside the tree-trunks ."
But the best thing Solomon had done was to teach him to have a glad heart .
"All birds have glad hearts unless you rob their nests , and so , as they were the only kind of heart Solomon knew about , it was easy to him to teach Peter how to have one ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Peter screamed out , ` Do it again ! '"
"and with great good-nature they did it several times -RSB- Peter 's heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long , just as the birds sing for joy , but , being partly human , he needed an instrument , so he made a pipe of reeds , and he used to sit by the shore of the island of an evening , practising the sough of the wind and the ripple of the water , and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon , and he put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that even the birds were deceived , and they would say to each other , ` Was that a fish leaping in the water or was it Peter playing leaping fish on his pipe ? '"
"And sometimes he played the birth of birds , and then the mothers would turn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an egg ."
"If you are a child of the Gardens you must know the chestnut-tree near the bridge , which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts , but perhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way ."
"It is because Peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come , and the chestnut being so near , hears him and is cheated ."
"If this reformation goes on as it has begun , I shall soon feel like Dr. Blimber with his model young gentlemen , '' said Professor , laughing , as he saw Tommy not only remove his own hat , but knock off Ned 's also , as they entered the hall where the Princess was taking a ride on the rocking-horse , attended by Rob and Teddy astride of chairs , and playing gallant knights to the best of their ability ."
"`` You will never be a Blimber , Fritz , you could n't do it if you tried ; and our boys will never submit to the forcing process of that famous hot-bed ."
No fear that they will be too elegant : American boys like liberty too well .
"But good manners they can not fail to have , if we give them the kindly spirit that shines through the simplest demeanor , making it courteous and cordial , like yours , my dear old boy . ''"
`` Tut !
tut !
"we will not compliment ; for if I begin you will run away , and I have a wish to enjoy this happy half hour to the end ; '' yet Mr. Bhaer looked pleased with the compliment , for it was true , and Mrs. Jo felt that she had received the best her husband could give her , by saying that he found his truest rest and happiness in her society ."
"`` To return to the children : I have just had another proof of Goldilocks ' good influence , '' said Mrs. Jo , drawing her chair nearer the sofa , where the Professor lay resting after a long day 's work in his various gardens ."
"`` Nan hates sewing , but for love of Bess has been toiling half the afternoon over a remarkable bag in which to present a dozen of our love-apples to her idol when she goes ."
"I praised her for it , and she said , in her quick way , ' I like to sew for other people ; it is stupid sewing for myself . '"
"I took the hint , and shall give her some little shirts and aprons for Mrs. Carney 's children ."
"She is so generous , she will sew her fingers sore for them , and I shall not have to make a task of it . ''"
"`` But needlework is not a fashionable accomplishment , my dear . ''"
`` Sorry for it .
"My girls shall learn all I can teach them about it , even if they give up the Latin , Algebra , and half-a-dozen ologies it is considered necessary for girls to muddle their poor brains over now-a-days ."
"Amy means to make Bess an accomplished woman , but the dear 's mite of a forefinger has little pricks on it already , and her mother has several specimens of needlework which she values more than the clay bird without a bill , that filled Laurie with such pride when Bess made it . ''"
"`` I also have proof of the Princess 's power , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , after he had watched Mrs. Jo sew on a button with an air of scorn for the whole system of fashionable education ."
"`` Jack is so unwilling to be classed with Stuffy and Ned , as distasteful to Bess , that he came to me a little while ago , and asked me to touch his warts with caustic ."
"I have often proposed it , and he never would consent ; but now he bore the smart manfully , and consoles his present discomfort by hopes of future favor , when he can show her fastidious ladyship a smooth hand . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer laughed at the story , and just then Stuffy came in to ask if he might give Goldilocks some of the bonbons his mother had sent him ."
"`` She is not allowed to eat sweeties ; but if you like to give her the pretty box with the pink sugar-rose in it , she would like it very much , '' said Mrs. Jo , unwilling to spoil this unusual piece of self-denial , for the `` fat boy '' seldom offered to share his sugar-plums ."
`` Wo n't she eat it ?
"I should n't like to make her sick , '' said Stuffy , eyeing the delicate sweetmeat lovingly , yet putting it into the box ."
"`` Oh , no , she wo n't touch it , if I tell her it is to look at , not to eat ."
"She will keep it for weeks , and never think of tasting it ."
Can you do as much ? ''
`` I should hope so !
"I 'm ever so much older than she is , '' cried Stuffy , indignantly ."
"`` Well , suppose we try ."
"Here , put your bonbons in this bag , and see how long you can keep them ."
"Let me count two hearts , four red fishes , three barley-sugar horses , nine almonds , and a dozen chocolate drops ."
Do you agree to that ? ''
"-LSB- Illustration : A hundred flew off with the string , and Peter clung to the tail -RSB- But as Peter sat by the shore tootling divinely on his pipe he sometimes fell into sad thoughts , and then the music became sad also , and the reason of all this sadness was that he could not reach the Gardens , though he could see them through the arch of the bridge ."
"He knew he could never be a real human again , and scarcely wanted to be one , but oh !"
"how he longed to play as other children play , and of course there is no such lovely place to play in as the Gardens ."
"The birds brought him news of how boys and girls play , and wistful tears started in Peter 's eyes ."
Perhaps you wonder why he did not swim across .
The reason was that he could not swim .
"He wanted to know how to swim , but no one on the island knew the way except the ducks , and they are so stupid ."
"They were quite willing to teach him , but all they could say about it was , ` You sit down on the top of the water in this way , and then you kick out like that . '"
"Peter tried it often , but always before he could kick out he sank ."
"What he really needed to know was how you sit on the water without sinking , and they said it was quite impossible to explain such an easy thing as that ."
"Occasionally swans touched on the island , and he would give them all his day 's food and then ask them how they sat on the water , but as soon as he had no more to give them the hateful things hissed at him and sailed away ."
Once he really thought he had discovered a way of reaching the Gardens .
"A wonderful white thing , like a runaway newspaper , floated high over the island and then tumbled , rolling over and over after the manner of a bird that has broken its wing ."
"Peter was so frightened that he hid , but the birds told him it was only a kite , and what a kite is , and that it must have tugged its string out of a boy 's hand , and soared away ."
"After that they laughed at Peter for being so fond of the kite ; he loved it so much that he even slept with one hand on it , and I think this was pathetic and pretty , for the reason he loved it was because it had belonged to a real boy ."
"-LSB- Illustration : After this the birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise -RSB- To the birds this was a very poor reason , but the older ones felt grateful to him at this time because he had nursed a number of fledglings through the German measles , and they offered to show him how birds fly a kite ."
So six of them took the end of the string in their beaks and flew away with it ; and to his amazement it flew after them and went even higher than they .
"Peter screamed out , ` Do it again ! '"
"and with great good-nature they did it several times , and always instead of thanking them he cried , ` Do it again ! '"
which shows that even now he had not quite forgotten what it was to be a boy .
"At last , with a grand design burning within his brave heart , he begged them to do it once more with him clinging to the tail , and now a hundred flew off with the string , and Peter clung to the tail , meaning to drop off when he was over the Gardens ."
"But the kite broke to pieces in the air , and he would have been drowned in the Serpentine had he not caught hold of two indignant swans and made them carry him to the island ."
After this the birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise .
"Nevertheless , Peter did reach the Gardens at last by the help of Shelley 's boat , as I am now to tell you ."
-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` Peter Pan ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` The Thrush 's Nest ' -RSB- III THE THRUSH 'S NEST Shelley was a young gentleman and as grown-up as he need ever expect to be .
He was a poet ; and they are never exactly grown-up .
"They are people who despise money except what you need for to-day , and he had all that and five pounds over ."
"So , when he was walking in the Kensington Gardens , he made a paper boat of his bank-note , and sent it sailing on the Serpentine ."
"It reached the island at night ; and the look-out brought it to Solomon Caw , who thought at first that it was the usual thing , a message from a lady , saying she would be obliged if he could let her have a good one ."
"They always ask for the best one he has , and if he likes the letter he sends one from Class A , but if it ruffles him he sends very funny ones indeed ."
"Sometimes he sends none at all , and at another time he sends a nestful ; it all depends on the mood you catch him in ."
"He likes you to leave it all to him , and if you mention particularly that you hope he will see his way to making it a boy this time , he is almost sure to send another girl ."
"Borrowing a rope for a halter , Dan led her home , followed by a party of very sober young gentlemen , for the cow was in a sad state , having strained her shoulder jumping , so that she limped , her eyes looked wild , and her glossy coat was wet and muddy ."
"`` You 'll catch it this time , Dan , '' said Tommy , as he led the wheezing donkey beside the maltreated cow ."
"`` So will you , for you helped . ''"
"`` We all did , but Demi , '' added Jack ."
"`` He put it into our heads , '' said Ned ."
"`` I told you not to do it , '' cried Demi , who was most broken-hearted at poor Buttercup 's state ."
"`` Old Bhaer will send me off , I guess ."
"Do n't care if he does , '' muttered Dan , looking worried in spite of his words ."
"`` We 'll ask him not to , all of us , '' said Demi , and the others assented with the exception of Stuffy , who cherished the hope that all the punishment might fall on one guilty head ."
"Dan only said , `` Do n't bother about me ; '' but he never forgot it , even though he led the lads astray again , as soon as the temptation came ."
"When Mr. Bhaer saw the animal , and heard the story , he said very little , evidently fearing that he should say too much in the first moments of impatience ."
"Buttercup was made comfortable in her stall , and the boys sent to their rooms till supper-time ."
"This brief respite gave them time to think the matter over , to wonder what the penalty would be , and to try to imagine where Dan would be sent ."
"He whistled briskly in his room , so that no one should think he cared a bit ; but while he waited to know his fate , the longing to stay grew stronger and stronger , the more he recalled the comfort and kindness he had known here , the hardship and neglect he had felt elsewhere ."
"He knew they tried to help him , and at the bottom of his heart he was grateful , but his rough life had made him hard and careless , suspicious and wilful ."
"He hated restraint of any sort , and fought against it like an untamed creature , even while he knew it was kindly meant , and dimly felt that he would be the better for it ."
"He made up his mind to be turned adrift again , to knock about the city as he had done nearly all his life ; a prospect that made him knit his black brows , and look about the cosy little room with a wistful expression that would have touched a much harder heart than Mr. Bhaer 's if he had seen it ."
"It vanished instantly , however , when the good man came in , and said in his accustomed grave way , `` I have heard all about it , Dan , and though you have broken the rules again , I am going to give you one more trial , to please Mother Bhaer . ''"
"Dan flushed up to his forehead at this unexpected reprieve , but he only said in his gruff way , `` I did n't know there was any rule about bull-fighting . ''"
"`` As I never expected to have any at Plumfield , I never did make such a rule , '' answered Mr. Bhaer , smiling in spite of himself at the boy 's excuse ."
"Then he added gravely , `` But one of the first and most important of our few laws is the law of kindness to every dumb creature on the place ."
"I want everybody and everything to be happy here , to love and trust , and serve us , as we try to love and trust and serve them faithfully and willingly ."
"I have often said that you were kinder to the animals than any of the other boys , and Mrs. Bhaer liked that trait in you very much , because she thought it showed a good heart ."
"But you have disappointed us in that , and we are sorry , for we hoped to make you quite one of us ."
Shall we try again ? ''
"Dan 's eyes had been on the floor , and his hands nervously picking at the bit of wood he had been whittling as Mr. Bhaer came in , but when he heard the kind voice ask that question , he looked up quickly , and said in a more respectful tone than he had ever used before , `` Yes , please . ''"
"`` Very well , then , we will say no more , only you will stay at home from the walk to-morrow , as the other boys will and all of you must wait on poor Buttercup till she is well again . ''"
`` I will . ''
"`` Now , go down to supper , and do your best , my boy , more for your own sake than for ours . ''"
"Then Mr. Bhaer shook hands with him , and Dan went down more tamed by kindness than he would have been by the good whipping which Asia had strongly recommended ."
"Dan did try for a day or two , but not being used to it , he soon tired and relapsed into his old wilful ways ."
"Mr. Bhaer was called from home on business one day , and the boys had no lessons ."
"`` I couldnae , '' said she , shaking her head ."
"`` Na , I couldnae . ''"
"`` No , '' said he , `` but if ye could ? ''"
She answered him nothing .
"`` Look here , my lass , '' said Alan , `` there are boats in the Kingdom of Fife , for I saw two -LRB- no less -RRB- upon the beach , as I came in by your town 's end ."
"Now if we could have the use of a boat to pass under cloud of night into Lothian , and some secret , decent kind of a man to bring that boat back again and keep his counsel , there would be two souls saved -- mine to all likelihood -- his to a dead surety ."
"If we lack that boat , we have but three shillings left in this wide world ; and where to go , and how to do , and what other place there is for us except the chains of a gibbet -- I give you my naked word , I kenna !"
"Shall we go wanting , lassie ?"
"Are ye to lie in your warm bed and think upon us , when the wind gowls in the chimney and the rain tirls on the roof ?"
"Are ye to eat your meat by the cheeks of a red fire , and think upon this poor sick lad of mine , biting his finger ends on a blae muir for cauld and hunger ?"
"Sick or sound , he must aye be moving ; with the death grapple at his throat he must aye be trailing in the rain on the lang roads ; and when he gants his last on a rickle of cauld stanes , there will be nae friends near him but only me and God . ''"
"At this appeal , I could see the lass was in great trouble of mind , being tempted to help us , and yet in some fear she might be helping malefactors ; and so now I determined to step in myself and to allay her scruples with a portion of the truth ."
"`` Did ever you hear , '' said I , `` of Mr. Rankeillor of the Ferry ? ''"
`` Rankeillor the writer ? ''
said she .
`` I daur say that ! ''
"`` Well , '' said I , `` it 's to his door that I am bound , so you may judge by that if I am an ill-doer ; and I will tell you more , that though I am indeed , by a dreadful error , in some peril of my life , King George has no truer friend in all Scotland than myself . ''"
"Her face cleared up mightily at this , although Alan 's darkened ."
"`` That 's more than I would ask , '' said she ."
`` Mr. Rankeillor is a kennt man . ''
"And she bade us finish our meat , get clear of the clachan as soon as might be , and lie close in the bit wood on the sea-beach ."
"`` And ye can trust me , '' says she , `` I 'll find some means to put you over . ''"
"At this we waited for no more , but shook hands with her upon the bargain , made short work of the puddings , and set forth again from Limekilns as far as to the wood ."
"It was a small piece of perhaps a score of elders and hawthorns and a few young ashes , not thick enough to veil us from passersby upon the road or beach ."
"Here we must lie , however , making the best of the brave warm weather and the good hopes we now had of a deliverance , and planing more particularly what remained for us to do ."
"We had but one trouble all day ; when a strolling piper came and sat in the same wood with us ; a red-nosed , bleareyed , drunken dog , with a great bottle of whisky in his pocket , and a long story of wrongs that had been done him by all sorts of persons , from the Lord President of the Court of Session , who had denied him justice , down to the Bailies of Inverkeithing who had given him more of it than he desired ."
It was impossible but he should conceive some suspicion of two men lying all day concealed in a thicket and having no business to allege .
"As long as he stayed there he kept us in hot water with prying questions ; and after he was gone , as he was a man not very likely to hold his tongue , we were in the greater impatience to be gone ourselves ."
"The day came to an end with the same brightness ; the night fell quiet and clear ; lights came out in houses and hamlets and then , one after another , began to be put out ; but it was past eleven , and we were long since strangely tortured with anxieties , before we heard the grinding of oars upon the rowing-pins ."
"At that , we looked out and saw the lass herself coming rowing to us in a boat ."
"She had trusted no one with our affairs , not even her sweetheart , if she had one ; but as soon as her father was asleep , had left the house by a window , stolen a neighbour 's boat , and come to our assistance single-handed ."
"I was abashed how to find expression for my thanks ; but she was no less abashed at the thought of hearing them ; begged us to lose no time and to hold our peace , saying -LRB- very properly -RRB- that the heart of our matter was in haste and silence ; and so , what with one thing and another , she had set us on the Lothian shore not far from Carriden , had shaken hands with us , and was out again at sea and rowing for Limekilns , before there was one word said either of her service or our gratitude ."
"Take the real one as a model -- please do ; there are more coming , and this will brighten up your room for a day or two . ''"
"As she spoke , Merry cut the stem , and , adding two or three of the great green leaves , put the handsome flower in his hand with so much good-will that he felt as if he had received a very precious gift ."
"Then he said good-night so gratefully that Merry 's hand quite tingled with the grasp of his , and went away , often looking backward through the darkness to where the light burned brightly on the hill-top -- the beacon kindled by an unconscious Hero for a young Leander swimming gallantly against wind and tide toward the goal of his ambition ."
Chapter XVII .
"Down at Molly 's `` Now , my dears , I 've something very curious to tell you , so listen quietly and then I 'll give you your dinners , '' said Molly , addressing the nine cats who came trooping after her as she went into the shed-chamber with a bowl of milk and a plate of scraps in her hands ."
"She had taught them to behave well at meals , so , though their eyes glared and their tails quivered with impatience , they obeyed ; and when she put the food on a high shelf and retired to the big basket , the four old cats sat demurely down before her , while the five kits scrambled after her and tumbled into her lap , as if hoping to hasten the desired feast by their innocent gambols ."
"Granny , Tobias , Mortification , and Molasses were the elders ."
"Granny , a gray old puss , was the mother and grandmother of all the rest ."
"Tobias was her eldest son , and Mortification his brother , so named because he had lost his tail , which affliction depressed his spirits and cast a blight over his young life ."
"Molasses was a yellow cat , the mamma of four of the kits , the fifth being Granny 's latest darling ."
"Toddlekins , the little aunt , was the image of her mother , and very sedate even at that early age ; Miss Muffet , so called from her dread of spiders , was a timid black and white kit ; Beauty , a pretty Maltese , with a serene little face and pink nose ; Ragbag , a funny thing , every color that a cat could be ; and Scamp , who well deserved his name , for he was the plague of Miss Bat 's life , and Molly 's especial pet ."
"He was now perched on her shoulder , and , as she talked , kept peeping into her face or biting her ear in the most impertinent way , while the others sprawled in her lap or promenaded round the basket rim ."
"`` My friends , something very remarkable has happened : Miss Bat is cleaning house ! ''"
"and , having made this announcement , Molly leaned back to see how the cats received it , for she insisted that they understood all she said to them ."
"Tobias stared , Mortification lay down as if it was too much for him , Molasses beat her tail on the floor as if whipping a dusty carpet , and Granny began to purr approvingly ."
"The giddy kits paid no attention , as they did not know what house-cleaning meant , happy little dears !"
"`` I thought you 'd like it , Granny , for you are a decent cat , and know what is proper , '' continued Molly , leaning down to stroke the old puss , who blinked affectionately at her ."
`` I ca n't imagine what put it into Miss Bat 's head .
"I never said a word , and gave up groaning over the clutter , as I could n't mend it ."
"I just took care of Boo and myself , and left her to be as untidy as she pleased , and she is a regular old -- '' Here Scamp put his paw on her lips because he saw them moving , but it seemed as if it was to check the disrespectful word just coming out ."
"`` Well , I wo n't call names ; but what shall I do when I see everything in confusion , and she wo n't let me clear up ? ''"
"asked Molly , looking round at Scamp , who promptly put the little paw on her eyelid , as if the roll of the blue ball underneath amused him ."
"`` Shut my eyes to it , you mean ?"
"I do all I can , but it is hard , when I wish to be nice , and do try ; do n't I ? ''"
asked Molly .
"But Scamp was ready for her , and began to comb her hair with both paws as he stood on his hind legs to work so busily that Molly laughed and pulled him down , saying , as she cuddled the sly kit ."
`` You sharp little thing !
"I know my hair is not neat now , for I 've been chasing Boo round the garden to wash him for school ."
"Then Miss Bat threw the parlor carpet out of the window , and I was so surprised I had to run and tell you ."
"Now , what had we better do about it ? ''"
"The cats all winked at her , but no one had any advice to offer , except Tobias , who walked to the shelf , and , looking up , uttered a deep , suggestive yowl , which said as plainly as words , `` Dinner first and discussion afterward . ''"
"`` Very well , do n't scramble , '' said Molly , getting up to feed her pets ."
"Make Jack own up , whether he can or not ."
Little donkey ! ''
"stormed Frank , who hated rowdies and could not forgive his brother for being seen with one ."
"`` My dear , all boys do foolish things sometimes , even the wisest and best behaved , so do n't be hard on the poor child ."
"He has got into trouble , I 've no doubt , but it can not be very bad , and he earned the money to pay for his prank , whatever it was . ''"
"Mrs. Minot left the room as she spoke , and Frank cooled down as if her words had been a shower-bath , for he remembered his own costly escapade , and how kindly both his mother and Jack had stood by him on that trying occasion ."
"So , feeling rather remorseful , he went off to talk it over with Gus , leaving Jill in a fever of curiosity , for Merry and Molly had dropped in on their way home to break the blow to her , and Frank declined to discuss it with her , after mildly stating that Jack was `` a ninny , '' in his opinion ."
"`` Well , I know one thing , '' said Jill confidentially to Snow-ball , when they were left alone together , `` if every one else is scolding him I wo n't say a word ."
"It 's so mean to crow over people when they are down , and I 'm sure he has n't done anything to be ashamed of , though he wo n't tell . ''"
"Snow-ball seemed to agree to this , for he went and sat down by Jack 's slippers waiting for him on the hearth , and Jill thought that a very touching proof of affectionate fidelity to the little master who ruled them both ."
"When he came , it was evident that he had found it harder to refuse his mother than all the rest ."
"But she trusted him in spite of appearances , and that was such a comfort !"
"For poor Jack 's heart was very full , and he longed to tell the whole story , but he would not break his promise , and so kept silence bravely ."
"Jill asked no questions , affecting to be anxious for the games they always played together in the evening , but while they played , though the lips were sealed , the bright eyes said as plainly as words , `` I trust you , '' and Jack was very grateful ."
"It was well he had something to cheer him up at home , for he got little peace at school ."
"He bore the grave looks of Mr. Acton meekly , took the boys ' jokes good-naturedly , and withstood the artful teasing of the girls with patient silence ."
"But it was very hard for the social , affectionate fellow to bear the general distrust , for he had been such a favorite he felt the change keenly ."
But the thing that tried him most was the knowledge that his report would not be what it usually was .
"It was always a happy moment when he showed it to his mother , and saw her eye brighten as it fell on the 99 or 100 , for she cared more for good behavior than for perfect lessons ."
"Mr. Acton once said that Frank Minot 's moral influence in the school was unusual , and Jack never forgot her pride and delight as she told them what Frank himself had not known till then ."
"It was Jack 's ambition to have the same said of him , for he was not much of a scholar , and he had tried hard since he went back to school to get good records in that respect at least ."
"Now here was a dreadful downfall , tardy marks , bad company , broken rules , and something too wrong to tell , apparently ."
"`` Well , I deserve a good report , and that 's a comfort , though nobody believes it , '' he said to himself , trying to keep up his spirits , as the slow week went by , and no word from him had cleared up the mystery ."
Chapter XIV .
"And Jill Finds It Out Jill worried about it more than he did , for she was a faithful little friend , and it was a great trial to have Jack even suspected of doing anything wrong ."
"School is a child 's world while he is there , and its small affairs are very important to him , so Jill felt that the one thing to be done was to clear away the cloud about her dear boy , and restore him to public favor ."
"`` Ed will be here Saturday night and may be he will find out , for Jack tells him everything ."
"I do hate to have him hectored so , for I know he is , though he 's too proud to complain , '' she said , on Thursday evening , when Frank told her some joke played upon his brother that day ."
"`` I let him alone , but I see that he is n't badgered too much ."
That 's all I can do .
"If Ed had only come home last Saturday it might have done some good , but now it will be too late ; for the reports are given out to-morrow , you know , '' answered Frank , feeling a little jealous of Ed 's influence over Jack , though his own would have been as great if he had been as gentle ."
`` Has Jerry come back ? ''
"as she softly lifted away the apron , and saw the little ruddy face below ."
"The berry-stained lips were half-open as the breath came and went , the yellow hair lay damp on the hot forehead , and both the chubby hands held fast the little pail still full ."
"The sight of the childish harvest , treasured through all the troubles of that night for her , seemed to touch Mrs. Jo to the heart , for suddenly she gathered up her boy , and began to cry over him , so tenderly , yet so heartily , that he woke up , and at first seemed bewildered ."
"Then he remembered , and hugged her close , saying with a laugh of triumph , `` I knew you 'd come !"
O Marmar !
I did want you so ! ''
"For a moment they kissed and clung to one another , quite forgetting all the world ; for no matter how lost and soiled and worn-out wandering sons may be , mothers can forgive and forget every thing as they fold them in their fostering arms ."
"Happy the son whose faith in his mother remains unchanged , and who , through all his wanderings , has kept some filial token to repay her brave and tender love ."
"Dan meantime picked Nan out of her bush , and , with a gentleness none but Teddy ever saw in him before , he soothed her first alarm at the sudden waking , and wiped away her tears ; for Nan also began to cry for joy , it was so good to see a kind face and feel a strong arm round her after what seemed to her ages of loneliness and fear ."
"`` My poor little girl , do n't cry !"
"You are all safe now , and no one shall say a word of blame to-night , '' said Mrs. Jo , taking Nan into her capacious embrace , and cuddling both children as a hen might gather her lost chickens under her motherly wings ."
`` It was my fault ; but I am sorry .
"I tried to take care of him , and I covered him up and let him sleep , and did n't touch his berries , though I was so hungry ; and I never will do it again truly , never , never , '' sobbed Nan , quite lost in a sea of penitence and thankfulness ."
"`` Call them now , and let us get home , '' said Mrs. Jo ; and Dan , getting upon the wall , sent a joyful word `` Found ! ''"
ringing over the field .
"How the wandering lights came dancing from all sides , and gathered round the little group among the sweet fern bushes !"
"Such a hugging , and kissing , and talking , and crying , as went on must have amazed the glowworms , and evidently delighted the mosquitoes , for they hummed frantically , while the little moths came in flocks to the party , and the frogs croaked as if they could not express their satisfaction loudly enough ."
"Then they set out for home , a queer party , for Franz rode on to tell the news ; Dan and Toby led the way ; then came Nan in the strong arms of Silas , who considered her `` the smartest little baggage he ever saw , '' and teased her all the way home about her pranks ."
"Mrs. Bhaer would let no one carry Rob but himself , and the little fellow , refreshed by sleep , sat up , and chattered gayly , feeling himself a hero , while his mother went beside him holding on to any pat of his precious little body that came handy , and never tired of hearing him say , `` I knew Marmar would come , '' or seeing him lean down to kiss her , and put a plump berry into her mouth , '' 'Cause he picked 'em all for her . ''"
"The moon shone out just as they reached the avenue , and all the boys came shouting to meet them , so the lost lambs were borne in triumph and safety , and landed in the dining-room , where the unromantic little things demanded supper instead of preferring kisses and caresses ."
"They were set down to bread and milk , while the entire household stood round to gaze upon them ."
"Nan soon recovered her spirits , and recounted her perils with a relish now that they were all over ."
"Rob seemed absorbed in his food , but put down his spoon all of a sudden , and set up a doleful roar ."
"`` My precious , why do you cry ? ''"
"asked his mother , who still hung over him ."
"`` I 'm crying 'cause I was lost , '' bawled Rob , trying to squeeze out a tear , and failing entirely ."
`` But you are found now .
"Nan says you did n't cry out in the field , and I was glad you were such a brave boy . ''"
`` I was so busy being frightened I did n't have any time then .
"But I want to cry now , 'cause I do n't like to be lost , '' explained Rob , struggling with sleep , emotion , and a mouthful of bread and milk ."
"The boys set up such a laugh at this funny way of making up for lost time , that Rob stopped to look at them , and the merriment was so infectious , that after a surprised stare he burst out into a merry , `` Ha , ha ! ''"
and beat his spoon upon the table as if he enjoyed the joke immensely .
She was the only really celebrated Fig .
"We are now in the Broad Walk , and it is as much bigger than the other walks as your father is bigger than you ."
"David wondered if it began little , and grew and grew , until it was quite grown up , and whether the other walks are its babies , and he drew a picture , which diverted him very much , of the Broad Walk giving a tiny walk an airing in a perambulator ."
"In the Broad Walk you meet all the people who are worth knowing , and there is usually a grown-up with them to prevent them going on the damp grass , and to make them stand disgraced at the corner of a seat if they have been mad-dog or Mary-Annish ."
"To be Mary-Annish is to behave like a girl , whimpering because nurse wo n't carry you , or simpering with your thumb in your mouth , and it is a hateful quality ; but to be mad-dog is to kick out at everything , and there is some satisfaction in that ."
"If I were to point out all the notable places as we pass up the Broad Walk , it would be time to turn back before we reach them , and I simply wave my stick at Cecco Hewlett 's Tree , that memorable spot where a boy called Cecco lost his penny , and , looking for it , found twopence ."
There has been a good deal of excavation going on there ever since .
Farther up the walk is the little wooden house in which Marmaduke Perry hid .
"There is no more awful story of the Gardens than this of Marmaduke Perry , who had been Mary-Annish three days in succession , and was sentenced to appear in the Broad Walk dressed in his sister 's clothes ."
"He hid in the little wooden house , and refused to emerge until they brought him knickerbockers with pockets ."
"You now try to go to the Round Pond , but nurses hate it , because they are not really manly , and they make you look the other way , at the Big Penny and the Baby 's Palace ."
"She was the most celebrated baby of the Gardens , and lived in the palace all alone , with ever so many dolls , so people rang the bell , and up she got out of her bed , though it was past six o'clock , and she lighted a candle and opened the door in her nighty , and then they all cried with great rejoicings , ` Hail , Queen of England ! '"
What puzzled David most was how she knew where the matches were kept .
The Big Penny is a statue about her .
"Next we come to the Hump , which is the part of the Broad Walk where all the big races are run ; and even though you had no intention of running you do run when you come to the Hump , it is such a fascinating , slide-down kind of place ."
"Often you stop when you have run about half-way down it , and then you are lost ; but there is another little wooden house near here , called the Lost House , and so you tell the man that you are lost and then he finds you ."
"It is glorious fun racing down the Hump , but you ca n't do it on windy days because then you are not there , but the fallen leaves do it instead of you ."
There is almost nothing that has such a keen sense of fun as a fallen leaf .
"From the Hump we can see the gate that is called after Miss Mabel Grey , the Fig I promised to tell you about ."
"There were always two nurses with her , or else one mother and one nurse , and for a long time she was a pattern-child who always coughed off the table and said , ` How do you do ? '"
"to the other Figs , and the only game she played at was flinging a ball gracefully and letting the nurse bring it back to her ."
"Then one day she tired of it all and went mad-dog , and , first , to show that she really was mad-dog , she unloosened both her boot-laces and put out her tongue east , west , north , and south ."
"She then flung her sash into a puddle and danced on it till dirty water was squirted over her frock , after which she climbed the fence and had a series of incredible adventures , one of the least of which was that she kicked off both her boots ."
"At last she came to the gate that is now called after her , out of which she ran into streets David and I have never been in though we have heard them roaring , and still she ran on and would never again have been heard of had not her mother jumped into a ` bus and thus overtaken her ."
"It all happened , I should say , long ago , and this is not the Mabel Grey whom David knows ."
"-LSB- Illustration : There is almost nothing that has such a keen sense of fun as a fallen leaf -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- Returning up the Broad Walk we have on our right the Baby Walk , which is so full of perambulators that you could cross from side to side stepping on babies , but the nurses wo n't let you do it ."
"From this walk a passage called Bunting 's Thumb , because it is that length , leads into Picnic Street , where there are real kettles , and chestnut-blossom falls into your mug as you are drinking ."
"Quite common children picnic here also , and the blossom falls into their mugs just the same ."
"Next comes St. Govor 's Well , which was full of water when Malcolm the Bold fell into it ."
"He was his mother 's favourite , and he let her put her arm round his neck in public because she was a widow ; but he was also partial to adventures , and liked to play with a chimney-sweep who had killed a good many bears ."
"The sweep 's name was Sooty , and one day , when they were playing near the well , Malcolm fell in and would have been drowned had not Sooty dived in and rescued him ; and the water had washed Sooty clean , and he now stood revealed as Malcolm 's long-lost father ."
So Malcolm would not let his mother put her arm round his neck any more .
"Dan dropped asleep at once , and slept heavily for several hours ; then his foot began to throb and ache , and he awoke to toss about uneasily , trying not to groan lest any one should hear him , for he was a brave lad , and did bear pain like `` a little Spartan , '' as Mr. Bhaer called him ."
"Mrs. Jo had a way of flitting about the house at night , to shut the windows if the wind grew chilly , to draw mosquito curtains over Teddy , or look after Tommy , who occasionally walked in his sleep ."
"The least noise waked her , and as she often heard imaginary robbers , cats , and conflagrations , the doors stood open all about , so her quick ear caught the sound of Dan 's little moans , and she was up in a minute ."
"He was just giving his hot pillow a despairing thump when a light came glimmering through the hall , and Mrs. Jo crept in , looking like a droll ghost , with her hair in a great knob on the top of her head , and a long gray dressing-gown trailing behind her ."
"`` Are you in pain , Dan ? ''"
`` It 's pretty bad ; but I did n't mean to wake you . ''
"`` I 'm a sort of owl , always flying about at night ."
"Yes , your foot is like fire ; the bandages must be wet again , '' and away flapped the maternal owl for more cooling stuff , and a great mug of ice water ."
"`` Oh , that 's so nice ! ''"
"sighed Dan , the wet bandages went on again , and a long draught of water cooled his thirsty throat ."
"`` There , now , sleep your best , and do n't be frightened if you see me again , for I 'll slip down by and by , and give you another sprinkle . ''"
"As she spoke , Mrs. Jo stooped to turn the pillow and smooth the bed-clothes , when , to her great surprise , Dan put his arm around her neck , drew her face down to his , and kissed her , with a broken `` Thank you , ma'am , '' which said more than the most eloquent speech could have done ; for the hasty kiss , the muttered words , meant , `` I 'm sorry , I will try . ''"
"She understood it , accepted the unspoken confession , and did not spoil it by any token of surprise ."
"She only remembered that he had no mother , kissed the brown cheek half hidden on the pillow , as if ashamed of the little touch of tenderness , and left him , saying , what he long remembered , `` You are my boy now , and if you choose you can make me proud and glad to say so . ''"
"Once again , just at dawn , she stole down to find him so fast asleep that he did not wake , and showed no sign of consciousness as she wet his foot , except that the lines of pain smoothed themselves away , and left his face quite peaceful ."
"The day was Sunday , and the house so still that he never waked till near noon , and , looking round him , saw an eager little face peering in at the door ."
"He held out his arms , and Teddy tore across the room to cast himself bodily upon the bed , shouting , `` My Danny 's tum ! ''"
as he hugged and wriggled with delight .
"Mrs. Bhaer appeared next , bringing breakfast , and never seeming to see how shamefaced Dan looked at the memory of the little scene last night ."
"Teddy insisted on giving him his `` betfus , '' and fed him like a baby , which , as he was not very hungry , Dan enjoyed very much ."
"Then came the doctor , and the poor Spartan had a bad time of it , for some of the little bones in his foot were injured , and putting them to rights was such a painful job , that Dan 's lips were white , and great drops stood on his forehead , though he never cried out , and only held Mrs. Jo 's hand so tight that it was red long afterwards ."
"`` You must keep this boy quiet , for a week at least , and not let him put his foot to the ground ."
"By that time , I shall know whether he may hop a little with a crutch , or stick to his bed for a while longer , '' said Dr. Firth , putting up the shining instruments that Dan did not like to see ."
"`` It will get well sometime , wo n't it ? ''"
"he asked , looking alarmed at the word `` crutches . ''"
"`` I hope so ; '' and with that the doctor departed , leaving Dan much depressed ; for the loss of a foot is a dreadful calamity to an active boy ."
"`` Do n't be troubled , I am a famous nurse , and we will have you tramping about as well as ever in a month , '' said Mrs. Jo , taking a hopeful view of the case ."
"But the fear of being lame haunted Dan , and even Teddy 's caresses did not cheer him ; so Mrs. Jo proposed that one or two of the boys should come in and pay him a little visit , and asked whom he would like to see ."
"`` Nat and Demi ; I 'd like my hat too , there 's something in it I guess they 'd like to see ."
I suppose you threw away my bundle of plunder ? ''
"said Dan , looking rather anxious as he put the question ."
"`` No , I kept it , for I thought they must be treasures of some kind , you took such care of them ; '' and Mrs. Jo brought him his old straw hat stuck full of butterflies and beetles , and a handkerchief containing a collection of odd things picked up on his way : birds ' eggs , carefully done up in moss , curious shells and stones , bits of fungus , and several little crabs , in a state of great indignation at their imprisonment ."
"Well, in she came."
"""Can you wash this shirt clean, lassie you?"" said he."
"""I don't know,"" she said, ""but I think I can."""
"And almost before she had taken it and dipped it in the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still."
"""Yes; you are the lassie for me,"" said the Prince."
"At that the old hag flew into such a rage, she burst on the spot, and the Princess with the long nose after her, and the whole pack of Trolls after her at least I've never heard a word about them since."
"As for the Prince and Princess, they set free all the poor Christian folk who had been carried off and shut up there; and they took with them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as far as they could from the Castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon."
THE BLUE BELT
"Once on a time there was an old beggar-woman, who had gone out to beg."
"She had a little lad with her, and when she had got her bag full she struck across the hills towards her own home. So when they had gone a bit up the hill-side, they came upon a little Blue Belt which lay where two paths met, and the lad asked his mother's leave to pick it up."
"""No,"" said she, ""maybe there's witchcraft in it;"" and so with threats she forced him to follow her. But when they had gone a bit further, the lad said he must turn aside a moment out of the road; and meanwhile his mother sat down on a tree-stump. But the lad was a long time gone, for as soon as he got so far into the wood that the old dame could not see him, he ran off to where the Belt lay, took it up, tied it round his waist, and lo! he felt as strong as if he could lift the whole hill. When he got back, the old dame was in a great rage, and wanted to know what he had been doing all that while. ""You don't care how much time you waste, and yet you know the night is drawing on, and we must cross the hill before it is dark!"" So on they tramped; but when they had got about half-way, the old dame grew weary, and said she must rest under a bush."
"""Dear mother,"" said the lad, ""mayn't I just go up to the top of this high crag while you rest, and try if I can't see some sign of folk hereabouts?"""
Yes! he might do that; so when he had got to the top he saw a light shining from the north. So he ran down and told his mother.
"""We must get on, mother; we are near a house, for I see a bright light shining quite close to us in the north."" Then she rose and shouldered her bag, and set off to see; but they hadn't gone far, before there stood a steep spur of the hill, right across their path."
"""Just as I thought!"" said the old dame, ""now we can't go a step farther; a pretty bed we shall have here!"""
"But the lad took the bag under one arm, and his mother under the other, and ran straight up the steep crag with them."
"""Now, don't you see? Don't you see that we are close to a house? Don't you see that bright light?"""
"But the old dame said those were no Christian folk, but Trolls, for she was at home in all that forest far and near, and knew there was not a living soul in it, until you were well over the ridge and had come down on the other side. But they went on, and in a little while they came to a great house which was all painted red."
"""What's the good?"" said the old dame. ""We daren't go in, for here the Trolls live."""
"""Don't say so; we must go in. There must be men where the lights shine so,"" said the lad. So in he went, and his mother after him, but he had scarce opened the door before she swooned away, for there she saw a great stout man, at least twenty feet high, sitting on the bench."
"""Good evening, grandfather!"" said the lad."
"""Well, here I've sat three hundred years,"" said the man who sat on the bench, ""and no one has ever come and called me grandfather before."""
"Then the lad sat down by the man's side, and began to talk to him as if they had been old friends."
"""But what's come over your mother?"" said the man, after they had chatted a while. ""I think she swooned away; you had better look after her."""
"So the lad went and took hold of the old dame, and dragged her up the hall along the floor. That brought her to herself, and she kicked and scratched, and flung herself about, and at last sat down upon a heap of firewood in the corner; but she was so frightened that she scarce dared to look one in the face."
"After a while, the lad asked if they could spend the night there."
"""Yes, to be sure,"" said the man."
"So they went on talking again, but the lad soon got hungry, and wanted to know if they could get food as well as lodging."
"""Of course,"" said the man, ""that might be got too."" And after he had sat a while longer, he rose up and threw six loads of dry pitch-pine on the fire. This made the old hag still more afraid."
"""Oh! now he's going to roast us alive,"" she said, in the corner where she sat."
"And when the wood had burned down to glowing embers, up got the man and strode out of his house."
And he told them all about it.
"But they all happened to have engagements for that evening; so they praised John's cleverness, and said they were quite content to leave the matter in his hands."
"""But what about my baby?"" said John."
"""Oh, well,"" said the mayor, ""if anything should happen, you will always be able to remember that your baby perished in a good cause."""
"So John went home again, and told his wife some of the tale."
"""You've given the baby to the dragon!"" she cried. ""Oh, you unnatural parent!"""
"""Hush,"" said John, and he told her some more. ""Now,"" he said, ""I'm going down. After I've been down you can go, and if you keep your head the boy will be all right."""
"So down went the blacksmith, and there was the dragon purring away with all his might to keep the baby quiet."
"""Hurry up, can't you?"" he said. ""I can't keep up this noise all night."""
"""I'm very sorry, sir,"" said the blacksmith, ""but all the shops are shut."
"The job must wait till the morning. And don't forget you've promised to take care of that baby. You'll find it a little wearing, I'm afraid."
"Good night, sir."""
"The dragon had purred till he was quite out of breath so now he stopped, and as soon as everything was quiet the baby thought everyone must have settled for the night, and that it was time to begin to scream. So it began."
"""Oh, dear,"" said the dragon, ""this is awful."" He patted the baby with his claw, but it screamed more than ever."
"""And I am so tired too,"" said the dragon. ""I did so hope I should have a good night."""
The baby went on screaming.
"""There'll be no peace for me after this,"" said the dragon. ""It's enough to ruin one's nerves. Hush, then did 'ums, then."" And he tried to quiet the baby as if it had been a young dragon. But when he began to sing ""Hush-a-by, Dragon,"" the baby screamed more and more and more. ""I can't keep it quiet,"" said the dragon; and then suddenly he saw a woman sitting on the steps. ""Here, I say,"" said he, ""do you know anything about babies?"""
"""I do, a little,"" said the mother."
"""Then I wish you'd take this one, and let me get some sleep,"" said the dragon, yawning. ""You can bring it back in the morning before the blacksmith comes."""
"So the mother picked up the baby and took it upstairs and told her husband, and they went to bed happy, for they had caught the dragon and saved the baby."
"And next day John went down and explained carefully to the dragon exactly how matters stood, and he got an iron gate with a grating to it and set it up at the foot of the steps, and the dragon mewed furiously for days and days, but when he found it was no good he was quiet."
"So now John went to the mayor, and said: ""I've got the dragon and I've saved the town."""
"""Noble preserver,"" cried the mayor, ""we will get up a subscription for you, and crown you in public with a laurel wreath."""
"So the mayor put his name down for five pounds, and the corporation each gave three, and other people gave their guineas and half guineas and half crowns and crowns, and while the subscription was being made the mayor ordered three poems at his own expense from the town poet to celebrate the occasion. The poems were very much more admired, especially by the mayor and corporation."
"The first poem dealt with the noble conduct of the mayor in arranging to have the dragon tied up. The second described the splendid assistance rendered by the corporation. And the third expressed the pride and joy of the poet in being permitted to sing such deeds, beside which the actions of St. George must appear quite commonplace to all with a feeling heart or a well-balanced brain."
"When the subscription was finished there was a thousand pounds, and a committee was formed to settle what should be done with it. A third of it went to pay for a banquet to the mayor and corporation; another third was spent in buying a gold collar with a dragon on it for the mayor and gold medals with dragons on them for the corporation; and what was left went in committee expenses."
"So there was nothing for the blacksmith except the laurel wreath and the knowledge that it really was he who had saved the town. But after this things went a little better with the blacksmith. To begin with, the baby did not cry so much as it had before. Then the rich lady who owned the goat was so touched by John's noble action that she ordered a complete set of shoes at 2 shillings, 4 pence, and even made it up to 2 shillings, 6 pence, in grateful recognition of his public-spirited conduct. Then tourists used to come in breaks from quite a long way off, and pay twopence each to go down the steps and peep through the iron grating at the rusty dragon in the dungeon and it was threepence extra for each party if the blacksmith let off colored fire to see it by, which, as the fire was extremely short, was twopence-halfpenny clear profit every time. And the blacksmith's wife used to provide teas at ninepence a head, and altogether things grew brighter week by week."
"The baby named John, after his father, and called Johnnie for short began presently to grow up. He was great friends with Tina, the daughter of the whitesmith, who lived nearly opposite. She was a dear little girl with yellow pigtails and blue eyes, and she was tired of hearing the story of how Johnnie, when he was a baby, had been minded by a real dragon."
"The two children used to go together to peep through the iron grating at the dragon, and sometimes they would hear him mew piteously. And they would light a halfpenny's worth of colored fire to look at him by. And they grew older and wiser."
"At last one day the mayor and corporation, hunting the hare in their gold gowns, came screaming back to the town gates with the news that a lame, humpy giant, as big as a tin church, was coming over the marshes toward the town."
"""We're lost,"" said the mayor. ""I'd give a thousand pounds to anyone who could keep that giant out of the town. I know what he eats by his teeth."""
"No one seemed to know what to do. But Johnnie and Tina were listening, and they looked at each other, and ran off as fast as their boots would carry them."
"No! They are placed right for you to look at other people, and are where they help you hunt for food."""
"""How often may I look at my own feathers?"" asked the young Woodpecker."
"He was wondering at that minute how his tail looked, but he was determined not to turn his head."
"The old Woodpecker's eyes twinkled. ""I should think,"" he said, ""that since you are young and have no family to look after, you might preen your feathers in the morning and in the afternoon and when you go to sleep. Then, of course, when it is stormy, you will have to take your waterproof out of the pocket under your tail, and put it on one feather at a time, as all birds do. That would be often enough unless something happened to rumple them."""
"""I will not look at them any oftener,"" said the young Red-headed Woodpecker, firmly. ""I will not be called a silly fellow."" And he was as good as his word."
"His mother sighed when she heard of the change. ""I am very glad,"" said she. ""But isn't that always the way? His father and I have talked and talked, and it made no difference; but let somebody else say he is silly and vain, and behold!"""
THE NIGHT MOTH WITH A CROOKED FEELER
"The beautiful, brilliant Butterflies of the Meadow had many cousins living in the forest, most of whom were Night Moths. They also were very beautiful creatures, but they dressed in duller colors and did not have slender waists. Some of the Butterflies, you know, wear whole gowns of black and yellow, others have stripes of black and white, while some have clear yellow with only a bit of black trimming the edges of the wings."
"The Moths usually wear brown and have it brightened with touches of buff or dull blue. If they do wear bright colors, it is only on the back pair of wings, and when the Moth alights, he slides his front pair of wings over these and covers all the brightness. They do not rest with their wings folded over their heads like the Butterflies, but leave them flat."
"All the day long, when the sun is shining, the Moths have to rest on trees and dead leaves. If they were dressed in yellow or red, any passing bird would see them, and there is no telling what might happen."
"As it is, their brown wings are so nearly the color of dead leaves or bark that you might often look right at them without seeing them."
"Yet even among Moths there are some more brightly colored than others, and when you find part of the family quietly dressed you can know it is because they have to lay the eggs. Moths are safer in dull colors, and the egg-layers should always be the safest of all. If anything happened to them, you know, there would be no Caterpillar babies."
"One day a fine-looking Cecropia Moth came out of her chrysalis and clung to the nearest twig while her wings grew and dried and flattened. At first they had looked like tiny brown leaves all drenched with rain and wrinkled by somebody's stepping on them. The fur on her fat body was matted and wet, and even her feelers were damp and stuck to her head."
"Her six beautiful legs were weak and trembling, and she moved her body restlessly while she tried again and again to raise her crumpled wings."
"She had not been there so very long before she noticed another Cecropia Moth near her, clinging to the under side of a leaf. He was also just out of the chrysalis and was drying himself. ""Good morning!"" he cried."
"""I think I knew you when we were Caterpillars. Fine day to break the chrysalis, isn't it?"""
"""Lovely,"" she answered. ""I remember you very well. You were the Caterpillar who showed me where to find food last summer when the hot weather had withered so many of the plants."""
"""I thought you would recall me,"" he said. ""And when we were spinning our chrysalides we visited together. Do you remember that also?"""
"Miss Cecropia did. She had been thinking of that when she first spoke, but she hoped he had forgotten. To tell the truth, he had been rather fond of her the fall before, and she, thinking him the handsomest Caterpillar of her acquaintance, had smiled upon him and suggested that they spin their cocoons near together. During the long winter she had regretted this. ""I was very foolish,"" she thought, ""to encourage him."
"When I get my wings I may meet people who are better off than he. Now I shall have to be polite to him for the sake of old friendship. I only hope that he will make other acquaintances and leave me free. I must get into the best society."""
"All this time her neighbor was thinking, ""I am so glad to see her again, so glad, so glad! When my wings are dry I will fly over to her and we will go through the forest together."" He was a kind, warm-hearted fellow, who cared more for friendship than for beauty or family."
"Meanwhile their wings were growing fast, and drying, and flattening, so that by noon they could begin to raise them above their heads. They were very large Moths and their wings were of a soft dust color with little clear, transparent places in them and touches of the most beautiful blue, quite the shade worn by the Peacock, who lived on the farm. There was a brown and white border to their wings, and on their bodies and legs the fur was white and dark orange. When the Cecropias rest, they spread their wings out flat, and do not slide the front pair over the others as their cousins, the Sphinxes, do. The most wonderful of all, though, are their feelers."
"The Butterflies have stiff feelers on their heads with little knobs on the ends, or sometimes with part of them thick like tiny clubs. The Night Moths have many kinds of feelers, most of them being curved, and those of the Cecropias look like reddish-brown feathers pointed at the end."
"Miss Cecropia's feelers were perfect, and she waved them happily to and fro. Those of her friend, she was troubled to see, were not what they should have been. One of them was all right, the other was small and crooked. ""Oh dear,"" she said to herself, ""how that does look! I hope he will not try to be attentive to me."" He did not mind it much. He thought about other things than looks."
"As night came, a Polyphemus Moth fluttered past. ""Good evening!"" cried he. ""Are you just out? There are a lot of Cecropias coming out to-day."""
"Miss Cecropia felt quite agitated when she heard this, and wondered if she looked all right. Her friend flew over to her just as she raised her wings for flight. ""Let me go with you,"" he said."
"While she was wondering how she could answer him, several other Cecropias came along. They were all more brightly colered than she."
"""Hullo!"" cried one of them, as he alighted beside her. ""First-rate night, isn't it?"""
"He was a handsome fellow, and his feelers were perfect; but Miss Cecropia did not like his ways, and she drew away from him just as her friend knocked him off the branch. While they were fighting, another of the strangers flew to her. ""May I sit here?"" he asked."
"""Yes,"" she murmured, thinking her chance had come to get into society."
"""I must say that it served the fellow right for his rudeness to you,"""
"At that minute the great Black Brahma Cock came up behind Mr. Crow. He had heard from the Hens how rude Mr. Crow had been, and he thought that as the head of the house he ought to see about it. Well! one cannot say very much about what happened next, but the Black Brahma Cock did see about it quite thoroughly, and when the Hen-house door swung open, it was a limp, ragged, and meek-looking Crow who came out, leaving many of his feathers inside."
"The next morning Mr. Crow flew over the forest and far away. He did not want to go back there again. He heard voices as he passed a tall tree by the edge of the forest. Miss Crow was out with the Crow whom he had beaten, and they were looking for a good place in which to build. ""I don't think they will know me if they see me,"" said Mr. Crow, ""and I am sure that I don't want them to."""
THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER CHILDREN
Mrs. Red-headed Woodpecker bent her handsome head down and listened.
"""Yes, it is! It certainly is!"" she cried, as she heard for a second time the faint ""tap-tap-tap"" of a tiny beak rapping on the inside of an egg shell. She hopped to one side of her nest and stood looking at the four white eggs that lay there. Soon the rapping was heard again and she saw one of them move a bit on its bed of chips."
"""So it is that one,"" she cried. ""I thought it would be. I was certain that I laid that one first."" And she arched her neck proudly, as the beak of her eldest child came through a crack in the shell. Now nobody else could have told one egg from another, but mothers have a way of remembering such things, and it may be because they love their children so that sometimes their sight is a little sharper, and their hearing a little keener than anybody else's."
"However that may be, she stood watching while the tiny bird chipped away the shell and squeezed out of the opening he had made. She did not even touch a piece of the shell until he was well out of it, for she knew that it is always better for children to help themselves when they can."
"It makes them strong and fits them for life. When the little Red-headed Woodpecker had struggled free, she took the broken pieces in her beak and carried them far from the nest before dropping them to the ground."
"If she had done the easiest thing and let them fall by the foot of the hollow tree where she lived, any prowling Weasel or Blue Jay might have seen them and watched for a chance to reach her babies. And that would have been very sad for the babies."
"The newly hatched bird was a tired little fellow, and the first thing he did was to take a nap. He was cold, too, although the weather was fine and sunshiny. His down was all wet from the moisture inside the egg, and you can imagine how he felt, after growing for so long inside a warm, snug shell, to suddenly be without it and know that he could never again have it around him. Even if it had been whole once more, he could not have been packed into it, for he had been stretching and growing every minute since he left it. It is for this reason that the barn-yard people have a wise saying: ""A hatched chicken never returns to his shell."""
"When Mrs. Red-headed Woodpecker came back, she covered her shivering little one with her downy breast, and there he slept, while she watched for her husband's coming, and thought how pleased and proud he would be to see the baby. They were a young couple, and this was their first child."
"But who can tell what the other three children, who had not cracked the shell, were thinking? Could they remember the time when they began to be? Could they dream of what would happen after they were hatched? Could they think at all? They were tiny, weak creatures, curled up within their shells, with food packed all around them. There had been a time when they were only streaks in the yellow liquid of the eggs. Now they were almost ready to leave this for a fuller, freer life, where they could open their bills and flutter their wings, and stretch their legs and necks. It had been a quiet, sheltered time in the shell; why should they leave it? Ah, but they must leave it, for they were healthy and growing, and when they had done so, they would forget all about it. By the time they could talk, and that would be very soon, they would have forgotten all that happened before they were hatched. That is why you can never get a bird to tell you what he thought about while in the egg."
"After the young Woodpecker's three sisters reached the outside world, the father and mother were kept busy hunting food for them, and they were alone much of the time. It was not long before they knew their parents' voices, although, once in a while, before they got their eyes open, they mistook the call of the Tree Frog below for that of the Woodpeckers. And this was not strange, for each says, ""Ker-r-ruck!"
"Ker-r-ruck!"" and when the Tree Frog was singing in his home at the foot of the tree, the four Woodpecker children, in their nest-hollow far above his head, would be opening their bills and stretching their necks, and wondering why no juicy and delicious morsel was dropped down their throats."
"When they had their eyes open there was much to be seen. At least, they thought so. Was there not the hollow in their dear, dry old tree, a hollow four or five times as high as they could reach? Their mother had told them how their father and she had dug it out with their sharp, strong bills, making it roomy at the bottom, and leaving a doorway at the top just large enough for them to pass through. Part of the chips they had taken away, as the mother had taken the broken shells, and part had been left in the bottom of the hollow for the children to lie on. ""I don't believe in grass, hair, and down, as a bed for children,"" their father had said. ""Nice soft chips are far better."""
"And the Woodpecker children liked the chips, and played with them, and pretended that they were grubs to be caught with their long and bony tongues; only of course they never swallowed them."
"It was an exciting time when their feathers began to grow. Until then they had been clothed in down; but now the tiny quills came pricking through their skin, and it was not so pleasant to snuggle up to each other as it had once been. Now, too, the eldest of the family began to show a great fault. He was very vain. You can imagine how sorry his parents were."
Every morning when he awakened he looked first of all at his feathers.
"Those on his breast were white, and he had a white band on his wings."
"His tail and back and nearly the whole of his wings were blue-black. His head, neck, and throat were crimson. To be sure, while the feathers were growing, the colors were not very bright, for the down was mixed with them, and the quills showed so plainly that the young birds looked rather streaked."
"The sisters were getting their new suits at the same time, and there was just as much reason why they should be vain, but they were not. They were glad (as who would not be?) and they often said to each other: ""How pretty you are growing!"" They looked exactly like their brother, for it is not with the Woodpeckers as with many other birds, the sons and daughters are dressed in precisely the same way."
"As for the vain young Woodpecker, he had many troubles. He was not contented to let his feathers grow as the grass and the leaves grow, without watching. No indeed! He looked at each one every day and a great many times every day. Then, if he thought they were not growing as fast as they should, he worried about it. He wanted to hurry them along, and sometimes, when his sisters did not seem to be looking, he took hold of them with his bill and pulled. Of course this did not make them grow any faster and it did make his skin very sore, but how was he to know? He had not been out of the shell long enough to be wise."
"It troubled him, too, because he could not see his red feathers. He twisted his head this way and that, and strained his eyes until they ached, trying to see his own head and neck. It was very annoying. He thought it would have been much nicer to have the brightest feathers in a fellow's tail, where he could see them, or at any rate on his breast; and he asked his mother why it couldn't be so."
"""I once knew a young Woodpecker,"" she said, ""who thought of very little but his own beauty. I am afraid that if he had been allowed to wear his red feathers in his tail, he would never have seen anything else in this wonderful great world, but just his own poor little tail."" She looked out of the doorway as she spoke, but he knew that she meant him."
"Things went on in this way until the children were ready to fly. Then there were daily lessons in flying, alighting, clinging to branches, and tapping for food on the bark of trees. They learned, too, how to support themselves with their stiff tails when they were walking up trees or stopping to eat with their claws hooked into the bark. Then Mrs."
"Red-headed Woodpecker taught them how to tell the ripest and sweetest fruit on the trees before they tasted it. That is something many people would like to know, but it is a forest secret, and no bird will tell anyone who cannot fly."
"It was on his way back from an orchard one day, that the vain young Woodpecker stopped to talk with an old Gray Squirrel. It may be that the Gray Squirrel's sight was not good, and so he mistook the Woodpecker for quite another fellow. He was speaking of an old tree where he had spent the last winter. ""I believe a family of Red-headed Woodpeckers live there now,"" he said. ""I have met them once or twice. The father and mother are fine people, and they have charming daughters, but their son must be a great trial to them. He is one of these silly fellows who see the world through their own feathers."""
"As the young Red-headed Woodpecker flew away, he repeated this to himself: ""A silly fellow, a silly fellow, who sees the world through his own feathers."" And he said to his father, ""Whose feathers must I look through?"""
"This puzzled his father. ""Whose feathers should you look through?"" said he. ""What do you mean?"""
"""Well,"" answered the son, ""somebody said that I saw the world through my own feathers, and I don't see how I can get anybody else's."""
"How his father did laugh! ""I don't see why you should look through any feathers,"" said he. ""What he meant was that you thought so much of your own plumage that you did not care for anything else; and it is so. If it were intended you should look at yourself all the time, your eyes would have been one under your chin and the other in the back of your head."
"But there after a while, Halvor went about, and was so strange and dull and silent. Then the Princesses asked him what he lacked, and if he didn't like to live with them any longer? Yes, he did, for they had enough and to spare, and he was well off in every way, but still somehow or other he did so long to go home, for his father and mother were alive, and them he had such a great wish to see."
"Well, they thought that might be done easily enough."
"""You shall go thither and come back hither, safe and unscathed, if you will only follow our advice,"" said the Princesses."
"Yes, he'd be sure to mind all they said. So they dressed him up till he was as grand as a king's son, and then they set a ring on his finger, and that was such a ring, he could wish himself thither and hither with it; but they told him to be sure and not take it off, and not to name their names, for there would be an end of all his bravery, and then he'd never see them more."
"""If I only stood at home I'd be glad,"" said Halvor; and it was done as he had wished. Then stood Halvor at his father's cottage door before he knew a word about it. Now it was about dusk at even, and so, when they saw such a grand stately lord walk in, the old couple got so afraid they began to bow and scrape. Then Halvor asked if he couldn't stay there, and have a lodging there that night. No; that he couldn't."
"""We can't do it at all,"" they said, ""for we haven't this thing or that thing which such a lord is used to have; 'twere best your lordship went up to the farm, no long way off, for you can see the chimneys, and there they have lots of everything."""
"Halvor wouldn't hear of it he wanted to stop; but the old couple stuck to their own, that he had better go to the farmer's; there he would get both meat and drink; as for them, they hadn't even a chair to offer him to sit down on."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go up there till to-morrow early, but let me just stay here to-night; worst come to the worst, I can sit in the chimney corner."""
"Well, they couldn't say anything against that; so Halvor sat down by the ingle, and began to poke about in the ashes, just as he used to do when he lay at home in old days, and stretched his lazy bones."
"Well, they chattered and talked about many things; and they told Halvor about this thing and that; and so he asked them if they had never had any children."
"Yes, yes, they had once a lad whose name was Halvor, but they didn't know whither he had wandered; they couldn't even tell whether he were dead or alive."
"""Couldn't it be me, now?"" said Halvor."
"""Let me see; I could tell him well enough,"" said the old wife, and rose up. ""Our Halvor was so lazy and dull, he never did a thing; and besides, he was so ragged, that one tatter took hold of the next tatter on him. No; there never was the making of such a fine fellow in him as you are, master."""
"A little while after the old wife went to the hearth to poke up the fire, and when the blaze fell on Halvor's face, just as when he was at home of old poking about in the ashes, she knew him at once."
"""Ah! but it is you after all, Halvor?"" she cried; and then there was such joy for the old couple, there was no end to it; and he was forced to tell how he had fared, and the old dame was so fond and proud of him, nothing would do but he must go up at once to the farmer's, and show himself to the lassies, who had always looked down on him. And off she went first, and Halvor followed after. So, when she got up there, she told them all how Halvor had come home again, and now they should only just see how grand he was, for, said she, ""he looks like nothing but a King's son."""
"""All very fine,"" said the lassies, and tossed up their heads. ""We'll be bound he's just the same beggarly ragged boy he always was."""
"Just then in walked Halvor, and then the lassies were all so taken aback, they forgot their sarks in the ingle, where they were sitting darning their clothes, and ran out in their smocks. Well, when they were got back again, they were so shamefaced they scarce dared look at Halvor, towards whom they had always been proud and haughty."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""you always thought yourselves so pretty and neat, no one could come near you; but now you should just see the eldest Princess I have set free; against her you look just like milkmaids, and the midmost is prettier still; but the youngest, who is my sweetheart, she's fairer than both sun and moon. Would to Heaven they were only here,"" said Halvor, ""then you'd see what you would see."""
"He had scarce uttered these words before there they stood, but then he felt so sorry, for now what they had said came into his mind. Up at the farm there was a great feast got ready for the Princesses, and much was made of them, but they wouldn't stop there."
"""No, we want to go down to your father and mother,"" they said to Halvor; ""and so we'll go out now and look about us."""
"So he went down with them, and they came to a great lake just outside the farm. Close by the water was such a lovely green bank; here the Princesses said they would sit and rest a while; they thought it so sweet to sit down and look over the water."
"So they sat down there, and when they had sat a while the youngest Princess said:"
"""I may as well comb your hair a little, Halvor."""
"Well, Halvor laid his head on her lap, and she combed his bonny locks, and it wasn't long before Halvor fell fast asleep. Then she took the ring from his finger, and put another in its stead; and she said:"
"""Now hold me all together! and now would we were all in Soria Moria Castle."""
"So when Halvor woke up, he could very well tell that he had lost the Princesses, and began to weep and wail; and he was so downcast, they couldn't comfort him at all. In spite of all his father and mother said, he wouldn't stop there, but took farewell of them, and said he was safe not to see them again; for if he couldn't find the Princesses again, he thought it not worth while to live."
"Well, he had still about sixty pounds left, so he put them into his pocket, and set out on his way. So, when he had walked a while, he met a man with a tidy horse, and he wanted to buy it, and began to chaffer with the man."
"""Aye,"" said the man, ""to tell the truth, I never thought of selling him; but if we could strike a bargain perhaps """
"""What do you want for him?"" asked Halvor."
"""I didn't give much for him, nor is he worth much; he's a brave horse to ride, but he can't draw at all; still he's strong enough to carry your knapsack and you too, turn and turn about,"" said the man."
"At last they agreed on the price, and Halvor laid the knapsack on him, and so he walked a bit, and rode a bit, turn and turn about. At night he came to a green plain where stood a great tree, at the roots of which he sat down. There he let the horse loose, but he didn't lie down to sleep, but opened his knapsack and took a meal. At peep of day off he set again, for he could take no rest. So he rode and walked and walked and rode the whole day through the wide wood, where there were so many green spots and glades that shone so bright and lovely between the trees. He didn't know at all where he was or whither he was going, but he gave himself no more time to rest than when his horse cropped a bit of grass, and he took a snack out of his knapsack when they came to one of those green glades. So he went on walking and riding by turns, and as for the wood there seemed to be no end to it."
But at dusk the next day he saw a light gleaming away through the trees.
"""Theirs not to make reply,    Theirs not to reason why,    Theirs but to do and die:"
"Into the valley of Death    Rode the six hundred."""
"On every side thundered the enemy's guns, and shot and shell fell thick and fast, but on through all rode the brave horsemen, on till they reached the cannon at the end of the valley. The smoke of the enemy's fire closed round and hid them from their watching comrades, but now and again the scarlet lines could be seen cutting down those who tried to stop their charge."
"""Flashed all their sabres bare,    Flashed as they turned in air,    Sabring the gunners there,    Charging an army, while    All the world wonder'd."""
"And then only, when the strange order had been obeyed, when their duty had been nobly done in the face of death, did the Light Brigade all that was left of it turn to ride back. Alas! there were not then six hundred. Barely two hundred brave men, wounded, and blackened by smoke and powder, reached the British camp. The rest of the noble band lay dead or dying in the valley of Death."
"""When can their glory fade?"
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wonder'd.
Honour the charge they made!
"Honour the Light Brigade,    Noble six hundred!"""
The Coronation of King Edward VII
"Never had a country a more popular king than King Edward VII, nor a more gracious queen than Queen Alexandra, and never was a happier day for the English people than that on which King Edward was crowned. A few days before the date fixed for the Coronation the king suddenly became ill, and a great gloom fell over the country, for it was feared that he might never be crowned. But though his illness was severe he soon began to get better, and when he was out of danger the hearts of his subjects were filled with joy and thankfulness. Guns were fired, church-bells pealed, and glad shouts and cheers rang out from the happy crowds which lined the streets of London, through which the king and queen, in the midst of their gay procession, drove to Westminster Abbey."
"Inside the gray old Abbey was one of the most brilliant gatherings the world has ever seen. Princes and princesses from other lands were there, in their robes of state; peers and peeresses, in velvet, and ermine, and glittering diamonds; grave statesmen; and soldiers in their gay uniforms."
"It was a grand and solemn scene when, before them all, the aged Archbishop of Canterbury drew near to the King, and with trembling hands placed the crown upon his head."
"""The Lord give you a fruitful country, and healthful seasons, victorious fleets and armies, and a quiet Empire."" These are the words that the old man said when he had crowned the king, and each one of us will pray that all these blessings may indeed rest upon King Edward VII, and the great Empire over which he rules."
WAR.
"Over the broad, fair valley,     Filling the heart with fear,   Comes the sound of tramping horses,     And the news of danger near."
"'Tis the enemy approaching,     One can hear the muffled drum,   And the marching of the soldiers,     As on and on they come."
"Soon the air is rent in sunder,     Bullets flying sharp and fast,   Many stout hearts fail and tremble,     Every moment seems their last."
"On the ground lie dead and dying,     Young and old alike must fall;   None to come and aid the sufferer,     Fight they must for freedom's call."
"Many are the anxious loved ones     Praying for the war to cease,   Waiting for the right to conquer,     Bringing freedom, rest, and peace."
E.S.
A BOY'S HEROIC DEEDS.
"May 31st, 1889, is a day that will long be remembered with horror by the people in the beautiful valley of the Conemaugh, in Pennsylvania. On that date occurred the terrible disaster which is known to the world and will be named in history as the ""Johnstown Flood."""
"For many days previous to that date it had been raining hard, and great floods extended over a vast region of country in Pennsylvania, New York and the District of Columbia. Never before had there been such a fall of rain in that region within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. The waters in the river and creeks of that beautiful valley rose rapidly and overflowed their banks, while the people looked on in wonder, but seemingly not in fear. Suddenly there appeared to their wondering gaze a great bay horse galloping at break-neck speed and bearing a rider who waved his hands to them and cried: ""South Fork dam will burst. To the hills for your lives."" Only a few heeded his words of warning, while many mocked and jeered. On dashed the rider to warn still others of the impending danger, and, alas, to be himself and horse dashed to death by the massive timbers of a falling bridge. South Fork dam did break, and the mighty waters of Conemaugh Lake were hurled with resistless force upon the doomed people of that beautiful valley. The terrible details of the appalling disaster would fill several volumes larger than this. On rushed the mighty waters, sweeping onward in their flood dwellings, churches and buildings of every description, whether of wood, brick or stone, until Johnstown was reached and destroyed. The town was literally lifted from its foundations. Thousands of men, women and children were caught up and swirled away in the pitiless flood, and their agonizing but vain appeals for help could be heard amidst the mighty roar of the waters. Many acts of heroism were performed by brave men and women yes, and boys in rescuing victims of the flood. Only one of them concerns us here. Charles Hepenthal, a schoolboy, seventeen years of age, who was on his way to Bellefonte from his home at East Liberty, Pa., on the evening of the flood, stood quietly among the passengers on the express train, as they crowded to view the terrible havoc done by the flood. As the flood reached the train, at Sang Hollow, a small frame house came pitching down the mad tide, an eddy floated it in, near to the train, so close that the wailing cries of an infant were heard, piercing their way through the roar. Charles Hepenthal's heart was touched and his courage was equal to the emergency. He determined to rescue that little wailing waif from a watery grave. Strong men urged him to desist, insisting that he would only sacrifice his own life for nothing that it was impossible for any one to survive in the surging waters. But the boy was resolved."
"He cut the bell cord from the cars, tied it fast to his body, and out into the whirling gulf he went; he gained the house, secured the infant and returned through the maddened waters with the rescued babe in his arms. A shout went up from the passengers on the train. ""Wait!"" he cried; ""there is still another in the house, I must save her!"" and, seizing a plank to use as a support, he plunged again into the surging waters. Ah! his struggle this time was harder, for his precious load was heavy. In the floating house on his first visit he found a little girl, apparently ten years old, disrobed and kneeling beside her bed, on which lay the screaming infant, praying to her Father in heaven to save her and her baby brother from the fury of the flood. ""God has heard my prayer,"" she cried, as Charles entered the door. ""Oh, save the baby, quick,"" and then fainted away on the floor. When Charles had landed the babe in safety and returned again for the girl, he found her still unconscious on the floor, and the water was fast flowing in at the door."
"In another minute she would have been drowned. But the brave boy's manly arms were soon around her, and with his precious load the young hero fought his way back to land and was given three times three cheers and a ""tiger"" by the passengers of the day express."
A CAT'S EXTRAORDINARY LEAP.
"""Now you shall be as grieved as I was when you let out the star;"" and with these words she carried off the babe."
"But when those who were on the watch woke, they thought the queen had eaten her own child, and the old queen was all for burning her alive, but the Prince was so fond of her that at last he begged her off, but he had hard work to set her free."
"So the next time the young queen was to have a child, twice as strong a watch was set as the first time, but the same thing happened over again, only this time her Foster-mother said:"
"""Now you shall be as grieved as I was when you let the moon out."""
"And the queen begged and prayed, and wept; for when her Foster-mother was there, she could speak but it was all no good."
"And now the old queen said she must be burnt, but the Prince found means to beg her off. But when the third child was to be born, a watch was set three times as strong as the first, but just the same thing happened. Her Foster-mother came while the watch slept, took the babe, and cut its little finger, and smeared the queen's mouth with the blood, telling her now she should be as grieved as she had been when the Lassie let out the sun."
"And now the Prince could not save her any longer. She must and should be burnt. But just as they were leading her to the stake, all at once they saw her Foster-mother, who came with all three children two she led by the hand, and the third she had on her arm; and so she went up to the young queen and said:"
"""Here are your children; now you shall have them again. I am the Virgin Mary, and so grieved as you have been, so grieved was I when you let out sun, and moon, and star. Now you have been punished for what you did, and henceforth you shall have your speech."""
"How glad the Queen and Prince now were, all may easily think, but no one can tell. After that they were always happy; and from that day even the Prince's mother was very fond of the young queen."
THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO MIND THE HOUSE
"Once on a time there was a man, so surly and cross, he never thought his Wife did anything right in the house. So, one evening, in haymaking time, he came home, scolding and swearing, and showing his teeth and making a dust."
"""Dear love, don't be so angry; there's a good man,"" said his goody; ""to-morrow let's change our work. I'll go out with the mowers and mow, and you shall mind the house at home."""
"Yes! the Husband thought that would do very well. He was quite willing, he said."
"So, early next morning, his goody took a scythe over her neck, and went out into the hayfield with the mowers, and began to mow; but the man was to mind the house, and do the work at home."
"First of all, he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had churned a while, he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel of ale. So, just when he had knocked in the bung, and was putting the tap into the cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen. Then off he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as fast as he could, to look after the pig, lest it should upset the churn; but when he got up, and saw the pig had already knocked the churn over, and stood there, routing and grunting amongst the cream which was running all over the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot the ale-barrel, and ran at the pig as hard as he could. He caught it, too, just as it ran out of doors, and gave it such a kick, that piggy lay for dead on the spot. Then all at once he remembered he had the tap in his hand; but when he got down to the cellar, every drop of ale had run out of the cask."
"Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill the churn again, and so he began to churn, for butter they must have at dinner. When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milking cow was still shut up in the byre, and hadn't had a bit to eat or a drop to drink all the morning, though the sun was high. Then all at once he thought 'twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he'd just get her up on the house top for the house, you must know, was thatched with sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing there. Now the house lay close up against a steep down, and he thought if he laid a plank across to the thatch at the back he'd easily get the cow up."
"But still he couldn't leave the churn, for there was his little babe crawling about on the floor, and ""if I leave it,"" he thought, ""the child is safe to upset it."" So he took the churn on his back, and went out with it; but then he thought he'd better first water the cow before he turned her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw water out of the well; but, as he stooped down at the well's brink, all the cream ran out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down into the well."
"Now it was near dinner-time, and he hadn't even got the butter yet; so he thought he'd best boil the porridge, and filled the pot with water and hung it over the fire. When he had done that, he thought the cow might perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck. So he got up on the house to tie her up. One end of the rope he made fast to the cow's neck and the other he slipped down the chimney and tied round his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water now began to boil in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal."
"So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, down fell the cow off the house-top after all, and as she fell, she dragged the man up the chimney by the rope. There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, she hung half-way down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for she could neither get down nor up."
"And now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her Husband to come and call them home to dinner; but never a call they had. At last she thought she'd waited long enough, and went home. But when she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, she ran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe. But, as she did this, down came her Husband out of the chimney; and so, when his old dame came inside the kitchen, there she found him standing on his head in the porridge pot."
THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WIND
"Once on a time there was an old widow who had one son; and as she was poorly and weak, her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal for cooking; but when he got outside the safe, and was just going down the steps, there came the North Wind puffing and blowing, caught up the meal, and so away with it through the air. Then the Lad went back into the safe for more; but when he came out again on the steps, if the North Wind didn't come again and carry off the meal with a puff:"
"and, more than that, he did so the third time. At this the Lad got very angry; and as he thought it hard that the North Wind should behave so, he thought he'd just look him up, and ask him to give up his meal."
"So off he went, but the way was long, and he walked and walked; but at last he came to the North Wind's house."
"""Good day!"" said the Lad, ""and thank you for coming to see us yesterday."""
"""GOOD DAY!"" answered the North Wind, for his voice was loud and gruff, ""AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT?"""
"""Oh!"" answered the Lad, ""I only wished to ask you to be so good as to let me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for we haven't much to live on; and if you're to go on snapping up the morsel we have, there'll be nothing for it but to starve."""
"""I haven't got your meal,"" said the North Wind; ""but if you are in such need, I'll give you a cloth which will get you everything you want, if you only say, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes!'"""
"With this the Lad was well content. But, as the way was so long he couldn't get home in one day, so he turned into an inn on the way; and when they were going to sit down to supper he laid the cloth on a table which stood in the corner, and said:"
"""Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."""
"He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all who stood by thought it a fine thing, but most of all the landlady. So, when all were fast asleep at dead of night, she took the Lad's cloth, and put another in its stead, just like the one he had got from the North Wind, but which couldn't so much as serve up a bit of dry bread."
"Jackson was unfriendly to the Bank of the United States, and the bank retaliated by contracting its loans, thus making money-matters hard to get hold of by the masses."
"""When the public money,"" says the historian, ""which had been withdrawn from the Bank of the United States was deposited in local banks, money was easy and speculation extended to every branch of trade. New cities were laid out; fabulous prices were charged for building-lots which existed only on paper"" etc. And in Van Buren's time the people paid the violinist, as they have in 1893, with ruin and remorse."
Speculation which is unprofitable should never be encouraged.
"Unprofitable speculation is only another term for idiocy. But, on the other hand, profitable speculation leads to prosperity, public esteem, and the ability to keep a team. We may distinguish the one from the other by means of ascertaining the difference between them. If one finds on waking up in the morning that he experiences a sensation of being in the poor-house, he may almost at once jump to the conclusion that the kind of speculation he selected was the wrong one."
The Black Hawk War occurred in the Northwest Territory in 1832. It grew out of the fact that the Sacs and Foxes sold their lands to the United States and afterwards regretted that they had not asked more for them:
"so they refused to vacate, until several of them had been used up on the asparagus-beds of the husbandman."
"The Florida War (1835) grew out of the fact that the Seminoles regretted having made a dicker with the government at too low a price for land. Osceola, the chief, regretted the matter so much that he scalped General Thompson while the latter was at dinner, which shows that the Indian is not susceptible to cultivation or the acquisition of any knowledge of table etiquette whatever. What could be in poorer taste than scalping a man between the soup and the remove? The same day Major Dade with one hundred men was waylaid, and all but four of the party killed."
Seven years later the Indians were subdued.
"Phrenologically the Indian allows his alimentiveness to overbalance his group of organs which show veneration, benevolence, fondness for society, fêtes champêtres, etc., hope, love of study, fondness for agriculture, an unbridled passion for toil, etc."
"France owed five million dollars for damages to our commerce in Napoleon's wars, and, Napoleon himself being entirely worthless, having said every time that the bill was presented that he would settle it as soon as he got back from St. Helena, Jackson ordered reprisals to be made, but England acted as a peacemaker, and the bill was paid. On receiving the money a trunk attached by our government and belonging to Napoleon was released."
"Space here, and the nature of this work, forbid an extended opinion regarding the course pursued by Napoleon in this matter. His tomb is in the basement of the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris, and you are requested not to fumer while you are there."
CHAPTER XXII.
MORE DIFFICULTIES STRAIGHTENED OUT.
"Van Buren, the eighth President, was unfortunate in taking the helm as the financial cyclone struck the country. This was brought about by scarcity of funds more than anything else. Business-men would not pay their debts, and, though New York was not then so large as at present, one hundred million dollars were lost in sixty days in this way."
"The government had required the payments for public lands to be made in coin, and so the Treasury had plenty of gold and silver, while business had nothing to work with. Speculation also had made a good many snobs who had sent their gold and silver abroad for foreign luxuries, also some paupers who could not do so. When a man made some money from the sale of rural lots he had his hats made abroad, and his wife had her dresses fitted in Paris at great expense. Confidence was destroyed, and the air was heavy with failures and apprehension of more failures to come."
"The Canadians rebelled against England, and many of our people wanted to unite with Canada against the mother-country, but the police would not permit them to do so. General Scott was sent to the frontier to keep our people from aiding the Canadians."
"There was trouble in the Northeast over the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, but it was settled by the commissioners, Daniel Webster and Lord Ashburton. Webster was a smart man and a good extemporaneous speaker."
"Van Buren failed of a re-election, as the people did not fully endorse his administration. Administrations are not generally endorsed where the people are unable to get over six pounds of sugar for a dollar."
"General Harrison, who followed in 1841, died soon after choosing his Cabinet, and his Vice-President, John Tyler, elected as a Whig, proceeded to act as President, but not as a Whig President should. His party passed a bill establishing the United States Bank, but Tyler vetoed it, and the men who elected him wished they had been as dead as Rameses was at the time."
"Dorr's justly celebrated rebellion in Rhode Island was an outbreak resulting from restricting the right of suffrage to those who owned property. A new Constitution was adopted, and Dorr chosen as Governor."
"He was not recognized, and so tried to capture the seat while the regular governor was at tea. He got into jail for life, but was afterwards pardoned out and embraced the Christian religion."
"In 1844 the Anti-Rent War in the State of New York broke out among those who were tenants of the old ""Patroon Estates."" These men, disguised as Indians, tarred and feathered those who paid rent, and killed the collectors who were sent to them. In 1846 the matter was settled by the military."
"In 1840 the Mormons had settled at Nauvoo, Illinois. They were led by Joseph Smith, and not only proposed to run a new kind of religion, but introduced polygamy into it. The people who lived near them attacked them, killed Smith, and drove the Mormons to Iowa, opposite Omaha."
"In 1844 occurred the building of the magnetic telegraph, invented by Samuel F. B. Morse. The line was from Baltimore to Washington, or vice versa, authorities failing to agree on this matter. It cost thirty thousand dollars, and the boys who delivered the messages made more out of it then than the stockholders did."
"Fulton having invented and perfected the steamboat in 1805 and started the Clermont on the North River at the dizzy rate of five miles per hour, and George Stephenson having in 1814 made the first locomotive to run on a track, the people began to feel that theosophy was about all they needed to place them on a level with the seraphim and other astral bodies."
"Texas had, under the guidance of Sam Houston, obtained her independence from Mexico, and asked for admission to the Union. Congress at first rejected her, fearing that the Texas people lacked cultivation, being so far away from the thought-ganglia of the East, also fearing a war with Mexico; but she was at last admitted, and now every one is glad of it."
"The Whigs were not in favor of the admission of Texas, and made that the issue of the following campaign, Henry Clay leading his party to a hospitable grave in the fall. James K. Polk, a Democrat, was elected."
"Now when it was noon the King said, “One of you girls must take him something to eat.” “No,” said the two eldest, “We will not take it to him; the one by whom he last watched, can take him something.” Then the youngest was forced to go and take him something to eat. When she got into the forest, she asked him how he was getting on? “Oh,” said he, “I am getting on very badly.” Then she said he was to come and just eat a little. “Nay,” said he, “I cannot do that, I shall still have to die, so I will eat no more.” Then she spoke so kindly to him and begged him just to try, that he came and ate something. When he had eaten something she said, “I will comb thy hair a while, and then thou wilt feel happier.”"
"So she combed his hair, and he became weary and fell asleep, and then she took her handkerchief and made a knot in it, and struck it three times on the earth, and said, “Earth-workers, come forth.” In a moment, numbers of little earth-men came forth, and asked what the King’s daughter commanded? Then said she, “In three hours’ time the great forest must be cut down, and the whole of the wood laid in heaps.” So the little earth-men went about and got together the whole of their kindred to help them with the work. They began at once, and when the three hours were over, all was done, and they came back to the King’s daughter and told her so. Then she took her white handkerchief again and said, “Earth-workers, go home.” On this they all disappeared. When the King’s son awoke, he was delighted, and she said, “Come home when it has struck six o’clock.” He did as she told him, and then the King asked, “Hast thou made away with the forest?” “Yes,” said the King’s son. When they were sitting at table, the King said, “I cannot yet give thee my daughter to wife, thou must still do something more for her sake.” So he asked what it was to be, then? “I have a great fish-pond,”"
"said the King. “Thou must go to it to-morrow morning and clear it of all mud until it is as bright as a mirror, and fill it with every kind of fish.” The next morning the King gave him a glass shovel and said, “The fish-pond must be done by six o’clock.” So he went away, and when he came to the fish-pond he stuck his shovel in the mud and it broke in two, then he stuck his hoe in the mud, and broke it also. Then he was much troubled. At noon the youngest daughter brought him something to eat, and asked him how he was getting on? So the King’s son said everything was going very ill with him, and he would certainly have to lose his head. “My tools have broken to pieces again.” “Oh,” said she, “thou must just come and eat something, and then thou wilt be in another frame of mind.” “No,” said he, “I cannot eat, I am far too unhappy for that!” Then she gave him many good words until at last he came and ate something. Then she combed his hair again, and he fell asleep, so once more she took her handkerchief, tied a knot in it, and struck the ground thrice with the knot, and said, “Earth-workers, come forth.” In a moment a great many little earth-men came and asked what she desired, and she told them that in three hours’ time, they must have the fish-pond entirely cleaned out, and it must be so clear that people could see themselves reflected in it, and every kind of fish must be in it. The little earth-men went away and summoned all their kindred to help them, and in two hours it was done. Then they returned to her and said, “We have done as thou hast commanded.” The King’s daughter took the handkerchief and once more struck thrice on the ground with it, and said, “Earth-workers, go home again.” Then they all went away."
"When the King’s son awoke the fish-pond was done. Then the King’s daughter went away also, and told him that when it was six he was to come to the house. When he arrived at the house the King asked, “Hast thou got the fish-pond done?” “Yes,” said the King’s son. That was very good."
"When they were again sitting at table the King said, “Thou hast certainly done the fish-pond, but I cannot give thee my daughter yet; thou must just do one thing more.” “What is that, then?” asked the King’s son. The King said he had a great mountain on which there was nothing but briars which must all be cut down, and at the top of it the youth must build up a great castle, which must be as strong as could be conceived, and all the furniture and fittings belonging to a castle must be inside it. And when he arose next morning the King gave him a glass axe and a glass gimlet with him, and he was to have all done by six o’clock. As he was cutting down the first briar with the axe, it broke off short, and so small that the pieces flew all round about, and he could not use the gimlet either. Then he was quite miserable, and waited for his dearest to see if she would not come and help him in his need. When it was mid-day she came and brought him something to eat. He went to meet her and told her all, and ate something, and let her comb his hair and fell asleep. Then she once more took the knot and struck the earth with it, and said, “Earth-workers, come forth!” Then came once again numbers of earth-men, and asked what her desire was. Then said she, “In the space of three hours they must cut down the whole of the briars, and a castle must be built on the top of the mountain that must be as strong as any one could conceive, and all the furniture that pertains to a castle must be inside it.” They went away, and summoned their kindred to help them and when the time was come, all was ready."
"Then they came to the King’s daughter and told her so, and the King’s daughter took her handkerchief and struck thrice on the earth with it, and said, “Earth-workers, go home,” on which they all disappeared. When therefore the King’s son awoke and saw everything done, he was as happy as a bird in air."
"When it had struck six, they went home together. Then said the King, “Is the castle ready?” “Yes,” said the King’s son. When they sat down to table, the King said, “I cannot give away my youngest daughter until the two eldest are married.” Then the King’s son and the King’s daughter were quite troubled, and the King’s son had no idea what to do. But he went by night to the King’s daughter and ran away with her."
"When they had got a little distance away, the King’s daughter peeped round and saw her father behind her. “Oh,” said she, “what are we to do? My father is behind us, and will take us back with him. I will at once change thee into a briar, and myself into a rose, and I will shelter myself in the midst of the bush.” When the father reached the place, there stood a briar with one rose on it, then he was about to gather the rose, when the thorn came and pricked his finger so that he was forced to go home again. His wife asked why he had not brought their daughter back with him? So he said he had nearly got up to her, but that all at once he had lost sight of her, and a briar with one rose was growing on the spot."
"Then said the Queen, “If thou hadst but gathered the rose, the briar would have been forced to come too.” So he went back again to fetch the rose, but in the meantime the two were already far over the plain, and the King ran after them. Then the daughter once more looked round and saw her father coming, and said, “Oh, what shall we do now? I will instantly change thee into a church and myself into a priest, and I will stand up in the pulpit, and preach.” When the King got to the place, there stood a church, and in the pulpit was a priest preaching."
"So he listened to the sermon, and then went home again."
"Then the Queen asked why he had not brought their daughter with him, and he said, “Nay, I ran a long time after her, and just as I thought I should soon overtake her, a church was standing there and a priest was in the pulpit preaching.” “Thou shouldst just have brought the priest,”"
"said his wife, “and then the church would soon have come. It is no use to send thee, I must go there myself.” When she had walked for some time, and could see the two in the distance, the King’s daughter peeped round and saw her mother coming, and said, “Now we are undone, for my mother is coming herself: I will immediately change thee into a fish-pond and myself into a fish."
"When the mother came to the place, there was a large fish-pond, and in the midst of it a fish was leaping about and peeping out of the water, and it was quite merry. She wanted to catch the fish, but she could not. Then she was very angry, and drank up the whole pond in order to catch the fish, but it made her so ill that she was forced to vomit, and vomited the whole pond out again. Then she cried, “I see very well that nothing can be done now,” and said that now they might come back to her. Then the King’s daughter went back again, and the Queen gave her daughter three walnuts, and said, “With these thou canst help thyself when thou art in thy greatest need.” So the young folks went once more away together. And when they had walked quite ten miles, they arrived at the castle from whence the King’s son came, and close by it was a village. When they reached it, the King’s son said, “Stay here, my dearest, I will just go to the castle, and then will I come with a carriage and with attendants to fetch thee.”"
"When he got to the castle they all rejoiced greatly at having the King’s son back again, and he told them he had a bride who was now in the village, and they must go with the carriage to fetch her. Then they harnessed the horses at once, and many attendants seated themselves outside the carriage. When the King’s son was about to get in, his mother gave him a kiss, and he forgot everything which had happened, and also what he was about to do. On this his mother ordered the horses to be taken out of the carriage again, and everyone went back into the house. But the maiden sat in the village and watched and watched, and thought he would come and fetch her, but no one came. Then the King’s daughter took service in the mill which belonged to the castle, and was obliged to sit by the pond every afternoon and clean the tubs."
"And the Queen came one day on foot from the castle, and went walking by the pond, and saw the well-grown maiden sitting there, and said, “What a fine strong girl that is! She pleases me well!” Then she and all with her looked at the maid, but no one knew her. So a long time passed by during which the maiden served the miller honorably and faithfully. In the meantime, the Queen had sought a wife for her son, who came from quite a distant part of the world. When the bride came, they were at once to be married. And many people hurried together, all of whom wanted to see everything. Then the girl said to the miller that he might be so good as to give her leave to go also. So the miller said, “Yes, do go there.” When she was about to go, she opened one of the three walnuts, and a beautiful dress lay inside it. She put it on, and went into the church and stood by the altar. Suddenly came the bride and bridegroom, and seated themselves before the altar, and when the priest was just going to bless them, the bride peeped half round and saw the maiden standing there. Then she stood up again, and said she would not be given away until she also had as beautiful a dress as that lady there. So they went back to the house again, and sent to ask the lady if she would sell that dress. No, she would not sell it, but the bride might perhaps earn it. Then the bride asked her how she was to do this? Then the maiden said if she might sleep one night outside the King’s son’s door, the bride might have what she wanted. So the bride said, “Yes, she was willing to do that.” But the servants were ordered to give the King’s son a sleeping-drink, and then the maiden laid herself down on the threshold and lamented all night long. She had had the forest cut down for him, she had had the fish-pond cleaned out for him, she had had the castle built for him, she had changed him into a briar, and then into a church, and at last into a fish-pond, and yet he had forgotten her so quickly. The King’s son did not hear one word of it, but the servants had been awakened, and had listened to it, and had not known what it could mean. The next morning when they were all up, the bride put on the dress, and went away to the church with the bridegroom. In the meantime the maiden opened the second walnut, and a still more beautiful dress was inside it. She put it on, and went and stood by the altar in the church, and everything happened as it had happened the time before. And the maiden again lay all night on the threshold which led to the chamber of the King’s son, and the servant was once more to give him a sleeping-drink. The servant, however, went to him and gave him something to keep him awake, and then the King’s son went to bed, and the miller’s maiden bemoaned herself as before on the threshold of the door, and told of all that she had done. All this the King’s son heard, and was sore troubled, and what was past came back to him. Then he wanted to go to her, but his mother had locked the door. The next morning, however, he went at once to his beloved, and told her everything which had happened to him, and prayed her not to be angry with him for having forgotten her. Then the King’s daughter opened the third walnut, and within it was a still more magnificent dress, which she put on, and went with her bridegroom to church, and numbers of children came who gave them flowers, and offered them gay ribbons to bind about their feet, and they were blessed by the priest, and had a merry wedding. But the false mother and the bride had to depart. And the mouth of the person who last told all this is still warm."
114 The Cunning Little Tailor
"There was once on a time a princess who was extremely proud. If a wooer came she gave him some riddle to guess, and if he could not find it out, he was sent contemptuously away. She let it be made known also that whosoever solved her riddle should marry her, let him be who he might. At length, therefore, three tailors fell in with each other, the two eldest of whom thought they had done so many dexterous bits of work successfully that they could not fail to succeed in this also; the third was a little useless land-louper, who did not even know his trade, but thought he must have some luck in this venture, for where else was it to come from? Then the two others said to him, “Just stay at home; thou canst not do much with thy little bit of understanding.”"
"The little tailor, however, did not let himself be discouraged, and said he had set his head to work about this for once, and he would manage well enough, and he went forth as if the whole world were his."
"They all three announced themselves to the princess, and said she was to propound her riddle to them, and that the right persons were now come, who had understandings so fine that they could be threaded in a needle. Then said the princess, “I have two kinds of hair on my head, of what color is it?” “If that be all,” said the first, “it must be black and white, like the cloth which is called pepper and salt.” The princess said, “Wrongly guessed; let the second answer.” Then said the second, “If it be not black and white, then it is brown and red, like my father’s company coat.” “Wrongly guessed,” said the princess, “let the third give the answer, for I see very well he knows it for certain.” Then the little tailor stepped boldly forth and said, “The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and those are the two different colors.” When the princess heard that, she turned pale and nearly fell down with terror, for the little tailor had guessed her riddle, and she had firmly believed that no man on earth could discover it. When her courage returned she said, “Thou hast not won me yet by that; there is still something else that thou must do. Below, in the stable is a bear with which thou shalt pass the night, and when I get up in the morning if thou art still alive, thou shalt marry me.” She expected, however, she should thus get rid of the tailor, for the bear had never yet left any one alive who had fallen into his clutches. The little tailor did not let himself be frightened away, but was quite delighted, and said, “Boldly ventured is half won.”"
"When therefore the evening came, our little tailor was taken down to the bear. The bear was about to set at the little fellow at once, and give him a hearty welcome with his paws: “Softly, softly,” said the little tailor, “I will soon make thee quiet.” Then quite composedly, and as if he had not an anxiety in the world, he took some nuts out of his pocket, cracked them, and ate the kernels. When the bear saw that, he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too. The tailor felt in his pockets, and reached him a handful; they were, however, not nuts, but pebbles. The bear put them in his mouth, but could get nothing out of them, let him bite as he would. “Eh!” thought he, “what a stupid blockhead I am! I cannot even crack a nut!” and then he said to the tailor, “Here, crack me the nuts.” “There, see what a stupid fellow thou art!” said the little tailor, “to have such a great mouth, and not be able to crack a small nut!” Then he took the pebble and nimbly put a nut in his mouth in the place of it, and crack, it was in two! “I must try the thing again,” said the bear; “when I watch you, I then think I ought to be able to do it too.” So the tailor once more gave him a pebble, and the bear tried and tried to bite into it with all the strength of his body. But no one will imagine that he accomplished it."
"When that was over, the tailor took out a violin from beneath his coat, and played a piece of it to himself. When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, “Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?” “Light enough for a child. Look, with the left hand I lay my fingers on it, and with the right I stroke it with the bow, and then it goes merrily, hop sa sa vivallalera!” “So,” said the bear; “fiddling is a thing I should like to understand too, that I might dance whenever I had a fancy. What dost thou think of that? Wilt thou give me lessons?” “With all my heart,” said the tailor, “if thou hast a talent for it. But just let me see thy claws, they are terribly long, I must cut thy nails a little.” Then a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the little tailor screwed it tight, and said, “Now wait until I come with the scissors,” and he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep."
"When the princess heard the bear growling so fiercely during the night, she believed nothing else but that he was growling for joy, and had made an end of the tailor. In the morning she arose careless and happy, but when she peeped into the stable, the tailor stood gaily before her, and was as healthy as a fish in water. Now she could not say another word against the wedding because she had given a promise before every one, and the King ordered a carriage to be brought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor, and there she was to be married. When they had got into the carriage, the two other tailors, who had false hearts and envied him his good fortune, went into the stable and unscrewed the bear again. The bear in great fury ran after the carriage. The princess heard him snorting and growling; she was terrified, and she cried, “Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to get thee!” The tailor was quick and stood on his head, stuck his legs out of the window, and cried, “Dost thou see the vise? If thou dost not be off thou shalt be put into it again.” When the bear saw that, he turned round and ran away. The tailor drove quietly to church, and the princess was married to him at once, and he lived with her as happy as a woodlark. Whosoever does not believe this, must pay a thaler."
115 The Bright Sun Brings It to Light
"A tailor’s apprentice was travelling about the world in search of work, and at one time he could find none, and his poverty was so great that he had not a farthing to live on. Presently he met a Jew on the road, and as he thought he would have a great deal of money about him, the tailor thrust God out of his heart, fell on the Jew, and said, “Give me thy money, or I will strike thee dead.” Then said the Jew, “Grant me my life, I have no money but eight farthings.” But the tailor said, “Money thou hast; and it shall be produced,” and used violence and beat him until he was near death. And when the Jew was dying, the last words he said were, “The bright sun will bring it to light,” and thereupon he died. The tailor’s apprentice felt in his pockets and sought for money, but he found nothing but eight farthings, as the Jew had said. Then he took him up and carried him behind a clump of trees, and went onwards to seek work. After he had traveled about a long while, he got work in a town with a master who had a pretty daughter, with whom he fell in love, and he married her, and lived in good and happy wedlock."
"After a long time when he and his wife had two children, the wife’s father and mother died, and the young people kept house alone. One morning, when the husband was sitting on the table before the window, his wife brought him his coffee, and when he had poured it out into the saucer, and was just going to drink, the sun shone on it and the reflection gleamed hither and thither on the wall above, and made circles on it. Then the tailor looked up and said, “Yes, it would like very much to bring it to light, and cannot!” The woman said, “Oh, dear husband, and what is that, then?” “What dost thou mean by that?” He answered, “I must not tell thee.” But she said, “If thou lovest me, thou must tell me,” and used her most affectionate words, and said that no one should ever know it, and left him no rest. Then he told her how years ago, when he was travelling about seeking work and quite worn out and penniless, he had killed a Jew, and that in the last agonies of death, the Jew had spoken the words, “The bright sun will bring it to light.” And now, the sun had just wanted to bring it to light, and had gleamed and made circles on the wall, but had not been able to do it."
"After this, he again charged her particularly never to tell this, or he would lose his life, and she did promise. When however, he had sat down to work again, she went to her great friend and confided the story to her, but she was never to repeat it to any human being, but before two days were over, the whole town knew it, and the tailor was brought to trial, and condemned. And thus, after all, the bright sun did bring it to light."
116 The Blue Light
"There was once on a time a soldier who for many years had served the King faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received. The King said to him, “Thou mayst return to thy home, I need thee no longer, and thou wilt not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service for them.” Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. “Do give me one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,” said he to her, “or I shall starve.” “Oho!” she answered, “who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.” “What do you wish?” said the soldier. “That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.” The soldier consented, and next day labored with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. “I see well enough,” said the witch, “that you can do no more to-day, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must to-morrow chop me a load of wood, and make it small.” The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more."
"“To-morrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again for me.” Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him. “No,” said he, perceiving her evil intention, “I will not give thee the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground.” The witch fell into a passion, let him down again into the well, and went away."
"The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full. “This shall be my last pleasure,”"
"thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke."
"When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said, “Lord, what are thy commands?” “What commands have I to give thee?” replied the soldier, quite astonished."

"""Thank you."""
"""That ought to grease the way in the Diet for your deal. And the"

"""So I would like to think,"" he nodded. ""Of course, one never knows how"
"these things will eventually turn out."""
"""So when do I get a look at it?"""
"""Why, that all depends on certain agreements we need to make."""
"""Then I guess it's time I heard the bottom line."""
"""Most assuredly."" He leaned back. ""Dr. Vance, you have just caused me"
considerable hardship. Nor is this the first occasion you have done so.
"Yet, I have not achieved what I have to date without becoming something"
of a judge of men. The financial arrangements you put together in
"London demonstrated, I thought, remarkable ingenuity. There could be a"
"place for you in my organization, despite all that has happened between"
"us."""

"She gazed sorrowfully at them and went on: ""You see, yours is the"

because it shows they are vulnerable to invasion. They want to stop
"that by invading your planet first. Besides their fear, there is their"
greed. Their looking-tubes reveal that yours is a fruitful and lovely
"sphere, and they are insatiable in their lust for new territories."
"Thus they plan to go to your planet as soon as they are able, and kill"
or enslave all the people there as they have killed and enslaved my
"race."""
"""They'll have a job on their hands trying to do that!"" declared Dex"
stoutly.
"But Brand paled. ""They can do it!"" he snapped. ""Look at those"

"Viggon Sarri looked from one to the other, grimly. ""You believe I'm"
"wasting time? Is that it?"""
"The two aides answered together, ""Yes!"" and ""Absolutely!"""
"Viggon Sarri said, ""I am still in command of this force. We'll continue"
to observe until I am satisfied. You two officers have one common
idea--that of moving in fast. You have differing ideas of how we are
to move in. Until you can settle your difference and provide me with a
good logical basis for your decision--whichever way--then we'll follow
my plan. And my plan is to move in just as soon as we have enough data
on the character and strength of this race to provide us with the
"correct way to take them."""
"""Then you are going to continue stalling?"" demanded Naylo."
"""Yes, if you wish to call it stalling. Maybe another man might call it"

"""We'll be just wasting time, as I've already said. We have enough stuff"

"Viggon Sarri shrugged. ""Yes. We could swoop in and take them like"
"mowing down a wheat field. Tell me, young men, what happens when you"
"mow down a wheat field."""
They looked at him blankly.
"Viggon smiled in a superior manner. ""One of two things, depending upon"
"how you operate. If you mow it down and let it lay, you drop seeds and"
"""We are all here,"" she answered. ""None of us has fled. Did you not"
"know that?"""
He looked about him. A flash of scorn rekindled in his somber eyes.
"""You are alone. Have they deserted you?"""
"""They do not know that I am here. I crept back of my own free will--to"
"speak with you, Nehal."""
"Both hands clasped upon his sword-hilt, erect, a proud figure of"
"misfortune, he stood there and studied her, half-wonderingly,"
half-contemptuously. The restless forces at his back were forgotten.
They were no more to him than the pawns with which his will played
life and death. He was their god and their faith. They waited for his
word to sweep out of his path the white-faced Englishwoman who held
him checked in the full course of his victory. But he did not speak to
"them, but to her, in a low voice in which scorn still trembled."
"""You are here, no doubt, to intercede for those others--or for"
"yourself. You see, I have learned something in these two years. It is"
"useless. No one can stop me now."""
"""No one?"""
"He smiled, and for the first time she saw a sneer disfigure his lips."
"""Not even you, Miss Cary. You have done a great deal with me--enough"
perhaps to justify your wildest hopes--but you have touched the limits
of your powers and of my gullibility. Or did you think there were no

AIR-RAIDS
"It was a warm, sunny afternoon. About a dozen of us were pitching a"
"marquee in leisurely fashion, when suddenly there was a shout of ""Fritz"
"up!"""
"We gazed at the sky, and, after searching for a while, saw a tiny white"
"speck moving slowly across the blue at an immense height. Then, at some"
"distance from it, a small white puff, like a little ball of cotton-wool,"
appeared. A few seconds passed and we heard a faint pop. More puffs
"appeared around the moving speck, each one followed by a pop. All at"
"once, behind us, a bright tongue of flame flashed out above a group of"
"bushes. There was a sharp report and a whizzing, rustling noise that"
died down gradually. Then another puff and another pop. The bright
flames flashed out again in rapid succession. The little speck moved on
and on. Grouped closely round it were compact little balls of
"cotton-wool, but trailing behind were thin wisps and semi-transparent"
whitish blurs. Above a belt of trees in the distance we observed a
"door. Stripped down for action, they were quickly and professionally"
"tallying the certificates, one handling the open cashiers checks and"
the other the bearer bonds.
"Guess they intend to keep a close eye on the details, Vance thought."
"Well, screw them. We've still got the protocol. We've got some leverage"
left.
But he was having trouble focusing on the future. He was still in shock
from the sight of Novosty being gunned down in cold blood. Alex's
"abrupt death was a tragic end to an exceptional, if sometimes dubious,"
career. He'd really wanted Novosty to make this one last score. The man
"deserved it. He was an operator who lived at the edge, and Vance had"
"always admired players who put everything on the table, no matter which"
side.
"Well, he told himself, the scenario had come close, damned close. But"
maybe it was doomed from the start. You only get so many chances to
"tempt the fates. Today everybody's number came up, Alex's for the last"
time.
"Rest in peace, Aleksei Ilyich."
"Then Vera turned back to them. ""Now, I want the computer. We know it"
"was moved to the house in Kensington, but our search this morning did"
"not locate it."""
"So they were on to us from the start, Vance realized."
"""Looks like you've got a problem."" He strolled over and plopped down in"
"one of the straight-backed chairs along the opposite wall. ""Too bad."""
"So, with greatly altered circumstance, was it in the present instance."
Rollo kissed first and made up his mind to it some time after.
Consequently Concha was taken absolutely by surprise. She uttered a
little cry and stepped back indignantly into the lighted room where the
spare muskets were piled.
"But again Rollo was before her. If he had attempted to make love, she"
"would have scathed him with the soundest indignation, based on"
"considerations of time, place, and personality."
But the young Scot gave her no opportunity. In a moment he had again
become her superior officer.
"""Take your piece,"" he said, with an air of assured command, ""together"
"with sufficient ammunition, and post yourself at the little staircase"
window over the great door looking towards the town. If you see any one
"approaching, do not hesitate to fire. Good-bye. God bless you! I will"
"see you again on my rounds!"""
And Rollo passed on his way.
"Then with a curious constraint upon her tongue, and on her spirit a new"
and delightful feeling that she could do no other than as she was
"bidden, Concha found herself, with loaded musket and pistol, obediently"
taking her place in the general defence of the palace.
CHAPTER XXXII
hands. Everything living had been slain. Astura was a castle of the
dead.
"""God! What work!"" exclaimed the Pisan. It was the testimony wrung from"
him by the stress of sheer hard fighting.
"""One of the viper-brood still lives,"" the duke turned to his"
"companion, kicking with the tip of his steel boot the lifeless form of"
Giovanni Frangipani.
The Pisan turned to a man-at-arms.
"""Take twenty men! Scour the lair from vault to pinnacle! We must have"
"that other,--dead or alive!"""
The rain had ceased for the time. New thunder-clouds came rolling out
of the west. Flambeaux flared in the court. Black shadows danced along
the ghostly walls. The wind moaned about the crenelated turrets;
"sentinels of the Pisans stood everywhere, alert for ambush."
The duke and his companions approached the door leading into the great
hall. It lay in splinters. Stygian darkness held sway within.
"Suddenly the duke paused, as if turned to stone, at the same time"
plucking his companion back by the sleeve of his surcoat.
Noiselessly as a ghost out of the door came the form of a woman. She
"was tall, exquisitely proportioned, and young. For a moment she paused"
on the threshold and looked out into the night. Almost immediately a
"second form followed, and paused near the first: that of a man. The"
"woman seemed to stare blindly at the duke, with wide, unseeing eyes,"
as one who walks in a sleep.
He shook his head.
"""Well, there was a certain shrewd old cannery-man in Washington State"
"whose catch consisted almost wholly of pink fish. As you know, that"
"variety does not bring as high a price as red salmon, like these. Well,"
"finding that he could not sell his catch, owing to the popular"
"prejudice about color, this man printed a lot of striking can-labels,"
"which read, 'Best Grade Pink Salmon, Warranted not to Turn Red in the"
"Can.' They tell me it worked like a charm."""
"""No wonder!"" Boyd laughed, beginning to feel the tension of his nerves"
"relax at the restfulness of her influence. As usual, he fell at once"
into the mood she desired for him. He saw that her brows were furrowed
"and her rosy lips drawn into an unconscious pout as she said, more to"
herself than to him:
"""I wish I were a man. I'd like to engage in a business of this sort,"
something that would require ingenuity and daring. I'd like to handle
"big affairs."""
"""It seems to me that you are in a business of that sort. You are one of"
"us."""
"""Oh, but you and George are doing it all."""
"""There is your copper-mine. You surely handled that very cleverly."""
"Cherry's expression altered, and she shot a quick glance at him as he"
went on:
"""How is it coming along, by-the-way? I haven't heard you mention it"
"""I'm not suicidal."" He stepped back as Vera proceeded to pat them down."
"""I think very carefully about my options."""
"""Get the money."" She was directing the two remaining _Mino-gumi kobun"
_toward the table.
"""Gonna just rob the bank now, Comrade?"" Vance turned and looked at her,"
then at the three bodies strewn on the floor. The _kobun _seemed to
consider their late colleagues merely casualties of war. The dead men
"received almost no notice. ""Pretty costly little enterprise, wouldn't"
you say. Not a very propitious start for your new era of world
"serenity."""
"""You would be advised to shut up,"" she responded sharply."
"""I feel personally violated by all this."" Nogami had turned to her and"
"his voice was like steel. ""As of this moment, you can put out of your"
mind any illusion I might cooperate further. This outrage is beyond
"acceptability."""
"""We did what had to be done,"" Vera said. ""We still expect your"
"cooperation and I do not think we will be disappointed."""
"""Then your expectation is sadly misplaced,"" he replied icily. His eyes"
signified he meant every word.
"""We will see."" She dismissed him as she turned her attention to the"
money. The two _kobun_ had carefully removed their shiny black leather
jackets now and laid them on the table. Underneath they wore tightly
"tailored white shirts, complete with underarm holsters containing 9mm"
"Llamas. The automatics were back in their briefcases, positioned by the"
"""Dex!"" he cried. ""We're moving! And the motor is shut off!"""
"""We're drawing down closer to the ground, too,"" announced Dex,"
"pointing to their altimeter. ""Our altitude has been reduced five"
"thousand feet in the last two minutes."""
"Quickly Brand turned on the motor in reverse. The space ship, as the"
"rushing, reddish ground beneath indicated, continued to glide forward"
as though pulled by an invisible rope. He turned on full power. The
ship's progress was checked a little. A very little! And the metallic
red surface under them grew nearer as they steadily lost altitude.
"""Something seems to have got us by the nose,"" said Dex. ""We're on our"
"way to the center of the red spot, I guess--to find whatever it was"
that Journeyman found. And the radio communication his been broken
"somehow...."""
"Wordlessly, they stared out the panel, while the shell, quivering with"
the strain of the atomic motor's fight against whatever unseen force
"it was that relentlessly drew them forward, bore them swiftly toward"
the heart of the vast crimson area.
*       *       *       *       *
"""Look!"" cried Brand."
"For over an hour the ship had been propelled swiftly, irresistibly"
toward the center of the red spot. It had been up about forty thousand
"feet. Now, with a jerk that sent both men reeling, it had been drawn"
down to within fifteen thousand feet of the surface; and the sight
that was now becoming more and more visible was incredible.
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE FLIGHT.
"One of the men--it was I--muttered something to Marie, and she snuffed"
"the wick, and blew up the light. In a moment it filled the room,"
"disclosing a strange medley of levelled weapons, startled faces, and"
flashing eyes. In one corner Fraulein Max and the two women cowered
"behind one another, trembling and staring. At the table sat my lady,"
"with dull, dazed eyes, looking on, yet scarcely understanding what was"
"happening. On either side of her stood Steve and I, covering the"
"general with our pistols, while the Waldgrave, who was still too weak"
"for much exertion, kept guard at the door."
"Tzerclas was the first to speak. 'What is this foolery?' he said,"
scowling unutterable curses at us. 'What does this mean?'
"'This!' I said, producing a piece of hide rope. 'We are going to tie"
"you up. If you struggle, general, you die. If you submit, you live."
"That is all. Go to work, Steve.'"
"There was a gleam in Tzerclas' eye, which warned me to stand back and"
"crook my finger. His face was black with fury, and for an instant I"
thought that he would spring upon us and dare all. But prudence and
"the pistols prevailed. With an evil look he sat still, and in a trice"
Steve had a loop round his arms and was binding him to the heavy
chair.
I knew then that as far as he was concerned we were safe; and I turned
"to bid the women get cloaks and food, adjuring them to be quick, since"
"""Absolutely."""
"""It would, moreover, not be possible for anyone to enter or leave"
"without your knowledge?""  I suggested."
"""M'sieur understands me perfectly.  Mademoiselle must have fallen to the"
"floor lifeless immediately after I had let you out.  She made no sound,"
"and had Jean not entered with her letters, which the concierge had"
"brought, my poor young mistress might be lying there now."""
The average Frenchwoman of the lower class is always dramatic wherever a
"domestic calamity is concerned, and this worthy bonne was no exception."
She punctuated all her remarks with references to the sacred personages
of the Roman Catholic religion.
"""You haven't searched the room, I suppose?"""
"""No, m'sieur.  Madame gave orders that nothing was to be touched."""
This reply was eminently satisfactory.  I glanced again around the
"place, now dim in the falling twilight, and ordered her to throw back"
the sun-shutters.
"The woman went to the window and opened them, admitting a flood of"
"mellow light, the last crimson of the glorious afterglow.  Up from the"
"boulevard came the dull roar of the traffic, mingling with the sound of"
"distant bells ringing the Ave Maria.  The bonne--an Alsatian, from her"
"accent--crossed herself from force of habit, and retreated towards the"
door.
"""You may go,"" I said.  ""I will remain here until the doctor arrives."""
"and saw, a hundred yards or so away, a bent and dreary figure trudging"
down the metal paving of the street. It was a figure like those to be
"seen on Earth, which placed it as belonging to Greca's race."
"The tall leader drew forth one of the shock-tubes. Seen near at hand,"
it was observed to be bafflingly simple in appearance. It seemed
devoid of all mechanism--simply a tube of reddish metal with a sort of
handle formed of a coil of heavy wire.
The Rogan pointed the tube at the distant figure.
"Greca screamed, and screamed again. Coincident with her cry, as though"
"the sound of it had felled him, the distant slave dropped to the"
pavement.
*       *       *       *       *
That was all. The tube had merely been pointed: as far as Brand could
"see, the Rogan's ""hand"" had not moved on the barrel of the tube, nor"
even constricted about the coil of wire that formed its handle. Yet
"that distant figure had dropped. Furthermore, fumes of greasy black"
smoke now began to arise from the huddled body; and in less than
thirty seconds there was left no trace of it on the gleaming metal
pavement.
"""So that's what those things are like at full power!"" breathed Dex."
"""My God!"""
"The Rogan leader spoke a few words. Greca, huddled despairingly on the"
"floor, crushed by this brutal annihilation of one of her country-men"
"before her very eyes, did not translate. But translation was"
"unnecessary. The Rogan's icy, triumphant eyes, the very posture of"
"we damned well need to know the inside story."""
"""Nikolai, if I see her, I'll be sure and ask."" He winked. ""And if she's"
"the hot number you say, maybe I'll find time to warm her up a little."
"Get her to drop her . . . guard."""
"""If you succeed in that, _moi droog_,"" he said as his heavy eyebrows"
"lifted with a sly grin, ""you'll be the envy of the facility. You've got"
"to see her."""
"""I can't wait."" He shrugged and moved on toward the Hangar Security"
"station, at the end of the long corridor. When he flashed his A-level"
"priority ID for the two Japanese guards, he noticed they nervously made"
"a show of scrutinizing it, even though they both knew him perfectly"
"well, before saluting and authorizing entry."
"That nails it, he told himself. Out of nowhere we suddenly have all"
"this rule-book crap. These guys are nervous as hell. No doubt about it,"
the big _nachalnik_ is on the scene.
Great. Let all those assholes on the Soviet staff see the expression on
his face when the truth comes out. That's the real history we're about
to make here.
"As he walked into the glare of neon, the cavernous space had never"
"seemed more vast, more imposing. He'd seen a lot of hangars, flown a"
"lot of experimental planes over the years, but nothing to match this."
"Still, he always reminded himself, Daedalus was only hardware, just"
more fancy iron. What really counted was the balls of the pilot holding
the flight stick.
"That's when he saw them, clustered around the vehicle and gazing up. He"
whilst I settle the bill and ask for food for the journey. The brown
woman fishes out from a huge black pot in the background sundry hunks of
"coarse boiled pork, and gives me two of these, hot, with bread and salt."
This is the luncheon. I pay the bill: which amounts to twenty-four
"francs, for everything. (One says francs or liras, irrespective, in"
"Italy.) At that moment arrives the train from Cagliari, and men rush in,"
"roaring for the soup--or rather, for the broth. ""Ready, ready!"" she"
"cries, going to the black pot."
V.
TO SORGONO.
"The various trains in the junction squatted side by side and had long,"
long talks before at last we were off. It was wonderful to be running in
"the bright morning towards the heart of Sardinia, in the little train"
"that seemed so familiar. We were still going third class, rather to the"
disgust of the railway officials at Mandas.
"At first the country was rather open: always the long spurs of hills,"
"steep-sided, but not high. And from our little train we looked across"
"the country, across hill and dale. In the distance was a little town, on"
"a low slope. But for its compact, fortified look it might have been a"
town on the English downs. A man in the carriage leaned out of the
"window holding out a white cloth, as a signal to someone in the far off"
"town that he was coming. The wind blew the white cloth, the town in the"
distance glimmered small and alone in its hollow. And the little train
pelted along.

"""No!"" he exclaimed. ""I'm not a fighting man, but I'm a good general."
"You know, Napoleon was about my size."""
"""I never noticed the resemblance,"" remarked Fraser."
"""All the same, your idea ain't so bad,"" said Balt. ""There's somebody"
"stirring those fellows up, and I think it's that detective. I wouldn't"
"mind getting my hands on him, and if you'll all stick with me I'll go"
"out after him."""
"""Not for mine,"" hastily declared ""Fingerless"" Fraser. ""I don't want to"
"fight anybody. I'm here as a spectator."""
"""You're not afraid?"" questioned Emerson."
"""Not exactly afraid, but what's the use of my getting mixed up in this"
"row? It ain't _my_ cannery."""
"Now, while a mob is by nature noisy and threatening, there is little"
real danger in it until its diffusive violence is directed into one
"channel by a leader. Then, indeed, it becomes a terrible thing, and to"
"the watchers at the dock it became evident, in time, that a guiding"
"influence was at work among their enemies. Sure enough, late in the"
"afternoon of the fourth day, without a moment's warning, the strikers"
"rushed in a body, bearing down the guards like reeds. They came so"
unexpectedly that there was no time to muster reinforcements at the
"gate; almost before the fishermen could drop their tasks, their enemies"
were inside the building and pandemonium had broken loose. The
"structure rocked to the tumult of pounding heels, of yells and"
"imprecations, the lofty roof serving to toss back and magnify the"
attract the surly pair who played at cards.
"""Now you might try Airedale and Pekinese,"" Tommy suggested, but this was"
lost on the serious little man. Yet he did call in another strangely
"sounding tongue, then with a sigh laid the megaphone down, saying:"
"""They must be stuffies!"""
"""Dummies, sir, dummies,"" Tommy corrected. ""Nice people don't say"
"stuffies, ever!"""
"""Your Tommy does so much cut-upping, eh!"" he smiled at me. I had noticed"
that when preoccupied or excited the idioms of his various languages got
tumbled into a rather hopeless potpourri.
Quarantine and customs were passed in the leisurely fashion of Cuban
"officials, and Monsieur asked to be sent immediately ashore, promising"
"to return at sundown. There was a man, the secret agent, he explained,"
who held important information.
"""I'll have the launch for you at Machina wharf, sir,"" Gates told him,"
"but he refused to consider this, declaring that he could hire any of the"
boatmen thereabout to bring him out.
"""He's that considerate, sir,"" Gates later confided to me. ""But I carn't"
make head nor tail of him. Bilkins says he went in to lay out his
"clothes, and the things he's got stuck in those bags would astonish"
"you!"""
"Nearing six o'clock a skiff drew alongside, being propelled by one"
oar--a method much in vogue with Havana harbormen--and when Monsieur
came aboard we saw at once evidences of disappointment. His arms hung
"""I can not trust you,"" he said again, ""nor can I turn back. But there"
is one thing from the past which can not be changed. I love you. It
seems that must remain through all my life. And because of that love I
"must save you from the death that awaits your countrymen."" He smiled"
"in faint self-contempt. ""It is not for your sake that I shall save"
"you; it is because I am too great a coward, and can not face the"
"thought that anything so horrible should come near you."" He turned to"
two native soldiers behind him and gave an order. When he faced
Beatrice again he saw that she held a revolver in her hand.
"""You do not understand,"" she said. ""You say you mean to save me, but"
"that is not in your power. It is in your power to save us all, but not"
"one alone. I know what my people have resolved to do. There are weak,"
"frightened women among them, but not one of them will fall into your"
"hands alive. Whatever happens, I shall share their fate."""
"Though her tone was quiet and free from all bravado, he knew that she"
"was not boasting. He knew, too, that she was desperate."
"""You can not force me to kill you,"" he said sternly."
"""I think it possible,"" she answered. She was breathing quickly, and"
"her eyes were bright with a reckless, feverish excitement. But the"
hand that held the revolver pointed at the men behind him was
steady--steadier than his own.
Nehal Singh motioned back the two natives who had advanced at his
order.
"""You play a dangerous game,"" he said, ""and, as before, your strength"
lies in my weakness--in my folly. But this time you can not win. My
detectives watching all over the city and country for any car that
looks suspicious.”
"Kennedy thanked him for his courtesy, and we rose to go. “I shall be"
"glad to keep you informed of anything that turns up,” he promised."
CHAPTER XX
THE ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY
"In the laboratory, Kennedy quietly set to work. He began by tearing"
from the germ letter the piece of gelatine and first examining it with
"a pocket lens. Then, with a sterile platinum wire, he picked out"
several minute sections of the black spot on the gelatine and placed
"them in agar, blood serum, and other media on which they would be"
likely to grow.
"“I shall have to wait until to-morrow to examine them properly,” he"
"remarked. “There are colonies of something there, all right, but I must"
have them more fully developed.”
"WHAT to read. This is like giving a loaded gun to a boy and saying,"
"'Shoot away! ... No matter in which direction you point your aim, . ."
"shoot yourself if you like, and others too,--anyhow, you've GOT the"
gun!' Of course there are a few fellows who have occasionally drawn up
"a list of books as suitable for everybody's perusal,--but then these"
"lists cannot be taken as true criterions, as they all differ from one"
another as much as church sects. One would-be instructor in the art of
reading says we ought all to study 'Tom Jones'--now I don't see the
the regular service and do so under efficient supervision. And there
was created the Government bureau designated as the Planetary
"Exploration Control Board, which was headed by Commander Stone."
*       *       *       *       *
Under this Board the exploration of the planets was undertaken
"methodically and efficiently, with a minimum of lives sacrificed."
"Mercury was charted, tested for essential minerals, and found to be a"
valueless rock heap too near the sun to support life.
Venus was visited and explored segment by segment; and friendly
relations were established with the rather stupid but peaceable people
found there.
Mars was mapped. Here the explorers had lingered a long time: and all
over this planet's surface were found remnants of a vast and intricate
"civilization--from the canals that laced its surface, to great cities"
with mighty buildings still standing. But of life there was none. The
atmosphere was too rare to support it; and the theory was that it had
constantly thinned through thousands of years till the last Martian
had gasped and died in air too attenuated to support life even in
creatures that must have grown greater and greater chested in eons of
adaptation.
Then Jupiter had been reached: and here the methodical planet by
"planet work promised to be checked for a long time to come. Jupiter,"
"with its mighty surface area, was going to take some exploring! It"
would be years before it could be plotted even superficially.
*       *       *       *       *
I answered in a low tone that I thought she must.
'No!' my lady cried harshly--she could be cruel sometimes--'not with
"us. She does not belong to our party. Let her stay with her paymaster,"
and to-morrow he will doubtless reward her.'
What reward she was likely to get Fraulein Max knew well. She flung
"herself at my lady's feet in an agony of fear, and clutching her"
"skirts, cried abjectly for mercy; she would carry, she would help, she"
"would do anything, if she might go! Knowing that we dared not leave"
her since she would be certain to release the general as soon as our
"backs were turned, I was glad when Marie, whose heart was touched,"
joined her prayers to the culprit's and won a reluctant consent.
It has taken long to tell these things. They passed very quickly. I
suppose not more than a quarter of an hour elapsed between our first
"appearance and this juncture, which saw us all standing in the"
"lamplight, laden and ready to be gone; while the general glowered at"
"us in sullen rage, and my lady, with a new thought in her mind, looked"
round in dismay.
"She drew me aside. 'Martin,' she said, 'his orderly is waiting in the"
road with his horse. The moment we are gone he will shout to him.'
"'We have provided for that,' I answered, nodding. Then assuring myself"
"by a last look round that all were ready, I gave the word. 'Now,"
Steve!' I said sharply.
In a twinkling he flung over the general's head a small sack doubled
inwards. We heard a stifled oath and a cry of rage. The bars of the
"strong chair creaked as our prisoner struggled, and for a moment it"
for a final check-up on directions.
They clambered into the tiny control room and shut the hermetically
sealed trap-door. Brand threw the control switch and precisely at
"eleven o'clock the conical shell of metal shot heavenward, gathering"
such speed that it was soon invisible to human eyes. He set their
"course toward the blazing speck that was Jupiter, four hundred million"
miles away; and then reported their start by radio to Commander
Stone's night operator.
The investigatory expedition to the ominous red spot of the giant of
the solar system was on.
CHAPTER II
_The Pipe-like Men_
Brand began to slacken speed on the morning of the thirteenth day
"(morning, of course, being a technical term: there are no horizons in"
space for the sun to rise over). Jupiter was still an immense distance
"off; but it took a great while to slow the momentum of the space ship,"
"which, in the frictionless emptiness of space, had been traveling"
faster and faster for nearly three hundred hours.
"Behind them was the distant ball of sun, so far off that it looked no"
larger than a red-hot penny. Before them was the gigantic disk of
"Jupiter, given a white tinge by the perpetual fog blankets, its"
outlines softened by its thick layer of atmosphere and cloud banks.
“Will it make you happy to promise?”
“Yes.”
"“Then I promise,” said Joyce, humouring him. “Now I’m not going to talk"
to you any more.”
"A few minutes later, his breathing told Joyce that he slept. The"
"newspapers fell from Joyce’s hand, and he put his elbows on his knees"
and crouched over the smouldering logs. Noakes spoke truly. There was
little chance of recovery. He would be left alone again soon. It would
be very comfortless. The poor wreck who was dragging out his last days
upon that wretched bed had been an unspeakable solace to him. Without
his womanlike devotion he would have died of fever six months back on
"the Arato goldfield. Without the influence of his calm fatalism, he"
would have given up heart long ago. Without his steadfast purity of
"soul, he would have gone recklessly to the devil. The thought of losing"
him was a great pang.
"He himself, too, was far from strong. The climate, the hard manual"
labour for which he was physically unfit were telling upon him heavily.
"He yearned for home, for civilised life, for the lost heritage of"
"honour. Yvonne’s letter, telling of the little commonplaces of the lost"
"sweet life of decent living, had revived the ever dormant longing. He"
"began to dream of her, of that last day he had seen her, of her voice"
singing Gounod’s serenade.
"It was difficult to picture her as married to his cousin Everard, whom,"
"in the days of his vanity, he had despised as a prig and now dreaded as"
a scornful benefactor. It was a strange mating. And yet she seemed happy
and unchanged.
stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue. The younger one cuddled down
with her head in her sister’s lap.
"“We will have to marry some day,” she said dreamily—“both of us. We"
have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the
"public. Do you want me to tell you the kind of a man I could love,"
Sis?”
"“Go on, you scatterbrain,” smiled the other."
"“I could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes, who is gentle and"
"respectful to poor girls, who is handsome and good and does not try to"
"flirt. But I could love him only if he had an ambition, an object, some"
work to do in the world. I would not care how poor he was if I could
"help him build his way up. But, sister dear, the kind of man we always"
meet—the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs—I
"could not love a man like that, even if his eyes were blue and he were"
ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street.”
BY COURIER
It was neither the season nor the hour when the Park had frequenters;
"and it is likely that the young lady, who was seated on one of the"
"benches at the side of the walk, had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to"
sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming Spring.
"She rested there, pensive and still. A certain melancholy that touched"
"her countenance must have been of recent birth, for it had not yet"
[17] It was a bad day for the cause of truth when Foxe's _Book of
Martyrs_ was allowed to go out of general circulation. When I was a boy
it was no uncommon thing to see copies of it in American homes. Now it
is rarely seen. A new and corrected edition of it ought to be brought
out and given wide circulation. There have been not a few indications
this year that our people are forgetting some of the most instructive
"history of all the past, and those who seem to be most oblivious of it"
are the editors of some of the secular newspapers.
"[18] There are other indications of some improvement in this matter,"
"but an Anglican resident in Italy, quoted by the _Review of Reviews_ as"
"""a painstaking and fair-minded"" witness, says, ""People are not shocked"
"by clerical immorality, but regard it as natural and inevitable."" To an"
Anglican friend a Roman prelate lamented that a certain cardinal was
"not elected at the late conclave. But the Anglican replied, ""He is a"
"man of conspicuous immorality."" ""No doubt,"" was the answer, ""but you"
Americans seem to think there is no virtue but chastity. The Cardinal
"has not that, but he is an honest man."""
CHAPTER XXXII.
THE OLD FORCES AND THE NEW IN THE ETERNAL CITY.
[Sidenote: An Audience with the Pope.]
"Well, we have seen the Pope. Hearing that a body of Italian pilgrims"
"were to be received by the pontiff at the Vatican, and having assured"
"He turned to the landlady. ""What's the address here, sister?"""
"And later, with the landlady back in her lair, Brent Taber sat down on"
the stairs to wait; sat there with surprise at the feeling of relief
that filled his mind. He had no feeling of triumph about it; no sense of
"a job well done. But there was no great guilt at having failed, either."
"Mostly, he thought, it was the simplification that had come about. There"
had been so many confusing and bewildering complications in the affair;
improbability piled on the impossible; the ridiculous coupled with the
incredible.
"But now, with one stroke of a knife, it had been simplified and brought"
into terms everyone could understand; into terms Captain Abrams of the
New York Police Department would grasp in an instant.
A killer was on the loose.
*       *       *       *       *
One of Senator Crane's priceless gifts was a sense of timing. Much of
his success had sprung from the instinctive knowledge of when to act. He
"had a sense of the dramatic which never deserted him. As a result, he"
had been known to turn in an instant from one subject to another--to
dodge defeats and score triumphs with bewildering agility.
His preoccupation on this particular day was with a home-state
"issue--the location of a government plant. After he obtained the floor,"
he counted the house and noted that only a bare quorum was present.
"Gradually, the members of the Senate of the United States would drift to"
their seats. So Crane began reading letters which tended to support his
"gone in."""
"I stand there waiting to be at hand, to rush in to the rescue, for after"
"all I am a human being, not a brute. Several minutes pass. He has not even"
"bothered to be very quiet, for I hear him clicking the key in the lock."
"Surely I ought to hear a cry now? I hear nothing, nothing; a chair"
"scraping across the floor, that is all."
"""But good heavens, he may do her some harm! He may injure her; he may"
overpower her with rape! Ought I not to tap on the window? I--what for?
"But at the very first cry, I shall be on the spot, take my word for it."""
Not a single cry.
The hours pass; I have settled down to wait. Of course I cannot go my way
and desert a helpless woman. But the hours wear on. A very thorough
"business in there, nothing niggardly about this; it is almost dawn. It"
"occurs to me that he may be killing her, perhaps has killed her already; I"
am alarmed and about to get up--when the key clicks in the lock again and
"Solem emerges. He does not run, but walks back the way he came, down to"
the veranda of my own house. There he hangs the actor's raincoat where it
"hung before, and emerges again. But this time he is naked. He has been"
naked under the coat all this time. Is it possible? Why not? No
"inhibitions, no restraint, no covering; Solem has thought it all out. Now,"
"stark naked, he stalks to his room."
What a man!
I sit thinking and collecting myself and regaining my wits. What has
"happened? The south wing is still wrapped in silence, but the lady is not"
"dead; I can see that from Solem's fearless manner as he goes to his room,"
"lights the lamp, and goes to bed."
sleep. Good-night.”
"“Good-night,” she said miserably."
"And so, without touch of hand, they parted."
"The hours of the evening wore on, and night came. At last she cried"
herself to sleep. It had been a day of tears.
They left Ostend quietly the following morning by the Dover boat. During
the whole journey the Canon treated Yvonne with the deferential courtesy
"he could always assume to women, seeing to her comforts, anticipating"
"her wants, even exchanging now and then casual remarks on passing"
objects of interest. But of the subject next his heart he said not a
word. The crossing was smooth. The sea air revived Yvonne’s strength.
"His silence half comforted, half frightened her. Had he relented? She"
"glanced often at his impassive face, in cruel anxiety to pierce to the"
thoughts that lay behind. Yet a little hope came to her; for fear of
losing it she dared not speak. To her simple mind it seemed impossible
that merely conscientious scruples could make him cast her off. If he
"loved her, his love would triumph. If he persisted in his resolve, he"
cared for her no longer. In this case her future was very simple. She
would go back to London and sing.
She seemed to have cried her feeling away during the night--such as he
had left unbruised and untorn. For the quivering flesh is only sensitive
up to a certain point of maceration. He had trodden upon her pitilessly;
"but she felt no resentment. In fact, she would have been quite happy if"
"he had put his arms round her and said, “Let us forget, Yvonne.” By the"
end of the journey she had cajoled herself into the idea that he would
do so.
"pomp of the alluring pompadour. She wore no chains, bracelets or"
lockets. She had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to
"luncheon. Her dress was grey and plain, but it fitted her figure with"
fidelity and discretion. In her neat black turban hat was the
gold-green wing of a macaw. On this morning she was softly and shyly
"radiant. Her eyes were dreamily bright, her cheeks genuine peachblow,"
"her expression a happy one, tinged with reminiscence."
"Pitcher, still mildly curious, noticed a difference in her ways this"
"morning. Instead of going straight into the adjoining room, where her"
"desk was, she lingered, slightly irresolute, in the outer office. Once"
"she moved over by Maxwell’s desk, near enough for him to be aware of"
her presence.
The machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man; it was a busy New
"York broker, moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs."
“Well—what is it? Anything?” asked Maxwell sharply. His opened mail lay
"like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk. His keen grey eye,"
"impersonal and brusque, flashed upon her half impatiently."
"“Nothing,” answered the stenographer, moving away with a little smile."
"“Mr. Pitcher,” she said to the confidential clerk, “did Mr. Maxwell say"
anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer?”
"“He did,” answered Pitcher. “He told me to get another one. I notified"
the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning.
"It’s 9.45 o’clock, and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple"
chewing gum has showed up yet.”
"“I will do the work as usual, then,” said the young lady, “until some"
which penetrated the sheltering walls out into the night where fifty
men writhed in a death-struggle with hundreds--saw every bleeding
"wound, heard every smothered moan of pain, felt already the cold iron"
"pierce their own breasts. The hours passed, and they did not yield."
"They had ceased from their incongruous tasks, and stood and waited,"
wordless and tearless.
As the first grey lights of dawn crept into the stifling room they
"heard footsteps hurrying across the adjacent room, and each drew"
herself upright to meet the end. Mrs. Carmichael's hand tightened over
"the revolver, but it was only Mr. Berry who entered. The little"
"missionary, a shy, society-shunning man, noted for doing more harm"
than good among the natives by his zealous bigotry and ignorance of
"their prejudices, stood revealed in a new light. His face was grimed"
"with dirt and powder, his clothes disordered, his weak eyes bright"
with the fire of battle.
"""Do not be afraid,"" he said quickly. ""There is no immediate danger. I"
have only been sent to warn you to be ready to leave the bungalow. The
"front wall is shot-riddled, and the place may become indefensible at"
"any moment. When that time comes, you must slip out to the old"
"bungalow. Nicholson believes he can hold out there."""
"""My husband--?"" interrupted Mrs. Carmichael."
"""Your husband is safe. In fact, all three were well when I left. If I"
"wasn't against such things, I should say it was a splendid fight--and"
"every man a hero. The Rajah--"""
"""The Rajah--?"""
Mr. Berry looked in stern surprise at the pale face of the speaker.
"If a foetus[54] lacks the right ear, the rule of the king will come"
"to an end, his palace will be destroyed, overthrow of the elders of"

greenish-gray to grayish brown; each with a flat face and five light
brown filiform ridges and about 16 oil-tubes; odor and taste agreeable
"and aromatic. The anise berries are dried and ground, this being the"
form in which it is usually used.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and pigs, 2 to 3 dr.; dogs,"
10 to 30 gr.
OLEUM ANISI--OIL OF ANISE
A volatile oil distilled from the fruit of star anise.
"PROPERTIES.--A colorless or pale yellow, thin and strongly refractive"
"liquid, having the characteristic odor of anise, and a sweetish, mildly"
aromatic taste. Specific gravity about 0.975 to 0.985. Soluble in an
equal volume of alcohol.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 20 to 30 m.; sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 m.; dogs"
"and cats, 1 to 5 m."
"ACTIONS.--Anise is an aromatic stimulant, stomachic and carminative. It"
"is used to relieve indigestion and flatulence, to communicate an"
"agreeable flavor to many medicines, and to diminish the griping of"
purgatives. Oil of anise resembles in action other volatile oils.
USES.--The oil of anise is employed with olive oil or alcohol to kill
"fleas or lice on dogs, rubbed over the skin; and one drop of the pure"
oil may be placed on the feathers of fowl to cause destruction of lice.
"The oil of anise is sometimes prescribed to disguise the odor of drugs,"
and is ordered in cough mixtures for its expectorant properties.
"“Ah, yes. That 's why I wrote to you yesterday, dear.”"
"She had written to him, in fact, every month for many years, long,"
foolish letters in which everything was futile save the genuine
"affection underlying them, and more often than not John had taken"
them as read and pitched them into the waste-paper basket. His few
"perfunctory replies, however, had been treasured and neatly docketed and"
"pigeon-holed in the bureau in her bedroom, together with the rest of her"
family archives and other precious documents. Among them was a famous
recipe for taking mulberry stains out of satin. That she prized
inordinately.
"“I should n't like to drift apart from dear Ellen's boy,” she said with"
a smile.
"“And I should n't like to lose touch with you, my dear aunt,” said John,"
with more graciousness. “And that is why I've come to see you to-day.
I've had rather a bad time lately.”
“I know--that awful case in the papers.” She shivered. “Don't let us
talk of it. You must try to forget it. I wrote to you how shocked I was.
"I asked you to come and stay with me, and said I would do what I could"
"to comfort you. I believe in the ties of kinship, my dear, and I did n't"
like to think of you bearing your trouble alone.”
"“That was very kind indeed of you,” said John, who had missed the"
invitation hidden away in the wilderness of the hastily scanned
"sixteen-page letter. He flushed beneath his dark skin, aware of"
"rudeness. After all, when a lady invites you to her house, it is boorish"
to ignore the offered hospitality. It is a slight for which one can
scarcely apologize. But she evidently bore him no malice.
"office itself, with its glass doors, its counter, and its long desk, at"
the farther end of which a bill-clerk was poring over his task.
Iron-barred windows at the front of the room looked out upon the
street; other windows and a door at the right opened upon the driveway
"and railroad track, while at the rear the glass-panelled door through"
"which they had just been peering gave egress only to the dock itself,"
up which the two officers were likely to come at any instant. Even as
"Emerson, with a last desperate glance, summed up the possible places of"
"concealment, Fraser exclaimed, softly:"
"""There they are now!"" and they saw at the foot of the gang-plank two"
men talking with Big George. They saw Balt point the strangers
"carelessly to the office, whence he had seen Boyd disappearing a few"
"moments before, and turn back to his stevedores; then they saw the"
plain-clothes men approaching.
"""Here! Gimme your coat and hat, quick!"" cried Fraser in a low voice,"
"his eyes blazing at a sudden, thought. He stripped his own garments"
"from his back with feverish haste. ""Put mine on. There! I'll stall for"
"you. When they grab me, take it on the run. Understand!"""
"""That won't do. Everybody knows me."" Boyd cast an apprehensive glance"
"at the arched back of the bill-clerk, but Fraser, quick of resource in"
"such a situation, forced him swiftly to make the change, saying:"
"""Nix. It's your only 'out.' Stand here, see!"" He indicated a position"
"beside the rear door. ""I'll step out the other way where they can see"
"me,"" he continued, pointing to the wagon-way at the right. ""Savvy? When"
"they grab me, you beat it, and don't wait for nothing."""
"""But you--"""

"LETTER TO THE CLEVELAND CONGRESS OF FREETHINKERS, OCTOBER, 1885."
I send my greetings to the Congress of Freethinkers assembled at
"Cleveland, and regret, more than I can express, that I am unable to"
"be there and hear all the good things you will hear, and see all the"
earnest workers you will see.
The Freethinkers of America ought to be a very proud and enthusiastic
"body, when they have in their presidential chair the ablest orator"
"of modern times, and the broadest, bravest, and most comprehensive"
"intellect that has ever been called ""Mr. President"" in this land of"
bravery and presidents. Washington was a patriot of whom we are all
justly proud. He was liberal in his religion and progressive in his
views of personal rights. And yet he had his limitations. To him liberty
"and personal rights were modified by the words, ""free, white, adult,"
"males."" He got no farther. He who fought for freedom upheld slavery! And"
yet we are all proud and glad to pay honor and respect to the memory of
Washington.
"Abraham Lincoln we place still higher on the roll of honor; for, added"
"to his still more liberal religious views, in his conceptions of freedom"
and justice he had at least two fewer limitations than had the patriot
"of 1776. He struck both ""free"" and ""white"" from his mental black list,"
and gave once more an impulse to liberty that thrilled a nation and gave
fresh dignity to the human race.
from a German mercantile sub-marine. So he says. Fifty francs a
"metre--very, very wide. But they are too much trouble to carry in a"
"knapsack, though their brilliance fascinates."
*       *       *       *       *
"So we stroll and look at the shops, at the filigree gold jewelling of"
"the peasants, at a good bookshop. But there is little to see and"
"therefore the question is, shall we go on? Shall we go forward?"
There are two ways of leaving Cagliari for the north: the State railway
"that runs up the west side of the island, and the narrow-gauge secondary"
railway that pierces the centre. But we are too late for the big trains.
"So we will go by the secondary railway, wherever it goes."
"There is a train at 2.30, and we can get as far as Mandas, some fifty"
miles in the interior. When we tell the queer little waiter at the
"hotel, he says he comes from Mandas, and there are two inns. So after"
lunch--a strictly fish menu--we pay our bill. It comes to sixty odd
"francs--for three good meals each, with wine, and the night's lodging,"
"this is cheap, as prices now are in Italy."
"Pleased with the simple and friendly Scala di Ferre, I shoulder my sack"
and we walk off to the second station. The sun is shining hot this
"afternoon--burning hot, by the sea. The road and the buildings look dry"
"and desiccated, the harbour rather weary and end of the world."
There is a great crowd of peasants at the little station. And almost
every man has a pair of woven saddle-bags--a great flat strip of
"coarse-woven wool, with flat pockets at either end, stuffed with"
purchases. These are almost the only carrying bags. The men sling them
"over their shoulder, so that one great pocket hangs in front, one"
announced that the prisoner had been placed in cell No. 2. Dawson
"sprang up. ""We will have a look at him through the peephole, and if it"
"is our man--"" One glance was enough. Before me I saw him whom I had"
expected to see. He and his cargo of whisky bottles had reached the
"last stage of their long journey; at one end had been peace, reasonable"
"prosperity, and a happy home; at the other was, perhaps, a rope or a"
bullet.
"Dawson began once more to descant upon his own astuteness, but I was"
too sick at heart to listen. I remembered only the visit years before
"which that man's wife had paid to me. ""Will you not open the parcel?"""
"I interposed. He fell upon it, exposed its contents of bread,"
"chocolate, and sardine tins, and called for a can opener. He shook the"
"tins one by one beside his ear, and then, selecting that which gave"
"out no ""flop"" of oil, stripped it open, plunged his fingers inside,"
and pulled forth a clammy mess of putty and sawdust. In a moment he
had come upon a paper which after reading he handed to me. It bore the
"words in English, ""Informant arrested: dare not send more."""
"""What a fool!"" cried Dawson. ""As if the evidence against him were not"
"sufficient already he must give us this."""
"""You will let that poor devil of a draughtsman down easily?"" I"
murmured.
"""We want him as a witness,"" replied Dawson. ""Tit for tat. If he helps"
"us, we will help him. And now we will cut along to the Admiral. He is"
"eager for news."""
"We broke in upon the Admiral in his office near the shipyards, and he"
"greeted me with cheerful badinage. ""So you are in the hands of the"
"police at last, Copplestone. I always told you what would be the end"
"being like a chest of drawers, or pigeon holes to hold the dead. Tufts"
of dark and plumy cypresses rise among the flat graves of the enclosure.
"In the south, cemeteries are walled off and isolated very tight. The"
"dead, as it were, are kept fast in pound. There is no spreading of"
"graves over the face of the country. They are penned in a tight fold,"
with cypresses to fatten on the bones. This is the one thoroughly
"strange note in the landscape. But all-pervading there is a strangeness,"
"that strange feeling as if the _depths_ were barren, which comes in the"
"south and the east, sun-stricken. Sun-stricken, and the heart eaten out"
by the dryness.
"""I like it! I like it!"" cries the q-b."
"""But could you live here?"" She would like to say yes, but daren't."
We stray back. The q-b wants to buy one of those saddle-bag
arrangements. I say what for? She says to keep things in. Ach! but
"peeping in the shops, we see one and go in and examine it. It is quite a"
"sound one, properly made: but plain, quite plain. On the white"
cross-stripes there are no lovely colored flowers of rose and green and
magenta: the three favorite Sardinian colors: nor are there any of the
fantastic and griffin-like beasts. So it won't do. How much does it
cost? Forty-five francs.
There is nothing to do in Mandas. So we will take the morning train and
"go to the terminus, to Sorgono. Thus, we shall cross the lower slopes of"
"the great central knot of Sardinia, the mountain knot called"
Gennargentu. And Sorgono we feel will be lovely.
"Back at the station we make tea on the spirit lamp, fill the thermos,"
"pack the knapsack and the kitchenino, and come out into the sun of the"
"platform. The q-b goes to thank the black-cap for the white bread,"
He saw not the rival queens of beauty in their gorgeous apparel.  He saw
"not the surging crowd that eddied around them, appraising, flattering,"
"admiring, laughing.  He only saw one white figure, standing aloof and"
"for the moment alone, the moonbeams glimmering upon the shining"
"whiteness of her dress, the fair face bent, as though in some sort of"
"sorrow or shame.  He saw it, and he was instantly at her side."
"Whether or not he spoke, he knew not.  He offered his arm, and the next"
"moment he was leading her away from that giddy, mocking crowd; and he"
felt the clinging clasp of her fingers thrilling him to his heart’s
core.  He heard the breath of relief as the chorus of flippant merriment
"died away in the distance. He paused, and a quick exclamation escaped"
his lips.
"""This is no place for you, Lady Geraldine.  Why do they bring you"
"hither?"""
"She answered not, but turned her gaze for a moment towards him, and then"
"dropped her eyes. With an impulse for which he could not account, he"
"covered the fingers which lay upon his arm with his own disengaged hand,"
and passionate words sprang to his lips.
"""Give me only the right, fair lady, and I will save you from them all."
I ask only to live and die as your knight—your champion—without
"wages—without reward!"""
Then he was silent.  His breath came thick and fast.  He felt the quiver
"of the hand he held.  He knew not how long the silence lasted, it was so"
"strangely sweet, so full of mysterious meaning."
"""I thank you, sir.  I trow that you speak truth, and that your words are"
not idle froth—gone in a moment—as the words of so many of yonder
trace of her did he find. But what he did discover solved the mystery
of the grewsome feast of death which he had just witnessed. In a
"corner where he had dropped it, there lay a silken banderol belonging"
"to a man-at-arms of Anjou's Provencals. They had been here, and the"
"nuns, to escape the violation of their bodies, had died, thus cheating"
the fiends out of the gratification of their lusts.
The terrible discovery unnerved Francesco so completely that for a
"time he stood as if turned to stone, looking about him like a"
traveller who has stumbled blindly into a charnel house. Urged by
"manifold forebodings, he then rushed from room to room, from cell to"
cell. The same silence met him everywhere. Of Ilaria he found not a
"trace. Had the fiends of Anjou carried her away, or had she, in"
"endeavoring to escape, found her death outside of the walls of San"
Nicandro?
He dared not think out the thought.
"The shadows of the place, the staring faces, the stiff hands clawing"
"at things inanimate, were like the phantasms of the night. Francesco"
took the sea-air into his nostrils and looked up into the blue
radiance of the sky. All about him the garden glistened in the dawn;
the cypresses shimmered with dew. The late roses made very death more
apparent to his soul.
"As he stood in deep thought, half dreading what he but half knew, a"
"voice called to him, breaking suddenly the ponderous silence of the"
"place. Guided by its sound, Francesco unlatched the door and found"
himself face to face with the Duke of Spoleto.
For a moment they faced each other in silence.
"George's brother, Count Anthony Hamilton. He had never been friendly to"
"his younger brother, and had ceased to look upon him as a brother at all"
after his disgraceful reformation. Then when the king turned against
"George, Anthony, good courtier that he was, turned likewise, and there is"
no bitterness that may be compared with that of an apostate brother.
"After we had talked for a minute or two, Count Anthony asked if I knew"
"anything of ""the fool,"" as he was pleased to call his brother."
"""I know nothing of your brother George, my lord, if it is him you mean."""
"""He is no brother of mine, and if you wish to become a member of our"
"family, you will cease to consider him your friend,"" returned his"
"Lordship, making an effort to conceal his anger."
"I was not in the mood to take his remark kindly, therefore I answered"
warmly:--
"""Shall my entering the ranks of your noble family curtail my privilege of"
"choosing my own friends?"""
"""No, with one exception,"" he replied."
"""The honor of the alliance is great, my lord, but I shall not consent to"
"even one exception at your dictation. Your sister, my future wife, loves"
"her brother, and if she does not object to my friendship for him, your"
"Lordship oversteps your authority, as head of your house, by protesting."""
"He turned angrily upon me, saying: ""You have been paying your court with"
"lukewarm ardor of late, Baron Clyde. Perhaps you would not grieve if your"
"friendship for a family outcast were to bar you from the family."""
that bombing-stunt a few months ago. It was bloody awful too--the worst
thing I've ever been in. I was standing next to him when the first one
"exploded. He flopped down and lay flat on the ground, but I rushed away"
into the fields with a lot of others. When it was all over we went back
and heard the wounded crying out in a way that was dreadful to hear.
"This fellow was still lying on the ground by the duckboards, trembling"
"all over and paralysed with fear. We went to help the wounded, but he"
"was in such a state that he could not come with us, so we left him"
behind. There was an inquiry afterwards and _we_ got into a frightful
"row for running away. He got the M.M. for sticking to his post!"""
VII
THE GERMAN PUSH
"""What madness there is in this arithmetic that counts men by the"
millions like grains of corn in a bushel.... A newspaper has just
written about an encounter with the enemy: 'Our losses were
"insignificant, one dead and five wounded.' It would be interesting"
to know for whom these losses are insignificant? For the one who
"was killed?... If he were to rise from his grave, would he think"
the loss 'insignificant'? If only he could think of everything from
"the very beginning, of his childhood, his family, his beloved wife,"
"and how he went to the war and how, seized by the most conflicting"
"thoughts and emotions, he felt afraid, and how it all ended in"
death and horror.... But they try to convince us that 'our losses
"are insignificant.' Think of it, godless writer! Go to your master"
the Devil with your clever arithmetic.... How this man revolts
"and is situated within Jiand's jurisdiction, although he is not the"
"actual owner of the town. The word Khwash literally means ""sweet,"""
"and, I believe, owes its name to the water, which is, by the way,"
quite warm when it appears at the surface of the ground in the
immediate vicinity.
"The Western portion of the Sarhad, extending roughly from Khwash to"
"Galugan, is held by the Ismailzais under their redoubtable leader,"
Juma Khan.
All three of these tribes possess approximately one thousand
"families apiece, and, of course, each family has many members, as"
"well as large numbers of camels, and herds of sheep and goats."
"Each of these tribes, at the time of which I write, could muster,"
"roughly, from one to two thousand riflemen, chiefly armed with Mauser"
"courage. As the man emerges upon the narrow platform, he is engulfed in"
"the swirling flakes, and often is pinned against the masonry so tightly"
by the wind that he cannot move a limb; at other times he is swept
"almost off his feet. While engaged in his freezing task, he also runs"
the risk of being drenched by a rising comber.

"The men on the lonely, exposed Tillamook Rock, off the Oregon coast,"
"have had more than one occasion to respect the storm-fiend. One night,"
"while a fearful gale was raging, a huge mass of rock was torn away from"
"the islet, snatched by the waves, and thrown high into the air. It"
and waited in the field. But this time there were several further
shell-bursts. No dull boom in the distance followed by a long-drawn
"whine, but only the earth and smoke thrown darkly up and then the"
deafening double detonation.
"The next day more shells came over, and the next day also."
The big holes with their earthen rims began to dot the fields in many
"places. No damage of ""military importance"" had been done. Not even a"
"soldier had been killed, but only an inoffensive cow."
"At night the sky was alive with the whirr of propellers, and shells"
whistled overhead and burst a long way off.
"One Sunday, toward the end of March, when we had a half-holiday, I"
walked up the hill that was crowned by a large monastery and sat down
on the slope by a group of sallows. They were in full bloom. A swarm of
bees and flies were buzzing round. Peacock and Tortoiseshell butterflies
were flitting to and fro. The sunlight filtered down through the bluish
haze. I rested and let an hour or two slip by. Then I got up and crossed
a little brook and strolled along a narrow path that wound its way
"through a copse. The ground was starred with wood-anemones, oxlips,"
"violets, cuckoo-flowers, and in damp places with green-golden saxifrage."
I came to a small cottage that had pots of flowers in every window. I
sat down while a hospitable old woman made coffee and chattered volubly
in Flemish. Another soldier arrived soon after. Had I heard the news?
The Germans had broken through on the Somme and had captured Bapaume. I
"asked him if he had seen it in print. No, he had heard it from an A.S.C."
"driver. He hoped it wasn't true, but he feared it was."
I returned to camp full of suppressed excitement.
I am glad to add that the views we hold seem to have come at last to be
shared by the more responsible part of the French amongst the
"governmental circle, as well as by the general public. The newspapers"
"which are still sticking to their old contention are very few in number,"
and they seem to have some particular reasons of their own. I can never
think a nation like France could consciously and wilfully offend against
"justice and equity, and the only thing we anxiously hope for is that the"
declaration of the French Government may be honestly and effectually
"followed up. Whatever may be one's intention, the drift of events often"
"creates unlooked-for incidents, and that too often against one's will,"
when it is too late to avoid the consequences. Let all parties concerned
be careful in this matter of vital importance.

ethical point of view it is an unjust and unreasonable accusation. From
a practical point of view it is idle and useless talk.
I have spoken and written on these particular points so often that I do

EMETIC
"DERIVATION.--Make a white paste with cream of tartar, antimony trioxide"
"and water. Set aside 24 hours, boil in water 15 minutes and crystallize."
"PROPERTIES.--Colorless, transparent crystals of the rhombic system,"
"becoming opaque and white on exposure to the air, or a white granular"
"powder without odor and having a sweet, afterwards disagreeable,"
"metallic taste. Soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol."
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; sheep, 2 to 5 gr.; pigs, ¹⁄₂ to 1"
"gr.; dogs, ¹⁄₁₀ to ¹⁄₂ gr. As an emetic for pigs, 4 to 10 gr.; dogs, 1"
to 2 gr.
"ACTIONS.--Tartar emetic is a systemic and local emetic, a diaphoretic,"
cardiac and arterial sedative and a gastro-intestinal irritant. It is a
"powerful waste producer and stimulates the secretions of the stomach,"
"intestines, salivary glands, liver and pancreas. Large doses cause"
"nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, while toxic doses are followed by"
"vomiting (in animals that can vomit), serious blood purging, great"
"depression of the circulation and respiration weakness, collapse and"
death. Tartar emetic is also a vermifuge.

"that she was there beside, around, against, within, above him, clinging"
"to him, wooing him, calling him so poignantly through the finer senses"
that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call. Once again he
"answered loudly: “Yes, dear!” and turned, wild-eyed, to gaze on"
"vacancy, for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and"
"outstretched arms in the odour of mignonette. Oh, God! whence that"
"odour, and since when have odours had a voice to call? Thus he groped."
"He burrowed in crevices and corners, and found corks and cigarettes."
These he passed in passive contempt. But once he found in a fold of the
"matting a half-smoked cigar, and this he ground beneath his heel with a"
green and trenchant oath. He sifted the room from end to end. He found
dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant; but of
"her whom he sought, and who may have lodged there, and whose spirit"
"seemed to hover there, he found no trace."
And then he thought of the housekeeper.
He ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a
crack of light. She came out to his knock. He smothered his excitement
as best he could.
"“Will you tell me, madam,” he besought her, “who occupied the room I"
have before I came?”
"“Yes, sir. I can tell you again. ’Twas Sprowls and Mooney, as I said."
"Miss B’retta Sprowls it was in the theatres, but Missis Mooney she was."
My house is well known for respectability. The marriage certificate
"hung, framed, on a nail over—”"
"""I will promise if you wish, madame, that no word shall pass my lips,"" I"
"said.  ""But as to assistance, I cannot promise until I am aware of the"
"nature of the service demanded of me."""
"""Of course,"" she exclaimed, with a faint attempt at a smile.  My words"
"had apparently reassured her, for she instantly became calmer, as though"
"relying upon me for help.  ""Then as you give me your promise upon your"
"honour to say nothing, you shall know the truth.  Come with me."""
"She led the way down the long corridor, and turning to the left suddenly"
"opened the door of a large and handsome bed-chamber, the wooden"
sun-blinds of which were closed to keep out the crimson glow of the
sunset.  The room was a fine one with big crystal mirrors and a shining
"toilette-service in silver, but upon the bed with its yellow silk"
"hangings lay a female form fully dressed, but white-faced and"
motionless.  In the dim half-light I could just distinguish the features
as those of Yolande.
"""What has occurred?""  I cried in a hoarse whisper, dashing towards the"
bedside and bending down to look upon the face that had once held me in
fascination.
"""We do not know,"" answered the trembling woman at my side.  ""It is all a"
"mystery."""
I stretched forth my hand and touched her cheek.  It was icy cold.
In those few moments my eyes had become accustomed to the dim light of
"the darkened room, and I detected the change that had taken place in the"
"girl's countenance.  Her eyes were closed, her lips blanched, her fair"
"hair, escaped from its pins, fell in a sheen of gold upon the lace-edged"
"obvious reluctance, glancing out of his little oblique eyes at the young"
colonel.
Rollo considered a while before answering.
"""It is my opinion that the fewer men concerned in such a venture the"
"greater the chances of success,"" he said at last; ""furnish me with one"
petty officer intimately acquainted with the country between Zaragoza
"and San Ildefonso, and I will ask no more."""
Cabrera drew a long breath and looked at the young man with infinitely
more approval than he had before manifested.
"""You are right,"" he said, ""three times right! If you fail, there are"
fewer to go to the gallows. In prison fewer ill-sewn wine-skins to leak
"information. If you succeed, there are also fewer to divide the credit"
"and the reward. For my own part, I do not think you will succeed, but I"
will provide you with the best man in my command for your purpose and in
"addition heartily wish you well out of your adventure!"""
Cabrera was indeed immensely relieved to find the desires of our hero so
moderate. He had been directed to supply him with whatever force he
"required, and he expected to be deprived of a regiment at least, at a"
most critical time in the affairs of the Absolute King.
"""Young man,"" he said, ""you will certainly be shot or hanged before you"
are a month older. Nevertheless in the mean time I would desire to have
"the honour of shaking you by the hand. If you were not to die so soon,"
undoubtedly you would go far! It is a pity. And the Cristinos are bad
shots. They will not do the job half as creditably as my fellows would
"have done it for you this morning!"""

TRAPPING AN ABORIGINE
In houses and clothing the Darien Indians are decidedly primitive]

Death came fast to those in the jungle. The agonies they suffered from
"starvation, exposure and insect pests baffle description. “Truxton in"
"casting his eyes on the ground saw a toad”, wrote the historian."
"“Instantly snatching it up, he bit off the head and, spitting it away,"
"devoured the body. Maury looked at him a moment, and then picked up the"
"rejected head, saying, ‘Well, Truxton, you are getting quite particular."
"Something of an epicure, eh’? With these words he quietly devoured the"
head himself.”
Nine of the twenty-seven men who entered the Darien with Strain died.
"When the leader returned with the relief party they were found, like"
"Greely at Camp Starvation, unable to move and slowly dying. Those who"
retained life never fully regained strength. Every condition which
brought such frightful disaster upon the Strain party exists in the
"Darien today. The Indians are as hostile, the trails as faintly"
"outlined, the jungle as dense, the insects as savage. Only along the"
"banks of the rivers has civilization made some little headway, but the"
richest gold field twenty miles back in the interior is as safe from
civilized workings as though it were walled in with steel and guarded by
dragons. Every speculative man you meet in Panama will assure you that
the gold is there but all agree that conditions must be radically
changed before it can be gotten out unless a regiment and a subsistence
"after the conclusion of the war continue so to act in relation to, and"
"finally dispose of, all matters and things which arose during the war,"
"including all penalties, liabilities and forfeitures incurred during the"
war.
Part II.--PROCEDURE IN PRIZE CAUSES.
"[Sidenote: Custody of ships taken as prize. [27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s."
16.]]
"16. Where a ship (not being a ship of war) is taken as prize, and is or"
"is brought within the jurisdiction of a prize court, she shall forthwith"
"be delivered up to the marshal of the court, or, if there is no such"
"marshal, to the principal officer of customs at the port, and shall"
"remain in his custody, subject to the orders of the court."
"[Sidenote: Bringing in of ship papers. [27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s. 17.]]"
"17.--(1) The captors shall in all cases, with all practicable speed,"
bring the ship papers into the registry of the court.
"(2) The officer in command, or one of the chief officers of the"
"capturing ship, or some other person who was present at the capture and"
"saw the ship papers delivered up or found on board, shall make oath that"
"they are brought in as they were taken, without fraud, addition,"
"subduction, or alteration, or else shall account on oath to the"
satisfaction of the court for the absence or altered condition of the
ship papers or any of them.
(3) Where no ship papers are delivered up or found on board the captured
"ship, the officer in command, or one of the chief officers of the"
"In truth, this is the one principle which can give men guidance in the"
"tangled intricacy of modern life. It is necessary to salvation, _now_,"
"not hereafter only, to believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord"
Jesus Christ.
"For, first of all, men need to be saved from the apathy of despair."
They need some hope that there is an answer to the riddle of the
Universe. Let them once begin to feel that it _may_ be true that the
very God cares for His creatures and has made His love for them
"manifest by taking to Himself the body, mind and spirit of man, and"
"joining for ever human nature to the Godhead, then through the"
darkness comes a human voice saying--
"“O heart I made, a heart beats here!"
"Face, my hands fashioned, see it in Myself."
"Thou hast no power nor mayst conceive of mine,"
"But love I gave thee, with Myself to love,"
And thou must love Me who have died for thee.”
A man regains his self-respect when once he has escaped from the
paralyzing sense that his is only
“a life of nothings nothing worth
From that first nothing ere our birth
To that last nothing under earth.”
And there is only one starting-point for those who journey on this
quest of an answer to the enigma of life. They must resolutely abandon
the long travelled “_a priori_ road.” They must understand that the
"science of to-day is not tied to any materialistic axioms, that"
"metaphysic cannot be ignored by the physician, and that no competent"
friends and forget all about the army and the war. I would be gay and
"frivolous and go to theatres, music-halls and cafés. And one day I would"
spend in the British Museum and lose myself in books--that would be
"just like old times! Of course, our leave would not last for ever and"
the return journey would be terrible. No doubt the fortnight would pass
"very quickly, but I determined to enjoy every single hour with"
"deliberation and understanding, and to squeeze every drop of pleasure"
out of it. How many hours were there in a fortnight? More than three
"hundred! Many would be wasted in sleep, but still, there would be many"
"left and by dwelling upon each one, the fortnight would seem an age."
*       *       *       *       *
An afternoon and an evening in a train that travelled all too slowly. A
night and half a day at Calais Rest Camp. How terrible was the rankling
impatience that gnawed our hearts as the hours dragged on.
"But at last we were on the leave boat. There was another long delay, and"
"then, with a feeling of immense relief, we heard the engines throb and"
the paddle-wheels begin to turn. I looked overboard and saw white foam
hissing along the surface of water rapidly widening between us and the
quay.
Seventeen months of exile and slavery had come to an end and before us
lay a wonderful fortnight of freedom and happiness. And at the end of
the fortnight? There was no need to think of that now.
The sea was blue and smooth and a cool breeze was blowing. We saw the
cliffs of England grow larger and larger. Soon we were able to
"distinguish the town of Dover, the houses clustered round the harbour,"
and the Castle up on the cliff. It was there that I had begun my career
as a soldier more than two years before. How much had happened since
"The description did fit Gates like an old glove, yet his most dominant"
characteristic was an unfailing loyalty to our family and an honest
"bluntness, both of which had become as generally recognized as his skill"
"in handling the _Whim_--""the smartest schooner yacht,"" he would have"
"told you on a two-minute acquaintanceship, ""that ever tasted salt."""
"""We might open the cottage for a few days, Gates,"" I said, as we were"
getting into the motor.
"""Bless you, sir,"" he replied, caressing a weather-beaten chin with thumb"
"and finger, ""the _Whim_'s been tugging at her cable mighty fretful this"
"parst fortnight! The crew hoped you'd be coming aboard at once, sir."
"Fact is, we're wanting to be told how you and Mr. Thomas, here, licked"
"those Germans."""
"""Angels of the Marne protect me,"" Tommy groaned. ""Gates, I wouldn't"
"resurrect those scraps for the Kaiser's scalp!"""
"""Yes, he will,"" I promised, smiling at the old fellow's look of"
"disappointment. ""He'll probably talk you to death, though; that's the"
"only trouble."""
"""I'll tell you what,"" Tommy said, ""we'll chuck the cottage idea and go"
"aboard; then tonight, Gates, you pipe the crew--if that's the nautical"
"term--whereupon I'll hold a two-hour inquest over our deceased war, on"
condition that we bury the subject forever more. We came down here to
"lose the last eighteen months of our lives, Gates, not keep 'em green."
"Maybe you don't know it, but we're after the big adventure!"""
"His eyes twinkled as he said this, and his face was lighted by a rare"
smile that no one possessed more engagingly than Tommy. While he treated
any serious commiseration.
"When he did come to death-grapple with the absolute, the beasts above"
"mentioned, he stood out a tragic young figure, fiercely alone in the"
"arena, save for Herold."
"His name, uncommon and arresting, had one connotation in London--the"
"Case, the appalling and abominable Case. Even Ferguson of the “Daily"
"Herald,” who had evinced such sympathy for him at first, shrank from the"
name at the head of the weekly column and suggested the temporary use of
"a pseudonym. Had it not been for Herold's intervention, Risca would have"
told Ferguson to go to the devil and would have refused to work for his
"Philistine paper. He swallowed the insult, which did him no good. He"
refused to carry the accursed name into the haunts of men.
"“Come to the club, at any rate,” Herold urged. “Every man there is loyal"
to you.”
“And every man as he looks at me will have on his retina not a picture
"of me, but a picture of what went on in that house in Smith Street.”"
"“Oh, go and buy a serviceable epidermis,” cried Herold. Argument was"
useless.
So Risca worked like a mole at anonymous journalism in his shabby
lodgings where Lilias and Niphetos were suggested only by a mangy tabby
"who occasionally prowled into his sitting-room, and Arachne presided,"
"indeed, but in the cobwebs about the ceiling in the guise which she had"
been compelled to take by the angry god when the world was young. Only
"when his attendance at the office of the weekly review was necessary,"
"such as on the day when it went to press, did he mingle with the busy"
world.
"there was one new thing, essentially Stella, which he had not noticed"
before. Surely it had been put there since his last visit.
In her own bedroom had hung since her imprisonment a fine reproduction
"of Watt's “Hope,” and, child though she was, she had divined, in a"
"child's unformulative way, the simple yet poignant symbolism of the"
"blindfold figure seated on this orb of land and sea, with meek head"
"bowed over a broken lyre, and with ear strained to the vibration of"
"the one remaining string. She loved the picture, and with unconscious"
"intuition and without consultation with Wratislaw, who would have"
"been horrified at its domination of his Adam room, had ordained that a"
similar copy should be hung on the wall facing the pillow of her Great
High Belovedest's bed.
The application of the allegory to his present state of being was
startlingly obvious. Risca knitted a puzzled brow. The new thing was
"essentially Stella, yet why had she caused it to be put in his room this"
day of all disastrous days? Was it not rather his cousin Julia's doing?
But such delicate conveyance of sympathy was scarcely Julia's way.
A sudden dread stabbed him. Had Stella herself heard rumours of the
"tragedy? He summoned Herold, who had a prescriptive right to the"
adjoining room.
"“If any senseless fools have told her, I 'll murder them,” he cried."
“The creatures of the sunset told her--at least as much as it was good
"for her to know,” said Herold."
“Do you mean that she did it in pure ignorance?”
"“In the vulgar acceptance of the word, yes,” smiled Herold. “Do you"
think that the human brain is always aware of the working of the divine
"for about ten minutes, then suddenly dump it back into its cradle, stare"
"at it gloomily or utter a laugh, and go out.  Sometimes, he would come up"
"when Gyp was there, and after watching her a little in silence, almost"
drag her away.
"Suffering always from the guilty consciousness of having no love for him,"
"and ever more and more from her sense that, instead of saving him she"
"was, as it were, pushing him down-hill--ironical nemesis for vanity!--Gyp"
"was ever more and more compliant to his whims, trying to make up.  But"
"this compliance, when all the time she felt further and further away, was"
straining her to breaking-point.  Hers was a nature that goes on
passively enduring till something snaps; after that--no more.
"Those months of spring and summer were like a long spell of drought, when"
"moisture gathers far away, coming nearer, nearer, till, at last, the"
deluge bursts and sweeps the garden.

The tenth of July that year was as the first day of summer.  There had
"been much fine weather, but always easterly or northerly; now, after a"
"broken, rainy fortnight, the sun had come in full summer warmth with a"
"gentle breeze, drifting here and there scent of the opening lime blossom."
"In the garden, under the trees at the far end, Betty sewed at a garment,"
and the baby in her perambulator had her seventh morning sleep.  Gyp
stood before a bed of pansies and sweet peas.  How monkeyish the pansies'
"faces!  The sweet peas, too, were like tiny bright birds fastened to"
"green perches swaying with the wind.  And their little green tridents,"
"growing out from the queer, flat stems, resembled the antennae of"
MARGINS
A feature not to be overlooked in the appearance of a well-printed
book is that of the margins. The perfect type-page is supposed to be
proportioned in such a way that its diagonal is twice its width. With
"this page as a basis, the location of the type upon the paper leaf is"
"to be studied carefully. In general, the two pages, right and left,"
"should be considered as a unit, and the top margin and the inside"
"margin of each page should be approximately the same. Doing this, the"
total blank between the two pages is supposed approximately to equal
the outside and the bottom margins.
"The proportion of margin is, to a certain extent, dependent upon the"
"size of the book, the margins becoming greater as the volume increases"
from the thirty-two mo size up to the folio. A student of typography
"has ingeniously estimated that, taking the height of the paper leaf"
"as 100 units, the height of the type page of the ordinary trade book"
"should be from 72% to 75%; that of a library edition, from 66% to 71%;"
"that of a de luxe volume, from 60% to 65%."
MAKING THE INDEX
"EVERY book of a permanent nature, or intended as a work of reference,"
"requires an index. The length of the Index, or its minuteness, depends"
"upon the nature of the subject treated, and the importance of making it"
easily available to the reader. The Index belongs to the same family
"as the Table of Contents, and the Topical Analyses often placed at the"
"though I am not abroad. But perhaps I am abroad after all, far away from"
the soil where I have my roots.
"Why, indeed, do I stay here any longer, at a resort full of"
"schoolmistresses, with a host who has once more said farewell to sobriety?"
Nothing is happening to me; I do not grow here. The others go out and lie
"on their backs; I steal off and find relish in myself, and feel poetry"
"within me for the night. The world wants no, poetry; it wants only verses"
that have not been sung before.
"And Norway wants no red-hot irons; only village smiths forge irons now,"
for the needs of the mob and the honor of the country.
No one came; the stream of tourists went up and down Stordalen and left
our little Reisa valley deserted. If only the Northern Railway could have
come to Reisa with Cook's and Bennett's tours--then Stordalen in its turn
"would have lain deserted. Meanwhile, the cotters who are cultivating the"
soil will probably go on harvesting half the crop of the outlying fields
for the rest of time. There is every reason to think so--unless our
"descendants are more intelligent than we, and refuse to be smitten with"
the demoralizing effects of the tourist traffic.
"Now, my friend, you mustn't believe me; this is the point where you must"
"shake your head. There is a professor scuttling about the country, a born"
mediocrity with a little school knowledge about history; you had better
"ask him. He'll give you just as much mediocre information, my friend, as"
your vision can grasp and your brain endure.

Hardly had Manufacturer Brede left when Paul began to live a most
irregular life again. More and more all roads were closed to him; he saw
them--and with the informality of adversity the three captives began
to talk. Swiftly Brand got a little knowledge of Greca's position on
"Jupiter, and of the racial history that led up to it."
*       *       *       *       *
Four of the nine satellites of Jupiter were now the home of living
"beings. But two only, at the dawn of history as Greca knew it, had"
been originally inhabited. These were the fourth and the second.
"On the fourth there dwelt a race, ""like me,"" as Greca put it--a"
"kindly, gentle people content to live and let live."
"On the second had been a race of immensely tall, but attenuated and"
physically feeble things with great heads and huge dull eyes and
characters distinguished mainly for cold-blooded savagery.
The inhabitants of the fourth satellite had remained in ignorance of
"the monsters on the second till one day ""many, many ages ago,"" a fleet"
of clumsy ships appeared on the fourth satellite. From the ships had
"poured thousands of pipe-like creatures, armed with horrible rods of"
"metal that killed instantly and without a sound. The things, it"
"seemed, had crowded over the limits of their own globe, and had been"
forced to find more territory.
They had made captive the entire population of the satellite.
Then--for like all dangerous vermin they multiplied rapidly--they had
overflowed to the first and fifth satellites--the others were
uninhabitable--and finally to the dangerous surface of Jupiter itself.
"Everywhere they had gone, they had taken droves of Greca's people to"
"be their slaves, ""and the source of their food,"" added Greca, with a"
shudder; a statement that was at the moment unintelligible to the two
33.--(1) A prize court shall make a decree declaring the title of the
"officers and crew of His Majesty's ship to the prize bounty, and stating"
the amount thereof.
(2) The decree shall be subject to appeal as other decrees of the court.
Part V.--SPECIAL CASES OF JURISDICTION.
[Sidenote: Jurisdiction in case of capture in land expedition. [27 & 28
"Vict. c. 25, s. 34.]]"
"34. Where, in an expedition of any of His Majesty's naval or naval and"
military forces against a fortress or possession on land goods belonging
"to the state of the enemy, or to a public trading company of the enemy"
"exercising powers of government, are taken in the fortress or"
"possession, or a ship is taken in waters defended by or belonging to the"
"fortress or possession, a prize court shall have jurisdiction as to the"
"goods or ships so taken, and any goods taken on board the ship, as in"
case of prize.
[Sidenote: Jurisdiction in case of prize taken in expedition with ally.
"[27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s. 35.]]"
35. Where any ship or goods is or are taken by any of His Majesty's
naval or naval and military forces while acting in conjunction with any
"forces of any of His Majesty's allies, a prize court shall have"
"jurisdiction as to the same as in case of prize, and shall have power,"
"after condemnation, to apportion the due share of the proceeds to His"
"Majesty's ally, the proportionate amount and the disposition of which"
share shall be such as may from time to time be agreed between His
him and played square. For that reason he would be equally square and
"aboveboard, and let this dirty work alone."
"That was what he _had_ decided, but now----"
"He gritted his teeth, glared fiercely around, and came to an abrupt"
stop. Every instinct of the riverman was aroused. On his left the river
dropped over short falls into a narrow gorge. It was a spot where things
"were likely to happen at any time, and where a man or two should have"
"been stationed continually. Curly knew, in fact, that there had been men"
"here all morning. They had been called away for some purpose, leaving"
the little falls unguarded. And as he stood there his practiced eyes
told him that he was beholding the very start of a jam.
"A log, plunging over the falls, upended. Another was thrust under it. A"
"third and fourth, coming down together, caught on the obstruction, all"
being held by some stones rising midstream. Before the current could
tear them loose several more timbers were forced against the mass which
"was piling up so swiftly, bridging to the opposite shore."
"To carry out that angry resolve of a minute or two ago, Curly should"
"have rolled himself another cigarette, and watched the growing damage"
with a sardonic smile. He did nothing of the sort. For a flash he had
"forgotten his grievance, and was a “river hog,” pure and simple. The"
stoppage must be broken before it reached the proportions of a real jam.
"There was no one else to do it, and so he leaped to the task without a"
second’s pause for thought.
"Upstream he ran a few feet, his eyes fixed on the surface of the river"
"above the falls. Then he saw what he wanted. An instant later, using his"
"peavey much as a pole vaulter does his pole, he leaped straight out over"
"the water, landed squarely on a big log, and was carried down to the"
Then I reached my own hut of last winter where I had passed so many lonely
months. I did not enter it.
"Or rather, I did enter it, for I had to spend the night there. But I shall"
"skip this, so for the sake of brevity, I call it not entering. This"
"morning I wrote something playful about Madame, the mouse I left here last"
spring; but tonight I am taking it out again because I am no longer in the
"mood, and because there is no point in it. Perhaps it would have amused"
"you to read it, my friend; but there is no point in amusing you now. I"
must deject you now and make you listen to me; there is not much more to
hear.
"Am I moralizing? I am explaining. No, I am not moralizing; I am"
"explaining. If it is moralizing to see the truth and tell it to you, then"
I am moralizing. Can I help that? Intuitively I see into what is distant;
"you do not, for this is something you cannot learn from your little"
schoolbooks. Do not let this rouse your hatred for me. I shall be merry
"again with you later, when my strings are tuned to merriment. I have no"
power over them. Now they are tuned to a chorale....
*       *       *       *       *
"At dawn, in the bright moonlight, I leave the hut and push on quickly in"
order to reach the village as soon as possible. But I must have started
"too early or walked too fast, for at this rate I shall reach the village"
at high noon. What am I chasing after? Perhaps it is feeling the nearness
"of the sea that drives me forward. And as I stand on the last high ridge,"
"with the glitter and roar of the sea far beneath, a sweetness darts"
"through me like a greeting from another world. ""_Thalatta!_"" I cry;"
and I wipe my eyeglasses tremblingly. The roar from below is sleepless and
"fierce, a tone of jungle passion, a savage litany. I descend the ridge as"
though in a trance and reach the first house.
"""A lamentable display of manners, my dear.  I shall withdraw now and"
"compose a stiff note to him.  The amenities must be observed."""
"Looking as severe as a naturally jovial face would permit him, and"
"wondering a little if he had pronounced ""amenities"" right, he strode"
to the library.
The library was his Majesty's favourite apartment.  Here in the
"mornings he would discuss affairs of state with his Chancellor, or"
receive any distinguished visitors who were to come to his kingdom in
"search of adventure.  Here in the afternoon, with a copy of _What to"
"say to a Wizard_ or some such book taken at random from the shelves,"
he would give himself up to meditation.
And it was the distinguished visitors of the morning who gave him most
to think about in the afternoon.  There were at this moment no fewer
"than seven different Princes engaged upon seven different enterprises,"
"to whom, in the event of a successful conclusion, he had promised the"
hand of Hyacinth and half his kingdom.  No wonder he felt that she
needed the guiding hand of a mother.
The stiff note to Barodia was not destined to be written.  He was
"still hesitating between two different kinds of nib, when the door was"
flung open and the fateful name of the Countess Belvane was announced.
The Countess Belvane!  What can I say which will bring home to you
"that wonderful, terrible, fascinating woman? Mastered as she was by"
"overweening ambition, utterly unscrupulous in her methods of achieving"
"her purpose, none the less her adorable humanity betrayed itself in a"
passion for diary-keeping and a devotion to the simpler forms of
lyrical verse.  That she is the villain of the piece I know well; in
"no Dryasdust. He was a living human being, troubled as we are troubled,"
"and interested in the things which interest us. He spoke to us, not"
"from the skies, but from among a crowd of his fellow human beings, and"
we feel that he was one of ourselves. As such it is good that a
memorial of him should be placed where it may easily be seen.

CHAPTER I
EARLY LIFE
"It may be a truism, but it is none the less a fact, that it is not"
always he of whom the world hears most who influences most deeply the
thought of the age in which he lives. The name of James Frederick
Ferrier is little heard of beyond the comparatively small circle of
philosophic thinkers who reverence his memory and do their best to keep
it green: to others it is a name of little import--one among a
multitude at a time when Scotland had many sons rising up to call her
"blessed, and not perhaps one of the most notable of these. And yet,"
could we but estimate the value of work accomplished in the higher
sphere of thought as we estimate it in the other regions of practical
"work--an impossibility, of course--we might be disposed to modify our"
"views, and accord our praises in very different quarters from those in"
which they are usually bestowed.
James Ferrier wrote no popular books; he came before the public
comparatively little; he made no effort to reconcile religion with
_Cock._ That shall be done anon.
"_Gammer._ Nay, tarry, Hodge, till thou hast light, and then we'll"
seek each one.
_Ralph Roister Doister_ and _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ mark the end of the
Interlude stage and the commencement of Comedy proper. Leaving the
"latter at this point for the present, we shall return in the next"
chapter to study its fortunes at the hands of Lyly.

"Morality Plays, though theoretically quite as suitable for tragic effect"
"as for comic, since the former only required that Mankind should"
"sometimes fail to reach heaven, seem nevertheless to have developed"
"mainly the lighter side, setting the hero right at the finish and in the"
"meantime discovering, to the relief of otherwise bored spectators, that"
"wickedness, in some unexplained way, was funny. As long as propriety"
forbade that good should be overcome by evil it is hard to see how
"tragedy could appear. Had Humankind, in _The Castell of Perseverance_,"
"been fought for in vain by the Virtues, or had Everyman found no"
"companion to go with him and intercede for him, there had been tragedy"
indeed. But religious optimism was against any conclusion so
"discouraging to repentance. The lingering Miracles, it is true, still"
presented the sublimest of all tragedies in the Fall of Man and the
"apparent triumph of the Pharisees over Jesus. Between them, however, and"
"the kind of drama that succeeded the Moralities, too great a gulf was"
"fixed. Contemporaries of those original spirits, Heywood and Udall,"
could hardly revert for inspiration to the discredited performances of
villages and of a few provincial towns. Tragedy had to wait until there
was matured and made popular an Interlude from which the conflict of
"Virtues and Vices, with the orthodox triumph of the former, had been"
"odor, free from yeastiness and a fruity, agreeable, slightly spirituous"
"taste, without excessive sweetness or acidity. The Pharmacopoeia (1890)"
"directs that the wine should contain from 7 to 12 per cent, by weight,"
"of absolute alcohol. California Hock and Reisling, Ohio Catawba, Sherry,"
"Muscatel, Madeira or the stronger wines of the Rhine, Mediterranean and"
Hungary come within the pharmacopoeial limits. Wines containing more
"than 14 per cent of alcohol are usually fortified, i. e., have alcohol"
"or brandy added to them, and much imported Sherry and Madeira contain 15"
"to 20 per cent, by weight, of absolute alcohol."
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
VINUM RUBRUM--RED WINE
DERIVATION.--An alcoholic liquid made by fermenting the juice of fresh
"colored grapes, the fruit of Vitis vinifera, in presence of their"
skins.
"PROPERTIES.--A deep red liquid, having a pleasant odor, free from"
"yeastiness, and a fruity moderately astringent, pleasant and slightly"
"acidulous taste, without excessive sweetness or acidity. Should contain"
"not less than 7 nor more than 12 per cent, by weight, of alcohol. Native"
"Claret, Burgundy, Bordeaux and Hungarian wines may be included within"
the pharmacopoeial limits of vinum rubrum. Port (vinum portense) is
"fortified with brandy during fermentation, and contains 15 to 25 per"
"cent, by weight, of absolute alcohol. Port is astringent from tannic"
"acid in the grapes, skin and stalks, or the astringency may be due to"
"logwood. Red wines are said to be rough, contain tannic acid and"
therefore are astringents. Dry wines are those which contain little
sugar. The wines develop ethers with age and these improve their flavor
and action.
"""You're such a big baby to've been such a big soldier! Don't you know"
"that romance is always just over the hill, hand in hand with"
adventure--both lonely for someone to play with? Wars can't kill them!
"It's after wars, when a nation is wounded, that they become priceless!"""
"""By George, that's right,"" Dad cried. ""Come to think of it, that's"
exactly right! And Gates has the same crew of six--men you've always
"known! Even that rascal, Pete, cooks better 'n ever! The _Whim_, you"
"can't deny, is the smartest ninety-six foot schooner yacht that sails! I"
say again that if I had the chance I'd turn her free on whatever magic
"course the wings of the wind would take her! That I would--by George!"""
And there was a note of deep appeal in the Mater's voice as she asked:
"""Why not get that boy you wrote so much about--Tommy what's-his-name,"
"the Southerner? I like him!"""
"This plan, which I now saw had been so carefully prepared--fruit of the"
secret conference--was but one in the million or so of others throughout
"America nurtured and matured by the brave army of fathers, mothers,"
"wives, sisters, daughters, who stayed at home and gave their all,"
"waiting with alternate hopes and fears, looking with prayerful eyes to"
the day that would bring a certain one back into their arms. What
difference if some plans were elaborate and some as modest as a flower?
Who would dare distinguish between the cruise on a private yacht and the
cake endearingly made in a hot little kitchen for the husky lad just
returned from overseas? Each was its own best expression of pride and
"love. Each said in its tenderest way: ""Well done, my own!"""
A lump came into my throat.
"""It's rather decent of a fellow to have two such corking forbears,"" I"
Across the void from her world to my own she was signaling--trying to
tell me what?--and frantically my fancy sprang to translate the message.
"But as the man, with growing agitation, had been watching narrowly"
throughout this--a condition of which I felt sure she must be acutely
aware--I dared not make the slightest sign. Yet she seemed to understand
"and, joining him, they passed out."
I pounced upon that crumpled ball of paper and was back in my chair
unfolding it with nervous fingers. Feverishly pressing out the creases I
"saw that it was, indeed, a corner torn from the winecard, and written"
upon it--nothing. Absolutely nothing!
"Perhaps I should have laughed, but as a matter of fact I cursed. Deep in"
"my soul I cursed. Her little joke, her pretty bit of acting, had left a"
stinging sense of loss. As suddenly as this ruthless comet swept into my
orbit it had swung out and on; for one delicious moment we had touched
"across the infinite, but now my harmony was shattered, the strings of my"
"harp were snapped, curled up, and could not be made to play again."
"But the Spanish girl was playing her guitar, once more singing her"
"impassioned song of the enchanted island in its sea of love, which made"
me pity myself so much that I permitted the waiter again to fill my
glass. What a wondrous adventure this night might have brought!
Such thoughts wore not to be profaned by the companionship of Tommy and
"Monsieur, so I slipped away, hailed a cab and alighted at the Machina"
"wharf. The boatman there, whom I aroused to take me out, was one of the"
"most stupid fellows I've ever encountered. At any rate, someone was"
stupid.
Going aboard the yacht I stood for a moment listening to the lonely
"We rowed in the foam and feathery jets of spray. ""She's rising fast!"""
"cried Eilert, rowing with all his might."
I felt so wretched that Eilert told me to ship my oars; he would manage by
"himself. But for all my wretchedness, I remembered that they could see me"
"from the shore, and I would not put down my oars. Eilert's wife might see"
me and laugh at me.
"What a revolting business, this seasickness that forced me to put my head"
"over the gunwale and make a pig of myself! I had a moment's relief, and"
then it began all over again. Charming! I felt as though I were in labor;
"the wrong way up, of course, through my throat, but it was a delivery"
"nonetheless. It moved up, then stopped, came on again and stopped, came on"
"and stopped once more. It was a lump of iron--iron, did I say? No, steel;"
I had never felt anything like it before; it was not something I was born
with. All my internal mechanism was stopped by it. Then I took a running
"start far down inside me and began, strangely, to howl with all my"
"strength; but a howl, however successful, cannot break down a lump of"
"steel. The pains continued. My mouth filled with bile. Soon, thank heaven,"
my chest would burst. O--oh--oh.... Then we rowed inside the islands that
"served as a breakwater, and I was saved."
"Quite suddenly I was well again, and began to play the clown, imitating my"
"own behavior in order to deceive the people ashore. And I assured Eilert,"
"too, that this was the first time I had ever been seasick, so that he"
"should understand it was nothing to gossip about. After all, he had not"
heard about the great seas I had sailed without the slightest discomfort;
"once I had been four-and-twenty days on the ocean, with most of the"
"passengers in bed, and even the captain sick in cascades; but not me!"
"""Yes, I get seasick sometimes, too,"" says Eilert."
"prospect at a certain house half a mile up the road where, as they had"
"ridden rapidly by, a couple of pretty girls had looked out curiously at"
the tossing Carlist _boinas_.
Rollo and El Sarria were carrying their scanty provend to a house where
"a decent-looking woman had agreed to cook it for them, when their gloomy"
reveries were interrupted by a sudden apparition which burst upon them
as they stood on the crest of a deep hollow.
"The limestone hills had been rent asunder at the place, and from the"
bare faces of the rocks the neighbouring farmers and villagers had
quarried and carried away such of the overhanging blocks as could easily
be trimmed to suit their purposes.
"Part of what remained had been shaped into a _hornito_, or stone oven,"
"under which a fire had been kindled, and a strange figure moved about,"
stirring the glowing charcoal with a long bar of iron. On a smaller
"hearth nearer at hand a second fire blazed, and the smell of fragrant"
cookery rose to the expectant and envious nostrils of the four.
"It was Sergeant Cardono, who moved about whistling softly, now attending"
"to the steaming _olla_, now watching the rising bread in the _hornito_."
"Perceiving Rollo, he saluted gravely and remarked, ""Dinner will be"
"served in half an hour."" The others, as before, he simply ignored. But"
in deference to his new commander he stopped whistling and moved about
with his lean shoulders squared as if on parade.
"When the bread and the skinny chicken were placed in his hands, he"
glanced at them with somewhat of superciliousness.
"""The bread will serve for crumbs,"" he said, and immediately began to"
chill horror of the unknown. Something had happened--that they felt.
Lois crept to the doorway and peered out into the gathering daylight.
"Here and there, half hidden behind the shelter of the trees, she could"
"see the khaki-clad figures of the Gurkhas, some kneeling, some"
"standing, their rifles raised to their dark faces, waiting like"
"statues for the enemy that never came. A dead, petrified world, the"
"only living thing the sunshine, which played in peaceful indifference"
upon the scene of an old and a new tragedy! Lois thought of her
mother. By the power of an overwrought imagination she looked back
through a quarter of a century to a day of which this present was a
strange and horrible repetition. For a moment she lived her mother's
"life, lived through the hours of torturing doubt and fear, and when a"
stifled cry called her back to the reality and forced her to turn from
"the sunlight to the dark room, it was as though the dead had risen, as"
though her dreams had taken substance. She saw pale faces staring at
her; she saw on the rusty truckle-bed a figure which rose up and held
"out frantic, desperate arms toward her. But it was no dream--no"
"phantom. Mrs. Cary, wild-eyed and distraught, struggled to rise to her"
feet and come toward her.
"""Where is Beatrice?"" she cried hysterically. ""Where is Beatrice? I"
"dreamed she was dead!--It isn't true! Say it isn't true!"""
Lois hurried back. In the confusion of their retreat she had lost
"sight of Beatrice, and now a cold fear froze her blood. She called her"
"name, adding her voice to the half-delirious mother's appeal; but"
"there was no answer, and as she prepared to leave the shelter of the"
"bungalow to go in search of the lost girl, a pair of strong hands"
grasped her by the shoulders and forced her back.
"""Lois, stand back! They are coming!"""
"nonchalantly. ""And--we're in lots of time."""
"Mr. Jobling looked cross. ""Five minutes more would have lost you the"
"train,"" he remarked somewhat sourly. ""And where would Captain Dove and I"
"have been then!"""
"As it was, however, they found Captain Dove in his berth, sound asleep,"
"although still fully dressed. And, as Slyne ushered Sallie into the"
"double compartment reserved for her and Ambrizette, ""Don't go to bed"
"just yet,"" he begged. ""I want to show you something by and by. You'll"
"have lots of time for a long sleep before we arrive."""
"""All right, Jasper,"" she agreed. ""I'll wait up till you come for me."""
"When he at length knocked at her door again, Mr. Jobling was still with"
her. She came out between them into the narrow corridor. Slyne rubbed
clear one steamy window to let her see the wintry landscape through
which they were travelling at express speed. And Sallie looked out
"delighted, at the sleeping English countryside as its broad grass-lands"
"and bare brown acres, coverts and coppices, hedgerows and lanes, with"
"here and there a grange or a group of cottages, all still and silent,"
"flashed into sight and so disappeared; until, overlooking them all from"
"a knoll on the near bank of a broad, winding river, there loomed up a"
"most magnificent mansion, embedded, in lordly seclusion, among many"
"gnarled and age-old oaks, with gardens terrace on terrace about it, tall"
"fountains among their empty flower-beds, a moss-grown sun-dial at the"
"edge of a quiet, silver lake."
"The moon was shining full on its innumerable windows, so that it seemed"
"to be lighted up from within, although, in reality, all were shuttered"
"and dark. Aloof and very stately it stood on that windless night, an"
"empty palace which came and went in a few moments, wing after wing, with"
three lobes into which its shell is divided longitudinally. There
"are also three cross divisions,--the head shield, the tail shield,"
"and between the two the thorax, consisting of a number of distinct"
and unconsolidated segments. The head shield carries a pair of
"large, crescentic, compound eyes, like those of the insect. The"
"eye varies greatly in the number of its lenses, ranging from"
fourteen in some species to fifteen thousand in others. Figure
"268, C, is a restoration of the trilobite, and shows the"
"appendages, which are found preserved only in the rarest cases."
During the long ages of the Cambrian the trilobite varied greatly.
"Again and again new species and genera appeared, while the older"
types became extinct. For this reason and because of their
"abundance, trilobites are used in the classification of the"
Cambrian system. The Lower Cambrian is characterized by the
presence of a trilobitic fauna in which the genus Olenellus is
"predominant. This, the OLENELLUS ZONE, is one of the most"
"important platforms in the entire geological series; for, the"
"world over, it marks the beginning of Paleozoic time, while all"
underlying strata are classified as pre-Cambrian. The Middle
"Cambrian is marked by the genus Paradoxides, and the Upper"
Cambrian by the genus Olenus. Some of the Cambrian trilobites were
"giants, measuring as much as two feet long, while others were the"
"smallest of their kind, a fraction of an inch in length."
Another type of crustacean which lived in the Cambrian and whose
order is still living is illustrated in Figure 269.

conceived under the shadow of the sword!
"Hourly, after the coded signals came in, Ted Wilson took the microphone"
himself and called out into space in the infrawave. He called messages
"of hope, and explained how many spacecraft were scouring the deep black"
"void. He could only pray that he would be heard, that his voice would"
give Alice some firm foundation for hope.
He could not be sure the passengers from the wrecked spaceship even had
"their receivers turned on, because infrawave receivers drink up a lot"
of power and lifeships are not equipped with any vast reserve. There
just was not the room in a lifeship for anything more than the bare
necessities of living.
"The search grid was a truncated cone, and the whitened areas of"
finished search had finally filled the smaller end of the cone. There
"was the flared skirt of the cone yet to be combed, and this provided"
more volume than the cylinder taken out of the middle. It also provided
"a shorter search path as the searching spacecraft built out the volume,"
ring after ring around the first pass along the line of flight.
"Far, far to one side a detector registered, and brought every man"
in the fleet to the alert. Then they relaxed unhappily again as the
scooter returned with another report of a small gas cloud. Wilson
"thought glumly that they had discovered enough space meteors, gas"
"clouds, and unawakened comets to make up a small sun."
Then his attention was taken from his own personal troubles by the
"there was no hæmoptysis, but for the succeeding nine days small"
brightish red clots were expectorated. There was some
tenderness over the ribs from the fifth to the ninth in the
"axillary line, and on the ninth day some gravitation ecchymosis"
appeared over the same region. Cough was an early troublesome
"symptom in this case, and when admitted to the Base hospital,"
"about the seventh day, there was evidence of fluid extending"
about a third of the way up the back.
On the tenth day after admission a pleural rub was detected at
"the upper margin of the dulness, and the latter shortly"
extended upwards over a little more than half the back.
"Meanwhile, there was no further hæmoptysis, respiration was"
"fairly easy, 24 per minute, but accompanied by slight"
"dilatation of the alæ nasi, and the temperature, which had been"
"ranging from 99° to 100°, began to rise steadily, on the"
fifteenth day reaching 102.5°. The patient refused even an
"exploratory puncture, and was treated on the expectant plan."
"The temperature slowly subsided, with a steady improvement in"
"the physical signs, and at the end of about ten weeks he left"
for home with only slight dulness and incapacity for active
exertion remaining. (Now again on active service.)

blood. Case No. 156]
(156) _Severe hæmothorax. Recurrent secondary effusion. Tapping

"Paardeberg, and arrived at the Base on the eighteenth day."

"struck down that epilept Emperor and a few of his ministers, had"
time been given for the New German Woman to assert herself in
"politics, there would have been no invasion of Belgium, no"
maltreatment of Servia. Germany would have ranged herself with the
Western powers and Western culture.
Minna von Stachelberg read her cousin's note and received the worn
"and anxious-looking Vivie like a sister ... like a comrade, she"
"said, in the War for the Vote ... ""which we will resume, my dear, as"
"soon as this dreadful Man's war is over, only we won't fight with"
"the same weapons."""
"But though kind, she was not gushing and she soon told Vivie that in"
nursing she was a novice and had much to learn. She introduced her
"to the German and Belgian surgeons, and then put her to a series of"
entirely menial tasks from which she was to work her way up by
"degrees. But if any English soldier were there and wanted sympathy,"
she should be called in to his ward ... From that interview Vivie
returned almost happy.
In the hot summer months she would sometimes be allowed to accompany
"Red Cross surgeons and nurses to the station, when convoys of"
"wounded were expected, if there was likelihood that British soldiers"
would be amongst them. These would cheer up at the sound of her
pleasant voice speaking their tongue. Yet she would witness on such
occasions incongruous incidents of German brutality. Once there came
"out of the train an English and a French soldier, great friends"
evidently. They were only slightly wounded and the English soldier
stretched his limbs cautiously to relieve himself of cramp. At that
The wind blustered outside. The cold draught whistled through the room.
"Joyce rose to his feet with a shiver, went to a corner for a couple of"
"sacks, which he threw over the sleeping man, and, after having wistfully"
"read Yvonne’s letter once more, ascended the ladder to the loft, where"
the shapeless mattress of dried grass and sacking awaited him.
CHAPTER XII--HISTOIRE DE REVENANT
Ostend is a magnificent white Kursaal on the Belgian coast. Certain
requisites are attached to it in the way of great hotels and villas
"along a tiled _digue_, and innumerable bathing-machines on the sands"
"below. There is an old town, it is true, somewhere behind it, with"
"quaint narrow streets, a Place d’Armes dotted round with cafés, and"
a thronged market-square; there is also a bustling port and a fishing
population. But the Ostend of practical life begins and ends at the
"Kursaal. Were it to perish during a night, the following day would see"
the exodus of twenty thousand visitors. The vast glass rotunda can hold
thousands. Within its precincts you can do anything in reason and out of
"reason. You can knit all day long like Penelope, or you can go among"
the Sirens with or without the precautions of Ulysses. You can consume
anything from a biscuit to a ten-course dinner. You can play dominoes at
centime points or roulette with a forty-franc minimum. You can listen to
"music, you can dance, you can go to sleep. You can write letters, send"
"telegrams, and open a savings-bank account. By moving to one side or the"
other of a glass screen you can sit in the warm sunshine or in the keen
sea wind. You can study the fashions of Europe from St. Petersburg to
"Dublin, and if you are a woman, you can wear the most sumptuous garments"
"Providence has deigned to bestow on you. And lastly, if you are looking"
"distinguished for a particular line of study, should be given the"
preference. I think the prospects of the Indian Educational Service are
sufficiently high to attract the very best material. In colonial
Universities they manage to get very distinguished men without any
extravagantly high pay. Possibly the present departmental method of
election does not admit of sufficiently wide publicity of notice to
attract the best candidates.
"83, 628 (II) _System of training and probation._--As regards probation"
"and training, Educational officers should first win a reputation as good"
teachers before the appointment is confirmed as they are transferred to
important colleges.
"83, 629 (IV) _Conditions of Salary._--As regards conditions of Salary,"
"the pay should be moderately high, but not extravagant, and settled once"
for all under some simple and well-defined rules. It is not only very
humiliating but degrading to a true scholar to be scrambling for money.
The difference between the pay of the higher and lower services should
be minimised.
"83, 630 (VI) _Conditions of pension._--With reference to pension, I"
"think it is very unfair that more favourable terms are offered, when the"
pensioner elects to retire in England.
"83, 631 (VII) _Such limitations as exist in the employment of"
non-Europeans._--Passing on to the question of limitations that exist in
"the employment of Indians in the higher service, I should like to give"
expression to an injustice which is very keenly felt. It is unfortunate
that Indian graduates of European Universities who have distinguished
themselves in a remarkable manner do not for one reason or other find
facilities for entering the higher Educational Service.
"passed in front and back of the body over a string tied around the hips,"
the forward extremity being left longer and flowing like an apron. On
feast days the string is replaced by a broad band of white beads. Around
the neck and chest they wear thick cords of the same beads and on their
wrists broad silver cuffs. Hats are not used; the hair is usually tied
with a red ribbon and often adorned with the bright flowers of the
forest.
"“The female outfit is not less simple, consisting of a piece of calico"
"less than three feet wide and about nine feet long, wrapped around the"
lower part of the body and reaching a little below the knees. This is
"all, except that the neck is more or less loaded with beads or silver"
"coins. But for this the women display less coquetry than the men, which"
may be because they feel sufficiently adorned with their mere natural
"charms. Fondness for cheap rings is, however, common to both sexes, and"
little children often wear earrings or pendants.

INDIAN GIRL OF THE DARIEN]
“The scantiness of the clothing is remedied very effectually by face and
"body painting, in which black and red colors are used, the first"
exclusively for daily wear. At times men and women are painted black
from the waist down; at other times it is the whole body or only the
"hands and feet, etc., all according to the day’s fashion, as was"
explained by one of our guides. For feast days the paintings are an
"elaborate and artistic affair, consisting of elegantly drawn lines and"
patterns--red and black or simply black--which clothe the body as
effectually as any costly dress.
"brown. Meanwhile, the abdomen was somewhat painful. When seen"
on the third day he had ceased to vomit for three hours. The
"face was slightly anxious, and the patient lay on the ground"
"with the lower extremities extended. Temperature 99°, pulse 72,"
"fair strength. Respirations 32, shallow. Tongue moist, lightly"
"furred, bowels not open for four days. He slept fairly last"
"night. Abdomen soft, moving well with respiration, no"
"distension, slight tenderness below and to the right of the"
"umbilicus, and local dulness in right flank."
"The next day the pulse fell to 60 and the bowels acted, but"
there was no change in the local condition. The man looked
"somewhat ill until the end of a week, but was then sent to the"
"Base, and at the expiration of a month was sent home well."
(177*) Wounded at Modder River. Two apertures of _entry_
(Mauser); (_a_) below cartilage of eighth rib in left nipple
line; (_b_) 2 inches below and 4-1/2 inches to the left of the
"median line. No exit wound discovered, and no track could be"
"palpated between the two openings, which were both circular and"
depressed. When seen on fourth day there was tenderness in the
"lower half of the abdomen, and the left thigh was held in a"
"flexed position. Respirations 20, respiratory movement confined"
"to upper half of abdominal wall. Pulse 70, temperature 99°."
"Tongue moist, covered with white fur; bowels confined since the"
accident; no sickness. The patient remained under observation
"thirteen days, during which time pain and difficulty in"
"movement of the left thigh persisted, also slight tenderness in"
the lower part of the abdomen; but at the end of a month he was
"sent to England well, but unfit to take further part in the"
"campaign. I thought the bullet might be in the left psoas, but"
it was not localised.
"to form a much better ""idea of the greatness of the religion of their"
"fathers""? Does it not seem strange that so many hundreds of these"
relics should be kept in those enlightened and happy countries like
"Italy, where ""the achievements of Catholic life"" are so well known,"
"and where Mother Church has for centuries had full sway, and that none"
"of them should be brought to these benighted Protestant regions, where"
they could effect such a salutary change in the faith of the people?
"But, seriously, as I added to my friend in the conversation referred"
"to, I have a better opinion of the intelligence of our good Roman"
Catholic people in America than to believe that they put the slightest
credence in these childish superstitions. Whatever the bishop above
"quoted may believe, I am confident that the intelligent Roman Catholic"
people of our country have no more faith in many of these alleged
relics than we have.

"[8] In July of this year, 1903, while the Roman Catholic world was"
"greatly exercised over the grave illness of the late Pope, Leo XIII.,"
the Associated Press dispatches from Naples reported that the blood of
St. Januarius had miraculously liquefied at that unusual time in token
that the prayers offered for the Pope's recovery had been answered.
The Archbishop of Naples has up to the present time vouchsafed
"no explanation of the fact that the Pope died a few days later,"
notwithstanding this miraculous assurance that he would recover.
"drift into Self and Wrong, than to strike out brave arms, and swim,"
"despite all difficulty, toward God and Right, yet if we once take the"
"latter course, we shall find it the most natural and the least"
fatiguing. And with every separate stroke of high endeavor we carry
"others with us,--we raise our race,--we bear it onward,--upward! And"
"the true reward, or best result of fame, is, that having succeeded in"
"winning brief attention from the multitude, a man may be able to"
pronounce one of God's lightning messages of inspired Truth plainly to
"them, while they are yet willing to stand and listen. This momentary"
"hearing from the people is, as I take it, the sole reward any writer"
"can dare to hope for,--and when he obtains it, he should remember that"
"his audience remains with him but a very short while,--so that it is"
"his duty to see that he employ his chance WELL, not to win applause for"
"himself, but to cheer and lift others to noble thought, and still more"
"noble fulfilment."""
Villiers regarded him wistfully.
"""Alwyn, my dear fellow, do you want to be the Sisyphus of this"
"era?--You will find the stone of Evil heavy to roll upward,--moreover,"
it will exhibit the usually painful tendency to slip back and crush
"you!"""
"""How can it crush me?"" asked his friend with a serene smile. ""My heart"
"cannot be broken, or my spirit dismayed, and as for my body, it can but"
"die,--and death comes to every man! I would rather try to roll up the"
"stone, however fruitless the task, than sit idly looking at it, and"
"doing nothing!"""
"""Your heart cannot be broken? Ah! how do you know"" ... and Villiers"
"shook his head dubiously--""What man can be certain of his own destiny?"""
"""Bring hither coffee and a dish of eggs for two. The wind and rain yet"
howl around the house.  This gentleman will sup with me ere we go home.
"Go and serve us quickly, for we have both a good stomach, and would eat"
"ere we depart hence."""
"The tapster vanished quickly to do the bidding of the guests, and Grey"
"turned a wondering glance upon the Old Lion, whose face, framed in its"
"shaggy gray hair, looked more leonine than ever, the bright eyes shining"
"out of deep caverns from under bushy brows, the rugged features full of"
"power, not unmixed with a curious underlying ferocity.  But the glance"
bent upon Grey was kindly enough.
"""Sit down, young man; I would know more of you.  I have a gift for"
reading faces.  I have marked yours ever since you entered this room.
"Tell me your name.  Tell me of yourself, for you were not born to the"
"state to which you have now fallen."""
"""My name is Grey,"" was the ready answer.  Grey had dropped his title and"
"patronymic with his fallen fortunes, and used his mother’s name alone."
"""My father was a country gentleman.  I was gently reared, and was at one"
"time a scholar at Oxford, where I dreamed many dreams.  Afterwards I"
"travelled abroad, returning to find my father dead and my home in the"
hands of a kinsman to whom it was mortgaged by my father.  The small
fortune I received I squandered foolishly in a few weeks of gay living
with young bloods of the town.  I wakened from my dream to find myself
"well-nigh penniless, disgusted alike with myself and those I had called"
my friends. I have ever been something ambitious.  I misdoubt me I am a
fool; but I did think that I might win laurels upon the field of
"literature.  I have never lost the trick of rhyming, and jotting down"
"such things as pleased my fancy, whether in prose or in verse. Do I"
"weary you with my tale?"""
"""Ah!"" cried the girl, laying her hand again on his cuff, ""that is"
because they do not wish you to share their plunder. But tell them that
you care nothing for that and they will welcome you readily enough. The
"place is plague-stricken, I tell you. The palace lies open. Little"
crook-backed Chepe brought me word. He says he adores me. He is of the
"village of Frias, back there behind the hills. I do not love him, even"
"though he has a bitter heart and can hate well. Therefore I suffer him."""
The Sergeant rose to his feet and looked compassionately down at the
"vivid little figure before him. The hair, dense and black, the blue"
"eyes, the red-knotted handkerchief, the white teeth that showed between"
the parted lips clean and sharp as those of a wild animal. Cardono had
"seen many things on his travels, but never anything like this. His soul"
"was moved within him. In the deeps of his heart, the heart of a Spanish"
"gipsy, there was an infinite sympathy for any one who takes up the blood"
"feud, who, in the face of all difficulties, swears the _vendetta_. But"
"the slim arms, the spare willowy body, the little white sandalled feet"
of the little girl--these overcame him with a pitifully amused sense of
the disproportion of means to end.
"""Have you no brother, Señorita?"" he said, using by instinct the title of"
respect which the little girl loved the most. She saw his point in a
moment.
"""A brother--yes, Don José! But my brother is a cur, a dog that eats"
offal. Pah! I spit upon him. He hath taken favours from the woman. He
hath handled her money. He would clean the shoes they twain leave at
their chamber door. A brother--yes; the back of my hand to such
brothers! But after to-night he shall have no offal to eat--no bones
thrown under the table to pick. For in one slaying I will kill the
"Italian woman Cristina, the man Muñoz who broke my mother's heart, and"
the foisted changeling brat whom they miscall the daughter of Fernando
re-captors to proceed to adjudication till her return to a port of His
Majesty's dominions.
"(2) The master or owner, or his agent, may, with the consent of the"
"re-captors, unload and dispose of the goods on board the ship before"
adjudication.
"(3) If the ship does not, within six months, return to a port of His"
"Majesty's dominions, the re-captors may nevertheless institute"
"proceedings against the ship or goods in the High Court, or in any prize"
"court in a British possession, and the court may thereupon award prize"
"salvage as aforesaid to the re-captors, and may enforce payment thereof,"
"either by warrant of arrest against the ship or goods, or in the same"
manner as a judgment of the court in which the proceedings are
instituted may be enforced.
_Prize Bounty._
[Sidenote: Prize bounty to officers and crew present in case of capture
"or destruction of enemy's ship. [27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s. 42.]]"
"32. If, in relation to any war, His Majesty is pleased to declare, by"
"proclamation or Order in Council, his intention to grant prize bounty to"
"the officers and crews of his ships of war, then such of the officers"
and crew of any of His Majesty's ships of war as are actually present at
the taking or destroying of any armed ship of any of His Majesty's
enemies shall be entitled to have distributed among them as prize bounty
a sum calculated at such rates and in such manner as may be specified in
the proclamation or Order in Council.
[Sidenote: Ascertainment of amount of prize bounty. [27 & 28 Vict. c.
"25, s. 43.]]"
for ever. But I _wouldn't_ think about it. I _would_ enjoy the present.
But the calm waters of happiness had been ruffled and it was beyond my
"power to restore their tranquillity. I began to think of many things, of"
"the war itself, of the possible offensive, and soon the fretful"
"rebellious discontent, that obsessed all those of us who had not lost"
"their souls, began to reassert itself."
But why not desert? Why not escape to the south of France? Why not enjoy
"a week, a fortnight, a month of freedom? I would be caught in the end--I"
"would be punished. I would receive Number 1 Field Punishment, and I"
"would be tied to a wheel or post, but nevertheless it would be worth"
it! I imagined myself slipping out of camp at night and walking until
"dawn. Then I would sleep in some wood or copse and then walk on again,"
calling at remote farms to buy bread and eggs and milk. I would reach
"the little village, the main street winding between white houses and"
flooded with brilliant moonlight. I would climb the wall and drop into
the familiar garden and await the morning. Then I would knock at the
"door and I would be welcomed by an old peasant woman, and she would ask:"
"""Tu viens en perme?"" How could I answer that question? It worried me, I"
felt it was spoiling my dream. But I dreamt on and at the same time
battled against increasing depression. Even a few days of freedom would
"be a break, a change from routine. And would the little village be the"
"same as when I saw it last? No, it would be different, it would be at"
"war. I might escape from the army, but I could never escape from the"
war. My dream had vanished.
But I _would_ make the best of things. I _would_ enjoy the immediate
present--was I not losing hours of sheer pleasure by harbouring these
thoughts and ignoring the beauty of the day?
Some distance ahead was a farm of the usual Flemish type--a thatched
"roof, whitewashed walls, and green shutters. Near by was a little pond"
And so I first saw the great Gustavus Adolphus. It was said that he
"would at times fall into fits of Berserk rage, and that in the field"
"he was another man, keen as his sword, swift as fire, pitiless to"
"those who flinched, among the foremost in the charge, a very"
thunderbolt of war. But as I saw him taking papers from women's hands
"at the end of the Burg Strasse, he had rather the air of a quiet,"
"worthy prince--of Coburg or Darmstadt, it might be,--no dresser and no"
"brawler; nor would any one, to see him then, have thought that this"
was the lion of the north who had dashed the pride of Pappenheim and
flung aside the firebrands of the south. Or that even now he had on
his shoulders the burden of two great nations and the fate of a
million of men.
CHAPTER XXVI.
THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.
After this it fared with us as it fares at last with the driftwood
that chance or the woodman's axe has given to a forest stream in
Heritzburg. After rippling over the shallows and shooting giddily down
"slopes--or perchance lying cooped for days in some dark bend, until"
the splash of the otter or the spring freshet has sent it dancing on
in sunshine and shadow--it reaches at last the Werra. It floats out on
"the bosom of the great stream, and no longer tossed and chafed by each"
"tiny pebble, feels the force of wind and stream--the great forces of"
"the world. The banks recede from sight, and one of a million atoms, it"
"is borne on gently and irresistibly, whither it does not know. So it"
was with us. From the day we fell in with Count Leuchtenstein and set
"this gift, he replied: “I wept with the man, so I feel I ought to _do_"
something for him.”
CHAPTER V.
ELEMENTS TO SEEK IN CHOICE OF MATERIAL.
IN “The Choice of Books” Frederic Harrison has said: “The most useful
"help to reading is to know what we shall _not_ read, ... what we"
shall keep from that small cleared spot in the overgrown jungle of
information which we can call our ordered patch of fruit-bearing
knowledge.”[24]
"Now, the same statement applies to our stories, and, having busied"
"myself, during the last chapter, with “clearing my small spot” by"
"cutting away a mass of unfruitful growth, I am now going to suggest"
what would be the best kind of seed to sow in the patch which I have
“reclaimed from the Jungle.”
"Again I repeat that I have no wish to be dogmatic, and that in offering"
"suggestions as to the stories to be told, I am only catering for a"
group of normal school-children. My list of subjects does not pretend
"to cover the whole ground of children's needs, and just as I exclude"
the abnormal or unusual child from the scope of my warning in subjects
"to avoid, so do I also exclude that child from the limitation in choice"
"of subjects to be sought, because you can offer almost any subject to"
"the unusual child, especially if you stand in close relation to him and"
"know his powers of apprehension. In this matter, _age_ has very little"
"stooping, as I fancied, and more than once standing to listen, as if"
"he were not satisfied. I sank down still lower, and he passed me"
"without notice, and went on, and I heard his footsteps slowly"
retreating until they quite died away.
"But in a moment, before I had risen to my full height, I heard them"
"again. He came back, and passed me, breathing quickly and loudly. I"
wondered if he had detected our party and was going to give the alarm;
"and I stood up, anxious and uncertain, at a loss whether I should"
follow him or run back.
"At that instant a fierce yell broke the silence, and rent the darkness"
"as a flash of lightning might rend it. It came from behind me, from"
the brow of the hill; and I started as if I had been struck. Hard on
"it a volley of shouts and screams flared up in the same direction, and"
"while my heart stood still with terror and fear of what had happened,"
"I heard the thunder of hoofs come down the road, with a clatter of"
blows and whips. They were coming headlong--my lady and the rest. The
"danger was behind them, then. I had just time to turn and get to the"
side of the road before they were on me at a gallop.
"I could not see who was who in the darkness, but I caught at the"
"nearest stirrup, and, narrowly escaping being ridden down, ran on"
"beside the rider. The horses, spurred down the slope, had gained such"
an impetus that it was all I could do to keep up. I had no breath to
"ask questions, nor state my fear that there was danger ahead also. I"
had to stride like a giant to keep my legs and run.
Some one else was less lucky. We had not swept fifty yards from where
"I joined them, when a dark figure showed for a moment in the road"
before us. I saw it; it seemed to hang and hesitate. The next instant
"it was among us. I heard a shrill scream, a heavy fall, and we were"
"""Yes, Dicon, and perchance it had been better had the luck been worse."
"I love not such gains as these. Besides, there is somewhat in this"
"beyond my ken. Lord Sandford desired my friendship and company then, and"
"luck was with me.  Now that he desires it no more, the luck has changed,"
and that so strangely and desperately that one might almost say there
"was magic in it."""
"Dick’s jaw dropped; he longed to know more, but feared to intrude too"
"much upon his master’s secrets. Grey, however, knew how faithful and"
"attached was his stanch henchman, and as he went through his morning"
"toilet he told him a little of the events of the past three days, in as"
far as he himself could remember them.
"""I have offended Lord Sandford doubly,"" he said, ""though he will not"
openly admit it.  But I know—I feel the change.  I trow that he is my
"enemy. Nay, Dicon, look not so aghast; it will matter little in the"
"future, since to-day I take my leave of him, and most like in this great"
"whirling world our paths will not again cross, either for weal or woe."""
"""But how?—what?  He did seem to love you well."""
"""I think he did; but a mischance befell.  He did not tell me of his"
"troth-plight to a fair lady—a lady of surpassing beauty, and of a virtue"
and purity which make her like a bright particular star amid the painted
dames and mincing damsels of this giddy London town. Twice or thrice did
I meet her and pay homage to her wondrous beauty and goodness.  It was
"words she spoke to me that decided me, ere ever any ill-blood had been"
"aroused, to leave off from this life of pleasure-seeking and"
"distraction, and seek a nobler career than that of the butterfly dandy"
fluttering round the town.  But Lord Sandford thought that there was
somewhat more than this betwixt us.  Of that I am assured.  A flame of
grate the baton-like loaf with a farrier's hoof-rasp which he used in
"his culinary operations. ""But this,"" he added, as he turned over the"
"bird, ""is well stricken in years, and had better be given to the"
recruits. They have young teeth and have had practice upon dead
"artillery mules!"""
"So saying, he went casually to the edge of the little quarry, whistled a"
"peculiar note and tossed the bird downward to some person unseen, who"
appeared from nowhere in particular for the purpose of receiving it.
When the dinner was ready Sergeant Cardono announced it to Rollo as if
he had been serving a prince. And what was the young man's astonishment
"to find a table, covered with a decent white cloth, under the shelter of"
"a limestone rock, spread for three, and complete even to table napkins,"
which the sergeant had tied into various curious shapes.
"As they filed down the slope the sergeant stood at attention, but when"
El Sarria passed he quickly beckoned him aside with a private gesture.
"""You and I will eat after the foreigners,"" he explained."
"El Sarria drew himself up somewhat proudly, but Sergeant Cardono"
whispered in his ear two or three words which appeared to astonish him
"so much that he did as he was bid, and stood aside while John Mortimer"
and Etienne de Saint Pierre seated themselves.
"But Rollo, who had no great love for eating, and considered one man just"
"as much entitled to respect as another, would not sit down till El"
Sarria was accommodated also.
"""May it please your Excellency, Don Ramon and I have much to say to each"
"other,"" quoth the Sergeant, with great respect, ""besides your honour is"
the woman's son's soul is not in the animal. The woman is not entitled
to the deer because she cannot prove that it is. The deer will therefore
remain with the court until some properly authenticated claim is put
in.'
"So the two parties were turned out, the woman in bitter tears, and the"
"hunters angry and vexed, and the deer remained the property of the"
judge.
But this decision was against all Burmese ideas of justice. He should
"have given the deer to the woman. 'He wanted it for himself,' said a"
"Burman, speaking to me of the affair. 'He probably killed it and ate it."
Surely it is true that officials are of all the five evils the
"greatest.' Then my friend remembered that I was myself an official, and"
"he looked foolish, and began to make complimentary remarks about English"
"officials, that they would never give such an iniquitous decision. I"
turned it off by saying that no doubt the judge was now suffering in
"some other life for the evil wrought in the last, and the Burman said"
that probably he was now inhabiting a tiger.
"It is very easy to laugh at such beliefs; nothing is, indeed, easier"
than to be witty at the expense of any belief. It is also very easy to
"say that it is all self-deception, that the children merely imagine that"
"they remember their former lives, or are citing conversation of their"
elders.
"How this may be I do not know. What is the explanation of this, perhaps"
the only belief of which we have any knowledge which is at once a living
"belief to-day and was so as far back as we can get, I do not pretend to"
"say. For transmigration is no theory of Buddhism at all, but was a"
"leading tenet in the far older faith of Brahmanism, of which Buddhism"
"was but an offshoot, as was Christianity of Judaism."
"Having arrived in the vicinity of the post, he prowled out on foot with"
"his only friend. It was early, for he must do his deed while yet the"
"lights were lit. Any one moving about after ""taps"" would surely be"
investigated by the guard. The country was not yet tranquil enough to
"permit of laxity in the matter of sentry duty, and the soldiers counted"
"""ten"" very fast after they challenged. He had laid aside his big hat,"
"and was wrapped in his blanket. Many Indians were about, and he was less"
"apt to be spoken to or noticed. He moved forward to the scout fire,"
"which was outside of the guard-line, and stood for a time in some"
"brushwood, beyond the play of the flames. He was closely enveloped in"
"his blanket, and although Indians passed quite near him, he was not"
"noticed. Suddenly he heard a detail of wagons clanking up the road, and"
conjectured rightly that they would go into the post. He ran silently
"toward them, and stooping low, saw against the skyline that the cavalry"
"guard had worked up in front, impatient to shave the time when they"
should reach their quarters.
"It was a wood train, and it clanked and ground and jingled to the"
"quartermaster's corral, bearing one log on the last wagon which was John"
Ermine and his fortunes. This log slid to the ground and walked swiftly
away.
*       *       *       *       *
"The time for ""taps"" was drawing near, and the post buzzed in the usual"
expectation of that approaching time of quiet. A rifle-shot rang loud
"and clear up on the officers' row; it was near Major Searles's house,"
"every one said as they ran. Women screamed, and Tongue River cantonment"
laid its legs to the ground as it gathered to the place. Officers came
"with revolvers, and the guard with lanterns. Mrs. Searles and her"
"daughter were clasped in each other's arms, while Mary, the cook, put"
her apron over her head. Searles ran out with his gun; the shot had been
"old enemy of his, and the sight of the fellow’s humiliation had inclined"
the riverman even more strongly toward the man who had brought it about.
"But that was over now, he told himself furiously as he stamped along the"
"stream, hands clenched and face set in a black scowl. He hated"
Bainbridge! The man had no right to jump on him that way. How did he
know what had been the cause of Kollock’s behavior? He had asked no
"questions, given Curly no chance to explain even had the latter been"
inclined to lower himself to that extent. He had taken it for granted
that the river jack was loafing in spite of the fact that record as a
worker was equal to that of the best.
This was where the sting lay. Kollock was aggrieved and disgruntled
"because of what was, to him, a very good reason. There had been a"
definite object in his pause by that stone. The night before he had
"received a brief note from Bill, in which he was urged to “make use of"
any chance you git to do--you know what.”
Curly did know “what” very well. It meant that he was to thwart and
delay the progress of the drive by any means in his power. _Any_ means!
"The simplest, of course, was to cause some to happen to Bainbridge"
himself. Bill had not hesitated to suggest several ways by which this
happy end could be reached. None of them appealed particularly to Curly.
"He was not overscrupulous, but he disliked doing up a man in cold blood"
"without giving him even a ghost of a show. Still, Bill had done him good"
"turns more than once when he was out of work; and, last but not least,"
there was the financial side of the affair. Curly had never been told
"who or what was back of these attacks on the independent lumber company,"
but he knew there was plenty of money in it.
All this he had been thinking over as he sat smoking that cigarette. In
the end he decided to have nothing to do with it. Bainbridge had trusted
"fully what were the Girl's feelings, did not dare to whisper even a word"
"of encouragement to her. At last, she ordered the Indian to lead the"
"way, and they started."
"The trail curved and twisted around the mountain, and in places they had"
to use the greatest care lest a misstep should carry them over a
"precipice with a drop of hundreds of feet. It was a perilous descent,"
"inasmuch as the path was covered with snow. Moreover, it was necessary"
that as little noise as possible should be made while they were making
"their way past the buildings of the camp below, for the Mexican had not"
"been wrong when he stated that Ashby's men were quartered at, or in the"
"immediate vicinity of, The Palmetto. Fortunately, they passed through"
"without meeting anyone, and before long they came to the edge of the"
plateau beneath which was the ravine which Johnson had to cross to reach
the spot where it had been agreed that Castro should be waiting with
horses for his master. It was also the place where the Girl was to leave
"her lover to go on alone, and so they halted. A few moments passed"
"without either of them speaking; at length, the man said in as cheery a"
voice as he could summon:
"""I must leave you here. I remember the way well. All danger is past."""
The Girl's lips were quivering; she asked:
"""An' when will you be back?"""
"The man noted her emotion, and though he himself was conscious of a"
choking sensation he contrived to say in a most optimistic tone:
"""In two weeks--not more than two weeks. It will take all that time to"
"arrange things at the rancho. As it is, I hardly see my way clear to"
"dismissing my men--you see, they belong to me, almost, and--but I'll do"
"""Ah, there is too much socialism everywhere!"" cried the q-b."
"""Ma--perhaps, perhaps--"" said the discreet Sicilian. She saw which way"
"the land lay, and added:"
"""Si vuole un _pocchetino_ di Socialismo: one wants a tiny bit of"
"socialism in the world, a tiny bit. But not much. Not much. At present"
"there is too much."""
"Our host, twinkling at this speech which treated of the sacred creed as"
"if it were a pinch of salt in the broth, believing the q-b was throwing"
"dust in his eyes, and thoroughly intrigued by us as a pair of deep ones,"
retired. No sooner had he gone than the lamp-flame stood up at its full
"length, and started to whistle. The q-b drew back. Not satisfied by"
"this, another flame suddenly began to whip round the bottom of the"
"burner, like a lion lashing its tail. Unnerved, we made room: the q-b"
cried again: in came the host with a subtle smile and a pin and an air
"of benevolence, and tamed the brute."
"What else was there to eat? There was a piece of fried pork for me, and"
"boiled eggs for the q-b. As we were proceeding with these, in came the"
"remainder of the night's entertainment: three station officials, two in"
"scarlet peaked caps, one in a black-and-gold peaked cap. They sat down"
"with a clamour, in their caps, as if there was a sort of invisible"
screen between us and them. They were young. The black cap had a lean
"and sardonic look: one of the red-caps was little and ruddy, very young,"
"with a little mustache: we called him the _maialino_, the gay little"
"black pig, he was so plump and food-nourished and frisky. The third was"
rather puffy and pale and had spectacles. They all seemed to present us
"the blank side of their cheek, and to intimate that no, they were not"
"going to take their hats off, even if it were dinner-table and a strange"
"_signora_. And they made rough quips with one another, still as if we"
await this hour; there might one find the treasures of the Forty
"Thieves. And so I quarried on slowly, with bated breath, savouring"
"the interest. Believe me, I had little palate left for the jelly; and"
"though I preferred the taste when I took cream with it, I used often to"
go without because the cream dimmed the transparent fractures.”
"In his work on Imagination, Ribot says: “The free initiative of"
children is always superior to the imitations we pretend to make for
them.”
The passage from Robert Stevenson becomes more clear from a scientific
point of view when taken in connection with one from Karl Groos' book
on the “Psychology of Animal Play”:
"“The Child is wholly absorbed in his play, and yet under the ebb and"
"flow of thought and feeling like still water under wind-swept waves, he"
has the knowledge that it is pretence after all. Behind the sham ‘I’
"that takes part in the game, stands the unchanged ‘I’ which regards the"
sham ‘I’ with quiet superiority.”
Queyrat speaks of play as one of the distinct phases of a child's
"imagination; it is “essentially a metamorphosis of reality, a"
transformation of places and things.”
"Now to return to the point which Mrs. Ewing makes, namely, that we"
should develop in normal children the power of distinguishing between
Truth and Falsehood.
I should suggest including two or three stories which would test that
"power in children, and if they fail to realise the difference between"
romancing and telling lies then it is evident that they need special
attention and help along this line. I give the titles of two stories of
"The event increased our uneasiness. After each ""bombing-stunt"" we"
"thought: ""We were lucky this time--it will be our turn next though."""
"Moreover, we began to realize our helplessness. We were compelled to"
remain in our tents during a raid and there was no possibility of taking
shelter. We could have put on our steel helmets--they would at least
"have afforded some head protection, but hardly any of us had the courage"
to do anything that might be regarded by the others as a sign of fear.
The discussion about the bombing of hospitals had made us all think of
air-raids. We had nearly finished our day's work when we noticed a few
clouds on the horizon. We felt relieved. Perhaps the sky would be
overcast and we would have an undisturbed night.
"""I can't stick night raids,"" said one of our number. ""They don't put my"
"wind up a bit, but they interfere with my sleep and make me feel tired"
"in the mornings."""
A man who had been in the war from the beginning answered:
"""I can see you haven't been out here long, and have never been in a"
proper raid. I'll never forget the last time we were bombed. We were out
on rest about fifteen miles behind the line. Fritz came over and I had
the wind up so badly that I left the tent to go into the open fields.
"(I'd had a taste of it before, you know, and that makes all the"
difference.) Then he bombed us before I knew where I was. I ran for my
life. There was a hell of a crash behind me and a bit caught me in the
shoulder and knocked me down. When it was all over I got up and went
"back, although my shoulder hurt like anything. A lot of our fellows were"
"running about and shouting. Where my tent used to be, there was a big"
bomb-hole and my mates were lying dead all round--fourteen of them. I
"didn't recognize most of them, they were so smashed up. Fritz had"
dropped one right on the tent. I reckon I was lucky to get off with a
time comes--after I've done my part.
"""I'm only sorry I haven't been able to get rid of Captain Dove right"
"away, but it won't be long now till--You needn't worry any more about"
him. I'll see that he behaves better.
"""If there's anything else I can do for your comfort, you must let me"
"know. And now, I'll leave you to your own devices until it's time to"
"start on our travels. Better get a rest while you can, eh? We've a very"
"busy week ahead of us."""
"She saw that he did not intend to tell her any more in the meantime, and"
"was glad to see him go. Then she called Ambrizette in for company, and"
"sat down by the window again, to try to sort out for herself the"
bewildering tangle that life had once more become within a few hours.
"Gazing out across the familiar sea with wistful, far-away eyes, she"
mused for a time over what Captain Dove had told Mr. Jobling of her
"history, and strove to piece together with that all she herself could"
recall of that dim and always more mysterious past out of which she had
"come to be Captain Dove's property, bought and paid for, at a high"
"price, as he had repeated several times."
"Her own earliest vague, disconnected, ineffectual memories were all of"
"some dark, savage mountain-country; of endless days of travel; of"
"camp-fires in the cold, and hungry camels squealing for fodder; of the"
fragrant cinnamon-smell of the steam that came from the cooking-pots.
"Before, or, it might have been, after that, she had surely lived on some"
"seashore, in a shimmering white village with narrow, crooked lanes for"
streets and little flat-roofed houses huddled together among hot
sandhills where the _suddra_ grew and lean goats bleated always for
CHAPTER II
WANDERJAHRE--SOCIAL LIFE IN SCOTLAND--BEGINNING OF HIS LITERARY LIFE
In the present century in Germany we have seen a period of almost
unparalleled literary glory succeeded by a time of great commercial
prosperity and national enthusiasm. But when Ferrier visited that
country in 1834 the era of its intellectual greatness had hardly passed
"away; some, at least, of its stars remained, and others had very"
"recently ceased to be. Goethe had died just two years before, but Heine"
"lived till many years afterwards; amongst the philosophers, though Kant"
"and Fichte, of course, were long since gone, Schelling was still at"
"work at Munich, and Hegel lived at Berlin till November of 1831, when"
he was cut off during an epidemic of cholera. Most of the great men had
"disappeared, and yet the memory of their achievements still survived,"
and the impetus they gave to thought could not have been lost. The
traditional lines of speculation consistently carried out since
"Reformation days had survived war and national calamity, and it"
remained to be seen whether the greater tests of prosperity and success
would be as triumphantly undergone.
We can imagine Ferrier's feelings when this new world opened up before
"him, a Scottish youth, to whom it was a new, untrodden country. It may"
be true that it was his literary rather than his speculative affinities
that first attracted him to Germany. To form in literature he always
"attached the greatest value, and to the end his interest in letters was"
only second to his attachment to philosophy. German poetry was to him
"be of Orphic origin. They were buried with the dead, and for this"
reason were more outspoken in their references to the mystic doctrines
than was permissible in epitaphs exposed to the vulgar gaze. The most
"complete of these tablets is one which was found near Sybaris, and,"
"with the exception of the last sentence of all, the inscription is in"
"hexameter verse. Miss Harrison, to whose work I am wholly indebted for"
"this valuable evidence, translates as follows[1505]:"
"‘Out of the pure I come, Pure Queen of Them Below,"
Eukles and Eubouleus and the other Gods immortal.
"For I also avow me that I am of your blessed race,"
But Fate laid me low and the other Gods immortal
... starflung thunderbolt.
I have flown out of the sorrowful weary Wheel.
I have passed with eager feet to the Circle desired.
"I have sunk beneath the bosom of Despoina, Queen of the Underworld."
I have passed with eager feet from the Circle desired.
"Happy and Blessed One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal."
A kid I have fallen into milk.’
The gist of the document which the dead man takes with him is then
briefly this. He claims to have been pure originally and of the same
"race as his gods; but as a man he was mortal and exposed to death,"
and in this respect differed from his gods. He states however that he
has performed certain ritual acts which entitle him to be re-admitted
to the pure fellowship of the gods now that death is passed. And the
"answer comes, ‘Thou shalt be God instead of mortal.’"
Now here I wish to consider one only of these ritual acts--that one of
which the meaning is clearest--Δεσποίνας δ’ ὑπὸ κόλπον ἔδυν χθονίας
"βασιλείας, which means, if I may give my own rendering, ‘I was admitted"
"to the embrace of Despoina, Queen of the under-world.’ The phrase"
"own methods of salvation for Corsica were rejected, he tore himself"
away and threw his undivided energies into the Revolution.
Yet the records of his early life show that in his character there was
a strain of true sentiment and affection. In him Nature carved out a
"character of rock-like firmness, but she adorned it with flowers of"
human sympathy and tendrils of family love. At his first parting from
"his brother Joseph at Autun, when the elder brother was weeping"
"passionately, the little Napoleon dropped a tear: but that, said the"
"tutor, meant as much as the flood of tears from Joseph. Love of his"
relatives was a potent factor of his policy in later life; and slander
has never been able wholly to blacken the character of a man who loved
"and honoured his mother, who asserted that her advice had often been"
"of the highest service to him, and that her justice and firmness of"
spirit marked her out as a natural ruler of men. But when these
"admissions are freely granted, it still remains true that his"
character was naturally hard; that his sense of personal superiority
"made him, even as a child, exacting and domineering; and the sequel"
"was to show that even the strongest passion of his youth, his"
"determination to free Corsica from France, could be abjured if"
"occasion demanded, all the force of his nature being thenceforth"
concentrated on vaster adventures.
*      *      *      *      *
CHAPTER II
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND CORSICA
"by Russia and France, to come out to the Far East, especially because"
the Russian fleets have ceased to exist. I admit that the German fleet
"is strong, but I do not believe it is powerful enough for one to say"
"with certainty that it can easily crush Japan. At all events, what"
pretext has Germany to enter into war in the Far East? Among other
things also she would have to count on the opinion and sentiments of two
"countries at least, I mean England and the United States. I do not,"
"therefore, consider a new combination possible. Japan cannot be"
intimidated by mere barking.
"If, however, Europe should choose to take such a course, we should"
gravely reflect. I do not believe your country for example would ever
undertake an expedition against Japan. You have disapproved a small
expedition to Tonkin and we are a little more serious than the
"Tonkinese. France might no doubt, if her honour demanded it, judge it"
"worth the pain to engage in a war with Japan, but under no other"
circumstance do I believe her disposed to take such a part.
Japan will always continue to advance on the lines of occidental
civilisation. I do not see the reason which will prevent Japan from
"acting in concert with France or Germany, provided of course these"
powers do not enter upon an action which may appear to her altogether
"unjust or iniquitous, in which case she may not be able to march with"
them hand-in-hand.
Would Japan be offended by France introducing civilisation into
Indo-China?
We are not at all opposed to your introducing Western civilisation into
"your colonies. On the contrary we shall be quite contented, but in"
introducing your civilisation into your colonies you have to be prepared
that it signifies an amelioration of the condition of the natives. If it
shameful secret.
A sound--the sound of a man in great pain checked her hysterical sobs.
"Dazed, she passed her hand over her face as if to clear away the dark"
shades that were obstructing her vision. Another groan--and like a flash
she was down on her knees lavishing endearments upon the road agent.
"Never before, it is true, had the Girl had any experience in gun-shot"
"wounds. She had played the part of nurse, however, more than once when"
the boys met with accidents at the mines. For the women of the
California camps at that time had endless calls upon them. It was a
"period for sacrifices innumerable, and help and sympathy were never"
"asked that they were not freely given. So, if the Girl did not know the"
"very best thing to do, she knew, at least, what not to do, and it was"
only a few minutes before she had cut the coat from his back.
The next thing to be done--the dragging of the unconscious man to the
"bed--was hard work, of course, but being strong of arm, as well as stout"
"of heart, she at last accomplished it."
"Now she cut away his shirt in order to find the wound, which proved to"
be in his breast. Quickly then she felt with her fingers in an endeavour
"to find the ball, but in this she was unsuccessful. So after a moment's"
deliberation she made up her mind that the wound was a flesh one and
that the ball was anywhere but in the man's body--a diagnosis that was
"largely due to the cheerful optimism of her nature and which,"
"fortunately, proved to be true."
Presently she went to a corner of the room and soon returned with a
basin of water and some hastily torn bandages. For a good fifteen
"minutes after that she washed the gash and, finally, bandaged it as well"
"as she knew how. And now, having done all that her knowledge or instinct"
boy; throughout the whole incident of the gentle lady whose fate melts
even the Vice to tears; and in the outburst of a mother's grief over her
child's corpse. We quote the last.
"O blissful babe, O joy of womb, heart's comfort and delight,"
"For counsel given unto the king, is this thy just requite?"
"O heavy day and doleful time, these mourning tunes to make!"
"With blubb'red eyes into my arms from earth I will thee take,"
And wrap thee in my apron white: but O my heavy heart!
"The spiteful pangs that it sustains would make it in two to part,"
"The death of this my son to see: O heavy mother now,"
That from thy sweet and sug'red joy to sorrow so shouldst bow!
What grief in womb did I retain before I did thee see;
"Yet at the last, when smart was gone, what joy wert thou to me!"
"How tender was I of thy food, for to preserve thy state!"
How stilled I thy tender heart at times early and late!
"With velvet paps I gave thee suck, with issue from my breast,"
And danced thee upon my knee to bring thee unto rest.
"Is this the joy of thee I reap? O king of tiger's brood,"
"O tiger's whelp, hadst thou the heart to see this child's heart-blood?"
"Nature enforceth me, alas, in this wise to deplore,"
"To wring my hands, O wel-away, that I should see this hour."
"Thy mother yet will kiss thy lips, silk-soft and pleasant white,"
With wringing hands lamenting for to see thee in this plight.
"My lording dear, let us go home, our mourning to augment."
"The second play, _Appius and Virginia_ (1563), by R.B. (not further"
"identified), is, in some respects, weaker; though, by avoiding the"
"crowded plot which spoilt _Cambyses_, it attains more nearly to tragedy."
"The low characters, Mansipulus and Mansipula, the Vice (Haphazard), and"
"the abstractions, Conscience, Comfort and their brethren, reappear with"
as little success. But the singleness of the theme helps towards that
"At all events, the Sergeant and La Giralda went off calmly enough in the"
"direction of the town of San Ildefonso, driving their donkey before"
"them. For a minute, as they gained the crest, their figures stood out"
black and clear against the coppery sunrise. The next they had
"disappeared down the slope, the flapping peak of Cardono's Montera cap"
being the last thing to be lost sight of.
"The long, dragging, idle day was before the party in the dry ravine."
"Etienne went to his saddle-bags, and drawing his breviary from the"
"leathern flap, began to peruse the lessons for the day with an attentive"
piety which was not lessened by the fact that he had forgotten most of
"the Latin he had learned at school. John Mortimer, on the other hand,"
"took out his pocket-book, and was soon absorbed by calculations in which"
wine and onions shared the page with schemes for importing into Spain
Manchester goods woven and dyed to suit the taste of the country
housewives.
El Sarria sat down with a long sigh to his never-failing resort of
"cleaning and ordering his rifle and pistols. He had a phial of oil, a"
"feather, and a fine linen rag which he carried about with him for the"
purpose. Afterwards he undertook the same office for the weapons of
Rollo. Those of the other members of the expedition might take care of
themselves. Ramon Garcia had small belief in their ability to make much
"use of them, at any rate--the sergeant being alone excepted."
"These three being accounted for, there remained only Rollo and Concha."
"Now there was a double shelf a little way from the horses, from which"
the chief of the expedition could keep an eye on the whole encampment.
"The pair slowly and, as it were, unconsciously gravitated thither, and"
"in a moment Rollo found himself telling ""the story of his life"" to a"
true. It is for man not to quarrel with circumstances but bravely accept
them; and we belong to that race and dynasty who had accomplished great
things with simple means.
FAILURE AND SUCCESS
"This day twenty-three years ago, I resolved that as far as the"
"whole-hearted devotion and faith of one man counted, that would not be"
wanting and within six months it came about that some of the most
difficult problems connected with Electric Waves found their solution in
"my Laboratory and received high appreciation from Lord Kelvin, Lord"
Rayleigh and other leading physicists. The Royal Society honoured me by
"publishing my discoveries and offering, of their own accord, an"
appropriation from the special Parliamentary Grant for the advancement
of knowledge. That day the closed gates suddenly opened and I hoped that
"the torch that was then lighted would continue to burn brighter, and"
brighter. But man's faith and hope require repeated testing. For five
"years after this, the progress was interrupted; yet when the most"
generous and wide appreciation of my work had reached almost the highest
point there came a sudden and unexpected change.
LIVING AND NON-LIVING
In the pursuit of my investigations I was unconsciously led into the
border region of physics and physiology and was amazed to find boundary
lines vanishing and points of contact emerge between the realms of the
Living and Non-living. Inorganic matter was found anything but inert; it
also was a thrill under the action of multitudinous forces that played
"on it. A universal reaction seemed to bring together metal, plant and"
animal under a common law. They all exhibited essentially the same
"stood ready to cast off--was that he once followed the sea, but in more"
recent years lived by fishing up sponges and at times supplying shark
meat to the poorer quarter of Key West. The carcass of a water fowl tied
"to his boat, while he occupied himself with sponges, would sometimes"
"attract a shark; then he would strip, take a knife in his teeth, and"
dive.
"I glanced at Gates, but saw no incredulity in his face."
"In another hour, at nearly dusk, Key West had grown small and finally"
"sank below the horizon, leaving only its three skeleton-like towers"
"standing against the sky--standing erect with all nerves strained,"
"watch-dogs of the darkening sea; ears cocked, to catch a distressed cry"
from some waif out in the mysterious night.
Looking back along our wake I imagined the big black man standing as we
"had left him on the dock, gazing after us with patient regret; and I was"
"glad to have given him the handful of coins at parting, little dreaming"
how many times that loaf upon the water would come floating in to me.
Monsieur Dragot revealed himself more and more to our astonished eyes as
we sat that night on deck. He had been a professor in the University of
"Bucharest, and hinted at an intimate entente with the reigning house of"
"Azuria. Besides being versed in many sciences, including medicine, he"
spoke seven languages and read several others. But these things were
"drawn from him by Tommy's artful questions, rather than being said in"
"boastfulness. Indeed, Monsieur was charmingly, almost touchily, modest."
"Of his business in Havana he gave no hint, yet this happened to be the"
one piece of information that Tommy seemed most possessed to find out.
"""You'll be in Cuba long, Monsieur?"" he asked."
He felt the tension of the muscles beneath him. Don Carlos was gathering
"himself together for the leap.  He would not fail, falter, or refuse."
The great mass seemed rushing up against him.  He felt the slackening
"with which Don Carlos faced his task, the motion of his flanks as he"
"took off and rose. Then what was it happened?  The sound of a click,"
"sharp and clear—a sickening sensation of falling, sinking, struggling,"
plunging.  Grey felt for a moment as though the end had come.  He and
his horse seemed falling into the very bowels of the earth. A black
shadow almost overhead showed him that the stallion had cleared the
"barrier, and the air was full of shouts, screams, cheers, and cries."
Next moment he felt strong hands lifting and dragging him upwards.
"Dick’s white face looked into his own, and the first words he heard were"

"""Foul play, foul play, my master.  That ditch was dug and concealed—ay,"

"one thought was for the good horse, who had dropped downwards into this"
"unseen, unsuspected pit, and was gasping in affright, but might possibly"
"have escaped serious injury.  He himself felt little ill effects, having"
"had a marvellous escape.  But his soul was stirred within him, and in"
"getting out the horse he saw plainly that Dick had been right, and that"
some sort of old trap-door concealed an opening into the ground which
"might have been at one time a well, but was now silted up with sand.  By"
"luring the foremost rider to this particular spot to take the leap, any"
astute enemy aware of the nature of the ground could almost certainly
"There was a woman once who loved a young man, not of her village, very"
"dearly. And he loved her, too, as dearly as she loved him, and he"
demanded her in marriage from her parents; but they refused. Why they
"refused I do not know, but probably because they did not consider the"
young man a proper person for their daughter to marry. Then he tried to
"run away with her, and nearly succeeded, but they were caught before"
they got clear of the village.
The young man had to leave the neighbourhood. The attempted abduction of
"a girl is an offence severely punishable by law, so he fled; and in"
"time, under pressure from her people, the girl married another man; but"
she never forgot. She lived with her husband quite happily; he was good
"to her, as most Burmese husbands are, and they got along well enough"
together. But there were no children.
"After some years, four or five, I believe, the former lover returned to"
his village. He thought that after this lapse of time he would be safe
"from prosecution, and he was, moreover, very ill."
"He was so ill that very soon he died, without ever seeing again the girl"
he was so fond of; and when she heard of his death she was greatly
"distressed, so that the desire of life passed away from her. It so"
happened that at this very time she found herself enceinte with her
"first child, and not long before the due time came for the child to be"
born she had a dream.
"She dreamt that her soul left her body, and went out into space and met"
there the soul of her lover who had died. She was rejoiced to meet him
"again, full of delight, so that the return of her soul to her body, her"
"awakening to a world in which he was not, filled her with despair. So"
"she prayed her lover, if it was now time for him again to be incarnated,"

It is a matter of intense regret that so very few people have
sufficiently clear remembrance of their own childhood to help them to
understand the taste and point of view of the _normal_ child. There
is a passage in the “Brownies” (by Mrs. Ewing) which illustrates the
confusion created in the child mind by a facetious allusion in a
dramatic moment which needed a more direct treatment.
"When the nursery toys have all gone astray, one little child exclaims"
joyfully:
"“Why, the old Rocking-Horse's nose has turned up in the oven!”"
"“It couldn't” remarks a tiresome, facetious doctor, far more anxious"
to be funny than to sympathise with the joy of the child; “it was the
"purest Grecian, modelled from the Elgin marbles.”"
"Now, for grown-up people this is an excellent joke, but for a child"
"who has not yet become acquainted with these Grecian masterpieces, the"
whole remark is pointless and hampering.[20]
VI.--_Stories which appeal to fear or priggishness._ This is a class of
story to be avoided which scarcely counts to-day and against which the
teacher does not need a warning; but I wish to make a passing allusion
"to it, partly to round off my subject and partly to show that we have"
made some improvement in choice of subject.
When I study the evolution of the story from the crude recitals
"offered to our children within the last hundred years, I feel that,"
"though our progress in intelligent mental catering may be slow, it"
is real and sure. One has only to take some examples from the Chap
"word is given--to my people."""
"""I shall not plead with you,"" she returned steadily, ""and you may be"
sure I shall not waver. I am not afraid to die. I had hoped to atone
"for all the wrong that has been done you with my love for you, Nehal."
I had hoped that then you would turn away from this madness and become
once more our friend. To this end I have not hesitated to trample on
my dignity and pride. I have not spared myself. But you will not
"listen, you are determined to go on, and I""--she caught her breath"
"sharply--""surely you can understand? I love you, and you have made"
"yourself the enemy of my country. Death is the easiest, the kindest"

Nehal Singh's brows knitted themselves in the anguish of a man who
"finds himself thwarted by his own nature. He tried not to believe her,"
"and indeed, in all her words, though they had rung like music, his"
"ear, tuned to suspicion, had heard the mocking undercurrent of"
laughter. She had laughed at him secretly through all those months
"when he had offered up to her the incense of an absolute faith, an"
"unshared devotion. Even now she might be laughing at him, playing on"
that in him which nothing could destroy or conceal--his love for her.
"And yet--! Behind him he heard the uneasy stir of impatient feet, the"
"hushed clash of arms. He stood between her and a certain, terrible"
"death. One word from him, and it would be over--his path clear. But he"
"could not speak that word. Treacherous and cruel as she had been, the"
halo of her first glory still hung about her. He saw her as he had
"first seen her--the golden image of pure womanhood--and, strange,"
"unreasoning contradiction of the human heart, beneath the ashes of his"
old faith a new fire had kindled and with every moment burned more
brightly. Unquenchable trust fought out a death struggle with
"distrust, and in that conflict her words recurred to him with poignant"
"significance: ""Death is the easiest, the kindest solution to it all."""
"""Tell it straight,"" interrupted Cherry. ""They don't understand you."""
"""Well, there ain't any Pullmans running to this resort, so I stow away"
"on a coal-burner, but somebody flags me. Then I try to hire out as a"
"fisherman, but I ain't there with the gang talk and my stuff drags, so"
I fix it for a hide-away on _The Blessed Isle_--that's her name. Can
"you beat that for a monaker? This sailor of mine goes good to grub me,"
"but he never shows for forty-eight hours--or years, I forget which."
"Anyhow, I stand it as long as I can, then I dig my way up to a hatch"
"and mew like a house-cat. It seems they were hep from the start, and"
"battened me down on purpose, then made book on how long I'd stay hid."
"Oh, it's a funny joke, and they all get a stomach laugh when I show."
When I offer to pay my way they're insulted. Nix! that ain't their
"graft. They wouldn't take money from a stranger. Oh, no! They permit me"
"to _work_ my way. The scullion has quit, see? So they promote me to his"

"the grub, wait on table, wash the dishes, mop the floors, make the"
"officers' beds, peel six bushels of potatoes a day, and do the laundry."
"Then, of course, there's some odd tasks. Oh, it was a swell job--more"
"like a pastime. When a mop sees me coming now it dances a hornpipe, and"
I can't look a dish-rag in the face. All I see in my dreams is
"potato-parings and meat-rinds. I've got dish-water in my veins, and the"
whole universe looks greasy to me. Naturally it was my luck to pick the
"slowest ship in the harbor. We lay three weeks in the ice, that's all,"
"and nobody worked but me and the sea-gulls."""

"""I did. I beat the barrier, and now I want a bath and some clean"

found herself skirting the high-paled ironwork which confines the
"palace. She pursued her way towards the town, taking care, however, to"
look sharply about her so that she might miss nothing.

from their ungrateful labours open-mouthed and gasping for breath. Not
"even a gardener was to be seen scratching weeds on a path, or in the"
dimmest distance passing at random across one of the deep-shaded
"avenues. An unholy quiet seemed to have settled upon the place, the"
"marvel of Castile, the most elevated of earthly palaces, broken only by"
"the sombre tolling of the chapel bell, which would cease for five"
"minutes without apparent reason, and then, equally without cause, begin"
all over again its lugubrious chime.
"Down the zigzags towards the town went La Giralda, the goats taking"
"advantage of the wider paths to stray further afield, and needing more"
"frequently the touch of the wand, which the old woman had taken from the"
donkey's load in order to induce them to proceed.
"As the gipsy passed along, a small shrill voice called upon her to stop,"
"and from a side walk, concealed by roses and oleander bushes, late"
"flowering because of the great elevation, a richly-dressed little girl"
came running. She ran at the top of her speed towards the gilt railings
which towered high above her head. Her age appeared to be about that of
the little girl whom La Giralda had buried among the pottery shards in
that other meaner garden up on the mountain side.
"""Stop,"" she cried imperiously, ""I bid you stop! I am the Queen, and you"
must obey me. I have not seen any one for five days except stupid old
"Susana, who will be after me in a moment. Stop, I tell you! I want to"
"see your goats milked. I love milk, and they will not give me enough,"
The man who was chosen by Cabrera to accompany them on their mission was
"of a most remarkable appearance. Tall, almost as tall as El Sarria, he"
was yet distinguished from his fellows by a notable gauntness and
angularity of figure.
"""A step-ladder with the bottom bars missing!"" was Rollo's mental"
"description of him, as he stood before them in a uniform jacket much too"
"tight for him, through which his ribs showed not unlike the spars of a"
ladder.
But in other respects Sergeant Cardono was a remarkable man. The iron
"gravity of his countenance, seamed on the right-hand side by a deep"
"scar, took no new expression when he found himself detailed by his"
general for this new and dangerous mission.
With a single salute he fell out and instantly attached himself to
"Rollo, whom he relieved of his knapsack and waterbottle on the spot."
"Sergeant Cardono paid no attention whatever to the other three, whom he"
evidently regarded as very subordinate members of the expedition.
As soon as they arrived at the village where they were to part from the
"command of Cabrera, Sergeant Cardono promptly disappeared. He was not"
"seen for several hours, during which Rollo and El Sarria wandered here"
and there endeavouring in that poor place to pick up some sustenance
which would serve them in lieu of a dinner. They had but poor success. A
"round of black bread, a fowl of amazing age, vitality, and muscular"
"development, with a few snails, were all that they could obtain by their"
"best persuasions, aided by the money with which Rollo was plentifully"
supplied. John Mortimer looked disconsolately on. He had added a little
"ham on his own account, which last he had brought in his saddle-bags"
"from the venta of Sarria. But everything pointed to a sparse meal, and"
even the philosophic Etienne shrugged his shoulders and departed to
by melting bits of lead. With his primitive weapon with the entreaties
of his villagers ringing in his ears Kaloo Singh started on his perilous
journey. At midday I was startled by the groanings of some animals in
pain. The tigress had sprung among a herd of buffalo and with successive
strokes of its mighty paws had killed two buffaloes and left them in the
field. Kaloo Singh waited there for the return of the tigress to the
kill. There was not a tree near by; only there was a low bush behind
which he lay crouched. After hours of waiting as the sun was going down
he was taken aback by the sudden apparition of the tigress which stood
within six feet of him. His limbs had become half paralysed from cold
and his crouching position. Trying to raise his gun he could take no aim
as his arm was shaking with involuntary fear. Kaloo Singh explained to
"me afterwards how he succeeded in shaking off his mortal terror. ""I"
"quietly said to myself, Kaloo Singh, Kaloo Singh, who sent you here? Did"
not the villagers put their trust on you! I could then no longer lie in
"hiding, and I stood up and something strange and invigorating crept up"
strength into my body. All the trembling went and I became as hard as
steel. The tigress had seen me and with eyes blazing crouched for the
spring lashing its tail. Only six feet lay between. She sprang and my
gun also went off at the same time and she missed her aim and fell dead
"close to me."" That was how a common villager went off to meet death at"
the call of something for which he could give no name and the mother
and wife of Kaloo Singh had also bidden him go. There are millions of
Kaloo Singhs with mother and sisters and wife to send them forth. And
you too have many loved ones who would themselves bid you arm for the
defence of your homes.
DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERAMENT

Have the overhand: in me it is verified.
"Pray for me, good people, I beseech you heartily,"
That the Lord above on my poor soul have mercy.

"Farewell men of law, with the whole commonalty."

And desire God to pardon your iniquity.
"Farewell, sweet England, now last of all to thee:"
I am right sorry I could do for thee no more.
"Farewell once again, yea, farewell for evermore."
"Prompted by a different motive, yet not far removed in actual effect"
"from the politico-religious class of play represented by _New Custom_,"
are the early Interludes of John Heywood. It is quite impossible to read
such a play as _The Pardoner and the Friar_ and believe that its author
wrote under any such earnest and sober inspiration as did the author of
"_New Custom_. His intention was frankly to amuse, and to paint life as"
he saw it without the intrusion of unreal personages of highly virtuous
but dull ideas. Yet he swung the lash of satire as cuttingly and as
merrily about the flanks of ecclesiastical superstition as ever did the
creator of Perverse Doctrine.[47]
"The simplest plot sufficed Heywood, and the minimum of characters. _The"
Pardoner and the Friar_ (possibly as early as 1520) demands only four
"persons, while the plot may be summed up in a few sentences, thus: A"
"Pardoner and a Friar, from closely adjoining platforms, are endeavouring"
"to address the same crowd, the one to sell relics, the other to beg"
money for his order. By a sort of stichomythic alternation each for a
"time is supposed to carry on his speech regardless of the other, so that"
to follow either connectedly the alternate lines must be read in
"sequence. But every now and then they break off for abuse, and finally"
they fight. A Parson and neighbour Prat interfere to convey them to jail
"a gardener, not a dog, not even a soldier on guard to salute me or let"
"me examine his sword-bayonet. And now when this dear, this sweet old"
"Señora comes by with her lovely, lovely goats, you must perforce try to"
pull me off as if I were a village child that had played truant from the
"monks' school and must be birched for its fault!"""
"All the while she was speaking, the young Princess directed a shower of"
"harmless blows at the skirts of her attendant, which Doña Susana"
"laughingly warded off, begging all the while for pity, and instancing"
"the direct commands of the little girl's mother, apparently a very"
"exalted personage indeed, as a reason for her interference."
"But Isabel of Spain was not to be appeased, and presently she had"
recourse to tears in the midst of her fury.
"""You hate me--I know you do--that is what it means,"" she cried, ""you"
"would not have me happy even for a moment. But one day I shall be Queen,"
"and do as I like! Yes, and drink as much warm goat's milk as I want, in"
"spite of all the stupid, wicked, cruel Susanas in the world. And I shall"
throw you into a dungeon with nothing but mice and rats and serpents and
"centipedes--yes, and snails that leave a white slimy trail over you"
"when they crawl! Ugh! And I will have your hands tied, so that you shall"
"not be able to brush them off when they tickle your neck. Yes, I will,"
"Susana! I swear it, and I am growing big--so big! And soon I shall be"
"old enough to have you put in prison with the mice and snails, bad"
"Susana! Oh, wicked Susana!"""
"Now, whether these childish threats actually had some effect, or whether"
"the old lady was so soft-hearted as her comfortable appearance denoted,"
certain it is that she took a key from her pocket and passed it through
the tall gilt railings to La Giralda.
as obediently as well-trained dogs. Most of them were of the usual
"dark-red colour, a trifle soiled with the grey dust on which they had"
"been lying. A few were white, and these were the favourites of the"
"little Queen, who, though compelled to go on ahead, looked constantly"
back over her shoulder and endeavoured to imitate the shrill whistling
call by which La Giralda kept her flock in place.
When they arrived at the palace front the doors stood wide open. At Doña
"Susana's call an ancient major-domo appeared, his well-developed"
waistcoat mating ill with the pair of shrunk and spindle shanks which
"appeared beneath. The sentry boxes, striped red and gold with the"
"colours of Spain, were empty. At the guard-houses there were no lounging"
sergeants or smart privates eager to rise and salute as the little Queen
passed by.
There was already indeed about the palace an air of desolation. The
"great gates in front towards the town had been closed, as if to shut off"
"infection, and the Court itself, dwindled to a few faithful old"
"retainers of Fernando VII., surrounded his widow and her new husband"
with a devotion which was yet far more than their due.
It was not long before La Giralda had milked the remainder of the flock
and sent the creaming white pitchers into the palace. Little Isabel
danced with delight as one she-goat after another escaped with infinite
tail-waggling and bleatings of pleasure. And in the dearth of other
amusement she desired and even commanded the old woman to remain and
pasture her herd within the precincts of the palace. But La Giralda had
much yet to do. She must find out the state and dispositions of the town
"of San Ildefonso, and then rejoin her companions in the little corrie or"
cauldron-like _cirque_ in which she and the sergeant had left Rollo and
the other members of the expedition.
"""Baron Ned says my letter must be short, so I smother what remnant of"

"you, pray for you, and be your fortune good or ill, I would share it and"
give you a part of the bliss of life which you would give to me.
"""So I pray you, do not desert me in case your present hope of good"
"fortune fails you, but let me know at any time, and I will go to you, and"
will go with you wherever you will take me.

"has been populated by maniacs, and I pray God always will be. I pray you,"
"remember, in judging me, that you are you and that I am but a woman"
by whom the good or evil of life is reckoned in the measure of her love;
her joy or misery being only a matter of down weight or light weight more
"in the love she gives than in that which she receives. Remember, also,"
"that in this letter I must condense when I might easily be prolix, and"
"that after all is written, probably I shall have left unsaid the very"
thing I most wished to say. But these three words will tell it all and
bear repeating: I love you.
"""FRANCES."""
And this from my sensible cousin! What would it be if her heart were not
balanced by a wise head?
"Our letters being written, I became alarmed about posting them in London,"
"not knowing when a messenger would start for France, nor who he would be."
"The next day Frances and I talked it over, and she suggested that as the"
"king and most of the court were about to visit Bath for a season, and as"
captain--the fellow who had apparently followed Tommy and Monsieur. He
"was a well-built blond, with a bullet-shaped head, high cheek bones and"
"deep set eyes--pig eyes. His right cheek bore several scars which,"
"considering his type, strongly suggested a German of University dueling"
"experiences. So I looked on him with a livelier suspicion, even as she"
seemed to be doing.
In an undertone he now said something that brought the old man to his
"feet. With fear written on their faces they talked for several minutes,"
during which the blond jerked his head once or twice toward the gambling
rooms. The girl had leaned forward watching them intently. Then with a
peremptory order the old one sent him away and sank back into his chair;
"but a moment later, clutching the tablecloth, he spoke a few words that"
made her recoil in evident horror.
"I did not know what to do or what to think, so I merely watched with"
"every sense alert. I saw him call the waiter for his settlement, I saw"
him take out a large roll of money and with trembling fingers peel off
the outside bill--a new and crinkly fifty-dollar note. I saw the girl
"idly marking on the winecard with a small gold pencil, though her eyes"
were veiling an intense excitement; and when the waiter returned with a
"pile of change which the old man began to count, I saw her furtively"
slip the winecard to her lap. A moment later it fell to the floor as she
arose to leave.
"Together they started toward the exit, but having taken a few steps she"
"left him with a brief word and returned, presumably for her glove."
"Partially free from his eternal vigilance, she raised her eyes without"
"dissimulation and looked quickly, appealingly into mine; then down at"
"her hand, on which she leaned, whose fingers were unfolding from a"
little ball of paper. Again into my eyes she looked--a look of infinite
appeal.
The thoughtful traveler will concede to the Republic of Panama great
natural resources and a most happy entrance to the family of nations. It
is the especial protégé of the United States and under the watchful care
"of its patron will be free from the apprehension of misuse, revolution"
or invasion from without which has kept other Central American
governments in a constant state of unrest. About the international
morality of the proceedings which created the relations now existing
between the United States and Panama perhaps the least said the better.
"But even if we reprobate the sale of Joseph by his brethren, in the"
"scripture story, we must at least admit that he did better in Egypt than"
in his father’s house and that the protection and favor of the mighty
"Pharaoh was of the highest advantage to him, and in time to his"
unnatural brethren as well.

"At present the Republic suffers not only from its own checkered past,"
but from the varied failings of its neighbors. Its monetary system
"affords one illustration. The highest coin of the land is the peso, a"
piece the size of our silver dollar but circulating at a value of fifty
cents. If a man should want to pay a debt of $500 he would have to
deliver 1000 pesos unless he was possessed of a bank account and could
settle by check. No paper money is issued. “Who would take paper money
issued by a Central American republic?” ask the knowing ones scornfully
when you inquire about this seeming lack in the monetary system. Yet the
"Republic of Panama is the most solvent of nations, having no national"
debt and with money in bank.

"A Nursery Rhyme is the most sane, the most unselfish thing in the"
"world. It calls up some delightful image,--a little nut-tree with a"
silver walnut and a golden pear; some romantic adventure only for the
child's delight and liberation from the bondage of unseeing dulness: it
brings before the mind the quintessence of some good thing:
'The little dog laughed to see such sport'--there is the soul of
"good humour, of sanity, of health in the laughter of that innocently"
wicked little dog. It is the laughter of pure frolic without
unkindness. To have laughed with the little dog as a child is the best
preservative against mirthless laughter in later years--the horse
"laughter of brutality, the ugly laughter of spite, the acrid laughter"
"of fanaticism. The world of Nursery Rhymes, the old world of Mrs."
"Slipper-Slopper, is the world of natural things, of quick, healthy"
"motion, of the joy of living."
In Nursery Rhymes the child is entertained with all the pageant of
"the world. It walks in Fairy Gardens, and for it the singing birds"
pass. All the King's horses and all the King's men pass before it in
"their glorious array. Craftsmen of all sorts, bakers, confectioners,"
"silversmiths, blacksmiths are busy for it with all their arts and"
"mysteries, as at the court of an Eastern King.”"
"In insisting on the value of this escape from the commonplace, I cannot"
prove the importance of it more clearly than by showing what may happen
to a child who is deprived of his birthright by having none of the
stricken farmhouse. But only La Giralda gave a thought to the little
"grave in the shady corner of the garden, and only she promised herself"
to revisit it when the stern work of the night should be over and the
dawn of a calmer morning should have arisen.
"Now, as soon as Sergeant Cardono returned, he placed himself as"
completely as formerly under the orders of Rollo. He was no more José
"Maria the famous gipsy, but Sergeant Cardono of the army of H.M. Carlos"
"Quinto, and Señor Rollo was his colonel. Like a good scout he was ready"
"to advise, but to the full as ready to hold his tongue and obey."
"And Rollo, though new to his position, was not above benefiting"
"continually by his wisdom, and as a matter of fact it was the Sergeant"
"who, in conjunction with La Giralda, led the little expedition down the"
perilous goat-track by which the old gipsy had followed her flock in the
"morning. As usual Concha kept her place beside Rollo, with Mortimer and"
"Etienne a little behind, while El Sarria, taciturn but alert as usual,"
brought up the rear.
It can hardly be said that they carried with them any extraordinary
"elements of success. Indeed, in one respect they were at a manifest"
disadvantage. For in an expedition of this kind there ought to be one
"leader of dignity, character, and military genius far beyond the others."
But among this little band which stole so quietly along the
"mountain-paths of the Guadarrama, beneath the frowning snow-clad brow of"
"Peñalara, there was not one who upon occasion could not have led a"
similar forlorn hope. Each member of the party possessed a character
definite and easily to be distinguished from all the others. It was an
army of officers without any privates.
"Still, since our Firebrand, Rollo the Scot, held the nominal leadership,"
"and his quick imperious character made that chieftainship a reality,"
placed--a point in the argument which left an opportunity open to Kant
"to suggest a new development, to ask whether things being found"
"inadequate in producing knowledge, we might not ask if knowledge could"
not be more successful with things. But it is the Scottish lines of
"attempted solution that we wish to follow out, and not the German."
Perhaps they are not so very different.
"Philosophy, as Reid found it, was in a bad way enough, as far as the"
orthodox mind of Scotland was concerned. All justification for belief
"in God, in immortality, in all that was held sacred in a century of"
"much orthodoxy if little zeal, was gone. Such things might be believed"
"in by those who found any comfort in so believing, but to the educated"
"man who had seriously reflected on them, they were anachronisms. The"
"very desperateness of the case, however, seemed to promise a remedy."
"Men could not rest in a state of permanent scepticism, in a world"
utterly incapable of being rationally explained. Even the propounder of
"the theories allowed this to be true; and as for others, they felt that"
"they were rational beings, and this signified that there was system in"
the world.
"A champion arose when things were at their worst in Thomas Reid, the"
"founder, or at least the chiefest ornament, of the so-called Scottish"
School of Philosophy. He it was who set himself to add the principle of
"the coherence of the Universe, and the consequent possibility of"
"establishing Faith once more in the world. Reid, to begin with, instead"
"of looking at Hume's results as serious, regarded them as necessarily"
"absurd. He started a new theory of his own, the theory of Immediate"
"Perception, which signified that we are able immediately to"
"apprehend--not ideas only, but the Truth. And how, we may ask, can this"
be done?
It had been pointed out first of all that sensations as understood by
probability of bloodshed is reported to the king. To restore the courage
"of the despairing Gorboduc is now the labour of his counsellors, but the"
later announcement of the death of Ferrex casts him lower than before.
"At this point the Chorus, recalling the murder of a cousin in an earlier"
"generation of the royal race, points, in true Aeschylean fashion, to the"
hatred of an unsated revenge behind this latest blow:
"Thus fatal plagues pursue the guilty race,"
"Whose murderous hand, imbru'd with guiltless blood,"
"Asks vengeance still before the heaven's face,"
With endless mischiefs on the cursed brood.
"_Act IV, Scene 1._--Videna alone, in words of passionate vehemence,"
"laments that she has lived so long to see the death of Ferrex, renounces"
"his brother as no child of hers, and concludes with a threat of"
"vengeance. _Scene 2._--Bowed down with remorse, Porrex makes his defence"
"before the king, pleading the latter's own act, in dividing the kingdom,"
as the initial cause of the ensuing disaster. Before he has been long
"gone from his father's presence, Marcella, a lady-in-waiting, rushes"
"into the room, in wild disorder and grief, to report his murder at his"
"mother's hand. In anguished words she tells how, stabbed by Videna in"
"his sleep, he started up and, spying the queen by his side, called to"
"her for help, not crediting that she, his mother, could be his"
"murderess. Again, in tones of solemn warning, the Chorus reminds the"
audience that
"Blood asketh blood, and death must death requite:"
"Jove, by his just and everlasting doom,"
Justly hath ever so requited it.
"_Act V, Scene 1._--This warning is proved true by a report of the death"
of the king and queen at the hands of their subjects in revolt against
It was interesting to follow up the way it had come. The earlier news
"about the Dobuans had been brought by the canoes, which had fetched"
"the sago to Gumasila from the main island. A few days later, a canoe"
"from one of the main island villages had arrived here, and on its"
way had passed the Dobuans in Tewara. The news from the Trobriands
in the North had been brought by the Kuyawa canoe which had arrived a
couple of days before in Nabwageta (and whose visit to Nu'agasi I have
"described in Chapter XI). All these movements were not accidental,"
"but connected with the uvalaku expedition. To show the complexity,"
"as well as the precise timing of the various movements and events,"
"so perfectly synchronised over a vast area, in connection with the"
"uvalaku, I have tabulated them in the Chart, facing this page, in"
"which almost all the dates are quite exact, being based on my own"
"observations. This Chart also gives a clear, synoptic picture of an"
"uvalaku, and it will be useful to refer to it, in reading this Chapter."
"In olden days, not less than now, there must have been an ebullition"
"in the inter-tribal relations, and a great stirring from one place"
"to another, whenever an uvalaku Kula was afoot. Thus, news would"
"be carried rapidly over great distances, the movements of the vast"
"numbers of natives would be co-ordinated, and dates fixed. As has been"
"said already, a culminating event of an expedition, in this case the"
"arrival of the Dobuan fleet in Sinaketa, would be always so timed"
"as to happen on, or just before, a full moon, and this would serve"
"as a general orientation for the preliminary movements, such as in"
"this case, the visits of the single canoes."

"the custom of other snakes, he will not flee on hearing a footstep. When"
"anyone approaches he lies more still than ever, not even a movement of"
"his head betraying him. He is so like the colour of the ground, he hopes"
"he will be passed unseen; and he is slow and lethargic in his movements,"
"and so is easy to kill when once detected. As a Burman said, 'If he sees"
"you first, he kills you; if you see him first, you kill him.'"
In this district no Burman hesitates a moment in killing a viper when
he has the chance. Usually he has to do it in self-defence. This viper
"is terribly feared, as over a hundred persons a year die here by his"
bite. He is so hated and feared that he has become an outcast from the
law that protects all life.
"But with other snakes it is not so. There is the hamadryad, for"
"instance. He is a great snake about ten to fourteen feet long, and he is"
"the only snake that will attack you first. He is said always to do so,"
certainly he often does. One attacked me once when out quail-shooting.
He put up his great neck and head suddenly at a distance of only five or
"six feet, and was just preparing to strike, when I literally blew his"
head off with two charges of shot.
You would suppose he was vicious enough to be included with the
"Russell's viper in the category of the exceptions, but no. Perhaps he is"
too rare to excite such fierce and deadly hate as makes the Burman
"forget his law and kill the viper. However it may be, the Burman is not"
ready to kill the hamadryad. A few weeks ago a friend of mine and myself
came across two little Burman boys carrying a jar with a piece of broken
"tile over it. The lads kept lifting up the tile and peeping in, and then"
"putting the tile on again in a great hurry, and their actions excited"
"our curiosity. So we called them to come to us, and we looked into the"
jar. It was full of baby hamadryads. The lads had found a nest of them
"in the absence of the mother, who would have killed them if she had"
of intrusion by the beasts of the field.

In the typical Indian hut there is no furniture on the ground floor
"other than a rough hewn bench, a few pieces of pottery and gourds, iron"
"cooking vessels and what they call a kitchen, which is in fact a large"
"flat box with raised edges, about eight square feet in surface and about"
as high from the floor as a table. This is filled with sand and slabs of
"stone. In it a little fire is built of wood or charcoal, the stones laid"
about the fire support the pots and pans and cooking goes on as gaily as
"in any modern electric kitchen. The contrivance sounds primitive, but I"
have eaten a number of excellent meals cooked on just such an apparatus.
[Illustration: BANANA PLANT; NOTE SIZE OF MAN]
"Now it will be noticed that in all this habitation, sufficient for the"
"needs of an Indian, there is nothing except the iron pots and possibly"
"some pottery for which money was needed, and there are thousands of"
"families living in just this fashion in Panama today. True, luxury"
approaches in its insidious fashion and here and there you will see a
"$1.25 white iron bed on the main floor, real chairs, canned goods on the"
shelves and--final evidence of Indian prosperity!--a crayon portrait of
"the head of the family and a phonograph, of a make usually discarded at"
home. But when Miguel and Maria start out on the journey of life a
"machete, a gun and the good will of their neighbors who will lend them"
yams until their own planting begins to yield forms a quite sufficient
"capital on which to establish their family. Therefore, why work?"

A TYPICAL NATIVE HUT
"Carlist partisanship and military rank. Moreover, he had acquired, in"
"some unexplained way, a leathern Montera cap, a short many-buttoned"
"jacket, a flapped waistcoat of red plush, and leathern small-clothes of"
the same sort as those worn by La Giralda. Yet withal there remained
"something very remarkable about him. His great height, his angular"
"build, the grim humour of his mouth, the beady blackness of eyes which"
"twinkled with a fleck of fire in each, as a star might be reflected in a"
deep well on a moonless night--these all gave him a certain distinction
in a country of brick-dusty men of solemn exterior and rare speech.
"Also there was something indescribably daring about the man, his air and"
carriage. There was the swagger as of a famous _matador_ about the way
he carried himself. He gave a cock to his plain countryman's cap which
betokened one of a race at once quicker and more gay--more passionate
and more dangerous than the grave and dignified inhabitants of Old
Castile through whose country they were presently journeying.
"As Cardono and La Giralda departed out of the camp, the Sergeant driving"
before him a donkey which he had picked up the night before wandering by
"the wayside, El Sarria looked after them with a sardonic smile which"
"slowly melted from his face, leaving only the giant's usual placid good"
nature apparent on the surface. The mere knowledge that Dolóres was
alive and true to him seemed to have changed the hunted and desperate
outlaw almost beyond recognition.
"""Why do you smile, El Sarria?"" said Concha, who stood near by, as the"
"outlaw slowly rolled and lighted a _cigarrillo_. ""You do not love this"
"Sergeant. You do not think he is a man to be trusted?"""
"El Sarria shrugged his shoulders, and slowly exhaled the first long"
breathing of smoke through his nostrils.
"PHILLIPS, JOHN."
"A carpenter by trade, he sailed from the West Country for Newfoundland in"
a ship that was captured by the pirate Anstis in the _Good Fortune_.
"Phillips soon became reconciled to the life of a pirate, and, being a"
"brisk fellow, he was appointed carpenter to the ship. Returning to England"
"he soon found it necessary to quit the country again, and he shipped"
himself on board a vessel at Topsham for Newfoundland. On arriving at
"Peter Harbour he ran away, and hired himself as a splitter to the"
Newfoundland cod fishery.
"On the night of August 29th, 1723, with four others, he stole a vessel in"
the harbour and sailed away. Phillips was chosen captain. Articles were
"now drawn up and were sworn to upon a hatchet, because no Bible could be"
"found on board. Amongst other laws was the punishment of ""40 stripes"
"lacking one, known as Moses's law, to be afflicted for striking a"
"fellow-pirate."" The last law of the nine casts a curious light on these"
"murderers; it runs: ""If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that"
"Man that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer"
"present Death."" The pirates, fortified by these laws, met with instant"
"success, taking several fishing vessels, from which they augmented their"
small crew by the addition of several likely and brisk seamen. Amongst
these they had the good fortune to take prisoner an old pirate called John
"Rose Archer, who had served his pirate apprenticeship under the able"
"tuition of the famous Blackbeard, and who they at once promoted to be"
"quartermaster. This quick promotion caused trouble afterwards, for some of"
"the original crew, particularly carpenter Fern, resented it. The pirates"
"next sailed to Barbadoes, that happy hunting ground, but for three months"
"never a sail did they meet with, so that they were almost starving for"
"want of provisions, being reduced to a pound of dried meat a day amongst"
"woods yet, but a good beginning always means a lot, and he had no word"
to say against this start-off.
"Presently the various driving crews appeared, wet to the skin from the"
"waist down, and ravenously hungry. The drying racks were swiftly"
"steaming with the soggy garments, and the men fell to upon their supper"
without a second’s delay. There was little conversation--they were too
busy for that; but Bainbridge noticed with satisfaction that a certain
element of good-tempered raillery seemed to prevail. Evidently the crowd
as a whole bore no grudge against the man who had given them such a
"tongue-lashing that morning. In fact, if one could judge from their"
"manner toward their boss, they thought a lot more of him for having done"
so.
"Next day all hands did even better, and nightfall found them at the"
"inlet of Loon Lake, with the drive before them. Bob could not understand"
it. All day he had been expecting some disagreeable happening of a
nature to retard their progress which could be laid at the door of the
trust. When it did not come he was almost disappointed. It was
impossible to believe that Crane had given up so easily; he was not that
"sort. He would explode a bombshell of some sort soon, and the longer he"
delayed the more deadly was likely to be the nature of his attack.
"However, there was nothing to be gained in discounting the future, nor"
time to spare for fretting over the unknown. Bob was far too busy during
the daylight hours even to think of Crane or his satellites. It was a
ticklish job to get the drive across even so small a body of water as
"the so-called lake, and it took one entire day and the better part of"
"another. It was done without mishap, however, and Bainbridge was just"
congratulating himself on having got safely over one of the most
disagreeable bits of the entire distance when Jerry Calker approached
him as he stood watching the last few logs bob slowly out of the lake
"""Come with us,"" they cried; ""we are here for the greatest plunder ever"
"taken or dreamed of among the Romany----"""
"""Hush, I command you,"" cried the elder man. ""José Maria of Ronda this"
"man may be, but we are _Gitanos_ of the North, and need not a man from"
"Andalucia to lead us, even if he carry a scarlet cravat about his neck"
"for a credential!"""
The Sergeant nodded approval of this sentiment and addressed the old
"gipsy in deep Romany, to which he listened with respect, and answered in"
"a milder tone, shaking his head meanwhile."
"""I have indeed heard such sayings from my mother,"" he said, ""and I"
gather your meaning; but we _Gitanos_ of the North have mingled too much
with the outlander and the foreigner to have preserved the ancient
purity of speech. But in craft and deed I wot well we are to the full as
"good Roms as ever."""
By this time it was clear to the Sergeant that the old man was jealous
of his leadership; and as he himself was by no means desirous of taking
"part in a midnight raid against a plague-stricken town, he proceeded to"
"make it clear that, being on his way to his own country of Andalucia and"
had been led aside by the gipsy cryptograms he had observed by the
wayside and the casual greeting of the crook-backed imp of the village.
"Upon this the old man sat down beside Sergeant Cardono, or, as his new"
"friends knew him to be, José Maria the brigand. He did not talk about"
the intended attack as the Sergeant hoped he would. Being impressed by
"the greatness of his guest, he entered into a minute catalogue of the"
"captures he had made, the men he had slain as recorded on the butt of"
"his gun or the haft of his knife, and the cargoes he had successfully"
"severe. Master Bailey's assistance is next requisitioned, and him friend"
"Diccon cannot overreach. The whole truth coming out, Diccon is required"
to kneel and apologize. In doing so he gives Hodge a slap which elicits
"from that worthy a yell of pain. But it is a wholesome pang, for it"
finds the needle no further away than in the seat of Hodge's breeches.
If we compare this play with _Ralph Roister Doister_ three ideas will
"occur: first, that we have made no advance; second, that, in giving the"
"preference to rough country folk, the author has deliberately abandoned"
the higher standard of refinement in language and action set in Udall's
"major scenes; third, that whereas the earlier work bases its comedy on"
"character, educing the amusing scenes from the clash of vanity,"
"constancy and mischief, the later play relies for its comic effects on"
situations brought about by mischief alone. These are three rather heavy
counts against the younger rival. But in the other scale may be placed a
very fair claim to greater naturalness. Taking the scenes and characters
"in turn, mischief-maker, churchman and all, there is none so open to the"
"charge of being impossible, and therefore farcical, as the battle"
"between the forces of Ralph and Dame Custance, or the incredibly"
self-deceived Ralph himself. In accompanying Ralph through his
adventures we seem to be moving through a fantastic world in which Sir
"Andrew Aguecheek and Malvolio might feel at home; but with Dame Chat,"
Gammer Gurton and Hodge we feel the solid earth beneath our feet and
around us the strong air which nourished the peasantry and yeomen of
Tudor England.
The first extract is a verse from this comedy's one and famous song; the
"second is taken from Act I, Scene 4."

"I cannot eat but little meat,"
"prompted, she drew up a chair and prepared to pass the rest of the night"
in watching by his side.
For an hour or so he slept the sleep of unconsciousness. In the room not
"a sound could be heard, but outside the storm still roared and raged. It"
was anything but an easy or cheerful situation: Here she was alone with
"a wounded, if not dying, man; and she well knew that, unless there came"
"an abatement in the fury of the storm, it might be days before anyone"
"could climb the mountain. True, the Indians were not far off, but like"
as not they would remain in their wigwam until the sun came forth again.
"In the matter of food there was a scant supply, but probably enough to"
tide them over until communication could be had with The Polka.
"For three days she watched over him, and all the time the storm"
"continued. On the third day he became delirious, and that was the night"
of her torture. Despite a feeling that she was taking an unfair
"advantage of him, the Girl strained her ears to catch a name which, in"
"his delirium, was constantly on his lips; but she could not make it out."
"All that she knew was that it was not her name that he spoke, and it"
"pained her. She had given him absolute faith and trust and, already, she"
was overwhelmed with the fierce flames of jealousy. It was a new
"sensation, this being jealous of anyone, and it called forth a"
passionate resentment. In such moments she would rise and flee to the
other end of the room until the whispered endearments had ceased. Then
she would draw near again with flushes of shame on her cheeks for having
"heeded the sayings of an irresponsible person, and she would take his"
"head in her lap and, caressing him the while, would put cold towels on"
his heated brow.
"Dawn of the fourth day saw the Girl still pale and anxious, though"
despair had entirely left her; for the storm was over and colour and
speech had come back to the man early that morning. Love and good
lemon peel on the cocktail of creation—such is the bride. Holy is the
wife; revered the mother; galliptious is the summer girl—but the bride
is the certified check among the wedding presents that the gods send in
when man is married to mortality.
The car glided up the Golden Way. On the bridge of the great cruiser
"the captain stood, trumpeting the sights of the big city to his"
"passengers. Wide-mouthed and open-eared, they heard the sights of the"
"metropolis thundered forth to their eyes. Confused, delirious with"
"excitement and provincial longings, they tried to make ocular responses"
to the megaphonic ritual. In the solemn spires of spreading cathedrals
they saw the home of the Vanderbilts; in the busy bulk of the Grand
"Central depot they viewed, wonderingly, the frugal cot of Russell Sage."
"Bidden to observe the highlands of the Hudson, they gaped,"
"unsuspecting, at the upturned mountains of a new-laid sewer. To many"
"the elevated railroad was the Rialto, on the stations of which"
uniformed men sat and made chop suey of your tickets. And to this day
"in the outlying districts many have it that Chuck Connors, with his"
"hand on his heart, leads reform; and that but for the noble municipal"
"efforts of one Parkhurst, a district attorney, the notorious “Bishop”"
Potter gang would have destroyed law and order from the Bowery to the
Harlem River.
But I beg you to observe Mrs. James Williams—Hattie Chalmers that
"was—once the belle of Cloverdale. Pale-blue is the bride’s, if she"
will; and this colour she had honoured. Willingly had the moss rosebud
loaned to her cheeks of its pink—and as for the violet!—her eyes will
"do very well as they are, thank you. A useless strip of white chaf—oh,"
"no, he was guiding the auto car—of white chiffon—or perhaps it was"
"grenadine or tulle—was tied beneath her chin, pretending to hold her"
bonnet in place. But you know as well as I do that the hatpins did the
work.
Clyde--hours wherein she had come to know him more intimately and to
feel that he was growing to a truer understanding of herself. She
realized beyond all doubt that for him there was but one woman in all
"the world, yet the mere pleasure of being near him was an anodyne for"
"her secret distress. Womanlike, she took what was offered her and"
strove unceasingly for more.
"Two days after sighting _The Juliet_ they raised another ship, one of"
"the sailing fleet which they knew to be hovering in the offing, and"
then on the fifth of the month the capricious current opened a way for
them. Slowly at first they pushed on between the floes into a vast area
"of slush-ice, thence to a stretch as open and placid as a country"
"mill-pond. The lookout pointed a path out of this, into which they"
"steamed, coming at length to clear water, with the low shores of the"
mainland twenty miles away.
"At sundown they anchored in the wide estuary of the Kalvik River, the"
noisy rumble of their chains breaking the silence that for months had
lain like a smother upon the port. The Indian village gave sign of life
"only in thin, azure wisps of smoke that rose from the dirt roofs; the"
cannery buildings stood as naked and uninviting as when Boyd had last
seen them. The Greek cross crowning the little white church was gilded
by the evening sun. Through the glasses Cherry spied a figure in the
"door of her house which she declared was Constantine, but with"
commendable caution the big breed forebore to join the fleet of kyaks
"now rapidly mustering. Taking Clyde with them, she and Boyd were soon"
"on their way to the land, leaving George to begin discharging his"
cargo. The long voyage that had maddened the fishermen was at last at
"an end, and they were eager to begin their tasks."
"A three-mile pull brought the ship's boat to Cherry's landing, where"
"Constantine and Chakawana met them, the latter hysterical with joy, the"
went to one of these islands where many deer were to be found and set
"fire to the grass to drive them out of cover, shooting them as they came"
"out. Some deer, fleeing before the fire, swam across and escaped, others"
"fell victims, but one fawn, barely half grown, ran right down the"
"island, and in its blind terror it leaped into a boat at anchor there."
This boat was that of a fisherman who was plying his trade at some
"distance, and the only occupant of the boat was his wife. Now this woman"
"had a year or so before lost her son, very much loved by her, but who"
"was not quite of the best character, and when she saw the deer leaping"
"into the boat, she at once fancied that she saw the soul of her erring"
son looking at her out of its great terrified eyes. So she got up and
"took the poor panting beast in her arms and soothed it, and when the"
"hunters came running to her to claim it she refused. 'He is my son,' she"
"said, 'he is mine. Shall I give him up to death?' The hunters clamoured"
"and threatened to take the deer by force, but the woman was quite firm."
"She would never give him up except with her life. 'You can see,' she"
"said, 'that it is true that he is my son. He came running straight to"
"me, as he always did in his trouble when he was a boy, and he is now"
"quite quiet and contented, instead of being afraid of me as an ordinary"
"deer would be.' And it was quite true that the deer took to her at once,"
and remained with her willingly. So the hunters went off to the court of
the governor and filed a suit for the deer.
"The case was tried in open court, and the deer was produced with a"
ribbon round its neck. Evidence there was naturally but little. The
hunters claimed the deer because they had driven it out of the island by
their fire. The woman resisted the claim on the ground that it was her
son.
The decision of the court was this:
'The hunters are not entitled to the deer because they cannot prove that
"a certain district in the South-East, abutting on to the frontiers"
"of Afghanistan and of Baluchistan, and known as the Sarhad, which is"
occupied by a number of nomad tribes who claim absolute independence.
At this time these tribes were causing considerable embarrassment and
difficulty to the Indian Government.
"The Germans and their agents, who were past masters in the art of"
"propaganda, were still endeavouring, as they had done for years"
"before the outbreak of hostilities, to work upon the discontented"
portion of the Indian population in the hope of rousing them into
"open rebellion. They believed this to be quite possible, in spite of"
the magnificent way in which India had offered her resources of men
"and money to the British Raj, and hoped thereby to handicap us still"
further in our great struggle in the West.
"They were pouring their agents, with their lying propaganda, into"
"India via Persia and Afghanistan. Afghanistan, like Persia, was"
"nominally neutral, but she was breaking her neutrality by many open"
"acts of aggression, and was offering every facility in her power"
"to the German agents in their passage through her territories, and"
thence into the Punjab.
"To reach Afghanistan, however, the German agents had to pass through"
some part of Persia. The Persian Government placed no restrictions on
"the movements of either British or Germans, of which fact the latter"
took full advantage.
A glance at the map will show that apparently the easiest route for
"them to take across Persia was in the North, in the Russian sphere of"
"influence, and to approach Afghanistan through Korasan; or, failing"
"this, by a route rather farther South, across the Lut Desert, in the"
direction of Birjand. As a matter of fact they had tried both these
"that a fervent Buddhist will not kill even a fish, but a fisherman is"
not quite such a reprobate as a hunter in popular estimation. And the
"Nats think so too, for the Nat of a pool will not forbid all fishing."
"You must give him his share; you must be respectful to him, and not"
"offend him; and then he will fill your nets with gleaming fish, and all"
"will go well with you. If not, of course, you will come to grief; your"
"nets will be torn, and your boat upset; and finally, if obstinate, you"
"will be drowned. A great arm will seize you, and you will be pulled"
under and disappear for ever.
A Nat is much like a human being; if you treat him well he will treat
"you well, and conversely. Courtesy is never wasted on men or Nats, at"
"least, so a Burman tells me."
The highest Nats live in the mountains. The higher the Nat the higher
"the mountain; and when you get to a very high peak indeed, like"
"Mainthong Peak in Wuntho, you encounter very powerful Nats."
"They tell a story of Mainthong Peak and the Nats there, how all of a"
"sudden, one day in 1885, strange noises came from the hill. High up on"
his mighty side was heard the sound of great guns firing slowly and
"continuously; there was the thunder of falling rocks, cries as of"
"someone bewailing a terrible calamity, and voices calling from the"
precipices. The people living in their little hamlets about his feet
were terrified. Something they knew had happened of most dire import to
"them, some catastrophe which they were powerless to prevent, which they"
could not even guess. But when a few weeks later there came even into
"those remote villages the news of the fall of Mandalay, of the surrender"
"of the king, of the 'great treachery,' they knew that this was what the"
Nats had been sorrowing over. All the Nats everywhere seem to have been
"distressed at our arrival, to hate our presence, and to earnestly desire"
"our absence. They are the spirits of the country and of the people, and"
"monthly, which arose fairly directly out of erudite correspondence. It"
"was, as in antiquity--which in this respect was imitated better and more"
"profitably, perhaps, than in any other sphere--an art. Even before 1500"
"Erasmus had, at Paris, described that art in the treatise, _De"
"conscribendis epistolis_, which was to appear in print in 1522. People"
"wrote, as a rule, with a view to later publication, for a wider circle,"
"or at any rate, with the certainty that the recipient would show the"
"letter to others. A fine Latin letter was a gem, which a man envied his"
neighbour. Erasmus writes to Budaeus: 'Tunstall has devoured your letter
to me and re-read it as many as three or four times; I had literally to
tear it from his hands.'
Unfortunately fate did not always take into consideration the author's
"intentions as to publicity, semi-publicity or strict secrecy. Often"
"letters passed through many hands before reaching their destination, as"
did Servatius's letter to Erasmus in 1514. 'Do be careful about
"letters,' he writes more than once; 'waylayers are on the lookout to"
"intercept them.' Yet, with the curious precipitation that characterizes"
"him, Erasmus was often very careless as to what he wrote. From an early"
"age he preserved and cared for his letters, yet nevertheless, through"
"his itinerant life, many were lost. He could not control their"
publication. As early as 1509 a friend sent him a manuscript volume of
"his own (Erasmus's) letters, that he had picked up for sale at Rome."
Erasmus had it burnt at once. Since 1515 he himself superintended the
publication of his letters; at first only a few important ones;
"afterwards in 1516 a selection of letters from friends to him, and after"
"that ever larger collections till, at the end of his life, there"
appeared a new collection almost every year. No article was so much in
"demand on the book market as letters by Erasmus, and no wonder. They"
"were models of excellent style, tasteful Latin, witty expression and"
elegant erudition.
"kaloma!"" She looked closer, and said: ""Oh no, you are not red. Your"
"name is momoka."" She took then the stick with the kaloma discs and"
"thrust it into a hole of the reef. It stood there, but when she looked"
"at it, she said: ""Oh, the people from inland would come and see you"
"and pluck you off."" She went, she pulled out the stick; she went into"
"a canoe, and she paddled. She paddled out into the sea. She anchored"
"there, pulled the discs off the stick, and she threw them into the"
"sea so that they might come into the coral outcrop. She said: ""It"
is forbidden that the inland natives should take the valuables. The
"people of Sinaketa only must dive."" Thus only the Sinaketa people"
"know the magic, and how to dive."
This myth presents certain remarkable characteristics. I shall not
"enter into its sociology, though it differs in that respect from"
"the Kiriwinian myths, in which the equality of the Sinaketan and the"
Gumilababan chiefs with those of Omarakana is not acknowledged. It is
characteristic that the Malasi woman in this myth shows an aversion to
"the dog, the totem animal of the Lukuba clan, a clan which according"
to mythical and historical data had to recede before and yield its
"priority to the Malasi (compare Chapter XII, Division IV). Another"
"detail of interest is that she brings the kaloma on their sticks,"
"as they appear in the final stage of manufacturing. In this form,"
"also, she tries to plant them on the reef. The finished kaloma,"
"however, to use the words of one of my informants, ""looked at her,"
"the water swinging it to and fro; flashing its red eyes."" And the"
"woman, seeing it, pulls out the too accessible and too inviting"
kaloma and scatters them over the deep sea. Thus she makes them
"inaccessible to the uninitiated inland villagers, and monopolises them"
for Sinaketa. There can be no doubt that the villages of Vakuta have
learnt this industry from the Sinaketans. The myth is hardly known in
"Vakuta, only a few are experts in diving and manufacturing; there is"
a tradition about a late transference of this industry there; finally
scientist to-day would say of the Resurrection of Jesus on which
"ultimately depends His claims to our adoration, “_That could not"
happen_.” We know enough now of the laws of the Universe to know that
we do not know them all.
So some of us perceive that what is needed to-day is to arrest the
"attention of the man in the street, to get him to perceive that"
"Christianity has much more to say for itself than he suspected, and"
that Christian Philosophy will place in his hand a clue which will
guide him in the labyrinth of life.
“I say the acknowledgment of God in Christ
"Accepted by thy reason, solves for thee"
All questions in the earth and out of it.”
We must set men free from phrases and get them to think. It suits the
game of the party politician to pretend that ethics are easily
"self-evident, and that there is a simple fundamental religion on which"
all men are agreed; but there is a question which must be insistently
"urged, and upon the answer to which all things depend, “What think ye"
of Christ?”
Probably nothing has done more to alienate the man in the street from
religious observance than the hypocritical pretence that all men are
agreed about “simple Bible teaching.” He knows well enough that what
really matters is whether a man believes or not that God became man.
If ever the Labour Party should definitely declare for elementary
education without religious teaching it will be because the men whose
children attend the elementary schools know that they cannot read the
"New Testament without asking, “Is it true?”"
“Did Jesus Christ really die and rise again the third day according to
to be the case.
Grey had a faint misgiving at the first that no manager might be
forthcoming to admit the dialogue to his boards; but there the old actor
knew his ground.  He succeeded in inviting two of the most successful
"managers to listen to a performance in the attic, without the"
accessories which would add much to the effect upon the stage; and even
"so the scene proved so telling, the acting of the Old Lion was so superb"
"in its quiet dignity, and Grey (who had learned and studied patiently"
"and diligently) went through his part with such spirit, such power, such"
"dramatic energy, that even his instructor was surprised at his success,"
and the managers exchanged glances of astonishment and pleasure.
It was just the sort of piece to catch the public favour at this
"juncture.  Marlborough was still the idol of the nation, and might be"
expected home some time before the winter closed—perhaps before
"Christmas itself.  The nation was discussing how to do him honour, and"
would flock to see a piece wherein his praises were so ably sung.
"""With a wig such as the Duke wears, and with military dress, Mr. Grey"
"could be made to look the very image of the great General,"" cried one."
"""He has something the same class of face—handsome, regular features,"
grace of action and bearing. He does but want to be transformed from
"fair to dark, and his acting of the Duke will bring down veritable"
"thunders of applause from all."""
"And then began a gratifying rivalry as to terms, in which the Old Lion"
sustained his part with dignity and firmness.  Both managers desired to
"secure this interlude for their respective theatres, and at the last it"
was settled that the performance was to be given two nights a week at
"Drury Lane, and two at Sadler’s Wells, the astute old actor retaining"
living creatures is all his own. And here I may mention a very curious
"contrast, that whereas in India the Hindu will not take life and the"
"Mussulman will, yet the Mussulman is by reputation far kinder to his"
beasts than the Hindu. Here the Burman combines both qualities. He has
"all the kindness to animals that the Mahommedan has, and more, and he"
has the same horror of taking life that the Hindu has.
"Coming from half-starved, over-driven India, it is a revelation to see"
the animals in Burma. The village ponies and cattle and dogs in India
"are enough to make the heart bleed for their sordid misery, but in Burma"
"they are a delight to the eye. They are all fat, every one of them--fat"
and comfortable and impertinent; even the ownerless dogs are well fed. I
suppose the indifference of the ordinary native of India to animal
"suffering comes from the evil of his own lot. He is so very poor, he has"
"such hard work to find enough for himself and his children, that his"
sympathy is all used up. He has none to spare. He is driven into a dumb
"heartlessness, for I do not think he is actually cruel."
The Burman is full of the greatest sympathy towards animals of all
"kinds, of the greatest understanding of their ways, of the most"
humorously good-natured attitude towards them. Looking at them from his
"manhood, he has no contempt for them; but the gentle toleration of a"
"father to very little children who are stupid and troublesome often, but"
are very lovable. He feels himself so far above them that he can
"condescend towards them, and forbear with them."
His ponies are pictures of fatness and impertinence and go. They never
have any vice because the Burman is never cruel to them; they are never
"well trained, partly because he does not know how to train them, partly"
because they are so near the aboriginal wild pony as to be incapable of
"very much training. But they are willing; they will go for ever, and"
"are very strong, and they have admirable constitutions and tempers. You"
As teachers and workers it is an incontestable fact that Indian officers
"have distinguished themselves very highly, and anything which"
discriminates between Europeans and Indians in the way of pay and
prospects is most undesirable. A sense of injustice is ill-calculated to
bring about that harmony which is so necessary among all the members of
"an educational institution, professors and students alike."
"83, 632 (VIII) _Relations of the service with the Indian Civil Service"
and with other services._--As regards the relations with the Indian
"Civil Service, I am under the impression that they are somewhat"
"strained, but of this I have no personal experience."
"83, 633 (IX) _Other points._--I have endeavoured to give my opinion on"
the definite questions which have been asked. There is another aspect of
"educational work in India which I think of the highest importance,"
though I am not exactly sure whether it falls within the terms of
reference to the Royal Commission. I think that all the machinery to
improve the higher education in India would be altogether ineffectual
unless India enters the world movement for the advancement of knowledge.
And for this it is absolutely necessary to touch the imagination of the
people so as to rouse them to give their best energies to the work of
"research and discovery, in which all the nations of the world are now"
engaged. To aim at anything less will only end in a lifeless and
mechanical system from which the soul of reality has passed away. On
"this subject I could have said much, but I will confine myself to one"
point which I think at the present juncture to be of importance. The
Government of Bengal has been foremost in a tentative way in encouraging
research. What is necessary is the extension and continuity of this
enlightened policy.
"83, 634. _Supplementary Note._--I would like to add a few remarks to"
"make the meaning of paragraphs 83, 627 and 83, 631 in my note more"
room.
"When Grey awoke next morning, the sun was shining; a frugal but"
sufficient meal was spread upon the table; a fire was blazing cheerily
"upon the hearth; and there was the Old Lion, with his manuscript before"
"him, muttering beneath his breath, and throwing out his hand in telling"
"gesture, making so fine a picture with his leonine face and shaggy mane"
of hair that Grey watched him awhile in silence before advancing.
"""Good-morrow, and welcome to you, my son,"" was the greeting be received."
"""I have had a beautiful night.  The muse was hot upon me.  The rounded"
periods seemed to flow from my pen without effort. Let us to breakfast
"first; then shall you read what I have written, and together we will"
"amend it, if need be.  But first shall you remove hither from that"
unsavoury lodging of which you did speak. Here is money: pay your
"reckoning, and bring hither any goods and chattels you may value.  We"
"must dwell together these next weeks.  We will work hard, and before the"
week closes I will have some manager here to listen to our rendering of
this scene.  We will have the world crowding to see and hear us
"yet!—King Fortune, I salute thee, and I thank thee from my heart that"
"thou didst send this goodly youth to me, and didst prompt my heart from"
"the first to take note of him and seek his friendship."""
"The removal of Grey’s simple belongings took but little time, and lucky"
did he feel himself to be able to call this comfortable abode his home.
A small attic upon the same floor of the house made him a sleeping
"chamber at very small cost, and his days were spent in the sunny south"
"garret, which was called the Lion’s Den; and there they studied, and"
"wrote, and rehearsed this eulogy upon the Duke, and the prowess of the"
"English arms, the old man introducing here and there allusions and"
"innuendoes which Grey scarcely understood, but which Wylde declared"
"would bring down thunders of applause from the house—as, indeed, proved"
"short, people of all classes of society, to find their national and"
favorite devotions in it. As a matter of fact no other Anatolian god could
maintain his independence side by side with the deities of Pessinus.[24]
We do not know the internal development of the {61} Phrygian mysteries
sufficiently to give details of the addition of each individual part. But
we can prove that in the course of time certain religions were added to the
one that had been practised in the temple of the Palatine ever since the
republic.
"In the inscriptions of the fourth century, Attis bears the cognomen of"
_menotyrannus_. At that time this name was undoubtedly understood to mean
"""lord of the months,"" because Attis represented the sun who entered a new"
sign of the zodiac every month.[25] But that was not the original meaning
"of the term. ""_Mèn tyrannus_"" appears with quite a different meaning in"
"many inscriptions found in Asia Minor. _Tyrannos_ ([Greek: Turannos]),"
"""lord,"" is a word taken by the Greeks from the Lydian, and the honorable"
"title of ""tyrant"" was given to Mèn, an old barbarian divinity worshiped by"
all Phrygia and surrounding regions.[26] The Anatolian tribes from Caria to
the remotest mountains of Pontus worshiped a lunar god under that name who
"was supposed to rule not only the heavens but also the underworld, because"
the moon was frequently brought into connection with the somber kingdom of
the dead. The growth of plants and the increase of cattle and poultry were
"ascribed to his celestial influence, and the villagers invoked his"
protection for their farms and their district. They also placed their rural
burial grounds under the safeguard of this king of shadows. No god enjoyed
greater popularity in the country districts.
This powerful divinity penetrated into Greece at an early period. Among the
"mixed populations of the Ægean seaports, in the Piræus, at Rhodes, Delos"
"and Thasos, religious associations for his worship were {62} founded. In"
"Attica the presence of the cult can be traced back to the fourth century,"
"to send her away. But the girl pleaded and cried, until at last she was"
allowed to remain.
"After a time the foster-mother wanted to take another journey, and she"
"forbade the girl, above all, to go into the two rooms which, as yet, she"
had not entered. And the girl promised her that this time she would obey
"her. But when she had been alone for some time, and had had all sorts"
"of thoughts as to what there might be in the second room, she could no"
longer resist opening the second door a little way--and swish! out flew
"the moon. When the foster-mother returned, and saw the moon had slipped"
"out, she again grieved greatly, and told the girl she could keep her no"
"longer, and that now she must go. But when the girl again began to cry"
"bitterly, and pleaded with such grace that it was impossible to deny"
"her, she was once more allowed to remain."
"After this the foster-mother wished to take another journey, and she"
"told the girl, who was now more than half-grown, that she must take"
"her request not to go, or even so much as peep into the third room,"
seriously to heart. But when the foster-mother had been away for some
"time, and the girl was all alone and bored, she could at last resist no"
"longer. ""O,"" thought she, ""how pleasant it would be to take a peep into"
"that third room!"" It is true, that at first she thought she would not do"
"it, because of her foster-mother; yet when the thought returned to her,"
"she could not hold back, after all; but decided that she should and"
must by all means take a peep. So she opened the door the least little
"bit--and swish! out flew the sun. When the foster-mother then returned,"
"and saw that the sun had flown out, she grieved greatly, and told"
the girl that now she could positively stay with her no longer. The
foster-daughter cried and pleaded even more touchingly than before; but
"all to no avail. ""No, I must now punish you,"" said the foster-mother."
"""But you shall have your choice of either becoming the most beautiful"
"of all maidens, without the power of speech, or the most homely, yet"
Some days after this a strange report was brought to the palace. By the
landing-place near the spot where the fire had been was a great
"fig-tree. It was so near to the landing-place, and was such a"
"magnificent tree, that travellers coming from the boats, or waiting for"
"a boat to arrive, would rest in numbers under its shade. But the report"
said that something had happened there. To travellers sleeping beneath
"the tree at night it was stated that two Nats had appeared, very large"
"and very beautiful, a man Nat and a woman Nat, and had frightened them"
"very much indeed. Noises were heard in the tree, voices and cries, and a"
"strange terror came upon those who approached it. Nay, it was even said"
"that men had been struck by unseen hands and severely hurt, and others,"
"it was said, had disappeared. Children who went to play under the tree"
"were never seen again: the Nats took them, and their parents sought for"
"them in vain. So the landing-place was deserted, and a petition was"
"brought to the king, and the king gave orders that the tree should be"
"hewn down. So the tree was cut down, and its trunk was thrown into the"
"river; it floated away out of sight, and nothing happened to the men"
"who cut the tree, though they were deadly afraid."
"The tree floated down for days, until at last it stranded near a"
"landing-place that led to a large town, where the governor of these"
parts lived; and at this landing-place the portents that had frightened
the people at the great city reappeared and terrified the travellers
"here too, and they petitioned the governor."
"The governor sought out a great monk, a very holy man learned in these"
"matters, and sent him to inquire, and the monk came down to the tree and"
"spoke. He said that if any Nats lived in the tree, they should speak to"
"him and tell him what they wanted. 'It is not fit,' he said, 'for great"
Nats to terrify the poor villagers at the landing-place. Let the Nats
speak and say what they require. All that they want shall be given.' And
the Nats spake and said that they wanted a place to live in where they
publicity given to Indian affairs through the reports and hearings of a
"National Commission, would arouse the American people, and a brighter"
day for the Indian would certainly dawn.
"No matter what is said, the Commissioner must fight alone and"
single-handed with the members of Congress. His is a great
"responsibility. Both Mr. Leupp and Mr. Valentine, in conversations with"
"me, have admitted that the chief difficulty in handling the Indian"
problem is found in the word “politics”. The Commissioner is dependent
on Congress for his appropriations. He may be sustained or opposed by
"members of Congress, and the public will remain in ignorance. He may not"
appeal save to the Secretary of the Interior. He must keep in mind the
wishes of his political party. He will not admit political pressure when
"in office, but after leaving the Service, he may tell his story of"
"trouble with politicians, as Mr. Leupp has in his book. Mr. Valentine"
"could enlighten us further on “The Indian Office in Politics”, did he"
care to speak. A paid National Commission would be dominated by _no_
political party. Ten years’ service would enable it to become entirely
"familiar with the needs of the Indians, whereas the average"
"Commissioner, serving less than three years, barely becomes acquainted"
with the problem when he is succeeded by a new appointee.
I recommend to the earnest consideration of the American people the
"Commission idea, as the only means of salvation of the American Indian."
It will be said by critics that many of the tribes are making
satisfactory progress and need no Commission; that the present
"organization of the Indian Office is sufficient. This is partly true,"
"but a study of the table of statistics, and reference to the testimony"
"submitted in this book, establishes the sad fact, that the majority of"
the Indians must lose unless we make a radical change in our policy. It
is useless to blind our eyes to hard facts; and these are that we
"develop a certain area after painstaking labor, and then through unwise"
"disturbed or destroyed, with the same result.]"

elongated shape of the stomach or intestine; but such a supposition is

"sensations arising from the bladder, and here also it may be said that we"
"are concerned with a fish-like viscus. Greenwood (_Imagination in Dreams_,"

"the warehouse districts, and men ceased to venture there alone after"

One circumstance caused Boyd no little surprise and uneasiness--the
fact that no vigorous effort had been made to fix the blame for the
"striker's death on that riotous afternoon. Surely, he reasoned, Marsh's"
"detective must have witnessed the killing, and must recognize the ease"
with which the act could now be saddled upon him. If delay were their
"object, Emerson could not understand why they did not seek to have him"
arrested. The consequences might well be serious if Marsh's money were
"used; but, as the days slipped past and nothing occurred, he decided"
"that he had been overfearful on this score, or else that the manager of"
the Packers' Trust had limits beyond which he would not push his
persecution.
"A half-mile from Captain Peasley's ship, the rival Company tenders were"
"loading rapidly with union labor, and it seemed that in spite of Boyd's"
"plan to be first at Kalvik, Marsh's force would beat him to the ground"
unless greater efforts were made. When he communicated these fears to
"Big George, the fisherman suddenly became a slave-driver. He passed"
"among his men, cajoling, threatening, bribing, and they began to work"
"like demons, with the result that when the twentieth arrived he was"
able to announce to his partner that the work would be finished some
time during the following morning.
The next day Emerson and Clyde drove down to the dock with Cherry in a
"closed carriage, experiencing no annoyance beyond some jeers and"
insults as they passed through the picket line. Boyd had barely seen
"them comfortably established on board, when up the ship's gangway came"
"""Fingerless"" Fraser radiantly attired, three heavily laden hotel"
"porters groaning at his back, the customary thick-waisted cigar between"
fountains. In the church which has been built over them we were shown
"the pillar to which he was bound, and the block of marble upon which"
"he was decapitated, and, in the vault of another church hard by, the"
prison in which he was placed just before his execution.
We could not help asking the priest who was our escort whether this
"extraordinary story was still believed. His answer was: ""Certainly!"
There is no reason whatever to doubt it. The facts have been handed
"down in an unbroken succession from eye-witnesses,"" a position which"
he proceeded to defend at length and with great warmth when one of our
party in particular manifested much slowness to believe.
[Sidenote: St. Paul's Use of Plautilla's Veil.]
"Furthermore, the opening of these three fountains was not the only"
miracle wrought by the apostle after his death. Mrs. Jameson says:
"""The legend of his death relates that a certain Roman matron named"
"Plautilla, one of the converts of S. Peter, placed herself on the road"
"by which S. Paul passed to his martyrdom, to behold him for the last"
time; and when she saw him she wept greatly and besought his blessing.
"The apostle then, seeing her faith, turned to her, and begged that she"
"would give him her veil to blind his eyes when he should be beheaded,"
promising to return it to her after his death. The attendants mocked
"at such a promise; but Plautilla, with a woman's faith and charity,"
"taking off her veil, presented it to him. After his martyrdom, S. Paul"
"appeared to her and restored the veil, stained with his blood. In the"
"ancient representations of the martyrdom of S. Paul, the legend of"
Plautilla is seldom omitted. In the picture by Giotto in the Sacristy
"of S. Peter's, Plautilla is seen on an eminence in the background,"
"receiving the veil from the hands of S. Paul, who appears in the"
"clouds above; the same representation, but little varied, is executed"
"in bas-relief on the bronze doors of St. Peter's."""
they cannot abide a foreign domination.
"But the greatest place for Nats is the Popa Mountain, which is an"
extinct volcano standing all alone about midway between the river and
"the Shan Mountains. It is thus very conspicuous, having no hills near it"
"to share its majesty; and being in sight from many of the old capitals,"
it is very well known in history and legend. It is covered with dense
"forest, and the villages close about are few. At the top there is a"
"crater with a broken side, and a stream comes flowing out of this break"
"down the mountain. Probably it was the denseness of its forests, the"
"abundance of water, and its central position, more than its guardian"
"Nats, that made it for so many years the last retreating-place of the"
"half-robber, half-patriot bands that made life so uneasy for us. But the"
Nats of Popa Mountains are very famous.
When any foreigner was taken into the service of the King of Burma he
"had to swear an oath of fidelity. He swore upon many things, and among"
them were included 'all the Nats in Popa.' No Burman would have dared to
"break an oath sworn in such a serious way as this, and they did not"
imagine that anyone else would. It was and is a very dangerous thing to
"offend the Popa Nats; for they are still there in the mountain, and"
everyone who goes there must do them reverence.
"A friend of mine, a police officer, who was engaged in trying to catch"
"the last of the robber chiefs who hid near Popa, told me that when he"
"went up the mountain shooting he, too, had to make offerings. Some way"
"up there is a little valley dark with overhanging trees, and a stream"
"flows slowly along it. It is an enchanted valley, and if you look"
"closely you will see that the stream is not as other streams, for it"
flows uphill. It comes rushing into the valley with a great display of
"foam and froth, and it leaves in a similar way, tearing down the rocks,"
and behaving like any other boisterous hill rivulet; but in the valley
mainly upon his fists. Blows were rained upon him from unguarded
"quarters, he was kicked, battered, and flung about, his blind instinct"
finally leading him to clinch with whomsoever his hands encountered.
"Then a sudden blackness swallowed him up, after which he found himself"
"upon his knees, his arms loosely encircling a pair of legs, and"
realized that he had been half-stunned by a blow from behind. The legs
"he was clutching tried to kick him loose, at which he summoned all his"
"strength, knowing that he must go down no further; but as he struggled"
"upward, something smote him in the side with sickening force, and he"
went to his knees again.
"Close beside him he saw the club he had dropped, and endeavored to"
"reach it; but before he could do so, a hand snatched it away and he"
"heard a voice cursing above him. A second time he tried to rise, but"
his shocked nerves failed to transmit the impulse to his muscles; he
could only raise his shoulder and fling an arm weakly above his head in
anticipation of the crushing blow he knew was coming. But it did not
"descend, Instead, he heard a gun shot--that sound for which his ears"
had been strained from the first--and then for an instant he wondered
"if it had been directed at himself. A weight sank across his calves,"
"the legs he had been holding broke away from his grasp; then, with a"
"final effort, he pulled himself free and staggered to his feet, his"
"head rocking, his knees sagging. He saw a man's figure facing him, and"
"lunged at it, to bring up in the arms of ""Fingerless"" Fraser, who cried"
sharply:
"""Are you hurt, Bo?"""
"Too dazed to answer, he turned and beheld the body of a man stretched"
"face downward on the floor. Beyond, the fellow in the gray suit was"
disappearing into the crowd. Even yet Boyd did not realize whence the
"shot had come, although the smell of powder was sharp in his nostrils."
"first holiday which she had known since August, 1914. She always seems"
to travel with fewer restrictions and at greater speed than any except
Prime Ministers and commanding Generals. In Italy she is an Italian and
in France a Frenchwoman--a dazzling Italian and a very winning
Frenchwoman. The police of both countries make smooth her path with
their humble bodies upon which Madame is graciously pleased to trample.
"""I never trouble much about passports or credentials,"" says she, ""though"
I carry them just as I do my .25 automatic pistol; in practice I find
that I need draw my papers as rarely as I draw my gun. Most of the
"police and officials who have seen me once know me when I come again,"
"and rush to my assistance."" She is never grateful for service. I do not"
believe she knows the sentiment of gratitude. A poor man renders her aid
"in defiance of regulations, and maybe at the risk of his neck; she"
"smiles upon him, and the debt is instantly discharged. He is dismissed"
until perchance Madame may again have occasion for his devotion. Then
she reveals the royal accomplishment of never forgetting a face. Imagine
"a harassed, weary _chef du train_, before whose official unseeing eyes"
"travellers flit like figures on a cinema screen, imagine such a one"
addressed by name and rank by the most beautiful and gracious of mortal
"women, by a woman who remembers all those little family confidences"
"which he had poured into her sympathetic ears some twelve months before,"
by a woman who enquires sweetly after his good wife--using her pet
name--laments that the brave son--also accurately named--is still
missing beyond those impenetrable Boche lines. Will not the _chef du
"train_, cooed over thus and softly patted as one pats butter, break"
every French rule the most iron-bound to speed Madame upon her way? Of
"course he will. In war time, as in peace time, that is the royal manner"
of Madame Gilbert. She does not travel; she makes a progress.

admitted to this school to be educated at the charges of the King of
"France (April, 1779). He was now, at the tender age of nine, a"
"stranger in a strange land, among a people whom he detested as the"
"oppressors of his countrymen. Worst of all, he had to endure the taunt"
of belonging to a subject race. What a position for a proud and
exacting child! Little wonder that the official report represented him
"as silent and obstinate; but, strange to say, it added the word"
"""imperious."" It was a tough character which could defy repression"
"amidst such surroundings. As to his studies, little need be said. In"
his French history he read of the glories of the distant past (when
"""Germany was part of the French Empire""), the splendours of the reign"
"of Louis XIV., the disasters of France in the Seven Years' War, and"
"the ""prodigious conquests of the English in India."" But his"
imagination was kindled from other sources. Boys of pronounced
character have always owed far more to their private reading than to
"their set studies; and the young Buonaparte, while grudgingly learning"
"Latin and French grammar, was feeding his mind on Plutarch's"
"""Lives""--in a French translation. The artful intermingling of the"
"actual and the romantic, the historic and the personal, in those vivid"
"sketches of ancient worthies and heroes, has endeared them to many"
minds. Rousseau derived unceasing profit from their perusal; and
"Madame Roland found in them ""the pasture of great souls."" It was so"
with the lonely Corsican youth. Holding aloof from his comrades in
"gloomy isolation, he caught in the exploits of Greeks and Romans a"
distant echo of the tragic romance of his beloved island home. The
librarian of the school asserted that even then the young soldier had
modelled his future career on that of the heroes of antiquity; and we
"may well believe that, in reading of the exploits of Leonidas,"
"Curtius, and Cincinnatus, he saw the figure of his own antique"
"republican hero, Paoli. To fight side by side with Paoli against the"
"French was his constant dream. ""Paoli will return,"" he once exclaimed,"
"""and as soon as I have strength, I will go to help him: and perhaps"
"though he could not read it then and there, he could see, by casting his"
"eyes over it, that there were many very fine periods in it, and that it"
"was filled with descriptive passages of some great battle, and the"
energy and glory of the General in command. He raised his eyes
"inquiringly to the impassioned face of the author, which was working"
with excitement.
"""See you not something of the form?  It is a dramatic interlude.  It"
should be played upon the stage during the intervals of the play.  Time
"sits aloft, aged and grim, his scythe in his hand, his hour-glass beside"
"him, and he speaks of the decay of mankind—that the world’s greatness is"
"vanishing, its men of genius growing ever fewer and fewer.  That is my"
part.  I take the _rôle_ of Time.  To him then enters one in the guise
of youth—one in the flush of manhood’s prime—one who has seen great and
"doughty deeds, and comes to rehearse the same in the ears of old Time,"
"to bid him change his tune, to tell him that giants yet live upon the"
earth.  This youth comes with songs of victory; he speaks of what he has
seen; he describes in burning words and glowing colours that last great
fight wherein England’s General put to flight the hosts of the haughty
monarch of France.  For months has this been written; for months have I
gone about seeking the man to take the part of youth and manhood. But I
have sought in vain.  All those whom I would have chosen have other work
"to do, and did but laugh at me.  Those who would gladly do my bidding, I"
"will none of.  You saw how they did mouth and rant to-night, thinking to"
"show their talent, when they only displayed their imbecile folly. But"
here have I found the very man for whom I have long waited.  You have
"youth, beauty—that manly beauty which transcends, to my thinking, the"
ephemeral loveliness of woman; you have the gift; you have seen the
"great hero: you have caught the very trick of his words and speech.  Oh,"
"I know it!  Once did I hear him address the House of Lords, and when you"
spoke I seemed to see and hear him again.  The great world of fashion
will go mad over you.  We shall draw full houses; we shall succeed.  I

"To and fro,--to and fro,--gravely persistent, sublimely eloquent, the"
"huge, sustained, and heavy monotone went thudding through the"
"stillness,--till, startled from his profound sleep by such loud, lofty,"
"and incessant clangor, Alwyn turned on his pillow and listened,"
"half-aroused, half-bewildered,--then, remembering where he was, he"
understood; it was the great Bell of the Dom pealing forth its first
"summons to the earliest Mass. He lay quiet for a little while, dreamily"
counting the number of reverberations each separate stroke sent
"quivering on the air,--but presently, finding it impossible to sleep"
"again, he got up, and drawing aside the curtain looked out of the"
"window of his room, which fronted on the Platz. Though it was not yet"
"six o'clock, the city was all astir,--the Rhinelanders are an early"
"working people, and to see the sun rise is not with them a mere fiction"
"of poesy, but a daily fact. It was one of the loveliest of lovely"
"spring mornings--the sky was clear as a pale, polished sapphire, and"
every little bib of delicate carving and sculpture on the Dom stood out
from its groundwork with microscopically beautiful distinctness. And as
"his gaze rested on the perfect fairness of the day, a strange and"
"sudden sense of rapturous anticipation possessed his mind,--he felt as"
"one prepared for some high and exquisite happiness,--some great and"
"wondrous celebration or feast of joy! The thoughts of death, on which"
"he had brooded so persistently during the past yester-eve, had fled,"
"leaving no trace behind,--only a keen and vigorous delight in life"
"absorbed him now. It was good to be alive, even on this present earth!"
"it was good to see, to feel, to know! and there was much to be thankful"
for in the mere capability of easy and healthful breathing!
lady and the baby and the cart emerged from the hotel door they were
"attended by an ever-increasing throng of unwashed Venetians, whose"
interest could not have been keener had Santos Dumont's air-ship or a
"Japanese jinriksha suddenly appeared in their gondola-ridden town, and"
who commented in shrill Italian on this wheeled apparition. The lady is
"not easily beaten when she decides to do anything, but, after standing"
"that for half a block or so, she made a hasty retreat to the hotel, and"
"wheels disappeared, probably forever, from the streets of Venice."
[Sidenote: Gondolas and Gondoliers.]
"Although Venice, with its population of one hundred and sixty-three"
"thousand, is seven miles in circumference, and is divided by one"
"hundred and forty-six canals into one hundred and seventeen islands,"
yet these are so joined together by means of four hundred bridges that
it is possible to walk all over the city. But the bridges are built in
"steps, and cannot be used by wheeled vehicles. There are no horses or"
"carriages of any kind. The funereal-looking gondola, always painted"
"black, is the only conveyance upon these streets of water, and does"
"duty for cab, omnibus, wagon, cart, wheelbarrow and hearse. It is used"
"for pleasure riding, shopping, church-going, theatre-going, visiting,"
"carrying prisoners to jail, carrying the dead to the cemetery--in"
"short, for everything."
"In propelling this black but graceful and easy-going boat, the"
"gondolier does not sit. He stands, on a sort of deck platform towards"
"the stern, and to balance his weight there is affixed to the prow a"
"heavy piece of shining steel, which rears itself at the front almost"
"like a figure-head, only this is always of the same pattern, simply"
"a broad, upright blade of steel, notched deeply on the front edge."
"The gondolier does not pull the oar, he pushes it--there is only one"
"oar--and he does not change it from side to side, as in paddling a"
towards one of its intermediate halting places. It also brought
"home to me vividly the inter-tribal character of this institution,"
which unites in one common and strongly emotional interest so many
"scattered communities. That night, as we learnt afterwards, a good"
number of canoes had anchored on the outlying deserted islands of the
"Amphletts, waiting for the rest of the fleet to arrive. When we came"
"that evening to Nabwageta, the news had already been received of the"
"important event, and the whole village was astir."
"Next day, the weather was particularly fine and clear, with the distant"
"mountains wreathed only in light cumuli, their alluring outlines"
"designed in transparent blue. Early in the afternoon, with a blast of"
"conch shell, a Dobuan waga, in full paint and decoration, and with the"
"rich pandanus mat of the sail glowing like gold against the blue sea,"
"came sailing round the promontory. One after the other, at intervals"
"of a few minutes each, other canoes came along, all sailing up to"
"some hundred yards from the beach, and then, after furling the sail,"
paddling towards the shore (see Plate XL). This was not a ceremonial
"approach, as the aim of the expedition this time did not embrace the"
"Amphletts, but was directed towards the Trobriands only, Vakuta,"
and Sinaketa; these canoes had put in only for an intermediate
"halt. Nevertheless, it was a great event, especially as the canoes"
of Nabwageta were going to join with the fleet later on. Out of the
"sixty or so Dobuan canoes, only about twenty-five with some 250 men in"
"them had come to Nabwageta, the others having gone to the big village"
"of Gumasila. In any case, there were about five times as many men"
gathered in the village as one usually sees. There was no Kula done
"at all, no conch-shells were blown on the shore, nor do I think were"
any presents given or received by either party. The men sat in groups
"round their friends' houses, the most distinguished visitors collected"
"about the dwelling of Tobwa'ina, the main headman of Nabwageta."
"pearl among women. And she told the king that he was right, and she was"
"wrong. She said, putting her arms about him and caressing him, that she"
had discovered that it was true that her brother had been plotting
"against the king, and therefore his death was necessary. It was"
"terrible, she said, to find that her brother, whom she had always held"
"as a pattern, was no better than a traitor; but it was even so, and her"
king was the wisest of all kings to find it out.
"The king was delighted to find his queen in this mood, and he soothed"
"her and talked to her kindly and sweetly, for he really loved her,"
though he had given in to bad advice about the brother. And when the
"king's suspicions were lulled, the queen said to him that she had now"
"but one request to make, and that was that she might have permission to"
"go down with her maids to the river-shore in the early morning, and see"
"herself the execution of her traitor brother. The king, who would now"
"have granted her anything--anything she asked, except just that one"
"thing, the life of her brother--gave permission; and then the queen said"
that she was tired and wished to rest after all the trouble of the last
"few days, and would the king leave her. So the king left her to herself,"
and went away to his own chambers.
"Very early in the morning, ere the crimson flush upon the mountains had"
"faded in the light of day, a vast crowd was gathered below the city, by"
"the shore of the great river. Very many thousands were there, of many"
"countries and peoples, crowding down to see a man die, to see a traitor"
"burnt to death for his sins, for there is nothing men like so much as to"
see another man die.
"Upon a little headland jutting out into the river the pyre was raised,"
"with brushwood and straw, to burn quickly, and an iron post in the"
middle to which the man was to be chained. At one side was a place
"reserved, and presently down from the palace in a long procession came"
"the exasperated peasantry in Friesland and Guelderland,[757] but to put"
"down all the oligarchs who had rebelled against him, and finally to"
"behead them by the dozen,[758] leaving the land to his son as a"
virtually subject State.
"In the sixteenth century, under Charles V, the men of Ghent, grown once"
"again a great commercial community,[759] exhibited again the fatal"
instability of the undeveloped democracy of all ages. Called upon to pay
"their third of a huge subsidy of 1,200,000 _caroli_ voted by the Flemish"
"States to the Emperor, they rang their bell of revolt and defied him,"
"offering their allegiance to the King of France. That monarch, by way of"
"a bargain, promptly betrayed the intrigue to his ""brother,"" who"
"thereupon marched in force through France to the rebel city, now"
"paralysed by terror; and without meeting a shadow of resistance,"
"penalised it to the uttermost, beheading a score of leading citizens,"
"banishing many more, annulling its remaining municipal rights, and"
exacting an increased tribute.[760] It needed an extremity of grievance
to drive such communities to an enduring rebellion. When Charles V
"abdicated at Brussels in favour of his son Philip in 1555, he had"
already caused to be put to death Netherlanders to the number at least
of thousands for religious heresy;[761] and still the provinces were
"absolutely submissive, and the people capable of weeping collectively"
"out of sympathy with the despot's infirmities.[762] He, on his part,"
"born and educated among them, and knowing them well, was wont to say of"
them that there was not a nation under the sun which more detested the
"_name_ of slavery, or that bore the reality more patiently when managed"
with discretion.[763] He spoke whereof he knew.
§ 2. _The Revolt against Spain_
That the people who endured so much at the hands of a despot should have
"them to Kiriwina. All their canoes were being painted and renovated,"
a sail was being repaired on the beach (see Plate LIII). There were
"some minor distributions of food taking place in the village, the stuff"
"being over and over again allotted and re-allotted, smaller pieces"
carved out of the big chunks and put into special wrappings. This
constant handling of food is one of the most prominent features of
"tribal life in that part of the world. As I arrived, a sail for one of"
"the canoes was just being finished by a group of men. In another canoe,"
"I saw them mending the outrigger by attaching the small log of light,"
"dry wood to make the old, waterlogged float more buoyant. I could"
"also watch in detail the final trimming of the canoes, the putting"
"up of the additional frames, of the coco-nut mats, the making of the"
little cage in the central part for the pots and for the lilava (the
"sacred bundle), I was, nevertheless, not on sufficiently intimate"
terms with these Nabwageta natives to be allowed to witness any of
"the magic. Their system of mwasila is identical with that of Boyowa,"
"in fact, it is borrowed from there."
Next day--in this village again I had difficulty in finding any good
"informants, a difficulty increased by the feverish occupation of all"
"the men--I went for a long row in the afternoon with my two 'boys,'"
"hoping to reach the island of Domdom. A strong current, which in this"
"part is at places so pronounced that it breaks out into steep, tidal"
"waves, made it impossible to reach our goal. Returning in the dark,"
"my boys suddenly grew alert and excited, like hounds picking up a"
"scent. I could perceive nothing in the dark, but they had discerned"
"two canoes moving westwards. Within about half-an-hour, a fire became"
"visible, twinkling on the beach of a small, deserted island South"
of Domdom; evidently some Dobuans were camping there. The excitement
"and intense interest shown by my boys, one a Dobuan, the other from"
"Sariba (Southern Massim), gave me an inkling of the magnitude of"
this event--the vanguard of a big Kula fleet slowly creeping up
"with the country round Edinburgh, will be able to form some judgment"
"as to the tendency of papal domination. The descent of Spain, once"
"the first among the monarchies, to the lowest depths of degradation,"
"the elevation of Holland, in spite of many natural disadvantages, to"
"a position such as no commonwealth so small has ever reached, teach"
the same lesson. Whoever passes in Germany from a Roman Catholic to
"a Protestant principality, in Switzerland from a Roman Catholic to a"
"Protestant canton, in Ireland from a Roman Catholic to a Protestant"
"county, finds that he has passed from a lower to a higher grade of"
civilization. On the other side of the Atlantic the same law prevails.
The Protestants of the United States have left far behind them the
"Roman Catholics of Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Roman Catholics of"
"Lower Canada remain inert, while the whole continent round them is"
in a ferment with Protestant activity and enterprise. The French
"have doubtless shown an energy and intelligence which, even when"
"misdirected, have justly entitled them to be called a great people."
"But this apparent exception, when examined, will be found to confirm"
"the rule, for in no country that is called Roman Catholic has the"
"Roman Catholic Church, during several generations, possessed so little"
"authority as in France."""
"Charles Dickens, in a letter written from Switzerland, in 1845, to"
"his friend and biographer, Forster, says: ""In the Simplon, hard"
"by here, where (at the bridge of St. Maurice over the Rhone) the"
"Protestant canton ends and a Catholic canton begins, you might"
separate two perfectly distinct and different conditions of humanity
by drawing a line with your stick in the dust on the ground. On the
"Protestant side--neatness, cheerfulness, industry, education, continued"
"aspiration, at least, after better things. On the Catholic side--dirt,"
"disease, ignorance, squalor and misery. I have so constantly observed"
the like of this since I came abroad that I have a sad misgiving that
"the religion of Ireland lies at the root of all its sorrows."" Writing"
"the Admiralty to authorise, and the Admiralty may thereupon by warrant"
"authorise, either a Vice-Admiralty court or a Colonial Court of"
"Admiralty, within the meaning of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act,"
"1890, to act as a prize court in a British possession, or may in like"
manner establish a Vice-Admiralty court for the purpose of so acting;
"and any court so authorised shall, subject to the terms of the warrant"
"from the Admiralty, have all such jurisdiction as is by this Act"
conferred on the High Court as a prize court.
"Commissions. [57 & 58 Vict. c. 39, s. 2 (1), (2).]"

King or the Admiralty for the purpose of commissioning a prize court at
"any place in a British possession may, notwithstanding the existence of"
"peace, be issued at any time, with a direction that the court shall act"
only upon such proclamation as herein-after mentioned being made in the
possession.
"(2) Where any such commission, warrant, or instructions have been"
"issued, then, subject to instructions from His Majesty the Vice-Admiral"
"of such possession may, when satisfied by information from a Secretary"
of State or otherwise that war has broken out between His Majesty and
"any foreign State, proclaim that war has so broken out, and thereupon"
"the said commission, warrant, and instructions shall take effect as if"
the same had been issued after the breaking out of such war and such
foreign State were named therein.

virginity[1494].’ Finally the first night on which the wedded pair came
"together was known as the ‘mystic night’ (νὺξ μυστική)[1495], a term"
not a little suggestive of the great night of Demeter’s mysteries when
to the eyes of the initiated was displayed the secret proof and promise
of wedlock between men and gods hereafter. In short the ceremonies
of a wedding by one means or another proclaimed it to be a form of
"initiation, and the estate of marriage was to the Greeks, as our"
"prayer-book calls it, ‘an excellent mystery.’"
Hence naturally followed the belief that the unmarried and the
uninitiated shared the same fate in the future life. One conception
"of the punishment of the uninitiated was, according to Plato[1496],"
"that they should carry water in a sieve to a broken jar; and this, as"
"is well known, was also the lot of the Danaids in the nether world."
"Commenting on these facts Dr Frazer says, ‘It is possible that the"
original reason why the Danaids were believed to be condemned to this
"punishment in hell was not so much that they murdered, as that they did"
"not marry, the sons of Aegyptus. According to one tradition indeed they"
afterwards married other husbands (Paus. III. 12. 2); but according
"to another legend they were murdered by Lynceus, apparently before"
"marriage (Schol. on Euripides, _Hecuba_, 886). They may therefore have"
"been chosen as types of unmarried women, and their punishment need"
not have been peculiar to them but may have been the one supposed to
await all unmarried persons in the nether world[1497].’ A passage of
"Lucian, which appears to have been overlooked in this connexion[1498],"
converts the view of the Danaids which Dr Frazer considers possible
into a practical certainty. The passage in point forms the conclusion
of that dialogue in which Poseidon with the aid of Triton plots and
"carries out the rape of Amymone, the Danaid. She has just been seized"
and is protesting against her abduction and threatening to call her
"father, when Triton intervenes: ‘Keep quiet, Amymone,’ he says, ‘it"
"is Poseidon.’ And the girl rejoins, ‘Oh, Poseidon you call him, do"
"sulky, and said: “I need them better than you do.” She quite agreed"
"this might be, but reminded him that, after all, they belonged to her."
"She promised, however, that if he would tell her for what purpose he"
"wanted the envelopes, she would endeavour to help him in the matter."
Then came the astonishing announcement: “I am building a navy.” After
"a little more gradual questioning, Mrs. Glover drew from the boy the"
information that the Borough Water Carts passed through the side
"street once a week, flushing the gutter; that then the Envelope Ships"
were made to sail on the water and pass under the covered ways which
formed bridges for wayfarers and tunnels for the “navy.” Great was the
excitement when the ships passed out of sight and were recognised as
they arrived safely at the other end. Of course the expenses in raw
material were greatly diminished by the illicit acquisition of Mrs.
"Glover's property, and in this way she had unconsciously provided the"
"neighbourhood with a navy and a Commander. Her first instinct, after"
"becoming acquainted with the whole story, was to present the boy with a"
"real boat, but on second thought she collected and gave him a number of"
"old envelopes with names and addresses upon them, which added greatly"
"to the excitement of the sailing, because they could be more easily"
"identified as they came out of the other side of the tunnel, and had"
their respective reputations as to speed.
"Here is indeed food for romance, and I give both instances to prove"
that the advantages of street life are to be taken into consideration
as well as the disadvantages; though I think we are bound to admit that
the latter outweigh the former.
One of the immediate results of dramatic stories is the escape from
"the commonplace, to which I have already alluded in quoting Mr."
"Goschen's words. The desire for this escape is a healthy one, common to"
adults and children. When we wish to get away from our own surroundings
"and interests, we do for ourselves what I maintain we ought to do for"
Vivie's health gradually recovered from the effects of the forcible
"feeding; the prison fare, supplemented by the weekly parcels, suited"
her digestion; the peace of the prison life and the regular work at
interesting trades soothed her nerves. She enjoyed the respite from
"the worries of her complicated toilettes, the perplexity of what to"
"wear and how to wear it; in short, she was finding a spell of prison"
"life quite bearable, except for the cold and the attentions of the"
chaplain. She gathered from the fortnightly letter which her
"industry and good conduct allowed her to receive, and to answer,"
that unwearied efforts were being made by her friends outside to
shorten her sentence. Mrs. Warren through Bertie Adams had found out
the cases where jockeys and stable lads had lost their effects in
the fires or explosions which had followed Vivie's visits to their
"employers' premises, and had made good their losses. As to their"
"employers, they had all been heavily insured, and recovered the"
value of their buildings; and as to the insurance companies _they_
had all been so enriched by Mr. Lloyd George's legislation that the
"one-or-two hundred thousand pounds they had lost, through Vivie's"
"revenge for the seemingly-fruitless death of Emily Wilding Davison,"
was a bagatelle not worth bothering about. But all attempts to get
the Home Office to reconsider Miss Warren's case or to shorten her
imprisonment (except by the abridgment that could be earned in the
prison itself) were unavailing. So long as the Cabinet held Vivie
"under lock and key, the Suffrage movement--they foolishly"
believed--was hamstrung.
"So the months went by, and Vivie almost lost count of time and"
"almost became content to wait. Till War was declared on August 4th,"
1914. A few days afterwards followed the amnesty to Suffragist
prisoners. From this the Home Office strove at first to exclude
Vivien Warren on the plea that her crime was an ordinary crime and
admitted of no political justification; but at this the wrath of
the island he would carry him to Jamaica to be hanged.
"Soon after Holford's departure another ship put in for water, none of the"
"crew of which knew Vane by sight, and he was too crafty to let them find"
out the notorious pirate he was. They consented to take off the
"shipwrecked mariner, when, just as all seemed to be going well, back came"
"the ship of friend Holford. Holford, who seems to have been a sociable"
"kind of man, was well acquainted with the captain who was befriending"
"Vane, and Holford was invited to dine on board his ship. As the guest was"
passing along the deck of his host's ship on his way to the great cabin he
"chanced to glance down the open hold, and there who should he see but his"
dear old friend Vane hard at work; for he had already won his new master's
"good graces by being a ""brisk hand."" Holford at once informed his host"
"that he was entertaining a notorious pirate, and with his consent clapped"
"Vane in irons, and removed him to his own ship, and when he arrived in"
"Jamaica handed his old friend to the justices, who quickly tried,"
to the relative frequency of occurrence of hæmothorax I should have
placed it at about 30 per cent. The patients in these early battles
"needed little wagon transport, and when sent down to the Base travelled"
in comfortable ambulance trains. After the commencement of the march
"from Modder River to Bloemfontein, however, these conditions were"
"changed, and all the chest as other cases were exposed to the necessity"
of three days and nights' journey to the Stationary hospitals and
"afterwards to the long journey to Cape Town. Of these patients, at"
least 90 per cent. suffered with hæmothorax of varying degrees of
severity.
"In some cases, the least common, signs of considerable intra-pleural"
"hæmorrhage immediately followed the wound; in others, the accumulation"
"of blood was gradual, and only manifest in any degree at the end of"
"three or four days, when it became stationary if the patient was kept at"
rest. In a second series the hæmorrhage was of the recurrent variety;
"noisiest crowd being a group of young seminarians, prospective priests,"
who occupied the same bench with us and the two or three nearest to
it. After we had been there an hour the great clock of St. Peter's
struck twelve. Instantly all the noisy young seminarians rose to their
"feet and began to recite, in a lower, humming tone, their _Ave-Marias_"
and _Pater-Nosters_. As soon as the reciting and counting of beads
"was over, as it was in a minute, they struck in again with their gay"
conversation. We had plenty of time to take it all in. The Pope is
"always late, and it was an hour after the time fixed for the audience"
"when he appeared; but at last he did, and instantly everybody, men and"
"women, sprang up on the benches and chairs, frantically waving their"
"handkerchiefs and shouting at the top of their voices, ""_Evviva il"
"Papa-Re! Evviva il Papa-Re!_""--""Long live the Pope-King! Long live the"
"Pope-King!""--the ablest performer in this part of the ceremony being a"
"leather-lunged young priest at my elbow, with a voice as powerful and"
"persistent as that of a hungry calf, and who made known his desire"
for the restoration of the temporal power to the Pope with such energy
that the perspiration rolled down his fat face in shining rivulets.
I never heard anything like it except in a political convention or a
"stock exchange. Accompanied by the Noble Guard, a body of picked men"
"renowned for their superb physique and clad in resplendent uniform, the"
"Holy Father was borne in on an arm-chair, carried by twelve men, also"
"in uniform. Occasionally he would rise to his feet with evident effort,"
"leaning on, or rather grasping, one arm of his chair, and bless the"
"people he was passing, with two fingers outstretched in the familiar"
attitude that we have seen in the pictures. At such times the furious
"acclamations, and waving of handkerchiefs, and clapping of hands,"
"would be redoubled. He passed within arm's length of us, a little knot"
"of Protestants, silent amid the uproar. It was a pitiful spectacle."
"A pallid, feeble, tottering old man, with slender, shrunken neck,"
"and excessively sharp and prominent features, nose and chin almost"

Ferrier appears to have spent a week at Frankfort before reaching his
destination at Leipzig. He describes his journey there: 'At Frankfort I
saw nothing worthy of note except a divine statue of Ariadne riding on
a leopard. After lumbering along for two nights and two days in a
"clumsy diligence, I reached Leipzig two days ago. I thought that by the"
"way I might perhaps see something worthy of mention, and accordingly"
"sometimes put my head out of the window to look. But no--the trees, for"
"instance, had all to a man planted their heads in the earth, and were"
"growing with their legs upwards, just as they do with us; and as for"
"the natives, they, on the contrary, had each of them filled a"
"flower-pot, called a skull, full of earth, put their heads in it, and"
"were growing _downwards_, just as the same animal does in our country;"
and on coming to one's recollection in the morning in a German
"diligence you find yourself surrounded by the same drowsy, idiotical,"
"glazed, stained, and gummy complement of faces which might have"
accompanied you into Carlisle on an autumn morning after a night of
travel in His Majesty's mail coach.'
Berlin impressed Ferrier by its imposing public buildings and general
"aspect of prosperity. It had, of course, long before reached a position"
"of importance under the great Frederick's government, though not the"
"importance or the size that it afterwards attained. Still, it was the"
"centre of attraction for all classes throughout Prussia, and possessed"
a cultivated society in which the middle-class element was to all
appearances predominant. Ferrier writes of the town: 'Of the inside of
"the buildings and what is to be seen there I have nothing yet to say,"
"but their external aspect is most magnificent. Palaces, churches,"
"mosque-like structures, spires and domes and towers all standing"
"together, but with large spaces and fine open drives between, so that"
"all are seen to the greatest possible advantage, conspire to form a"
most glorious city. At this moment a fountain which I can see from my
All the rumours which had been reported to me in the Amphletts about
the previous movements of the Trobriand natives had been correct. Thus
"the natives of Vakuta had really been to the East, to Kitava, and"
"had brought with them a big haul of armshells. To'uluwa, the chief of"
"Kiriwina, had visited Kitava later, and about five or six days before"
"had returned from there, bringing with him 213 pairs of armshells. The"
"Sinaketans then had gone to Kiriwina, and out of the 213 pairs had"
succeeded in securing 154. As there had been previously 150 pairs
"in Sinaketa, a total of 304 was awaiting the Dobuans. On the morning"
"of my arrival, the Sinaketan party had just returned from Kiriwina,"
hurrying home so as to have everything ready for the reception of the
"Dobuans. Of these, we got the news that very afternoon--news which"
"travelled overland from one village to another, and reached us from"
Vakuta with great rapidity. We were also told that the uvalaku fleet
would be at Sinaketa within two or three days.
This period I utilised in refurbishing my information about that phase
"of the Kula, which I was going to witness, and trying to get a clear"
outline of every detail of all that was going soon to happen. It is
extremely important in sociological work to know well beforehand
"the underlying rules and the fundamental ideas of an occurrence,"
"especially if big masses of natives are concerned in it. Otherwise,"
the really important events may be obliterated by quite irrelevant and
"accidental movements of the crowd, and thus the significance of what"
he sees may be lost to the observer. No doubt if one could repeat
"one's observations on the same phenomenon over and over again, the"
essential and relevant features would stand out by their regularity
"and permanence. If, however, as it often happens in ethnographic"
"field-work, one gets the opportunity only once of witnessing a"
"public ceremony, it is necessary to have its anatomy well dissected"
"beforehand, and then concentrate upon observing how these outlines are"
"followed up concretely, gauge the tone of the general behaviour, the"
"Their father and mother were dead, and there was no one but those two,"
"the brother and sister, so they loved each other dearly, and thought of"
no one else. The brother brought home no wife to his house by the forge.
"He wanted no one while he had his sister there, and when lovers came"
"wooing to her, singing amorous songs in the amber dusk, she would have"
"nothing to do with them. So they lived there together, he growing"
"stronger and she more beautiful every day, till at last a change came."
"The old king died, and a new king came to the throne, and orders were"
sent about to all the governors of provinces and other officials that
the most beautiful maidens were to be sent down to the Golden City to be
wives to the great king. So the governor of that country sent for the
"blacksmith and his sister to his palace, and told them there what orders"
"he had received, and asked the blacksmith to give his sister that she"
might be sent as queen to the king. We are not told what arguments the
"governor used to gain his point, but only this, that when he failed, he"
"sent the girl in unto his wife, and there she was persuaded to go. There"
"must have been something very tempting, to one who was but a village"
"girl, in the prospect of being even one of the lesser queens, of living"
"in the palace, the centre of the world. So she consented at last, and"
"her brother consented, and the girl was sent down under fitting escort"
to find favour in the eyes of her king. But the blacksmith refused to
go. It was no good the governor saying such a great man as he must come
"to high honour in the Golden City, it was useless for the girl to beg"
and pray him to come with her--he always refused. So she sailed away
"down the great river, and the blacksmith returned to his forge."
"As the governor had said, the girl was acceptable in the king's sight,"
"and she was made at last one of the principal queens, and of all she had"
"most power over the king. They say she was most beautiful, that her"
"presence was as soothing as shade after heat, that her form was as"
"graceful as a young tree, and the palms of her hands were like lotus"
the superstition which made Christians akreophagous on Fridays and
fast-days and all through the forty days of Lent. When the plan of
"salting herrings was hit upon,[726] all Christian Europe helped to make"
the fortunes of the fisheries.
Net-making may have led to weaving; in any case weaving is the first
important industry developed in the Low Countries. It depended mainly on
the wool of England; and on the basis of the ancient seafaring there
"thus arose a sea-going commerce.[727] Further, the position of"
"Flanders,[728] as a trade-centre for northern and southern Europe,"
served to make it a market for all manner of produce; and round such a
market population and manufactures grew together. It belonged to the
"conditions that, though the territory came under feudal rule like every"
"other in the medieval military period, the cities were relatively"
"energetic all along,[729] theirs being (after the Dark Ages, when the"
work was largely done by the Church) the task of maintaining the
"sea-dykes[730] and water-ways, and theirs the wealth on which alone the"
feudal over-lords could hope to flourish in an unfruitful land. The
"over-lords, on their part, saw the expediency of encouraging foreigners"
"to settle and add to their taxable population,[731] thus establishing"
the tradition of political tolerance long before the Protestant period.
"Hence arose in the Netherlands, after the Renaissance, the phenomenon of"
a dense industrial population flourishing on a soil which finally could
"not be made to feed them,[732] and carrying on a vast shipping trade"
without owning a single good harbour and without possessing home-grown
"timber wherewith to build their ships, or home-products to freight"
them.[733]
One of the determinants of this growth on a partially democratic footing
was clearly the primary and peculiar necessity for combination by the
"inhabitants to maintain the great sea-dykes, the canals, and the"
embankments of the low-lying river-lands in the interior.[734] It was a
main success.[770] Such was the standing of Dutch Protestantism in 1555;
and no edict against heresy could be more searching and merciless than
that drawn up by Charles in 1550[771] without losing any upper-class
loyalty. Philip did but strive to carry it out.[772]
"Had Philip, further, maintained a prospect of chronic war for the"
"nobility of the Netherlands, the accruing chances of wealth[773] would"
in all likelihood have sufficed to keep them loyal. In the early wars of
his reign with France immense gains had been made by them in the way of
"ransoms and booty. When these ceased, luxury continuing, embarrassment"
became general.[774] But when Philip's energies were seen to be mainly
"bent on killing out heresy, the discontented nobles began to lean to the"
side of the persecuted commonalty. At the first formation of the
"Confederacy of the ""Beggars"" in 1566, almost the only zealous Protestant"
"among the leaders was William's impetuous brother Louis of Nassau, a"
"Calvinist by training, who had for comrade the bibulous Brederode. The"
"name of ""Gueux,"" given to the malcontents in contempt by the councillor"
"Berlaimont, had direct application to the known poverty or embarrassment"
of the great majority.[775] There was thus undisguisedly at work in the
"Netherlands the great economic force which had brought about ""the"
"Reformation"" in all the Teutonic countries; and the needy nobles"
insensibly grew Protestant as it became more and more clear that only
the lands of the Church could restore their fortunes.[776] This holds
despite the fact that the more intelligent Protestantism which latterly
spread among the people was the comparatively democratic form set up by
"Calvin, which reached the Low Countries through France, finding the"
readier reception among the serious because of the prestige accruing to
its austerity as against the moral disrepute which now covered the
German forms.
"[As to the proportional success of Lutheranism and Calvinism, see"
"Motley, pp. 132, 133; and Grattan, pp. 110, 111. (On p. 110 of Grattan"
"poisonings, assassinations, massacres, death.""[17]"
"One may smile at such papal peccadilloes as the vanity of Paul II.,"
"who was chiefly remarkable for his personal beauty, and was so vain"
"of his appearance that, when he was elected Pope, he wished to take"
the name of Formosus. One may be amused at the intense self-esteem of
"Urban VIII., of whose spoliation of ancient Rome Pasquino says, ""Quod"
"non fecerunt barbari, fecerunt Barberini,"" and who, in the Barberini"
"palace, had the Virgin and angels represented as bringing in the"
"ornaments of the papacy at his coronation, and in another room a number"
"of the Barberini bees (the family crest) flocking against the sun, and"
eclipsing it--to symbolize the splendor of the family. But our feeling
"changes when we read that ""he issued a bull by which the name, estates"
"and privileges of his house might pass to any living male descendant,"
"legitimate or illegitimate, whether child of prince or priest,"" lest"
the family of Barberini might become absorbed in that of Colonna. And
we do not go far in our reading about such popes before the feeling of
"amusement yields to one of sadness, indignation and horror. We need"
"not insist upon the story of the female Pope Joan, who is said to have"
"secured her election to the papal throne disguised as a man, and to"
"have reigned two years as John VIII., and then to have died a shameful"
"death; for, notwithstanding the indisputable fact that till 1600 her"
head was included among the terra cotta representations of the other
"popes in the Cathedral of Sienna, and was inscribed ""Johannes VIII.,"
"Femina de Anglia,"" and that it was then changed into a head of Pope"
"Zacharias by the Grand Duke, at the request of Pope Clement VIII.,"
the story is now generally discredited. But there are many other
"facts, established beyond controversy, which explain fully the feeling"
of the great majority of the Italian people and the verdict of the
"accredited historians of the world. When the penitential Pope, Adrian"
"VI. (1522-'23), died of drinking too much beer, ""the house of his"
"physician was hung with garlands by midnight revellers, and decorated"
"their credit be it said, risked their prospects of advancement for the"
"principles of freedom. In their days Toryism, we must recollect, meant"
something very different from what it might be supposed to signify in
our own. It meant an attitude of obstruction as regards all change from
established standards of whatever kind; it signified a point of view
which said that grievances should be unredressed unless it was in its
interest to redress them. The new party of opposition included in its
"numbers Whig lawyers like Gibson Craig and Henry Erskine, in earlier"
"days, and Francis Jeffrey and Lord Cockburn later on; a party of"
"progress was also formed within the Church, and the same within the"
"precincts of the University. The movement, as became a movement on the"
"political side largely headed by lawyers, had no tendency to violence;"
"it was moderate in its policy, and by no means revolutionary--indeed it"
may be doubted whether there ever was much tendency to revolt even
amongst those working men who expressed themselves most strongly. The
"advance party, however, carried the day, and when Ferrier began to"
"write, Scotland was in a very different state from that of twenty years"
"before. The Reform Bill had passed, and men had the moulding of their"
country's destiny practically placed within their hands. In the
"University, again, Sir William Hamilton, a Whig, had just been"
"appointed to the Chair of Logic, while Moncreiff, Chalmers, and the"
"rest, were prominent in the Church. The traditions of literary"
Edinburgh at the beginning of the century had been kept up by a circle
"amongst whom Lockhart, Wilson, and De Quincey may be mentioned; now"
"Carlyle, who had left Edinburgh not long before, was coming into"
"notice, and a new era seemed to be dawning, not so glorious as the"
"past, but more untrammelled and more free."
"How philosophy was affected by the change, and how Ferrier assisted in"
"its progress, it is our business now to tell; but we must first briefly"
"sketch the history of Scottish speculation to this date, in order to"
show the position in which he found it.
becomes unconscious of everything except the constant flap-flapping of
"the weary paddles as they go beating on, awakening the dull echoes of"
the sedgy shores. The eye is occasionally relieved by patches of naked
"sand, and now and then a stone about the size of your fist, diversifies"
"the monotony of the scene. Occasionally, in the distance, are to be"
"seen funny, forlorn-looking objects, trying evidently to look like"
"trees, but whether they would really turn out to be trees on a nearer"
inspection is what I very much doubt.' At Cologne he had an amusing
"meeting with an Englishman, 'whom I at once twigged to be an Oxford"
"man, and more, even, an Oxford tutor. There is a stiff twitch in the"
"right shoulder of the tribe, answering to a similar one in the hip-bone"
"on the same side, which there is no mistaking.' The tutor appears to"
have done valiant service in making known the traveller's wants in
"French to waiters, etc., though 'he spent rather too much of his time"
"in scheming how to abridge the sixpence which, ""time out of mind,"" has"
"been the perquisite of Boots, doorkeepers, etc.' 'But,' he adds in"
"excuse, 'his name was Bull, and therefore, as the authentic epitome of"
"his countrymen, he would not fail to possess this along with the other"
"peculiarities of Englishmen.' From Cologne, Ferrier went to Bonn, where"
"he had an introduction to Dr. Welsh, and then proceeded up the Rhine to"
Mayence. He does not form a very high estimate of the beauty of the
"scenery. He feels 'a want of something; in fact, to my mind, there is a"
"want of everything which makes earth, wood, and water something more"
"than mere water, wood, and earth. We have here a constant and endless"
"variety of imposing objects (imposing is just the word for them), but"
"there is no variety in them, nothing but one round-backed hill after"
"another, generally carrying their woods, when they have any, very"
"stiffly, and when they have none presenting to the eye a surface of"
"tawdry and squalid patchwork,' thus suggesting, in his view, a series"
of children's gardens--an impression often left on travellers when
visiting this same country. His next letters find him settled in the
University town of Heidelberg.
what it was to so many of the youth of the country from which it
"came--the expression of their deepest, and likewise of their freshest"
aspiration. The poetry of other countries and other tongues--English
"and Latin, for example--meant much to him, but that of Germany was"
nearest to his heart. French learning did not attract him; neither its
literature nor its metaphysics and psychological method appealed to his
"thoughtful, analytic mind; but in Germany he found a nation which had"
not as yet resigned its interest in things of transcendental import in
favour of what pertained to mere material welfare.
"Such was the Germany into which Ferrier came in 1834. He did not, so"
"far as we can hear, enter deeply into its social life; he visited it as"
"a traveller, rather than as a student, and his stay in it was brief."
"Considering the shortness of his time there, and the circumstances of"
"his visit, the impression that it made upon him is all the more"
"remarkable, for it was an impression that lasted and was evident"
"throughout all his after life. Since his day, indeed, it would be"
difficult to say how many young Scotsmen have been impressed in a
similar way by a few months' residence at a University town in Germany.
"For partly owing to Ferrier's own efforts, and perhaps even more owing"
"to the 'boom'--to use a vulgarism--brought about by Carlyle's writings,"
and by his first making known the marvels of German literature to the
"ordinary English-speaking public, who had never learned the language or"
"tried to understand its recent history, the old traditional literary"
alliance between Scotland and France appeared for the time being to
have broken down in favour of a similar association with its rival
"country, Germany. The work of Goethe was at last appreciated, nothing"
was now too favourable to say about its merits; philosophy was suddenly
"discovered to have its home in Germany, and there alone; our insularity"
"in keeping to our antiquated methods--dryasdust, we were told, as the"
"old ones of the schools, and perhaps as edifying--was vigorously"
"denounced. Theology, which had hitherto found complete support from the"
"of Burgundy, after her father's overthrow by the Swiss; again in the"
case of her husband Maximilian after her death; and previously in the
"reaffirmation of the ill-observed Laws of Cortenberg, secured from the"
Duke of Brabant by the Louvainers in 1372; but they could never deliver
"themselves from the feudal superstition, never evolve the republican"
"ideal. When the rich citizens exploited the poor, it was the local"
"sovereign's cue, as of old, to win the populace; whereupon the"
"patricians leant to the over-lord, were he even the King of France; or"
it might be that the local lord himself sought the intervention of his
"suzerain, who again was at times the first to meddle, and against whom,"
"as against rival potentates, the cities would at times fight desperately"
"for their recognised head, when he was not overtaxing or thwarting them,"
or endangering their commerce.[754] It was a medley of clashing
"interests, always in unstable equilibrium. And so when sovereign powers"
"on a great scale, as the Dukes of Burgundy, followed by the Archduke"
"Maximilian, and later by the Emperor Charles, came into the inheritance"
"of feudal prestige, the Dutch and Flemish cities became by degrees"
"nearly as subordinate as those of France and Germany, losing one by one"
their municipal privileges.[755] The monarchic superstition overbore the
passions of independence and primary interest; and a strong feudal ruler
could count on a more general and durable loyalty than was ever given to
"any citizen-statesman. James van Arteveldt, who guided Ghent in the"
"fourteenth century, and whose policy was one of alliance with the"
"English king against the French, the feudal over-lord, was ""the greatest"
"personality Flanders ever produced.""[756] But though Arteveldt's policy"
"was maintained even by his murderers, murdered he was by his"
"fellow-citizens, as the great De Witt was to be murdered in Holland"
three hundred years later. The monarchised Netherlanders were
"republicans only in the last resort, as against insupportable tyranny."
"Philip of Burgundy, who heavily oppressed them, they called ""The Good."""
"At the end of the fifteenth century Maximilian was able, even before he"
"became Emperor, not only to crush the ""bread-and-cheese"" rebellion of"
"Villiers, too, whose easy, good-natured, and clever talk generally gave"
"some sparkle and animation to the dreariest social gathering, was"
"to-night unusually taciturn:--he was bored by his partner, a"
"middle-aged woman with a mania for philology, and, moreover, his"
"thoughts, like those of most of the persons present, were centered on"
"Alwyn, whom every now and then he regarded with a certain wistful"
wonder and reverence. He had heard the whole story of the Field of
"Ardath; and he knew not how much to accept of it as true, or how much"
to set down to his friend's ardent imagination. He had come to a fairly
"logical explanation of the whole matter,--namely, that as the City of"
"Al-Kyris had been proved a dream, so surely the visit of the"
"Angel-maiden Edris must have been a dream likewise,--that the trance at"
"the Monastery of Dariel, followed by the constant reading of the"
"passages from Esdras, and the treatise of Algazzali, had produced a"
"vivid impression on Alwyn's susceptible brain, which had resolved"
itself into the visionary result narrated.
He found in this the most practical and probable view of what must
"otherwise be deemed by mortal minds incredible; and, being a frank and"
"honest fellow, he had not scrupled to openly tell his friend what he"
thought. Alwyn had received his remarks with the most perfect sweetness
"and equanimity,--but, all the same, had remained unchanged in his"
opinion as to the REALITY of his betrothal to his Angel-love in Heaven.
"And one or two points had certainly baffled Villiers, and perplexed him"
"in his would-be precise analysis of the circumstances: first, there was"
"the remarkable change in Alwyn's own nature. From an embittered,"
"sarcastic, disappointed, violently ambitious man, he had become"
"softened, gracious, kindly,--showing the greatest tenderness and"
"forethought for others, even in small, every-day trifles; while for"
himself he took no care. He wore his fame as lightly as a child might
"wear a flower, just plucked and soon to fade,--his intelligence seemed"
"in Italy occupy a position of indifference and unbelief, or hostility"
"and scorn, towards the Christian religion, for Romanism is the only"
"Christianity that most of them know. Let it be remembered, too, that"
"the King, able, conscientious, patriotic, devoted to the welfare of"
"his people, and the Prime Minister, Zanardelli, like his predecessor,"
"Crispi, and the members of Parliament, and the army and navy, and the"
whole government which has given Italy such wonderful stability and
prosperity since the overthrow of the papal dominion and opened before
"the nation a future of so much promise, are all standing aloof from"
the Pope. Let any one see one of the great pilgrimages from every
"part of the country to the tomb of Victor Emmanuel, who freed Italy,"
"as we saw it the other day, and observe the immense popularity of the"
"great liberator and his successors of the house of Savoy, and let him"
"note the firm opposition of Italy's leading men to the papacy, and he"
will see that the view of the Pope which the secular newspapers so
persistently seek to force upon the people of the English-speaking
world simply cannot be that of the thoughtful men of Italy.
"By the way, I see plenty of women confessing to the priests, but"
"very, very few men. The textbook used in the training of priests"
"as father-confessors, and the standard work of the church on that"
"subject, approved by Pope Leo XIII., is Liguori's _Moral Philosophy_."
"""On July 14, 1901, the _Asino_, a daily newspaper published in Rome,"
"printed in its columns, and also in the form of large bills, which it"
"caused to be posted up in public places in the chief cities of Italy, a"
challenge offering one thousand francs to any Roman Catholic newspaper
"which would have the courage to print the Latin text, with an Italian"
"translation, of two passages in Liguori's book, which it specified."
"The challenge was never taken up, and it never will be, for any one"
daring to publish the passages named would certainly be prosecuted for
"outraging public decency"" (Dr. Alexander Robertson, _Roman Catholic"
"Church in Italy_, p. 149). Hare says, ""It was a curious characteristic"

You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?

You disturbed it.

I knew it.
That's no man.

Thank you.
Thomas.
You hate me.
Is that it?
You must stop calling me.
File a complaint with my insurance.
I will still call you.
Yeah.
I'll never file a complaint.
It's not my style.
I wouldn't have complained to your boss either.
You don't say.
It's obvious you love your work.
What?
I love my work?
As if fucking the disabled was a vocation.
No one forces you to do this.
- Yes.
They do.
How can you be forced into it?
I did some things.
What things?
Illegal things.
I can't talk about it.
I was given a substitution sentence.
Wait a second.
You were sentenced to being a prostitute for the disabled?
You don't have to insult me.
- No.
I'm a hostess.
All right.
He's the one I'll go after.
Wait a minute.
It's cold outside.
You'll freeze.
Here.
I'll lend you my fur.

You have everything you need at the bar.
Enough about the bar!
Here she comes!

You have to swear first.
Swear you won't look behind the curtains.

I swear.

- Fine.
- Good girl.
"You got me another present, didn't you?"
Don't buy me any more presents!
"Why not, sweetie?"
We have everything we need.
I have my dress.
You have your things.
Why do we need more things?
Because they're nice to have.
What is it?
Franzie...
I have something to say.
They'll be coming up soon.
"So just slow down a little, Dale."
"I'm pumped, man."
Pumped!
Stupid cops.
- Stupid!
- Couldn't stop a snail on a salt bed.
- You see him yet?
"- No, not yet."
"- When you see him, tell me quick!"
- I will!
- Now...
- Yeah?
"When I give the order, you ram him hard into the guard rail, Dale."
- That'll stop him.
- I'm a road warrior!

- That's hot.
- You know we are.
Did either of you ever actually kill anybody?
Not yet.
I did.
How did it feel?
It didn't feel like I thought it would.
It felt shitty.
It felt wrong.

"Partner, there's nothing you could do."
Your silence has saved your life.
Until now.
"Now you need us, and we need you."
There's only one way to catch that maniac.
Hold on.
By offering him something he can't refuse.
You aren't serious!
We have no other choice.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
He wants to use you as bait.
You what?
- It's your only chance.
Put me out there like a piece of meat.
You came to see us.
Don't get her involved!
She already is!
You wanted to solve this case.
Not at her expense.
And we'll solve it.
Always you!
And if it's the last thing I do.
You just can't be trusted.
What?
Here's a package.
Speak up!
Who's it for?
"For you, lnspector Minks."
From somebody named lrezumi.
I'll put it here.
Car keys and a parking-lot ticket.
No.
- I have the rights to adoption.
- Never!
Thanks for freeing me.
I had no means... to get out.
Carry your papers... and no one will hassle you.
I didn't know that.
"It won't happen again, brother."
Have you finished?
- Have some more.
- I'm full.
You can always eat a little more.
- Have a roll.
"- I can't, really."
Try the salad.
Don't refuse everything.
Have some fruit.
I'll have a banana.
- I'm leaving now.
- Already?
"Wait for me, I'll wash my hands."
"As I foresaw, your employment has been arranged."
Come to the factory tomorrow.
There's no need for a ride.
- How will you go back?
"- On foot, as usual."
- I'll show you out.
- Don't bother.
Good evening!
Balla!
They set you free?
My boss paid for me.
Liar!
Little?
Any newbie can do it.
It will make no difference.
"How can you say that, Je?"
No difference?
It was a simple little job.
Be reasonable.
You turned off your mobile for half a day.
What was I supposed to do?
I had to fix it.
You weren't here.
Are you seeing someone now?
The hell!
Have you ever seen me with a girl?
No.
"But if you do, that's cool."
But turning off your cell phone.
That's too much.
"Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"
It's good that I noticed it first.
How could you miss that?
Even I noticed it.
"""Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"""
Shit!
It's not going away.
Not better.
So tired.
A waste of time.
What am I doing?
Hold on.
Shit!
November.
- And the redhead?
- She's my associate.
You don't fancy her?
None of your business.
What about you?
No girlfriend?
It never works out with girls.
"You're good-looking, you should be popular with the girls."
I'll let you finish.
I'm off to bed.
Catch!
A T-shirt for the night.
"Good thinking, thanks."
- Good night.
Niko?
How's your hand?
That bitch bit through the skin.
You'd better get tested in case she has AIDS...
I'll call you back.
"Hello, Vlad."
How are you?
"Not so good, mate."
Why didn't you tell me a girl tried to run?
"I was going to tell you, but we got her."
Tani took care of her.
We have more pressing matters.
Did you watch the news?
Not yet...
The cops are looking for the football player.
They found his hideout.
Find him and kill him.
I don't want him to talk about us.
"Give us back our jobs, you arsehole."
Not now you all hate me.
The workers united will never be defeated!
..cheaper grain.
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
Cheaper grain!
When do we want it?
Now!
Delphine?
What are you doing here?
"What are you doing here, Marcus?"
You said you'd cut grain prices and then you raised them!
I had to!
"Can you not protest against me, please?"
Why would you do that?
"Because he's looking after himself and his cronies, love."
"Mate, I'm trying to have a conversation with my girlfriend."
You go out with this arsehole?
"I do, yes."
And stop calling me that!
You could do a lot better!
Thank you.
"Shut up, please."
I'd dump him.
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
"I mean, this is not how I thought today would go."
"But since you don't have it, I'm gonna need that kiss."
Is...
Something wrong?
Pull her up.
Is she dying?
"She might, I... which is why this is gonna hurt."
You broke her arm!
It'll trigger the healing process.
I still gotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.
Stiles... you make a good Batman.
You know who it is.
Jackson.
"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
And we do it my way.
"Thank you, Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
Please... you have to tell him.
"It's okay, your baby's fine."
Not...
The baby.
He killed Sean.
"Honey, the police know."
They don't...
They didn't see it.
Excellent.
Hotel Lunik.
What can you do for us?
"Hi, we're with Hannes."
We're supposed to take some photos here.
I have a list of names.
Could you round everyone up?
I'll take care of that.
That'd be great.
"Photos, of all of us?"
With or without the mask?
He likes to wear a mask.
Is that alright?
"No, not at all!"
With the mask!
Alright!
I'll be right back.
Very nice.
"The man in the mask, in the middle."
Everybody a little closer together.
Are you a part of the group?
Why doesn't your boyfriend join us?
Why doesn't your girlfriend join us?
Why don't you both join us?
Come join us!
They can make fools of all of us.
It'll be good for you!
Come on.
I'm just a guest.
This time you're the subject.
"The more people we have, the livelier it will be."
Very nice!
"Sure, but do you ever do anything about it?"
I lay them by the dozen if need be.
Don't you?
What do you think I did with Chrissy last night?
But Christine has often walked down the aisle.
Never had any luck.
Take me to the studios some time.
Stupid bitoh!
Wait... stop!
Stop!
You got something going with her?
!
I saw that woman in a dream!
Ma'am!
"Nothing, I guess."
Probably screwing on some tombstone.
I read about them: cemetery whores.
- Damn weather!
- There!
We'll get soaked.
- That one's open!
- ln that tomb?
!
"Dead men don't bite, only live ones do."
Do you want to get hit?
It wouldn't be the first time.
- But you won't.
- Won't I?
No.
Do you think I'll like it?
I'm gonna try...
"Keep going, Gerard."
"Well, congratulations, sire."
We have a champion.
Good.
Where is he?
They haven't found him yet.
- Is that good?
- Yes.
That's what makes him a champion.
I see.
"They will find him, won't they?"
- You must be very proud.
"- Proud, you shit?"
Shit!
- Isn't that a great honour?
- Maybe he'll get the honour.
I'll get a dragon's tooth up my bum and a shilling-a-year pension.
I'll have to sit vigil with him all night as well.
"Christ, what luck!"
I promised my body to a woman tonight.
Maybe I could go and tell the lady that...
Wait a minute.
Maybe you could do it.
Certainly I could.
I'll tell the lady...
"- No, no, not that."
Sit the vigil.
- Me?
"I could give you my hat, my cape."
Just keep your head down.
He'll never know.
- I can't do that.
It's not right.
We're not the same breed.
Definitely not.
"I kind of like you, though..."
I know.
Me too.
I feel like getting closer to you.
Too bad I'm in a hurry.
I coulïve invited you to lunch.
You little bastard!
Isn't it nice here?
When no one bugs us we're content with simple pleasures.
"Just like flies, always buzzing around our balls."
Like we're indispensable.
Everything falls apart without us.
Don't go so fast!
My balls hurt!
Then stand up!
I win the prize!
Stupid ass...
Damn!
What a dumb way to get caught...
He's still thirsty.
Don't go away!
Give little Jesus a drink.
Here.
Take it and give him a drink.
Why?
I don't want your money.
Come on...
Don't give us a hard time...
Your tits really turn me on.
I'm meeting my husband.
Oi!
They're going down the science block.
Come back!
Halls of residence.
Shall we?
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
We're seeking shelter from the fascist oppressors.
And we're wet.
Can I interest you in some hashish?
I'm not really supposed to.
Drugs do odd things to me at the moment.
Aren't they supposed to?
This is Matt.
You want a hit from the bong?
He is an artist.
"Truly, an artist."
I'm Toby.
His roommate.
"And this is of the purest, highest possible grade."
I assure you.
Cool!
Bravo!
All splendid fun.
Polly!
My little chaffinch.
How the devil are you?
"I'm going to pretend that I don't smell that, Toby."
"Smell what, mon petit chou?"
"It's very, very naughty what you're doing, Toby."
Quite possibly.
Anyway.
Or through the rear window if you're brave enough to turn round.
It's so big!
We've passed the single tree.
And loads of others.
Two more up there. lt's beautiful!
I said we're reaching two single trees.
It would help if we could ask someone.
"Don't worry, we'll find someone."
We can ask them.
Slow down a bit.
- We may not find anyone.
- We will.
"This is farmland, they're out working."
We have to ask.
"Don't worry, we'll find someone."
I can see a black spot in the distance.
Over there.
He can't hear us.
"Wait, I'll go and ask him."
Ask that one.
Ask her.
"Hello, ma'am."
"Hello, I'm honoured."
How do we get to Siah Dareh?
"200 yards after the junction, turn left."
Thank you.
Good-bye.
"Look, it's behind the hill."
Wait till we pass that tree.
Look into the distance.
On the hill.
- Siah Dareh's over there?
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's go!
Stop it!
Hyo-jin!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
That's a ghost.
All the things happening around here are his doing.
"If nothing is done, it's not just your daughter, but everything that walks on two feet will perish."
Sir!
We head for Rochefort and the blockade squadron.
Sails on starboard bow!
That's the squadron.
"Deck, there!"
Flagship on the starboard bow!
- Strike topsail!
"- Lively, there!"
Stand by to drop anchor!
Wagstaffe?
Get your signals party ready.
Wait here.
You're mad!
You're all out of your minds!
- Dealing with an admiral?
- Jackson's an honest man.
He'll listen to us.
He'll agree until we surrender.
- Then he'll hang us.
- He won't.
I served under him in '89...
You'll see.
Mr. Crawford.
Vizard?
- Which of us goes to the flagship?
- None of us.
Why risk being clapped in irons?
I'll make them come to us.
Let go of the anchor!
Boat ahoy!
- Flagship!
"- Both your oars, up!"
Sergeant.
I'll come back.
Are you staying?
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No.
Madam.
You left the baby!
I went to fetch you some milk.
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No. I only saw them this morning.
This morning.
And this afternoon?
- Did they have the gear?
"- No, they had nothing."
I've prescribed her some pills.
Give them to her to ease the pain.
We don't have a car to get to the chemist's.
Give her medicine.
There's none left.
What's the matter?
It's her prescription.
Whose?
The invalid's.
The old woman?
I'll fetch it.
Can you drop me off?
"Yes, of course."
Good-bye.
Drive safely.
I'm like a general without an army.
Where do you want to go?
I'm going to the hospital.
Are you worried about your car or about the victim?
"No, I'm good."
All right.
Don't got to worry about me.
"You say you're okay, I take your word for it."
Medical suspensions?
[Chuckles]
"That's for the fucking nanny state, and I don't play that bullshit."
But do me a favor.
Put the glasses back on.
You're giving me a fucking headache.
"So, what's the deal?"
You got a spot on this card for me or what?
I can find a spot for you.
It's in Fresno.
It's only a week out.
It's not a problem.
Okay.
- Who's the guy?
- Local kid named Vargas.
He's aggressive.
"Not a lot of skill, but he's a tough motherfucker."
- 155?
- Ish.
"If either one of you's a few pounds over,"
I'm not gonna dock you.
I'll make it.
Even better.
"Unfortunately, though, not a lot of money."
I just want the fight.
All right.
It's a deal.
I'm excited.
"- Of course, who else?"
- You must be making a lot of money.
But your dad could've paid for it.
"Come on, I fend for myself now."
"By the way, how did you two meet?"
"Well, I worked on a student film way back."
I built a set for them.
And she did the music.
"Oh, so that's how you met."
"Like me, she's an avid fan of yours."
Really?
Have you lost your mind?
Are you nuts?
"By the way, I'm Kim Moonsook."
Nice to meet you.
- So you do music?
"- Yes, it's nothing really."
Her music is great!
How do you like this music?
I brought this CD for you.
What?
Is this her music?
"Yes, isn't it nice?"
She's mainly a composer.
She made this to use as a demo for her singing debut.
Very nice.
This is a bit mainstream.
I also have some weird stuff.
Want to hear it?
"No, it's nice."
Let's listen to this first.
I really like this one.
New shoes?
Have you jogged in them yet?
Judging by your rash.
"No, you haven't."
No cream residue.
"You've been scratching, right?"
"It's itchy, doc."
"So I have to scratch it, right?"
"If I scratch, my itch will go away, right?"
Wrong!
"The more you scratch, the itchier you get."
The more your lesions will get worse.
"And the bedtime pill, you didn't take either, right?"
"If I didn't take them, you can tell?"
No.
But based on what you just said.
I know you didn't.
And how is your penis?
"Doc, you don't miss a thing, do you?"
I'm really upset.
What you ask is too hard.
It's like asking me to become a monk.
This...
Who sleeps at 9PM anyways?
"In my profession, it's impossible."
What I am asking you to do isn't hard.
It is hard.
Do you sleep at 9PM?
Or you work 24 hours?
Yes.
No weekends off?
Nope.
What is that on your face?
It's mu gaze!
What age is it... that you flirt in such way?
- Hello...
- Stop your work!
- Hello!
- I have something for you!
I'm in a meeting.
The signal is not good.
- What meeting?
- Hello...
- The signal is low!
I'll hang up.
- Yawang.
Get in.
I'll drive you home.
Don't tell Mr. Lin that I go with Mr. Qu!
Not you!
Why do I have to get in your car?
"Just take it, or I'll stop the work!"
Don't you think the workers will be so pitiful?
Hi girl!
Do you want to have some coffee?
Let's go for dinner.
No!
My parents are waiting at home.
"Being home right after work, is so boring!"
"Since you are in hurry, we will go back faster!"
Are you insane?
Why are you speeding up?
Don't you like excitement?
Stop the car!
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
Why can't you answer?
You've already said it.
I'm the devil.
Shaman
I'm almost there.
Where are you?
Are you home?
I'm with the woman now.
You mustn't let her tempt you.
Never.
"Whatever she tells you, you must go to your daughter now."
Do you understand me?
Understand?
Do you?
Is that your shaman?
Don't believe what he tells you.
They're in on it together.
Isn't that right?
You're already certain I'm the devil.
That's why you came here... carrying that sickle.
"My words, whatever I say- they won't change your mind."
No.
That's not true.
There's no doubt.
You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.
That's not true!
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.
It's lovely.
"Come on, catch up!"
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.
- Blue sky!
Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.
Are you hurt?
- I cannot walk.
Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.
Margaret!
Don't be afraid.
He's quite safe.
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.
May I have your permission to ascertain if there are any breaks?
It is not broken.
Can you put your arm about my neck?
Allow me to escort you home.
At last!
She fell down and he's carrying her!
"Marianne, are you hurt?"
It's a twisted ankle.
It's not serious.
I felt the bone.
And it's sound.
- I cannot begin to thank you.
Not so soon.
How about tomorrow?
Let me tell you something.
"No need, just drop me a line."
Some chick is crazy about me.
I'm irresistible!
That's a good joke.
"Very funny indeed, good night!"
You are jealous.
"Guess, who's come to find me?"
The boss's fiancee
B.?
"How dare you call her B., only I can."
She calls me Robin darling too!
Robin darling?
Are you kidding?
"She's so sexy, she even tried to seduce me."
Tore everything off to rush and take a shower...
You mean her?
Me of course!
But she told me to do so.
Do you get it?
But it's very clear what she wanted to do.
Why is she lying on your bed?
I haven't done anything yet!
How dare you steal my first girlfriend?
I didn't.
Don't deny it.
This is the end of our friendship!
Did you go and visit him?
Yes I did!
Did you tell him to take a shower?
"Okay, look carefully!"
Hanging high as a star.
Flying light as butterfly
Kicking hard as the top star.
How's that?
What?
Isn't that right?
"You're okay, but, not good enough!"
Not good enough?
"You know these 3 stances have turned me into a strong man, look!"
"If so, why don't you work in the fields?"
You think I'm an ox?
Ox?
"Well, you aren't as big as that!"
"What then, you mean I'm puny?"
I can see that you're like a Mongol doctor
Sick or not sick as he wishes.
Lemme show you
Come!
Okay
Like Mongol doctor I'll give you a body check
I'm coming!
Left punch!
Right punch!
Wah!
Really fierce
"I mean, that's nothing"
Want to know how I defeated you?
Of course!
Then come again!
Hanging high as a star!
And the second one?
Get out!
Come here!
What are you smiling for?
You deaf person!
Gate?
!
Out?
!
Get out!
Who?
Then say so!
Why beat around the bush?
"Won't you go away, rascal?"
He was eating my head!
And why were you asking them?
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.
This girl has shot into my heart like a bullet.
"She sells flowers, yet fires bullets."
That's why it's said that one cannot trust the female species.
When I was hit with the bullet the first time...
- ...it hadn't been so painful.
"- But the pain is sweet, isn't it?"
- But what next?
- What do you mean?
Will this matter proceed further or not?
How will it proceed further?
You know I cannot do a thing.
I too don't know anything.
I haven't fallen in love often.
Brother!
"How are you, brother?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Surprised to see your pal Greg here.
Surprised to see your pal Greg here.
"He's undercutting us,"
"He's undercutting us, using our bloody network to sell his bloody gear."
using our bloody network to sell his bloody gear.
"Me, I'd set an example."
"Me, I'd set an example."
Prove to me you're not just another Kiwi wanker.
Prove to me you're not just another Kiwi wanker.
How you doing?
Fine.
How you doing?
Fine.
(SCOFFS) What's with you?
(SCOFFS) What's with you?
Greg.
Greg?
Greg.
Greg?
You know what he calls you - a poser.
You know what he calls you - a poser.
How can you be mates with him?
How can you be mates with him?
TERRY:
It's obvious you're not happy.
TERRY:
It's obvious you're not happy.
GREG:
"Mate, I'm as happy as a pig in shit."
GREG:
Where's Cutter?
"Din, where is Sgt. Cutter?"
- They catch him.
- What's that?
Who?
"In the gold temple, they catch Sgt. Cutter."
Who's they?
Priests or what?
Very bad men.
They'll give him torture.
"Go help, quick."
- How many men?
- Don't know.
- I run away quick to bring help.
- I'll bet you ran away quick.
"And you'll run back just as quick, too."
Show me the way.
- I'll pick a dozen men.
- You'll pick nothing!
I'm going alone.
You haven't a chance.
I'm not killing Cutter by riding in with a troop.
They'll cut him up if we have a rescue party.
- Right.
We'll go together.
- No.
"Tommy, what's the matter?"
"Cutter got himself into a mess, and Mac and I are going to get him out."
"Don't worry, I'm not taking him."
I'm going as a sergeant in Her Majesty's service.
- I'm not taking any civilians with me.
- Who's a civilian?
"Honest, that night, when you walked out of my place I made as if I didn't care."
I did care.
"After you'd gone, I kept wishing you'd come back."
"Truly, I did."
"This man, Hyde, will never trouble you again."
I give you my word.
How do you know?
He'll come back!
He'll come back and kill me!
No.
He won't come back.
I'll see to it.
"Oh, you don't know him, sir."
"Oh, you don't know him."
"He ain't human, he ain't!"
I gave you my word.
You'll never see Hyde again.
You must believe me.
"I believe you, sir."
I believe you.
You must go now.
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"For a moment, I thought..."
Goodbye.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have admitted such a person."
I didn't know she was hysterical.
That's all right.
I'm glad you admitted her.
"Now, about the wedding, we've got a lot to discuss."
- We've never been married before.
- Let's not get upset.
'
And I'm killing Rambo thanks to you.
You are welcome.
Hang on...so who's guarding the grain store now?
"Oh, yeah, no... no one."
"Oh, shit!"
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Oi!
Oi!
"Well, well, well."
The Professor.
"What brings you out here, then?"
"Oh, just concluding..."
"you know, a big sale."
Pleasure doing business with you!
Uh-huh?
How much did they steal?
Not much.
"A bit, yeah."
"Quite a lot, actually."
"It's fine, though."
I can handle it.
Of course you can.
"If you'll excuse me, I've just bought darling little Rex."
I've got a busy day of stroking ahead of me.
"Out of interest, what would you do if you were me?"
"Some kind of nose job, I imagine."
About the burglary.
"That's easy - make a few cutbacks, fire some of the fat ones."
"And if you're very low on grain, you're gonna have to raise the price."
"- No, you're right, and I don't."
"That doesn't mean I feel that way now, though."
"No, now you feel guilty."
You're still scared.
You're just scared of what I'll do to you.
"Well, that's true."
- You were really terrified?
"- Jenna, I am terrified."
"So am I, you idiot."
"I'm scared I'm gonna be a bad mother, and you won't love me, and you'll ignore me, and..."
"I won't want you, and the whole thing will fall apart and I won't know what to do."
"- Baby, that's not gonna happen."
- How do you know?
Because I know.
"- You know now, you didn't know before?"
- Yes.
I know now.
Were you telling me the truth last night?
You didn't sleep with her?
I was telling you the truth.
But then I went back.
Fuck you!
Jenna.
Calm down!
Listen to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
- Get the fuck out!
- I'm telling you the truth!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
- Here.
"- God, that stinks."
"Yeah, but it's gonna keep your face from swelling up like a pumpkin."
Hold it.
Here.
Hold it on there.
"So, whatcha gonna do ?"
It's payback time.
Either you down or you not.
Either you my boy or you ain't.
Simple as that.
"Oh, ha !"
"Hey, baby, we lit it up out there."
I am serious.
"Did you see us, ""D"" man ?"
Do you see us ?
We're talking.
Anyway.
"Hey, baby, we lit it up."
"- Oh, man, come on, man !"
"- That shit ain't funny, man."
- You damn right it ain't funny.
- l thought you liked it down there.
"That's your specialty, ain't it ?"
Crawling on the floor like a bitch.
That was a reflex action in the heat ofthe moment.
You're just plain rude and wrong to bring that shit up in mixed company.
- l'm gonna go home.
Are you ready ?
"- No, he's not ready."
He's talking to me.
"It's an ""A"" and ""B"" conversation."
- What about you?
- That's okay.
- We'll just stay for one night.
- No vacancies on the weekend.
I think he's fooling us.
It wasn't so expensive before.
I agree.
It's a rip off.
The rooms seem pretty much empty.
- See?
No one's here.
- You're right.
He was trying to make you stay longer.
"We'll stay here the night, and I'll look for some place cheaper."
- Let's look for one after we eat.
- Sure.
There's a lighthouse.
The sandstorm is not so bad.
How fortunate.
"Oh yeah, I enjoyed the music."
- Wasn't it nice?
- Yeah.
- Did you really like it?
- Yes.
The melody is soothing.
Nothing exaggerated.
You sung how an average person would.
I liked that amateur feel to it.
I admire your good taste in music.
"Changwook, I admire you as well."
How?
It's hard for a married man to openly bring along his girlfriend like you.
Let's go after him.
"No, you stay here."
Put your hands up!
Put 'em up!
I only got one arm.
What do you want?
Put that down.
What do you want from me?
I want to let bygones be bygones.
I'm not falling for that.
"I lost an arm, but otherwise I'm fine."
And?
And nothing.
Tell me what you want!
I want to let bygones be bygones.
Maybe you don't believe me.
My arm's gone.
It ain't gonna grow back.
But here I am.
So it's money you want?
Money?
"Yeah, I want to make money with you guys, work with you guys."
"I thought I could take the respectable route, but I was a real dope."
So here I am.
What else can I do?
Be an organ grinder?
"No, I'd rather steal."
I did everything I could.
"But that's over and done with, even if it costs me my neck."
- So this is your latest idea?
"- No, no, no!"
I did everything I could!
"Can I see your driver's license, please?"
But I don't understand how that happened.
I just...
- You lose something?
- A few hundred pounds of baby food.
- Now are you gonna help or what?
- Sure.
Okay.
No problem.
Call Caltrans.
Tell them to get a unit to clear this up.
And will you take over here?
We're supposed to be at central for a court call.
All right.
Okay.
"When you get reloaded, just make sure that latch is secure, okay?"
Yeah.
I'll sit on it if I have to.
I'm sorry.
I could have sworn I locked her up.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
We're late.
Getraer gets nervous when I'm not on time.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, what's he gonna do?"
"I mean, you're already on probation."
Yeah.
"If he had his way, he'd put my whole family on probation."
"Honey, look."
It's gotta be worth at least 40 bucks.
Chippies.
Yeah.
How long do you think we can go on like this?
"Still at this, are we?"
"So, you told me she was dead."
"Look, tell me."
"Burnt down, a man's worth $4.40."
- Excuse me?
- That's what you said.
- When?
- In the car.
"When all's said and done, you know, carbon and minerals."
A human being's worth less than five bucks.
I said that?
"Well, you know me, I talk a lot of shit."
"But if you say I said it, then I suppose I should believe you."
What about it?
We walk.
Both of us.
"Well, you might walk but her..."
That's impossible.
She knows too much.
She's got the codes.
She's got the cypher.
She's compromised.
It's gotta stop.
I'll get you a prescription for Ativan.
That will stop your conscience bothering you.
Yeah.
"Well, take a look at that."
It's a copy of the broadcasts.
The ones she stopped.
Number 14 might be of interest.
Thank you...
for your help.
Your dinner is getting cold.
"I know you're not very happy with me right now, but I am only looking out for your best interests."
I made that noodle casserole you like so much.
"Oh, Amanda."
"Hey, hon?"
Where the hell are they?
"This could be the biggest move you bust all night, so we just wanna make sure you have it down."
Meet her at the door.
Compliment her.
Walk her over to the table.
Offer her a seat.
Yes.
Care to demonstrate?
Would you like a seat?
No.
"No, no."
You have to pull the chair out for her.
Oh.
And then just slip it underneath her as she sits.
Not too fast or you'll take her out at the knees.
Right.
Not too fast.
Why am I even worried?
You'll be fine.
Does it look okay?
?
I love this.
"The lights, the table, everything."
And the window in my room.
How'd you even get the idea for that?
- What?
- Where am I?
With me.
In my world.
What do you mean?
How could you bring me here?
I asked...
But you didn't reply.
"Obviously, I was drunk, right?"
Just a second.
What did you mix in my drink?
It took me 25 years to find you.
What?
What if I tell you that we've met before?
What if I tell you there was a time when we loved each other like crazy?
And then someone separated us.
What would you say to that?
Then I'd say that you have gone crazy and you need help.
No.
No.
I am not crazy.
Doctors too used to say the same.
They were treating me.
They were trying to erase the image from my mind.
But how could I forget you?
I found you.
All the questions became meaningless.
My existence is for you.
- This is what the universe wants.
- Just leave me.
Let me go.
"- Wait Saira, wait!"
"I ought to pay your fee, oughtn't I?"
I haven't presented you with a bill yet.
How about this to begin with?
Not that it's enough.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's much more than most people pay.
It doesn't seem near enough to me.
"Harry, listen..."
"Oh, sorry."
"Come along, will you?"
It's getting late.
Well...
But...
But you aren't really going just because he says?
"No, no, no."
But I have to go now.
But look here.
Don't you understand?
I ain't no...
I ain't no...
"No, I know you're not."
You're a girl with her heart just where it ought to be.
Maybe a little too generous.
"Because you're a nice, pretty girl, next time be more careful about the company you pick, huh?"
"Well, but..."
"But you are here, ain't you?"
"Yes, but I shouldn't be."
"And if you really knew me, you'd know I don't wanna be."
"Well, I..."
I picks only them as wants my company.
- I'm sorry.
Stop!
It's none of your business!
You'll get hurt!
I told you!
You'll get hurt.
You traitors mixed the two factions.
"No, we haven't."
"Actually, they're the same style."
"Yes, you just haven't realized it."
Kung-fu is no fixed motion!
It's endless!
Go!
Stop!
Stand back!
They're geniuses to have mixed the two factions.
I must kill the two traitors!
"Brother, they set a good example."
We shouldn't kill them.
Fung-wu's master and Jun-kit's sister were killed by us so that we could learn their styles.
"They taught us, so they're our masters now."
Release them!
- Brother!
- Your Highness!
- He's a monk now!
- He's a monk now!
Master!
"Yan-ling, behave like a girl!"
"Master, I wish to go to the restaurant with you."
Go then!
What are you talking about?
Nothing!
What did you say?
- That's enough.
- I thought you quit smoking.
- The gum didn't work.
Who's she?
- That's my new partner.
- Not bad.
- You didn't know about that?
"- No, why should I?"
Coming back to the force?
See what you're missing?
Tommy!
- You want to get some dinner?
- What did I say?
- I just invited him to dinner.
- Go up there!
- He hasn't changed a bit.
"- Yeah, that's the problem."
- What do you know?
- We just fished out the body.
Don't play games with me.
I want to know what you know.
You don't want to hear it.
It's the same guy.
- The same guy?
As in Polish Hill?
- Fair hair.
Good bodies.
"These women were shot, not strangled."
They had neck bruises and were bound wrist and ankle.
- Eiler told me you know this girl.
- A lot of guys knew her.
"If I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't want to solve this case."
- If you need anything else...
Yeah.
"Actually, um, is there any reason why people would be uncomfortable with me being here?"
No reason.
It's great.
But I'm swamped.
I should go.
"No, no, please."
"Really, I feel like I have spinach in my teeth and nobody is telling me."
We all just really care about the senator.
"Personally, I think you make a really cute couple."
Couple!
C...
Couple?
No.
"No, no, no, no, no."
We are...
That...
No.
There's no couple.
I'm just part of his communications staff.
- There's no coupling.
- I get it.
You want to keep it on the down low.
I don't want to keep it on the down or the low.
I don't want to keep it anywhere.
There's nothing to keep anyway.
- I arranged for you to go to his ranch.
- For the day.
For the day.
It was one day.
It turned into just a couple of hours.
Thi-I saw the name on the list.
And I checked the profile Thi.
Max students.
"I thought I would stop at the airport, but not verified."
I expect you to believe.
After all that happened?
"Would you like Dave, But I tell you the truth."
- Who are you?
- Do you think I'm going to say?
Try .. quiet!
Everyone to calm down.
Who are you?
If you say ...
My friends would be in danger.
And my family.
And we?
I had a sister.
Thi does not matter.
Crazy fool!
How many pro like you were there?
Asshole.
Do you think I get involved?
"Max, if you want us to believe, You have to prove who you are."
If you do not want to tell us and then show us.
Empty your pockets!
Now!
And passports.
Take out of pocket ...
Tell the truth.
Are you happy now?
Stupid stupid!
Enough for now.
"Encouragement my ass, Daddy!"
You ain't even trying!
"Look, yoga's not my strong suit."
Yoga's not your strong suit?
"Oh, look at this one."
This little one is flexible.
She's good.
She's really good.
"Ooh, fantastic."
So you do like the lizard.
"Now is when we transfer the energy, you see?"
Yep.
And you just lay everything on top of her?
Yes.
Lay it on.
Stretch.
"That feels pretty good, hon?"
What?
"Am I straight enough here, do you think?"
Or am I curving a little?
Let me show you.
You feel the transfer of the energy.
"Well, it feels solid."
It is tantric energy.
Yeah.
It is karma.
Yes.
"Okay, now I want all my girls in a downward dog position."
"Yes, this pose contains a tantric hip thrust."
Now you and I will try this.
"You got a pose called ""Yoga Guy Gets His Ass Kicked',?"
"""Cause that's my favorite one."
Having a good time in the Judicial.
"How are you, Vincent?"
You get my message?
I prefer to come for you than that we are waiting for you like a fool at home.
"Well I did, did not you?"
Is there for me?
Of course!
"Amin, can you..."
"-Here, we'll share."
You know that Herville leaving?
-Seriously?
He applied for a deputy director of the anti-terrorist unit.
"Poor are getting better, as always."
-There Any others cold?
-It should be.
"One test, Vincent."
By this what you're smelling?
"Well, guys..."
There's no more beer.
Let?
Can.
I'll get my things.
Hello!
"-Back to work, guys!"
"You can not go on like that, Tintin."
"I give all of yourself, okay?"
Just what you did not shot.
-He threatened me.
This is the worst-case scenario legitimate defense.
-Get a grip.
Stop bothering me!
Nothing I did not ask!
- Are you lonely?
- Yes.
I have no expectations.
Nothing.
We should earn the real thing without any help from others.
But I think I still want to get it through people.
I know I shouldn't expect it of them.
- A real pleasure meeting you.
- Same here.
"Me, too."
"You know my intentions were genuine earlier, right?"
"Yes, of course."
You never quit.
So strange.
I wonder what's so fun about it.
They're just enjoying themselves.
Why did Nature have to divide us into male and female?
I'm so sick of it.
"You're a male, yourself."
You know that.
"Yeah, yeah."
That's why I'm like this.
Want to drink some more?
"Yes, well, as you like."
As I like?
So you want to drink more or not?
"Really, do as you like."
"If you want to drink, then do so."
"Okay, I'll go buy some more."
"Moonsook, I need to ask you something."
Can you come over here?
Sure.
It's humiliating.
Yeah?
"How much did you lose, 500?"
A grand?
This is a way for us to get close again.
"Hey,"
I almost got killed a few weeks ago.
Sorry if it's affected your sex life.
That's not what I meant.
"Why don't you tell them,princess?"
Huh?
It was 3.
"Ladies, tango comes from the portuguese"
"""tangere."""
To touch.
It's all about touch.Not talk.
"Turns out talk is cheap,bro,huh?"
"A little tight,don't you think?"
It's fine.
We'll adjust it when we get in the ambulance.
"Man,look at this,my fingers are turning blue."
"I'm thinking your boyfriend's the senior guy here, maybe he can take a look."
My partner is busy.
I can wait.
"You didn't mean ""senior guy,"" did you?"
You meant white guy.
Is that what you meant?
Ha ha!
That's what he means.Kick his racist ass!
"You,shut up."
"And you, a little respect,or we'll leave you all here."
"I don't need your help,son."
Well...
We won't give up.
We'll just keep looking.
"Today, tomorrow..."
"Oh, not tomorrow."
The race is tomorrow.
"Well, Roger's more important than the race."
"Oh, Thomas, you know, I get this feeling down deep in my solar plexus... that if you really try..."
I mean really try real hard... you can win this race.
"And if you win, everything will be okay for Roger and me."
"I mean, the police will find him and... and he'll give back the money and we'll get married."
You know what I mean?
"Yeah, I know."
Beauty Knows No Pain.
Yeah.
?
Beyond the reef?
?
Where the sea is dark and cold?
?
My love has gone?
?
And our dreams grow old?
?
Someday I'll know?
?
She'll come back?
"Remember, this is your best event."
So don't go saving your energy for the other events.
Got it?
Yeah.
Don't forget.
I've been instructed not to sell you any more.
What?
!
You're demonstrating addictive behavior.
You seem like a nice person;
I hope you get help.
No!
"You go to hell, zit-face!"
(sobbing)
"(stops sobbing, clears throat)"
"Hey, you guys want to make a quick buck?"
"Uh, is it gay stuff?"
Do you need it to be?
No.
Good.
I didn't want to have to make that decision.
"Here, take this money and buy me..."
CLERK:
"Sir, if you don't go away,"
I'll have to call the police.
(grunting)
(window crackles)
"Good-bye, Debbie."
I guess we'll never get to have ugly children together.
(grunts)
(maniacal laughter)
You checking me out?
"Well, too late."
You can't have none of this!
And I would've done anything.
Anything!
(maniacal laughter)
He really likes you and John.
I can tell.
Think he looks at y'all like you're some kind of heroes or something.
"Well, we're..."
We're far from that.
"You might want to tell him that then, if you know what I mean."
I've got a little girl in there who needs her daddy.
Dale doesn't know any better.
He watches TV.
I read nonfiction.
"Well, hey."
Hey.
"Hey, John, what do you say we head back?"
"Oh, no, come on, guys."
The night is young.
Y'all want some cookies?
We all do.
"No, we wouldn't dare try."
Very serious meal.
They're in here.
I got to go pee.
Pee off the porch.
Yeah.
Shit.
"You know, Dale..."
This whole case is our problem.
"I mean, what I'm saying is, you can be as involved, or uninvolved, in the actual apprehension of these guys as you want."
Assuming they show up.
"Well, if they do, I'll be there."
You got a nice spot here.
"Nice house, nice family."
You're a lucky guy.
But this time it's totally about the crying.
So he showed a little emotion.
Girls are supposed to like that.
I do not need the chase.
"Bella,you're a control freak."
You love a project.
"To you,an ambivalent guy is like a poorly organized closet."
I don't...
I don't want ambivalence.
I want to be adored.
Johnny's great.
The guy touches my face.
You know how many face-touching guys are left out there?
I hope it's a similar amount to the number of hand-washing guys.
"Good morning,my love!"
"Dude,just sack up,already."
Geez!
I saw it.
It was fine.
It was cute.
Whatever.
Excuse me.
Gotta go to the office.
Later.
What the hell did you do to this thing?
Were you hanging from it?
Nothing.
I don't know.
It's old.
- You had sex right there.
- Shut up.
- Right where your father is.
Huh?
Your attitude makes me sick!
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking to you!
If you don't take any advice... you'll never solve your problems!
I don't have any problems!
"- Oh, yeah?"
- You have a problem!
Sure.
Typical.
You are the problem!
Your obstinacy is my only problem!
- How come?
- You aren't reliable.
I have to smooth things out with Gerd!
"Sorry, but you got yourself into it!"
I don't get it.
You don't want to change a thing.
You only want to be left in peace.
Make an effort.
You know what's really ironic?
That you can't stand your father... but you say the same crap as him!
What do you know about my father?
I just have to look at you to know everything.
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Leave me alone!
- You just want to hurt me!
- Then cry!
It's true!
You enjoy hurting me!
Ouch!
Are you crazy?
Please sit down.
How do you like it here?
"It's a beautiful country, isn't it?"
- Yes.
- Could I see your papers?
"- Oh, come on."
You can overdo things.
- I'm supposed to check all civilians.
Certainly.
Don't get worked up.
There you are.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Where are you going?
"To the radio room, to check everything."
These militiamen are fanatical.
They'd frisk their own granny.
- We have nothing to hide.
- But it's unnecessary.
He's just a busybody who's seeing how far he can go.
Who is he going to call by radio?
The Holy Father?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Priests have a sense of humour too.
Everything's all right.
Open the gate.
We're going to the depot now.
We'll be there soon.
- I'm sure it's hotter here than it is in hell.
- It might get even hotter.
"Oh, I see, yes."
We're nearly there now.
This is the fuel depot.
I'll call you tonight.
"Won't you sit down, Miss Kelly?"
My money do all this?
"Yes, your money and my brains."
Except that it wasn't your money.
You stole it from me.
To steal from a thief is no crime.
"Look, I'm broke because of you."
"Well, how would you like a job?"
Doing what?
Working for me.
I could use a pretty thief in my business.
I'd wind up in jail.
Not my way you wouldn't.
Yours for sure.
I'd be no use to you.
I'm not really a thief.
I saw you pull a little job.
"Small stuff, but it showed promise."
The wallet dropped on the floor.
I was tempted.
I was broke.
I never dreamed of picking up that wallet would end that way for Chuck.
He tried to kill me.
He loved me.
He was just trying to help me.
"You know, you and I are very much alike."
"Oh, we're both crooks."
Only there's one difference.
I don't want to be.
And you can't help yourself.
I like you.
"I understand that, and thank you."
Yeah.
"So, uh, what's the plan?"
"Well, 7 AM we leave from here-"
"- Riley, no."
Stop.
He's not part of the crew.
Didn't my sister tell you?
You're not in.
"I understand that, Connor."
"I was just, wanted to see what you guys had planned."
No.
This is exactly my problem with you.
You're problem with me?
"You want me to take care of this, boss?"
Step back.
You just tell me to step back?
Don't tell me to step back.
I'll step back if I want.
"I'll step off, I'll step up to the streets if I want to."
"You know what my problem is with you, Ollie?"
Your lack of respect.
That's my problem with you.
"I, I respect you."
No you don't.
You don't trust me.
Never have.
Maybe that's because you've landed me in jail twice.
That's not helping.
You're not helpin'.
Where'd you get this guy?
I told you to play dead.
On your feet.
Hold on just a second.
Where are your manners?
"If you try something, I'll kill her!"
Don't make it worse for yourselves.
Come out with your hands up.
We won't hurt you.
"Aldin, I'm here!"
Don't worry anymore.
Your Renato is here.
You're gonna ruin everything!
"Renato, I want to go home!"
Don't worry.
I'll take you home.
"Shut up, for God's sake!"
Get him out of here.
Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
Don't get so excited.
I'll keep still.
Tie him up!
Listen to me.
The dastards took a shot at me!
Ask for a plane.
In exchange for what?
For that.
For that thing?
Would you exchange a plane for that?
"A child, a woman, a priest, yes, dut that?"
Pretend I'm not here.
It doesn't matter.
You have two minutes... or we'll open fire.
"Come and get us, you dastards!"
"Oh, God, I'm not pregnant."
I'm not pregnant.
That's ridiculous.
- Chug a beer then.
PAIGE:
"No, I'm not chugging a beer."
CATHERINE:
Chug a beer.
PAIGE:
"We're in love, you assholes."
"That's what people do when they're in love, they get married."
But you know what?
"Not everybody gets married, you know?"
There are many people who never get married.
"Well, thanks for the inspirational pep talk."
What she meant to say was that it's fine that you broke up with Neil.
Right.
Tons of people make the choice to be alone.
They're happy.
Look at Al Pacino.
"Never been married, happy as a clam."
Would that...?
Am I...?
Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?
"No, Bethie, we just..."
We want you to be happy.
"Well, then you should have rethought the coral."
LAURA:
"Oh, her face."
- Your face.
- Don't make her cry.
I'm sick of these coral jokes.
I didn't mean to kill him.
I didn't mean it.
He's all right.
I didn't mean to...
He's fine.
"Calm down, be brave!"
- You stay there!
-Jeffrey!
Let's get out of here.
Then you can arrest me.
Let's getJenny out of here.
The car's outside.
Come on!
I won't let you put me behind bars!
Throw the gun down.
You wouldn't kill a cop.
Thankyou.
You could have killed me with one shot.
I don't kill anybody until I know they are the real enemy.
- Do you really know me?
- Fate controls everything.
The only person who really knows me turns out to be a cop.
You could always give yourself up.
No.
I made a promise.
I keep my word.
"Sometimes, I really envy you, your freedom."
It's something I don't have.
"I believe in justice, but nobody trusts me."
I have the same problem.
You're an unusual cop.
And you're an unusual killer.
"You know, a car is like a man."
It needs to rest and restore itself.
It's given up the ghost.
It's overheating.
Can it be mended?
"Yes, it will work again."
Don't ask so many questions or I'll give up the ghost too... at this altitude.
I've forgotten my book.
- What?
- l've forgotten my book.
"Don't worry, the others will bring it."
I have exams.
They'll be coming up to join us soon.
I have to study.
I'll tell them to bring it.
I have to study to have a good grade.
What a pest...
"Ali, bring him up the book."
Where is it?
On top of the dashboard.
People always come this way?
"No, there are several different paths."
It's a tough one.
This isn't the main path.
Where is it?
It's a long way off.
This path is shorter.
- ls that why we've taken it?
- Yes.
"Wait, why are you going so fast?"
It was the best way!
That's what you want.
And so what if they laugh?
- So what?
- Don't tell me what I know... you haven't been through things like me.
"And I hope I'll never do, if that makes me so scared."
- I'm not scared!
"- Yes you are, Violet."
"You don't trust anyone, or anything.."
You never did.
I trusted you!
What?
I said I trusted you!
When did you stop?
The second I saw that goddamn dress on your back!
That's just perfect then.
Why?
Because now you don't have anything at all.
- So what are you trying to say?
- I just said it.
"Say it again, if you have the guts."
- You heard me!
- I'm gonna kick your ass!
Cut it off bitch!
You're gonna mess up my new dress.
My landlady was coming up the street.
I was just... just messin' with her.
Never shot a gun before.
- How was it?
- What do you aim on for some new shoes now?
- Shut up about it!
- You shut up about it!
- Make me!
- I just did!
Ariel?
Where are you going?
"Ariel, what are you doing here with this riffraff?"
I'm going to see Ursula.
"[Gasps] Ariel, no!"
No!
She's a demon.
She's a monster.
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.
But...
"But, I..."
Come on!
This way.
[Creatures moan]
"[Gasps, grunts]"
[Pants]
[Ursula] Come in.
"Come in, my child."
We mustn't lurk in doorways.
It's rude.
One might question your upbringing. [chuckles]
"Now, then, you're here because you have a thing for this human, this prince fellow."
Not that I blame you.
"He is quite a catch, isn't he?"
"Well, angelfish, the solution to your problem is simple."
The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself.
[Gasps] Can you do that?
"My dear, sweet child."
That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
"To help unfortunate merfolk, like yourself, poor souls with no one else to turn to."
"Would Elisa roast it, just for me?"
If you catch one.
"Come, come here..."
Got you at last!
I caught it!
Help!
I'll show him yet!
"I'm only little, but I'm nifty, see."
"Jean, I discovered something awful!"
We'll write to daddy about your new tooth!
He'll be amazed at you.
When he comes back.
"My little turtle-dove, if it weren't for you..."
So that's the way it is!
That pigeon must be done away with!
Where am I?
What is this?
What have I done to deserve this?
A sword!
"You ugly bird, there..."
I'll get you yet!
Damned bird!
"We'll wring your neck, no more love-notes!"
"Good morning, Elisa."
"Hello, my little devil, have you seen my pigeon?"
"No, let's hope a fox didn't get it!"
Beast!
"I was frightened, where've you been?"
"Good morning, Elisa."
"Did you sleep well, Johann?"
"How else, under one roof with a lovely woman!"
For you I'd sleep on a bare rock!
"I'm telling you, Joe pulled a gun on Patsy."
"A guy like him, self-defense?"
Not a chance.
"- If you killed him, you're out of luck."
- But I didn't kill him.
You're okay.
Better dive in somewhere till you find out for sure.
You gotta get out of the state.
"Mike, find a hideout."
Quick.
For what?
You've got that much head start.
Keep in touch with the hospital.
"When he goes, you start going."
Laying down on me?
You gonna cover me?
Not if he passes out.
"He's living, I can cover you."
Newspapers won't print a word.
They won't look for you.
If he goes-
"- Patsy, I don't have to kid you."
"--you're all washed up, you're through."
"Listen, get across the state line."
Get in touch with Nasetti.
He'll help you find a safe place.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Take your hats off.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
Doesn't seem like Sunday without Patsy around.
"Head to the south, See what I can find."
"Yeah, copy that."
Didn't see once piece of gold In that hole.
Am I headed In the right direction?
You need to turn right.
Turn right.
Look where he is.
He's way out there.
He's on his own.
I don't know.
It's looking like.
"All the right materials, Nice heavy material,"
But there ain't Anything here.
Now I'm starting to get Worried.
I can't see over here.
100 miles East of nome.
At the bluff...
Shawn pomrenke's Pump motor has run out of gas.
"And within seconds, mr."
Gold Will be out of air.
Here he comes.
We ran out of gas.
Umbilical's All twisted up.
Oof.
Out of breath.
That was a lot Of hard work that time.
When Just doesn't go right.
"When things are breaking And there's no gold,"
It gets stressful.
"As soon as that pump died, I could tell the air pressure."
Was dropping And I was losing air.
It was off.
Positive.
We'll walk home.
We almost died.
Yeah.
A-about what you said in the car...
Please don't make fun of me right now.
"No, I would never."
It was actually really honest.
And I need to stop taking shots at your intelligence.
You don't do it that often.
"Well, you miss a lot of it."
Oh.
"There, I did it again."
Did what?
"Uh, it doesn't matter."
"I always considered you to be this self-absorbed person, but you're more substantial than that, aren't you?"
Thank you.
You know what?
I'm blowing off Judo today.
Let's hang out.
What should we do?
Makeovers.
Okay.
Great!
We're gonna walk right past my waxing place.
Say goodbye to that gal stache.
Ow.
Ow!
"If it were easy, everyone would be hot."
"Yep, you know, I-it's not just my feet."
It's from when I walked into the stop sign because you wouldn't give me back my...
"Okay, fine."
She'll take it from me.
But that's not your money.
I must pay for the identity card.
The fun costs 600 Marks!
Why haven't you taken care of it long ago?
- Without any photos?
I need to have her photographed.
And you wanted her to be a witness.
Now don't get worked up!
"But, Bruno, she'll wake up."
She must go away before she gathers her wits.
We can't let that happen!
And I know exactly what's awaiting her when she realizes.
And that is terrible.
I feel... as if it were me.
Attention!
"Photographing now, Miss!"
The camera will click shortly.
What's the matter?
You're not at the dentist's!
Why the sad face?
A passport is not a wanted poster.
It's not so bad.
"Please, a bit more pleasant, Miss!"
Well then!
...
Well then!
...
See?
"When you smile, you look quite pretty."
"Excuse me, please!"
It almost makes me sorry that I must get you an ID card today.
"Oh, great."
Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.
"Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's."
I'll keep an eye on him.
"Well, thanks, Doc."
I've been feelin' a quart low.
"This ain't asphalt, son."
This is dirt.
"Oh, great."
What do you want?
You here to gloat?
"You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle."
"Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips."
"So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert."
I'll put it simple.
"If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turning' right."
Oh...
Right.
That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left!
Yes!
Thank you!
"Or should I say, ""No, thank you""?"
"Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, ""Thank you""!"
Crazy grandpa car.
What an idiot!
Turn right to go left.
Hmm...
Whoa!
Oh!
Ow!
"Oh, that..."
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
- He's a good man.
- But this is tough stuff.
This is body bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There's isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I got to go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface just as I knew when that bullet hit that boy it would keep traveling.
And find its way...
To me.
If only it had found me first.
It is not the way of a lust people !
"How could you lie to me, you butcher !"
How could you make me love you ?
I did not give you permission to leave !
She doesn't need anyone's permission.
Let her go !
Enough of this childishness !
Throw them in the slave pits !
Wait!
These are only lemon sharks!
This is all part of the course.
It is like life.
Like in relationships.
They will not attack unless they feel attacked!
"Marcel, I need you to take the French out of your mouth and tell me what to do!"
Don't let them see your fear.
"Okay, I think we just hold tight, we play it cool, we don't make a move."
What was that?
What?
What was that?
"Jason, stop..."
He said not to panic!
He said not to panic!
I'm sitting in blood!
I'm sitting in blood!
"Marcel, this isn't a drill, buddy!"
You got real sharks here!
It's time to get the guns' and it's time to shoot some fish!
"Here on Eden, there are no guns!"
You got an American life at stake.
One life is not more important than another.
What do I do?
My friends and my wife left me to die.
"You must get out of the chum, but slowly."
Okay.
Swim slowly out of the chum!
Slowly.
Slowly.
"Yes, yes."
"Slowly, baby!"
- It's not gay.
Just take your shirt off.
- It's not gay.
"Why can't I just get, like, all excited and passionately rip it off in the moment?"
- Why can't you just take your shirt off for us?
- Just drop it for now.
"All right, all right."
"Uh, maybe you should punch something."
- There you go.
"- Yeah, you should punch something..."
Why don't you punch this board?
Okay.
Hold it steady for me.
- Watch your eyes.
"- All right, come on."
Oh!
"Oh, that's..."
- That looks like it stings.
"- Oh, my God."
- What's that made out of?
"- It's a board, so it's, you know, made out of wood."
"- It's, like, particle board."
"- It's, like, harder than wood, dude."
- No.
- It's actually softer than wood.
"- Yeah, it's a lot softer than wood."
- Petrified wood.
"- What happened, man?"
I thought you were...
- I don't know.
- I wasn't drunk enough.
- You should be drunk for this.
She's not feeling that well.
"Aw, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while, so..."
I thought that...
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from EST.
"What do you mean, ""Away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
"Uh, for a few days."
"We've, um... had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there."
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
Sandra?
I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm --
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
"Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on -- you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
"Oh, it doesn't matter, really."
"- Who is he, Sandra?"
"I tried to give it to my daughter, but she... threw it back at me."
I think you're about her size.
Could you try it on?
I'll wait in the other room.
Got the bullets.
You'll be surprised how many places I...
What's goin' on?
How do I look?
Ok.
Where did you get it?
He gave it to me.
What for?
"I don't know, Vi."
Can I talk to you a minute?
Have you lost your mind?
- What's your problem?
- You're my problem!
I'll let you borrow it some time if that's what this is about.
It's not about the fucking dress!
"- Yea, right."
- That's exactly right!
"You don't run me, Violet!"
We don't know anybody.
or get involved in stuff or anything like that.
I never went to a prom.
"You did, but I didn't."
- Be glad you didn't!
- Why?
- Because they would laugh at you!
- How do you know?
Because that's what they do if you're different.
"Everybody isn't like that, Vi."
You should disinfect it.
"Yeah, later."
"You know, earlier with the coroner, maybe I went too fast."
You weren't too hot for the idea.
"No, it's OK."
I'm sorry.
You didn't want to.
"Not really, no."
What is it?
"well, you know..."
I'm retiring in 3 months.
"Yeah, so?"
This case looks complicated.
"I might still have to go to court in 1 , maybe 2 years after I retire, so..."
We started and that's what counts.
You sure?
"Yeah, sure."
Found anything interesting?
"Yeah, actually..."
"Come, I have a question for them."
Who wears high heels?
We found fresh tracks.
"we just need to take prints, it'II be easy to find."
"He must be talking about the girl, the dancer."
The dancer?
What dancer?
You never mentioned a dancer.
"He didn't see her, she stayed in my truck until he left."
"When he came back, she had gone back to the hotel."
What's her name?
Samantha... so she said.
"A cutie, fully equipped."
I don't.
I don't care if we fail.
Failing's fine!
"If we go down in flames, at least there were flames!"
Wow.
"If we're gonna do this, I want to do TV that's bold and thrilling and dangerous!"
I can be dangerous.
I-I can.
You don't seem dangerous.
That's what makes me so dangerous.
I like you.
"I like you, too."
I think you are so much more than you've been allowed to be.
Really?
You need to stop trying to please people.
Can you do that?
If that's what you want.
I don't think she's coming back.
Amazing.
She gave you another chance?
You are an evil genius.
You're too kind.
And you're okay with her getting married again?
Yeah.
Why not?
Your ex-wife ever remarry?
No.
I like to think she exhausted all her misery on me and then left the business.
So I'm guessing you don't miss her.
No.
I do miss my current wife.
"Yeah, you guys are idiots."
"He's not feeling well, kids."
I have to call it quits!
That hurt a little on the way out.
- What's this for?
- Careful!
You're going to break it!
"- Don't pull it like that, son."
- What's it for?
For balance.
Maria works with us in the circus.
"No, no."
"From now on, Maria doesn't work anywhere."
"She will simply study and play, right?"
What kind of work?
"She walks along a high wire, way up in the circus ring."
That was in the past.
This whole business about Maria in the circus is all done.
She uses this parasol to help her balance on the tightrope.
Are you her mother?
"No, I'm her godmother."
- What about you?
- I'm her godfather!
Take our picture.
"Right, that's enough."
"Can you walk for us, just a little bit?"
Walk!
Walk!
"Just a little bit, Maria."
Please.
Do you want to walk?
Want to walk the tightrope?
- Who likes magic here?
"and half of you is man, and the other half is woman. (Chuckling)"
"Shame on you, how can you say such things to your elders?"
"Nevermind, come on, let's all have a drink."
Bastard!
I'll tear him to pieces!
"Hey, what are you saying?"
Let's not worry about those things when we have these two beautiful young ladies to enjoy ourselves with.
(laughing)
(banging)
I'm sleeping.
"Hey, what's wrong?"
"He's so cold to us, we've done nothing to him."
Didn't you see his pigtails?
He acts just like a woman!
(Laughing)
He is more like a woman than a man!
"Well, you're a man."
"So, does he love you?"
Shut your mouth!
"Come on, let's go."
"No wait, don't rush."
"No, I can't wait!"
"If you rush, then you're gonna spoil the mood."
What do you want?
I want you to come and undress me.
But not using your hands.
But how?
I can't wait!
Just how am I gonna do that?
"You idiot, you'd use your mouth."
Well?
Do you like that?
"Come on, what are you going to do all by yourself in this gutter?"
"With me, you have a chance!"
You can all rot with her!
"This stare, not for me."
I've got to see Him!
Now I can't see a thing.
Now you can see for real.
"At the end of a regularfilm, I'd go on a killing spree too."
I'd be the hero.
But there are no more heroes.
Just the humiliated.
Stop your bullshit.
Let's walk out of here... barefoot.
"Made off, the rats, welfare!"
"This is the end, my only friend."
I won't have the lake.
There won't be any real revolution.
From now on don't budge!
Hear me?
Watch him.
Save me.
Take me.
Any place you want.
"This film was inspired by ""The Idiot"" by Fedor Dostoevsky."
It is intended as a homage to this great writer.

"Morena, get up on the dam."
I want you to deal with the radio room.
Come on!
José should be ready by now.
- We've got to go there.
- How?
Take a bus?
- We'll go in this.
"- Tia, the tires are flat."
Come on.
"If it doesn't start cooling soon, the chain reaction will start."
You hear that?
"In ten minutes, this place is going to be a hole in the ground."
"Now, let's be reasonable."
We have three and a half million dollars in the control room.
And the balance is on the way.
It's a deal.
I do not compromise.
"- Hey, what are you guys doing?"
- Nothing!
Nothing!
We're doing nothing.
"Hey, kids!"
How did these children get past security?
"Sir, the people destroying the furnace kidnapped my brother."
"If I could see him, I might stop them."
- She can do it!
- She can do it.
- Do what?
"Impossible, they're inside the room."
They've sealed the door somehow.
- What part has to be fixed?
- The emergency cooling system.
- Where is it?
- Five levels down.
But it's too late.
I think somebody needs to work on their sense of humor.
It was a joke.
Oh.
I'm Monica.
Got it.
Monica.
"So, Mike- Yes?"
What sort of impression do I make?
Come again?
If we were in a bar and you hadn't seen me before.
Oh.
Can I speak candidly?
I insist you speak candidly.
I'd think you were a hot piece of ass.
Good answer.
- Sarasvati.
"- Yes, Miss Mancuso?"
You told me you would have the opening day revenue report by now.
Where is it?
I'm afraid it's still being prepared.
Unacceptable.
Mr. Deline had some special requests.
He suggested you speak to him.
Come on.
Show some cleavage.
"It's a casino, not a convent."
"Okay, okay."
That's me taking the first counterfeit I found.
"Now, let's run it backwards... until we see that specific tray being removed from the cart."
All right?
Wow.
That's an easy gig.
Aren't you hungry?
I want to eat something yummy.
Will you treat me?
"Sure, what do you want?"
Something really tasty.
Like spicy rice cakes.
Spicy rice cakes?
Spicy rice cakes?
Don't know if they have it here.
Don't think so.
Do they sell rice cakes here?
"If they do, I can cook it myself."
I'm really good at it.
Really?
Let's check out the grocery store.
Don't go out of your way.
"Don't worry, stupid."
Let's go down to that sand dune.
There's something real neat.
What is it?
I'll show you.
What is it?
"You see, I got the splinter out."
"I didn't get it out myself, and didn't know when it happened."
But I think it was when I bowed on my knees.
You went down on your knees?
"Yeah, I think that's when the splinter got out."
Why did you bow?
Come on and see.
"You'll feel like doing it, too."
Why are you laughing?
"Alright, let's go."
–Nothin'.
"Hey, it's cool."
You can tell me.
No.
It doesn't matter.
I gotta get back.
"Seeing the way you stiffed your partner, I figure you're just one big hard-on today."
–Excuse me?
–You know what an officer-involved shooting means?
It means that we're all involved.
–I told the truth.
–When it comes to your partner's career... the truth is like grits.
You don't serve it up plain.
You put a little salt on it.
You goddamn rookies.
$20 apiece.
I'll let 'em both go for 35.
That's real...
That's like chiffon.
And this look good with your eyes.
And this is silk right here.
This will look real good with...
"Drop the clothes, ladies."
"Although, you have got to have that one."
–She's keeping that one for free.
–Wait...
Whoa!
"–I got receipts for all this, man!"
"–Oh, yeah?"
That's funny.
I got a police report for it from Dress For Less.
"Dealin' stolen merchandise, Taylor."
"I was thinking, ""How am I gonna back up?"""
I don't even know how to drive forward on a stick shift.
- I can't believe you left her there.
- I can.
Good.
I think that's the first time anyone's sympathized for her character there.
People cheer.
I love how she checks her boobs to see if there's something wrong.
"Her boobs must be misaligned, that's why he backed away."
- That's so funny.
"- It's so sweet, though."
That's so funny.
"- Mike, you're..."
This is terrific.
- This is a great moment.
This is really late.
- Oscar.
Oscar.
- Right?
Really late.
"- Yeah, it's probably 5:30, 5:45."
"- Well, maybe a Golden Globe."
Look how great.
That was really me doing that.
I really actually did that.
"Mike, you're a handsome act..."
Good actor.
I just want to sum this up.
"If you wanna give us any compliments, feel free."
"- Yeah, go for it."
- You guys are handsome.
You're so good.
Confirmed.
"Set a course for Destiny, speed standard by six."
- Where's that?
- Confirmed.
- What have you got there?
"- Why are we leaving them behind, what's going on?"
Where is Destiny?
!
"According to Avon, it's a story that doesn't have an end yet."
"All right then, we'll start with the beginning."
Probe.
Does this mean anything to you?
54124?
"- No, I don't think so."
- Should it?
Is it important?
"Yes, it is important."
Monitor response?
- The air is stale in here.
- The ventilator's closed.
- Well?
- Zero response.
There's nothing I can do.
It will have to be replaced.
I shall need laser transfer linkage.
Have you got any?
"I think so, in the storage hold."
I'll go and check.
"Stay here, I'll get it."
You'll need a torch.

[ELECTRONIC HUM]
- Who?
Why is this man threatening my husband with a gun?
- Do not allow...
- Shut her up.
"-Get down, you Nazi bitch."
-No no!
"Cookie, Cookie, Cookie!"
No no no no!
Cookie!
Do not!
Do not!
Please do not leave me!
It's a bad plan anyway.
"The best strategy is, to destroy the enemy from within."
He must defeat himself.
"Do not be an enemy, Bishop!"
The personification of the devil is a symbol of all evil.
In the form of humanoids.
"That's you, black blood!"
"Let me go, black blood!"
I'm going to kill them all!
"Just wait, I'll kill you!"
Keep your breath and keep the peace with God.
Shit!
What do the Noids know about God?
You are raised as rats in the laboratory.
Is the color of our blood so different?
Are not we all children of God?
God did not create you.
-We did.
You are an abomination without a soul.
- I am sorry!
Of course I am.
Take your hands off me.
- Sir?
Am I in error?
- Thank heaven you're here.
- You can see I'm a gentleman.
- Look at his lovely clothes.
"- Take him, Dawlish."
- But you can't.
"- Vizard, you sail tomorrow?"
"- Yeah, Mediterranean."
- So you should count us out for now.
- No need.
Spread word to that fleet.
"If both fleets struck at once, we'd win our demands overnight!"
"- You'll act soon, then?"
"- Yes, soon every ship will mutiny."
- Before spring?
- Depends.
How's your crew?
Forty more pledges.
- We have half the ship already.
- Good.
"Poor men, driven like cattle."
I don't understand it.
Having to be pressed to go to sea?
- Not everyone wants to leave home.
- Think of it!
Sailing the Defiant and fighting the French.
You sound just like your father.
"Anyway, the admiral may not agree to let you go."
Father's back.
Just pass me the bill.
Okay!
Sir Wong is looking for you.
What's wrong with you?
You used my money to solve a kidnap case.
You saved the guy but my money is gone.
Now my money is strewn all over the streets.
Isn't that too much?
Capturing the baddies at all cost.
"Bro, you think I'm the richest man in HK?"
"I'm not your bro, Mr. Mak."
I'm your son.
Are there other cops like you?
Using money to work?
You're too busy to spend your money.
Treat it as a good cause.
You think I'm a charity?
Fine...
You only call when I spend your money.
Meet and scold me in person.
Isn't that more satisfying?
I'm always free to meet you.
I never wanted you to be a cop.
"I warn you, I'll freeze your account."
Excuse me...
Where's the resource room?
You can't buy style.
Shit!
We've the same tie!
"I asked for resource room, not fashion advice."
"No resource room, evidence room is ahead."
Thank you.
The wounded go before the dead.
We thought we'd better not move him.
They zapped me good.
You're not gone yet.
"Would you do me a favor, sir?"
Would you take a touch with me?
I sure will.
"Thank you, sir."
"Another favor, sir?"
What is it?
"You remember the decision I was trying to make, about my name?"
KIRBY:
The signs?
I remember.
That's it.
"There it is, sir."
You're sure that's what he wanted?
Affirmative.
That's what he wanted and that's what he's going to get!
Maybe he liked the idea of having so many men think about him every day.
Besides it sings.
It sings?
That's what he said.
It sings.
ROBIN:
Provo's Privy.
It does sing!
"Last time we met, Colonel Cai and I were going to tell you about a plan we had and ""A"" camp 107 got hit."
This can't wait till you take over.
I want you briefed.
- Why way out here?
- This is top secret.
Right?
What?
Already expended it?
Just got 30 acres of vineyard.
Wine?
Yes.
"If I can make it, I'll send you some."
"That, will be a pleasure."
If we make through alive...
Today we will only look for garbage again?
"Bring a basket, a sandwich or something..."
It's like going hiking...
In a bleak place though....
A farewell to Arms ( Buki Yo Saraba )
Nice catch.
The UAV is back!
The camera!
The camera!
Prepare that one for the next launch.
Yes!
"Yankee, good job."
Under control.
Report status?
Arriving in about 5 minutes.
Before arrival we will launch an UAV.
Understood...
"About that protective suits... no matter how you look it, look awfully hot."
"It comes with aircon, you know."
You fool.
Look at the monitor.
"Take a look before you drop, idiot!"
I was looking down...
So?
I don't get how a living person can be a ghost.
It's not a living human.
He died a long time ago.
He must have been human once.
But not anymore.
"So then, the ghost got inside him?"
"Well, that's how it started."
"Not everything that moves, breathes, and talks is alive."
Countless people have perished because they didn't understand that.
If it's not stopped... that demon will destroy this village.
Demon?
An evil ghost!
"Even among other demons, he's a master of evil."
"If that's true, why did it have to be... your daughter?"
What sin did that young girl ever commit?
Yes.
"If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch?"
No.
He's just fishing.
Not even he knows what he'll catch.
"He just threw out the bait, and your daughter took it."
That's all it was.
Park Chun-bae
- This one?
- No.
Money.
"Yes, money."
21 dollars more.
- No!
- That's okay.
"Oh, come on."
"OK, long story, short version."
I was going to marry his ex-wife.
(CHUCKLES) Seriously?
!
"What, and now you're mates, and everything?"
"(CHUCKLES) Well, mates is probably pushing it."
So where is she?
"His ex, your missus?"
She died.
Ouch!
Sorry.
- Mouth on me sometimes.
- That's all right.
You weren't to know.
- What about you?
How do you know him?
- Don't.
Not really.
"As far as I'm concerned, he's this random smurf popped up out of nowhere."
So why the...?
Long time ago my dad killed this girl.
"It was by accident and everything, but... he panicked."
Cut her up and whatnot.
- Put all the bits in wheelie bins.
- Jesus.
I'm sorry.
"So this bloke, Luther, was one of the coppers that put him away."
And your dad?
Killed himself in prison.
"Jenny, listen, I know how hard..."
how hard it can be.
Losing someone that way.
Drop the weapon!
It's over!
Aah!
Aah!
Get away from me!
"Trevor, you don't want to do this."
Let me help you or you're gonna die.
You help me?
"Yeah, right!"
I know about Preston.
I know that he put you up to all of this.
You damn half-breed!
You don't know anything!
"Trevor, we pulled your phone records."
You called Preston 13 times today.
So what?
!
"We pulled his voicemail messages, too."
"He's using you, kid."
That's why he won't call you back.
Get out of here or I'll kill this bitch!
Listen to me.
Just listen.
"When those men broke in your house, you know who ended up buying it?"
It was your man Preston.
And he got it for nothing.
You're a liar!
All you people do is you lie!
"The men convicted of killing your family, they both said somebody paid them off to do that job."
They just couldn't prove it.
So now they're doing life.
"Yeah, well, they should have gotten the chair!"
What's left of it.
This is the place that you're trying to save?
Mm-hmm.
It's so beautiful.
You think so?
Yeah.
Why would anybody want to ruin this?
Well...
Look...
A glossy ibis.
I watch a lot of documentaries on TV.
"You know, maybe I don't have to leave."
"I mean, it's so safe here and nobody knows about this place."
Except you and me.
Just you and me.
And the 20 of us.
What makes for good television?
"The story as it breaks, live, coming to you from the bad guy himself?"
"I mean, we wouldn't want your viewers to change the fucking channel, would we?"
What the hell's this world coming to?
- Nice.
- I'm sorry.
I'll buy you a new one.
Subject has just passed Flowerbowl.
I'm about 30 yards back.
- Stay with him.
I'm coming on your right.
- I can't see him.
Where is he?
- He's in front of the Pier One truck!
- All right.
We just passed the Flowerbowl.
Take a shower.
They're gonna be here soon.
You need to clean the grill.
"Why can't we just stay in, just the two of us, and just not do that?"
"You mean like when I'm up and I am doing things, and you're asleep?"
Let's save that for another afternoon.
Get up.
The joke's on you.
I'm not a ventriloquist dummy.
- That's all right.
- It's all right.
It's all right.
- You could use that in your act.
- I could.
You want cheese?
- Cheeseburger.
Cheeseburger.
- It's funny.
Can I do it?
Do you mind if I...?
I just don't need everybody touching my cheese.
Just...
No.
This will be mine.
- I'll have cheese.
No cheese for this guy.
- I can't have dairy.
I'm taking this cooking class where we're learning how to make a curry carrot corn queso.
It's like a dip.
"It's for Christmas and couples, or you can put it on salad."
- Was it sponsored by the letter C?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- She looks mad.
"No, that's just her look."
What's that?
"- ""It looks like her number came up."""
- It's a zinger.
She's a lotto girl.
Her number came up.
Get it?
"You remember last year sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post, and he said, ""i'll keep you posted."""
- I heard about that.
- Everybody heard about it.
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
- This is a classic.
- If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to find the right moment."
"Captain, if you're ready to release the body, I can take her downtown."
I still don't get it.
Who'd want to kill the Lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
"- Hey, what are you doing?"
"- Hey, what are you doing?"
"- That was my line, man."
- What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds...
Ask the captain.
"- This is a crime scene, for god sakes."
"- No, you heard me."
You know what?
He must've heard me.
"It's okay, look."
You want to take a swing?
Do it.
Nothing would make me happier.
Just want you to move your truck.
What was I thinking?
"You only beat women, right?"
Listen...
"You're not paying for a double, and even if you... even if you were, it wouldn't include Crazy Horse over there."
That's a whole other deal entirely.
- I'm trying...
- You're not trying hard enough.
"Get rid of him soon, or this doesn't happen."
He left New Haven an hour ago.
He'll be here.
"Yeah, well, I'm just saying."
"No, you're just worrying."
Hmm.
Where else is he going to go
- with a Geiger counter?
- Huh.
[phone rings]
"Hi, Julia."
I did what you asked.
I got him to the restaurant and made sure he was facing the door.
Thank you.
"Look, I know how tough this is for you."
Tough?
This is...
This is tough?
"No matter how this goes down, I lose."
"You get that, don't you?"
"If you're right, the father of my son is nothing better than a con man."
To write me an introduction or two.
You're not exactly inspiring me to send you away.
"What if I offered to stay here at the castle,"
"Even if I were married,"
At your beck and call?
You'd have diane.
"I'd have my station,"
My position.
Find me a rich noble
"Who treats me right,"
"And I'll treat you right, as well."
You've learned many skills at court.
Teach me more.
One suitor a week until I choose.
Agreed?
Agreed.
No.
No more.
I'm in charge now.
Have you found my mother?
"I need her now, more than ever."
They said she's with the king.
Trying to wring more out of henry
"Before I'm married to anyone, no doubt."
But who will you marry?
Have you spoken with bash?
No.
Francis?
Catherine:
Could we have a moment?
What an eventful day.
"Francis's return,"
Okay.
He's got a thing about... clowns.
That's okay.
Lots of people are afraid of clowns.
"Oh, no, no."
He's not afraid of them.
He likes them.
Like a fetish?
"[Sighs] Oh, good Lord."
I-I haven't verified it yet.
I still have to speak with one of his exes.
Okay.
"Keep me posted, will you?"
"Ryan, that is excellent."
Thank you.
"Now, just hold off on giving it to LAPD just until morning."
We have a plan to expose who's behind this.
[Sighs] Or get ourselves killed.
Having second thoughts?
About having a ménage with a trophy-taking serial killer?
No!
What could possibly go wrong?
"Look, this the murder weapon."
All you have to do is distract Austin long enough for me to find this knife.
Let's just hope we don't find it in one of our backs.
Right.
[Alarm beeping] Oh.
Castle:
Wow.
Ooh.
Sorry.
I was setting up a few counter-surveillance precautions.
We're right behind You.
The promising claim.
"Is not an option, And once again,"
Captain kris is forced to go Back to the drawing board.
That means we're not Working tomorrow.
That's what that means.
"It pisses me off, man."
That's life.
"Man, I can't win."
It just seems like I can't stop.
From getting screwed over On a daily basis.
"Under the command Of captain kris,"
The kellys have secured Second place on the scoreboard.
Today is our first Day of mining.
"Go find us Lots of gold, zeke!"
It's gonna be fun.
You need to come up Immediately.
Now I'm starting To get worried.
I can't see over here.
"Take my hand, zeke!"
I am a miner!
[buzzes] [faint infant crying]
[crying continues]
[London] Chip!
I can't.
It won't stop crying.
- She.
She won't stop crying.
"- Yes, ""she."""
I'm not cut out for this.
We made a huge mistake.
Why did you take so long?
I have been expecting you.
I will explain...
I will explain the reason for my visit.
Reasons do not matter.
I only want you to answer some questions about...
It will be best for you to ask nothing.
Can you pour me a drink?
a...drink?
Double?
If you like.
Double.
I only want you to answer one question.
Would you like it if I told you...that I like you?
What do you know about her?
"Oh, you are refering to the murdered girl."
The same.
I know many things.
Tell me.
"I know she was a model, who came to a swimsuit designer's convention."
What else.
And that she was murdered.
The only thing I don't know is who did it.
Are you satisfied?
"No, I am not."
"Surely, you will be."
S.O.S.
he is in the elevator.
its stoped on the second floor.
"Open up, Laura."
Need something?
I want some info on the murdered girl.
Whatever's happening to you penguins... don't blame it on me.
I'm not.
But you can help save them.
"Listen, fella, you look after your kind, and I'll look after mine."
"If I thought like that, I would have left you in that hole."
"That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit."
Get off my beach!
"Wayne, now I'm really gonna hurt you."
I saved your life!
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off... or I'm gonna turn carnivore... with a craving for penguin.
- But...
"- The only ""butt"" I wanna see is yours... walking away."
"Come on, son."
We're wasting precious time.
There's nothing for us here.
"Now, where was I?"
- Right here.
"- Oh, yeah."
- What are you looking at?
- What are you?
BRYAN:
"I don't know, but it sure is ugly."
ERIK:
"No, Pa."
This is so unfair.
[SINGING] After all you have done.
You really deserve better.
Nothing makes sense in this world.
It's all a big pile of crazy.
And the kings are all fools.
BRYAN:
- How long has it been since you saw them?
Almost four years.
A beer?
"- No, I have to...."
- All the others went into town.
"A beer in the canteen, just the two of us."
Is that a date?
We can call it that if it helps.
- It helps.
- Good.
Cheers!
Thank you guys.
"Didn't think we'd let you get away that easily, did you?"
Skinnarland sends his love.
Apparently they're in trouble with the police chief who's threatening to blow their covers.
So you are going to be very busy.
Keep your backs straight.
One-two-three...
Good.
Thanks.
- Einar reports good weather in the area.
- Good.
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.
The war should be over in a couple of months.
I might pop over and see you myself.
"- Good luck, Tronstad."
- Thank you.
Well...
See you soon.
Good luck.
Leif Tronstad never reunited with his family.
- Major?
"- Yes, sir."
Is that General Kemper there bearing toward us?
"I believe it to be, sir."
General Kemper.
I do hope you are not seriously injured.
"They tell me that it's mortal, General."
I do pray God that it is not the case.
Is there anything I can do?
There's nothing more you can do for me.
"But, General Lee, will you see to it that full justice is done for my men who made this charge today?"
"I will do so, sir."
"Thank you, General."
"Thank you, General."
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
I thought we were invincible.
Friends.
It is all my fault.
Hear me.
"Hear me, I pray you."
It is entirely my fault.
Hear me.
Hear me.
"Please, friends."
We must rest now.
We must retire and fight again another day.
And there will be another day.
"Meanwhile, friends, we must show good order."
Never let them see you run.
Do you hear me?
Never let them see you run.
It hurts when I breathe.
"Okay, Judy, I think you've broken your breastbone."
"Add a sternal view, troponin, CT of head, abdomen and pelvis."
What else can you tell us about the vehicle?
There was a bike rack on the roof.
They tried to force me off the road.
They wanted to steal my car.
Am I bleeding?
You hit the window.
It's not bad.
Will I need stitches?
"Did either of them have a weapon, ma'am?"
I don't know.
It happened so fast.
I just wanted to get out of there.
Enough for now.
She's had a concussion.
We need to let her rest before she goes up to the CT.
- We're working here.
"- Sorry, Luka."
We've got a trauma.
We need the room.
"All right, here we go, gently."
Lift up the neck.
"On my count, one, two, three."
Here we go.
We're out of infant C-collars.
Luka do you know if we have any infant C-collars?
You can use towel rolls.
Airway is patent.
I can't hear breath sounds with all the crying.
- Do we have a sat?
Why so wound up?
Are you a first timer?
"2,000 rupees for each of you!"
"That's the rate, take it or leave it!"
The little fucker wants to play posh!
Drag him in boys!
Get in you faggot spreading filth on the streets!
Give the money first.
The motherfucker thinks he is prime piece of ass!
Let go of me!
Don't worry about the three of us you won't get past even one!
Open the door!
Let me out!
Stop the car!
Let me go!
What happened?
Come here...
Mukesh!
What happened?
Show!
"Look, I don't know what's going on with you but whatever it is, get out of it."
Forget the past... start afresh.
"Johnny, I won't give up what is rightfully mine."
Have you lost your mind!
What do you want?
I am not here for you...
My work has been stopped.
Your work?
I told your friend about it...
go ask him.
Who stopped it?
- What do you think?
- But it still works.
- I don't think so.
- And if I sweep the cakes off the table?
Would that help?
"Tilde, we belong to each other."
- Go away.
- Stop it!
- Are you listening to me?
- Go away!
"Tilde, it..."
Let's go home now.
May I look?
- We're not going to make love.
"- No, I just want to look."
"- You may touch them, if you like."
"- No, I just want to look."
- We've never dated anybody else.
- No.
"Remember, when we sat in the old truck   peeling each other's clothes off?"
How old were we?
- Twelve... thirteen.
"- Eleven, I think."
That's pretty advanced for two 11-year-olds.
It's as if the world got bigger with you.
Everything was more fun.
More entertaining.
"If you don't stop shooting up, you'll die."
"No, I won't die."
The drugs are keeping me alive.
"You need to take a break, or you'll die."
You're my break.
It's you.
it's your uncle bob.
is your mama there?
- no.
"- okay, i got this crazy note from her."
"- we got one, too."
but we haven't opened it yet.
"- hold on a second, buddy."
i got another call.
[cellphone beeps]
"- bob, tim is gone!"
"- marge, just calm down."
"- he's gone, and i have a note here from your crazy sister."
i think she took him.
"- hold on, honey."
"- what? ""hold on""?"
did you not hear what i said?
[cellphone beeps] - bob?
- uncle bob?
"- hey, buddy."
"look, your aunt marge got a note, too."
"i'm gonna come over there, and i'm gonna pick you up, so get ready."
- okay.
"- okay, i'll see you in a second, bud."
- okay. bye-bye.
[cellphone beeps] - bob. bob.
"do you hear me, bob?"
"oh, what i am gonna do that white-trash sister of yours!"
"- honey, calm down."
everything's gonna be just fine.
i will meet you there.
[cellphone beeps]
- bob.
Is everything okay?
"Pete, it's over."
We won.
Wait.
W-What does...
What does that mean?
Lance offered me the cash.
Oh.
Great.
You bet your ass it's great.
"Our con was so good, we got paid in phase 1."
Not bad for first timers.
"Uh, yeah."
We're naturals.
"I mean, technically, Lance won, but... but the important thing is that you got the money back, so that's good."
Hold on.
Hold on.
W...
"What do you mean, Lance won?"
It's called a Jesus con.
We never talked about this?
"A guy lights your house on fire, and then he shows up in the nick of time to put it out, making himself your savior."
A con man's not always after money.
Julia will think he's the hero.
She'll never believe my side.
"But the important thing is you got the money, so..."
What if I turn it down?
Why would you turn it down?
If I do... can we still con him?
"Grandma, let's just think about this for a second."
- A bird in the hand is worth...
- No.
You're a good man?
You like to hit women.
You like to hit children.
"That doesn't make you good and it sure as hell doesn't make you a man, so stop talking."
"Okay, I'm..."
I'm a good man.
"And if you say one more word, I might have to show you what this good man does to people like you."
"Dr. Bennett, you might want to rein in that charming bedside manner."
"Trust me, I was reining it in."
He's seizing.
Darren?
I need suction and an airway now.
Your incision is healing well.
"Just keep the area, you know, clean and dry."
Okay.
Anything else?
No.
Yes.
Um... you should probably get some light exercise.
Just go walk around the block or something.
"You know, just get out."
Wow.
"Your... your lips are moving, but your words sound just like Pete's."
"You were in the closet, Violet."
"Look, I'm..."
I'm doing the best I can.
"No, I know you are."
I do.
"Oh, look at that smile."
That's gas.
Sorry to tell you.
"No, it is not gas."
Hey!
Slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?
Fuck you!
You left it in my tip jar the other night.
Bullshit.
- I thought you wanted me to have it.
I...
"- Cut the crap, Stevie."
- What is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
- They say that the guy in the photo doesn't exist.
This says he does.
"Trevor, Trevor, I don't understand what the fuck you are talking about."
I'm talking about your ex!
Ivan.
- Who?
This guy standing next to you with a fish?
- I'm not in that photo.
"Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you."
You're standing next to some fat guy with glasses holding a fish.
That's not me.
"Trevor, it's you."
Look.
You lying whore.
You get the fuck out.
Fucking freak.
You play that fucking well!
You fucking whore!
You fucking freak.
Now I know why you're afraid of doctors.
'Cause you're a fucking psycho!
My ex...
Fucking psycho.
And now she's in the wind.
Kiddo.
Listen.
Go back to those twins.
They're your family now.
This was a bad idea.
So...
You.
Here.
This is what?
You giving up on working with your son?
Duval doesn't care what I think about this case or anything else.
You can't really believe that.
Your son wants very badly to please you.
Why do you think he became an FBI agent?
You don't follow in the footsteps of someone whose opinion doesn't matter.
You matter to him.
I never thought of that before.
He got into law enforcement because of me.
He wanted to please me. [Chuckles]
"His whole life, he just wanted to please me."
If he's her and I'm him...
Why am I here?
Because you want me to shut up.
Okay.
I'm good with that.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You want me to shut up.
You really want me to shut up.
And yet you still keep on talking.
Not now.
"I mean, probably now, but even when I was dead, did you ever hear me then?"
Because I liked you.
Do you think I'm still attractive for women?
"To me, yes."
Of course you are.
You knew who I was.
I've heard about you.
Great piece for your collection.
I don't know if you're mean or just pathetic!
"That night, the only thing that had your interest was the name."
Be honest.
But what does the first night matter?
There have been other nights I think.
I just wanted to be sure.
Are you calm now?
Yes.
Then I'm leaving.
Nobody stops here.
I have an idea.
Maybe if I wait here alone somebody stops.
Why don't you hide behind there?
-I won't.
It's easier for a lonely girl.
Don't be ridiculous!
You're not going to stay here alone.
-But you're gonna be right there!
No way.
"Please, let me do it."
Don't think that I like picking up people in the road.
Did you have breakdown?
No.
We don't have a car.
We're spending the weekend in the countryside.
What about you?
Me?
I was alone...
Until now.
Openly flirting?
Have you never seen a pretty girl in your life?
"No, I was waiting for you."
Do you do anything else other than charm people?
Juggling.
"- Hey, we have just met, okay?"
- Okay.
Slow down.
Spend some time with me and you will find out everything.
"Oh, mystery."
You guys think that if you speak less..
..hide a few things then the girl will stay interested.
Your smile itself is mysterious.
If you can spare a moment from looking at me..
..then let me know what you'll drink.
Whatever you want.
Why do you do this to yourself?
Why do you do it?
"You got jealous, right?"
I mean... you are drinking alone to drown your sorrows.
You could have joined me.
Stupid girl.
That isn't my drink.
And I am not alone.
Who told you that?
- So who's with you?
- I've found someone.
- Who?
Please don't cue the music until I'm waving good-bye.
- Sorry.
- It's not rocket science.
- There you are.
Did you get my email?
- About?
My new idea.
About all the fan letters I've been getting.
I thought
- I could read a few of them on the air.
- I don't really think we have time.
Sure we have time.
I'll just pick the Lotto numbers faster.
"You see, Natalie, the show's about the numbers."
That's why people are watching.
It's not really about you really.
Really?
Is that what you're hearing?
Because that's not what I'm hearing.
Why don't we discuss this later?
I'll see you monday.
Jeez!
Excuse me.
Do these cables have to be right here?
"Yes, they do."
Because they Carry your voice from this microphone to that soundboard.
Can't you put them someplace else?
I almost broke my neck.
Almost doesn't count.
"Fine, I'll do it."
"Okay, what are you doing?"
Are you mental?
MAN:
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
katherine:
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
We got here early.
I know about you and the girl.
"We know, okay?"
"Now we can offer you two a way out, a way through."
"And if you do what we say, if you help us, we won't have to hurt her."
There's no need for violence.
Violence is what got us all in this place to begin with.
This is the end of violence for us.
This is a new beginning.
It's a partnership.
And it starts by you getting her to open that door.
DAVID:
Fuck you.
EMERSON:
"Oh, shit."
Your leg.
Simon!
I'm coming!
Why is he being like that?
He's just drunk.
He'll come round.
LOVE
The perfect girlfriend would be...
Sweet and loving...
Back you up even in bad times.
Love...
I don't know if I've tried it...
"Well, of course I love all my friends."
I love mum and dad.
But real passion... no.
There's status in having the right boyfriend.
It gives you status.
If you're rich with loads of money it isn't cool to have a poor boyfriend.
A student on a... grant or whatever they go on.
The boys have most of the say.
It's always been like that among people like us.
They make the money.
She has to look good.
Of course she has to be nice.
If I'm going to marry her and have kids   and a joint bank account and all that shit   she's got to be nice.
- Is Sofie OK?
- Ask her.
- What happened?
- He doesn't want to discuss it.
- My sister's in a porn mag.
- Where can I get a copy?
- At the kiosk.
- You sisters are so fucked up.
It takes a lot more than this rain... to wash away their sins.
Be sexy in the rain!
Thank God!
Aleluia!
Aleluia!
You know what we need?
- The lightning machine.
- Lightning!
Lightning machine?
Let's get out of here.
"Maybe we should stick around, get lost then start to move faster!"
I'm freezing.
Call me a cube.
"This is unbeareable, cube."
"I can't believe they're making rain... for the photo shoot with, water from the Hudson river!"
They're crazy!
We're all gonna get typhoid-d!
"Listen, we gotta take off these clothes."
We don't wanna get pneumonia.
Do you think they'd mind if I wore something from the wardrobe?
No!
Go for it.
It's too jay.
"These things are supposed to be worn, not framed."
- I'm swimming in it!
- Hang on.
Where's your head?
Hang on.
"That's it, that's it."
There you go.
What's that?
Hang on!
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease...
Stop.
Just go.
Pleeeeease can we slow down?
Ow!
You're chafing my wrist.
Don't pretend you're not loving this.
Okay.
All right.
I think I just skated through some pee.
C-can we go back now?
- No!
- God.
"No, because we are not appointment-making control freaks."
We are having fun.
You are.
I'm just doing what you're making me do.
"Okay, okay, stop."
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no."
"Let's go back, let's go back, let's go back."
Why?
Why do we have to go back now?
"Why... oh, I get it."
I get it.
You're still scared to skate through the underpass.
"What do you mean, ""still""?"
"What do you mean, ""scared""?"
What underpass?
"Mitchell, you were 11 years old, and mom made me take you with me when I was skating with my friend Sophie King, and you were terrified to go through the underpass 'cause it was dark, and you were sure it was filled with monsters,"
so we ditched you.
I don't remember this at all.
"Tits, Franco."
"That's what real tits look like,"
OK?
Johnny giant fake boob.
"Yeah, well, excuse me for"
"Being an American, OK?"
I like to suck on big tits.
Now it's a political issue?
I'm a terrorist because I like
Real tits?
"It's political, what are you"
Talking about?
What about the sad fags?
What sad fags?
"Guys, guys."
Are we actually arguing about
"Tits, come on."
Ladder.
Batallion.
"You know what, guys."
I know this address.
My cousin's a sculptor.
He used to have a studio in this
Place.
It's like a whole warehouse.
"It's divided up into, like a"
"Million, tiny little rooms."
Just keep your head straight
"Cause you get lost in there, it"
Can get real confusing real
"Fast, you know?"
You got a cousin who's a
Cut the crap.
"Hey, watch what you say."
I wish we can sleep like this till dawn.
Is it okay?
What about your friend?
She and I do some things for each other.
"I listen to all her stories, so this is fine."
I'm probably the only friend who listens to her secrets.
So what's it like working as a manager of a cafe?
Do you make a lot of money?
Not really.
"But I don't waste money, so I can manage."
I hope the divorce goes well with your husband in Seoul.
It will.
Will you come by around lunch?
"My friend likes you too, though she doesn't show it."
I'll cook you hot chicken stew like you wished for.
"- It would be perfect with Soju, huh?"
- Yes.
Feels so good.
Can I feel this good?
Open the door!
Open the door!
Right now!
Hurry and open it!
- She's a friend of mine.
- She's too emotional.
Just stay quiet for a bit.
Open the door!
Open it!
Hey!
I'm telling you to open up!
You're not going in.
So what?
"What, we're just gonna stand out here all night?"
"Yeah, I guess so."
I don't even wanna go this is war.
This is war.
Programs!
Programs!
So let me get this straight.
You fell in love with his fiancée?
Before he proposed.
"Seriously, it's fine."
That makes no difference.
My guy should be the one going to the game.
Exactly.
My guy got invited first.
Your guy kissed my guy's girl.
I'm not gonna explain this again.
"Well, don't worry about it."
You don't have to.
I'm outta here.
Fine.
"So am I. You don't want to be friends, consider it done."
You know what you could use right now?
Ice cold ice cream.
Had to find some higher ground
Had some fear to get around
"Adam, it's Marjorie."
"I know that you probably hate me right now, but could you please call me?"
Please?
Last time through I hid my tracks
"So well, I could not get back."
(sighs)
"Well, unexplained things, secrets, occurrences that we're really not supposed to talk about?"
Oh.
Well...
"I believe that there are moments, experiences that someone like McGee, with his trusty computer, couldn't justify."
"When Gibbs left tonight,"
I... thought I saw it again.
Saw what?
The bounce.
"You know, I've been thinking about that."
Boss don't bounce.
"You cannot expect a person to keep things bottled up inside forever, can you?"
RYAN:
"Mm, charades."
Let's play.
Now?
(snorts)
It's as good a time as any.
(chuckles)
No.
Why not?
"Because I don't play games, Doc."
(laughs)
Like hell you don't.
"You know, people keep looking at their watch, usually means they're worried about something."
You got to run?
"Oh, I've been running."
Maybe it's time you stopped?
I wish I could.
You can.
Parker can.
You have no idea.
Congratulations.
I though this was what you always wanted.
"To get back to Norway, get out into the field again."
If you's rather stay here just until the end of hostilities then go and see your wife and children.
It's no problem.
I can...
Of course not.
The war is not over yet.
"- Thank you, Sir."
- Good man.
"- Well, you're certainly not going to miss the fish."
You don't get a fish this colour in Norway.
- No we don't.
I can't.
It must be very beautiful this time of year.
It's always beautiful.
Do you know what I miss most about Norway?
The horizons.
- Whereever you look.
- Yeah.
It's been awhile.
You must come and visit.
Our house is big.
It would be awkward.
"I might go back to university, do another degree."
That's a good idea.
This country needs good birdwatchers.
Certainly does.
It's going to be strange not to have the war.
Yes.
- When do you leave?
- Tomorrow.
Small root beer.
Would you like fries with that?
I would.
Thank you very much.
I almost forgot.
[Whistling]
[Cash drawer opens]
[Coins clink]
I'll just be sitting outside.
Welcome to Patty Palace.
Can I take your order?
[Indistinct chatter]
You ready to work?
- Where's Ryan?
- He's with his old man.
How you feeling?
"Deprived on every fucking level, but ready to fight."
How you feeling?
I feel good.
Thank you.
"I'm gonna have you see a nutritionist, okay?"
"We'll cut the weight, and you won't lose so much strength."
You talk to Lisa?
I have.
"A lot of other gyms that I can go to, man."
"I'm not letting you out of the gym, pal."
"You're too important here, okay?"
I'm gonna give you everything I give Ryan.
I promise.
"Hey, what do you think about this one..."
this girl?
Got to ask Ryan about that one.
Get that?
!
One of us!
"I don't get it. I'm stupid to get it Mr. Writer, sir."
"I say be an ordinary plumber, but you, you're a raving lunatic!"
That woman is deadly!
"Three husbands, three dead bodies!"
"One of us will be the fourth, can't you see that?"
Deadly?
You just want to scare me so I'll split!
So you'll have Chrissy for yourself and all her money!
Forget it!
"You can't rattle this boy, this boy's staying with Chrissy!"
- You stay and you're dead!
- Bullshit!
One of us will croak!
Scram!
Fine!
I'll read the headlines about your death!
Raving lunatic!
- Get in!
- No!
I'm leaving for Amsterdam!
Get in and I'll take you to the station.
Just don't take me anywhere near that woman.
Okay.
She's mine then.
- Can't you pass them?
- Grouch!
"You're driving beside your own funeral, Herman."
Watoh out!
"First him, doctor, first look at him."
"Yes, of course."
"You know, it's funny what a difference the flip of a coin will make."
"If you hadn't lost that silver dollar that night, i would've had fleurique, and you would've had josie."
"Oh, sergeant!"
"Yes, sir."
That cherry hill gang are coming over here looking for a scrap.
Cherry hill?
Yeah.
My bowery boys will be glad to hear that.
Ahem!
"Sorry, sir."
There must be some way we can give these bullies a party without getting our uniforms all torn up.
"Anyway, place a sentry around the ferry dock."
Have them give us a signal.
"Yes, sir."
"Here they come, colonel."
Keep that music going.
You all know what do do.
And remember... no knives or guns.
"Only clubs and iron bars for cherry hill, sir."
"Come on, uncle daniel, up you get."
Come on.
Up you go.
Come on.
Turn her on!
You want mr.
Daniel drew?
Yeah!
Come up and get him!
Cease firing!
Hooray!
"That'll get 'em, huh?"
We shall fight them in the Kardomah.
We shall never surrender.
"Sorry, that was a terrible Diana Dors impression!"
On the house.
"Anne, you're a bobby-dazzler."
I know I am.
Help yourself.
"No, I'm full."
"Anyway, I'm on a diet, supposedly."
"I'm doing it with Pauline, the girl I work with."
She wants to lose three stone and take all her hems up.
She's got chunky knees.
"Yours aren't chunky, if I may say."
"No, but office solidarity."
You were very... manly in there when you took charge.
"No, I surprised myself."
Don't know what's going on with me at the moment.
It's all happening!
Didn't I hear you say your mother had just died?
"Yes, she did."
And did you live with her?
Yes.
House to myself now.
So thank God for this place!
She didn't like music.
She struggled.
She found life a bit of an obstacle course.
"Well, it is."
"Actually, do you mind if I...?"
"No, please."
I may have over-vinegared.
Not for me.
Coffee.
Same here.
And two glasses of water.
"It's our first commercial release, so we're suspicious."
I saw the film.
And?
Nothing.
Comrades risked their lives to film it and smuggle it out.
So people know how desperate the situation is.
It's exceptional.
I didn't say I don't agree.
I totally do.
You live with Jean-René?
A house in Kremlin-Bicêtre.
With members of the collective.
The film you made in Italy...
Is it finished?
We're still debating.
Comrades find it politically questionable.
It's tense but fascinating.
I'm learning a lot.
We have an office.
"I answer the phone, tend to the prints."
It keeps me busy.
I want to go to college but I missed registration.
I may go to London.
To be a gofer on a film.
It may not work out.
What film?
Nothing like yours.
Go on.
Science fiction.
I never imagined it could be you!
With age a person's reflexes slow down
Don't blame yourself.
It's said...
"T o err is human, and you're not even human!"
How's that?
Good?
Who is Jin Tianyun to you?
We share a complex relationship
It's now close to the end
Let's forget all that meaningless talk!
Come!
Is it Gao Jian?
What do you call that stance?
Good!
Very good!
Stop!
"Gao Jian, will you ever obey your elders?"
Y es!
Please teach us the stances... which you used to kill that old fart
Don't you fear betraying your own school?
Of course not.
"There's only me, you and him"
"That's right, you can teach us step by step"
Nobody will know!
That's right!
Okay!
"- Good morning, sweetheart."
- Hi.
Still in love with that coat?
What coat?
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
And we do it my way.
(BABY cries)
"Thank you, Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
"Please, you have to tell him."
"It's okay, the baby's fine."
Not the baby.
Okay.
He killed Sean.
"-Honey, the police know."
-They don't...
They didn't see it.
It wasn't human.
Okay.
All right.
(DOOR OPENS)
(panting)
Please...
No... (MUFFLED screaming)
(sighs DEEPLY)
"I'm so sorry, Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
"Well, not completely."
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post-traumatic stress.
Or maybe a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
Don't overstep.
"Rebecca,there he is."
Walk me to him.
"- Doc,stay here.Call Tanner."
- You got it.
Don't come any closer.
"Hauser,just hang on.We're gonna get you off that thing."
"No,you're not."
Let me help you.You need anything?
- Water?
- A cigarette.
You don't smoke.
I should never have quit.
- You don't need to be here.
"- Oh,I know.Just can't see from up there."
"So what I told you on the phone,that help you catch him?"
Windward elementary.
- So I was right.
- Yes.
And just this once I will apologize for doubting you.
Not just 'cause you're standing on a bomb.
About another minute down here.
Found the lyrics to that song.
"Last 1960s bomb,""Twin Tree"" clue,you ever find the place?"
No.
Have you been looking for it this whole time?
I made a promise to a friend.
Gotta go grab something from my pack.
I'Il be right back.
Madsen.
"When he tells you the bad news,just give it to me straight."
He modified it.I'm gonna have to improvise.
Understood.
Male and I are going to be the distraction.
We will do it on three.
When the EMP hit it... it will shut down.
"Male, you'll destroy the TL."
We can't take back the warhead under this circumstances.
"In that case, to destroy it is our mission."
Ok?
Let's go... 1... 2... 3...
Male!
Are you ok?
Male?
Male!
It was done?
No...
Just...
Destroy the TL immediately!
"If you lock the fuse like that, the booster will burn it down."
You are going to roast a warhead.
Yes.
Jin here.
I'm going to disable the GUNK's launcher.
"Please, destroy the main weapon from there."
"Male here, entered in the TL."
I'll report back when the launcher preparation is ready.
Hurry up Male!
"If the GUNK recovers mobility, it will start blasting immediately."
Gimlet!
"Before that, please, destroy the main gun!"
"Sorry, was in trouble."
I'm in a blind spot here.
Let me see if I can do something...
You told me to do whatever it takes to stay in.
That didn't including shooting your fellow agents.
Those guys should have never been there.
That's not the point.
That's exactly the point.
God damn it David.
You shot three agents.
I winged them.
I tried to keep them alive.
Which is more than they did for me.
They didn't know who you were.
I told them.
I surrendered.
What do you want me to do?
So are you taking me off the case or what?
"No, I wish I could."
"Believe me I wish I could, but no."
Is that it?
You risk blowing my cover to chew me out?
You risk blowing my cover to chew me out?
"No, littman told me to find out if you had gone nuts."
"So, I'm going to tell him you haven't, right?"
You tell him whatever you want.
Oh no.
"I'm going to tell him that you haven't, right?"
Will that be all?
Yeah.
Hi.
"Hello, Mr. Davis."
I am yuko.
How are you doing?
Mr. sawamato said you found this place empty.
Guys!
"We found the perfect spot for the mosque, but it's going to get torn down."
"Ann, you have to stop it!"
"I don't know, Amaar!"
It seems like an awful lot of work.
It's the old schoolhouse at the edge of town.
"Yeah, it's probably rubble by now."
"No, Rayyan's keeping it safe for now, but you have to save it."
Amaar!
"We are in big trouble, which actually proves my point, but that's not the issue right now."
- What are you talking about?
- Mayor.
"Baber, Amaar, you two responsible for that van outside, right?"
"Huh, yeah, I guess so."
Why?
Oh!
"Cuff me, I won't resist."
"Just don't tase me, bro!"
Why would I cuff you for parking in a handicap spot?
Illegal parking?
"Oh, good!"
Because I thought
You were here because of the bomb in the back of the van.
- Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
- Wha..
"- Well, now you're under arrest."
- You can't arrest him!
-
- I'm afraid the law says otherwise.
"- Oh, come on, Paul!"
All outbound buses were told to stand down.
And you don't know when we're gonna be allowed to stand up again?
"Soon, I hope."
I hate missing dinner.
Yeah.
"Me, too."
There's our little graduate.
"My God, look at that gown."
You look just like the Statue of Liberty.
- All big and stony?
- No.
You look amazing.
You look very GQ.
Thanks to my best new friend Ermenegildo Zegna.
Don't you love how he can pronounce it now?
Very cosmopolitan.
He got it for the rehearsal dinner.
It's his first real suit.
And not my last.
I look hot.
"You know that Emily's out there, right?"
Why?
- It's a long story.
Just do me a favor.
- Sure.
Keep an eye on my parents.
Make sure they don't disrupt anything.
My mother doesn't behead anyone.
My father doesn't snore too loudly.
- They won't do anything like that.
- Haven't you met them?
- Why would they do that?
Talking menschkeit.
Stuff between men.
"The """"there"""" that's there."
The thousand telephone calls.
The bouquets and the brickbats.
The space between a handshake.
You know.
Stuff that goes with you to your grave.
There's space between a handshake for right and wrong?
Why are you pressing me?
I'm looking for an answer.
You want an answer?
"Okay, Pappy."
Think of it as colors.
There's black and there's white.
And in between is mostly gray.
That's us.
Gray's tough because it's not as simple as black and white.
"And for the media, certainly not as interesting."
But it's who we are.
What are you gonna do now?
"You mean """"we. """""
We'll fight the sons of bitches.
We're gonna come out swinging.
"We're gonna tell them, """"Hey!"
We're only human.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Frank Anselmo is dead.
He was a friend...
"... butthelast of the clubhouse bosses is gone. """""
We're gonna clean up the Augean stables.
We'll go to Miami...
"Is that right, Denny?"
I'm Pica now.
"Some days yes, other days no."
(Mouthes) Pica.
"The police have your DNA on the knife, the victim's blood on your clothes."
Witnesses saw you running from the lane.
They may have.
But I didn't do it.
He was alive when I found him.
"I took the knife out, but he died."
OK.
"Alright, we'll look into it further and get back to you."
You can't possibly believe him.
We've got our instructions.
Got your baggy eyes spot-on.
"Thanks, mate."
"Who is he, for Christ's sake?"
He is Pica.
What do we know about his prior?
Statutory rape. 15-year-old girl.
He was 19.
Girl.
Interesting.
You reckon it was a stitch-up?
"Well, come on."
"He looks like he did it, he sounds like he did it, he's homeless, he's got a serious prior."
It's the easiest stitch-up in the world.
Jails are full of guys who are there because they look like him.
You know?
No.
So you guys have sorted things out?
We haven't sorted out a bloody thing.
- Ha-ha-ha.
"- Come on, Slug, let's get our dough back."
"I'm sorry, but you can't take the dog inside."
- Fido wouldn't make a bit of trouble.
"- Sorry, but it's against the rules."
I'll have you understand I'm not a madam.
"Well, I wouldn't know about that."
I'm sorry.
- Take your hands off me.
- What's the trouble here?
- The lady has a dog.
- You needn't have been so rude about it.
"Poor Fido, did he hurt-um?"
- May I take your dog?
- No.
I'll give him back to you after the performance.
You're sure you'll take good care of him?
- Certainly.
- Thanks.
That's the second complaint I've had in five minutes.
- I must be slowing up.
- I think we can get along without you.
"- Aw, you hurt me."
- Turn in your uniform.
"Listen, Fido, this guy's got a wooden leg."
Try it sometime.
I dub you lieutenant.
[CHATTERING]
Uh-huh.
Did it again.
That's four pairs in a row.
"If this keeps up, I'm gonna buy you a fur coat."
- You slept with Jack?
- You slept with Vanessa?
Serena Van Der Woodsen here's looking at you.
Jack?
Blair?
Really?
That's calculating.Even for you.
I was sad and he tried to comfort me.
You call that comfort?
More like collusion.
Like you didn't do that with the dregs of d.u.m.b.o.
I'm standing right here.
I can't believe you slept with miss Carr.
And you were in jail?
I can't believe you let some guy take photos of you.
Wh-what was he doing there?
"No,no,no."
It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
Okay?
"You guys just stop it,okay?"
She's trying to create
A divide between us.
This is exactly what she wants.
We can't let that happen.
You want to know something?
I don't think it's her that created the divide.
I think it was you.
"You're the reason we're on ""gossip girl"" in the first place."
If it wasn't for you we'd all be safe.
Okay that's enough.
We all did what she said we did.
- You can't blame Serena for this.
You proceed.
- Nothing else. I've said it all.
What happened?
-Her complaint is that he teased  and whistled at her.
-l didn't!
Did you whistle?
- Actually...
"Did you whistle, or not?"
"- Yes, I did."
But not to her.
I swear.
- Then why?
I am a music buff. I like to fiddle with instruments.
He also broke into a song on seeing me.
What was that?
"""Me and you in a locked house"" ""And..."""
"""And... the keys not to be found"""
Constable...
Lock him up.
Tomorrow is court-day.
Make sure the keys to the lock-up don't vanish.
You can file your complaint.
I would like to tell you something.
"Yes, tell me."
It's our duty to arrest and teach a lesson to such third class loafers.
And we do it.
"But, there are some duties ofwomen too."
Like what?
I don't get it.
Just look at yourself.
Ifyou roam about in these kind of dresses... ..do you think instead ofwhistles you will hear the temple bell?
What's wrong with this dress?
You are independent.
"It is your nature, not a malady."
You are dissatisfied because your life constrains you.
You say it so plainly.
I'm ashamed to seem ungrateful for what I have.
But I just want...
You just want to be free.
Exactly.
Hmm.
Thank you.
Isabel.
Roderick.
My darling sister.
You are a sight for sore eyes.
How are you?
Have you settled in nicely?
I have.
It's everything that we hoped it would be.
And how is the famous doctor?
The medication is helping already.
I...
I already feel much more at ease.
"Uh, little bird?"
Where'd you go?
I'm sorry.
"Dr. cairn says it's a part of the healing process, a side effect as I adjust to the medication."
"Well, perhaps some, uh, fresh air will help."
Would you like to take a walk?
Let's enjoy the beautiful gardens.
You lead the way.
Whoareyou?
I'mEdith.
"Not hang him to ""death""."
"Now, he has been hung."
"So, you should set him free now."
That's cavil at words!
"Your Honour, law is law."
Not even one letter should be amended.
"Now, I can't help you."
Your Honour!
Think before you speak.
"Otherwise, you will lose the face of British government."
And you may be charged with murdering.
I want an urgent meeting first.
"Alright, back to your work."
You are all nuts!
Get lost.
It's my time!
The final decision of the court has been reached.
The penalty has been carried out.
Ho Foon is free now.
Bravo!
I'm free.
"Ho Chung, you are under arrest, you are charged with murder."
Brother Foon.
Lotus.
"My dear baby, your sudden appearance... makes me feel excited..."
Closer...
I am ready.
Alright?
"We are going to take the bridal pictures, we should be a bit serious, is that right, hubby?"
"Well, look at me!"
More serious!
Bravo!
I just run into things.
You don't really feel them till you get offstage.
Hey... can you put that on pause?
Yes?
No?
Yeah!
Of course.
"First, it sounds loud but then after a half hour it's not so loud, you know?"
"And after, like, three quarter of an hour, it's not loud enough, you know?"
"I think the lyrics to some of that stuff that ""Are you with..."""
It was so smart... so fucking smart...
It's nice just rocking.
But it's rock and smart.
That's to me like at the...
"Great time...man, that's just so good to see someone doing that."
"If that's not what it is all about, I don't know what it is."
Hello.
I know in speaking English but I like the group.
"Thank you the pictures, thank you everyday."
"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again."
Head's up!
Dave!
Dave!
Dave!
Yeah!
"1, 2, 3..."
Nail it!
The chair!
What do you guys shooting at?
"Exit sign, why?"
"Come on, Buzz..."
"Dude, please, just one..."
You'll get hurt.
"Tell that to the governor, will you?"
"Hey, give me that."
"Never mind, Ponch."
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Will be with you in a minute, okay?"
You can't write her a citation.
I can write her three citations for what she did.
You can't write her.
She's angry.
She's angry at us.
She's angry at the itsy-bit...
The signs.
She's angry with the state.
"She won't sign the ticket, she just..."
She won't accept it.
"Hey, the kid, huh?"
I can tell.
Okay?
- I'll hook her up and take her down.
- Take her down.
What you gonna do?
Tow her in?
That's gonna do a lot to beef up your arrest record.
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Until we have time to do something about those signs maybe you can be a little more careful, okay?"
"Now, if you could just slide over."
"Nice Officer Poncherello will help you turn around, okay?"
You be careful now.
We don't want to get hurt.
She gave me a cookie.
But it's for you.
- Can we take that as a yes?
- No.
Everything eventually registers.
He'll chime in on this in a couple of days.
- Days?
- Days.
"Hey, is Jackson in the house?"
Let me hear you say...
- A new toy.
- Shameless.
- How's it going?
- I hate these books.
Hate them.
No.
See that?
They're trying to escape.
"They hate me, too."
Your books don't hate you.
"Rory, my brain is full."
It has reached capacity.
It's Shea Stadium when the Beatles played.
"It's cramped, girls are screaming, and George is fighting with Ringo."
- You have a very active head.
- I cannot ingest any more information.
- Take a break.
- I don't have time.
"Close your eyes, clear your head."
Clearing my head just means that... all the knowledge I have painstakingly stuffed in there will leak out.
"In order to make room for stuff, I lose stuff."
It's a very vicious circle.
I'll make some coffee.
- I hate finals.
Ha!
That's all from mini-golf right there.
No lessons.
Can you believe it?
"I don't know what you think you're doing here, but..."
I was just starting to count the number of your fingers
I'm gonna break.
Get it?
You know what?
"I'm not too good at math, so I might lose count here."
Wait.
Ah!
He paid me.
A lot of money.
- For what?
"- To make up test results, phony prescriptions, medical bills."
- Why?
- I don't know.
You know who your father is.
I didn't ask questions.
I did it as I was told to do.
He came to me with a lot of cash.
"He said he needed a terminal illness, so I gave him one."
Ah!
"Jesus, Victor."
We need to get something straight about this partnership.
I'm in charge here.
- You work for me.
- Okay.
"Every decision about this party has been made for a reason, so before you go unwinding my hard work,"
- you might want to get...
- What the hell are you
I meant the exhibition.
Very successful.
* If my true love e'er come *
And your artist?
* I would surely find another *
Likewise.
* Where the wild mountain thyme *
So why didn't you stay?
* Grows around the blooming heather *
Would have covered for you.
* Will ye go... *
"I was thinking about...what Mr.Hilliard said about, needing to backseat for death speech."
I am.
* I will build my love a tower * * From the pure and crystal mountain *
* And around I should... * * All the flowers of the mountain *
"* Will ye go, lassie, will ye go?"
* * And we'll all go to heaven *
* To pull wild mountain thyme * * All around the blooming heather *
Bombers moon.
Someone would be copyin' it.
So...
"You know, now a couple of days in Devon."
London for the studio shoot.
Huh...then what?
Back to careless talk and carrots.
Don't know.
"Swain's takin' about another feature. ""Air Raid Wardens""."
There'll be slob.
I don't know.
Here.
Tell you this.
Marry you.
It's complicated.
Can you trust her?
Yes.
Absolutely.
"And you can, too."
But you can't trust me with the truth?
"Oh, hang on."
"Alexis, that's not about trust."
I am your father.
"And from the day you came into this world, it's been my job to protect you."
[Sighs]
"So, what's our next move?"
There is no next move.
We let sleeping dogs lie.
"It's safer that way, for everyone."
"I'm really sorry to interrupt, but I think I found something."
- On Phillip's homicide?
- Yeah.
"I was going through Jordan Keegan's computer files, and I found something interesting."
It's a screenplay.
Mm.
"""Gemini Killers."""
"Yeah, it's a dreadful story about a serial-killing duo."
"Not sure, but it might give us some insight."
I've seen this before.
The script?
"No, the..."
the notes in the margins here...
This odd handwriting that...
I know who the killer is.
"No, I cannot hold."
I...
- Look where i'm pointing.
- 90 seconds!
90 seconds?
"Wait, no!"
I don't have a script.
"Excuse me, I never got a script."
There is no script.
This is the lottery.
"For the love of god, f there was script, we'd all be rich."
Amateurs.
"Captain, Lieutenant."
How's the investigation going?
"Well, we're just getting started."
"Spoke to the staff, the camera crew."
Everybody said they left the building after the show.
They usually do.
"Well, somebody was here."
The girl didn't stab herself.
You wanted to know if Marissa received any fan mail.
Some of them are pretty dicey.
"You know, personal."
I put them on top.
"I need quiet, everyone!"
New girl.
"New girl, you're on in five, four, three, two, and you're on."
Good evening... people.
Welcome to the big gold rush pick 6.
I'm Natalie Teeger.
Are you ready to play?
Then let's play... the lottery.
And the first number is...
Turn it on!
"Never mind that, doctor."
Is the master okay now?
He's absolutely fine.
Aunty!
How will I...
Why are you making her cry?
Leave her alone.
"Ask the doctor when we can take the boss home, dear."
Today itself.
"And Dr. Rohit is around for help, too."
"Let's go home, uncle."
Get well soon.
We've got a lot to decide.
"No, Rohit."
"You're a good doctor, I know."
But let's leave it at that.
"What do you say, Laxmi?"
"Place some money in aunt's plate, grandpa."
"Why do I need to do that, dear?"
After all that she has done for us we ought to give her the keys of the family.
"Use keys on locks, sir."
Place some change in it now.
Treat that like a golden biscuit!
"Come on, sir..."
I'll take that.
"Coming, sir."
Did you call me?
"I've been alone for 20 years, after Lajwanti's death."
I have never missed female company in all these years.
"You have served me so well now, Lakshi!"
I don't think a wife would have taken so much of care!
See that?
Are you angry because I'm here all fine?
Is that why you're mad?
Ok!
You can miss exits.
How can you go that far?
Are you stupid?
Fine you can forget your phone.
But wasn't there a phone booth?
You could have called!
I didn't think I would go that far.
I didn't even know that I didn't have a phone.
Did you know that I was waiting for you?
"No, I don't."
Excuse me!
Who are you?
I said I'm sorry.
"I'm really sorry, I want to die ok?"
Why are you so angry?
Is this worth it?
Did I do it on purpose?
"You even missed planes, did you forget?"
-It's twice now.
-Three times!
-Were you counting?
-I was never late!
Because it's always on your schedule.
You don't even care about my schedule.
"Whenever you call and say 10 or 20 minutes, I always had to go even I was on the toilet."
"Even then there could be traffic, or something could be wrong with the car."
You can be late!
But I should be able to call you!
The performance is driving me nuts!
"I let my guard down, fell madly in love, planned a huge wedding, and the guy didn't show up."
"- Wow, that really sucks."
- No kidding.
Must have been so humiliating.
I don't like to dwell on it.
"I mean, just standing up there in your wedding dress... and all those people staring at you?"
"The point is,"
I know a little bit about anger.
And it's not healthy to hold on to it... or to take it out on other people.
Especially someone as sweet as your mum.
It's killing her that she can't connect with you.
"I gotta tell you, whoever that guy was, it was his loss."
Thank you.
Because you must have been so hot back then.
Yes.
Way back then.
Oh.
Here she is now.
Talk to her.
It'll be fine.
I promise.
"Hi, sweetie."
"Listen, um..."
I don't know what to say.
Neither do I.
But we can try.
Really?
Yeah.
So where do you wanna start?
"Well, the fact that dad's engaged to a 25-year-old..."
Or that I think I have a crush on joy... and I'm pretty sure she's feeling it too?
"Oh, wow."
I didn't hear right.
I can't believe what I heard.
This is for you.
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.
Good.
Don't take shit from nobody.
He shoots him in the foot and he tells him to go fuck himself.
"Tommy, you going to let this fucking punk get away with that?"
What's this world coming to?
That's what the fucking world's coming to.
-How's that?
-What is wrong with you?
What is the fucking matter with you?
Are you stupid or what?
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?
How do I know if you're kidding?
I'm kidding with you and you fucking shoot the guy?
He's dead.
Good shot. I'm a good shot.
-Hard to miss at this distance.
"-You got a problem with what I did, Anthony?"
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.
Stupid bastard!
I can't believe you.
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
is it the first hole I dug?
Not the first hole I dug.
But I'm gonna get you through it.
"Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut."
"Ahhh, I saw inside of you."
How are humans alive?
"Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?"
We'll get you through this.
Okay.
"Ugh, what was that sound?"
I did not like that squish sound.
The pipe has been removed.
Now...
I'm sewing myself up.
"Okay, this is almost over."
You're doing great.
Just keep talking.
Keep talking.
Talking about what?
"Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?"
You must be excited to see her.
"Very much, you know."
"Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well?"
"We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?"
- Uhhh!
"- Keep going, keep going."
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?
I don't know.
I don't know.
"I mean, maybe we've grown apart."
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
"–Yeah, man."
How's retirement?
–I'm shaving' a few strokes off my golf game.
–You look good.
–You I don't know.
–Ronnie Gardocki.
Joe Clarke.
Taught your boss everything he knows.
"Yeah, but you didn't teach me everything you know, right?"
That's right.
I'm saving some.
–We're gonna grab a bite.
Wanna go?
–They're busy.
"When I miss tee time at Riviera for this, you better be buying."
Riviera?
Since when do they let hacks like you play at Riviera?
You guys still here?
Come on!
"Hey, who was that with Vic?"
"–Joe Clarke, his old partner."
–They kicked him off the force.
–Why is that?
–Some punk took a swing at his last partner.
Joe knocked out like half of his teeth in front of this crowd.
Total railroad job.
Don't worry.
It's nothing like what you're going through.
So it's been a year since you called me up.
You drag my ass down here.
What's going on?
Can't I buy you lunch?
So I'm just digging A long trench.
Through the gravel And the pebbles.
He needs to be Excruciatingly careful.
About the amount of time He spends down there.
He could really hurt himself At that depth.
"Hey, zeke, we're at 35 feet right now."
Copy that.
Really?
Really.
Just be careful.
"I'm seeing hardpan, Like I wanted."
But there's not even A speck of gold on it.
"Well, let's go somewhere Else more interesting."
Yeah.
Roger.
"Whoa, boy, is this..."
It's a gold worm.
But I don't know if they Necessarily correlate exactly.
To there being A lot of gold.
It would be really Nice to see.
"Just a little flake Of gold, you know?"
Are we getting deeper?
Yes.
After 2 hours At 37-feet...
"Hey, you doing okay?"
The first stages Of nitrogen narcosis.
Are setting in.
Dangerous.
"Zeke, that's way too."
You need To get out of there.
"So zeke has two choices,"
He can call it quits Or get bent.
"As fast as possible,"
And leave before they get there.
The thought had crossed my mind.
(mace:)it looks like da veiga
Was working with sydney fox.
I can't wait to see rennes' face
When I tell him.
And I'd have you to thank.
For delivering your father to me.
Why did you betray him?
"Was it power,"
Money?
(mace:)they've used
The empty case as a decoy.
Where is the dagger
And the scabbard?
Don't be stupid.
Tell me.
Or I'll turn you over to him.
That must be karen.
Ahh...
Sorry I'm late.
I found the druid's noch
On an ancient roman map.
And I brought you those crumpets
That you like from marks and spencer.
"Thank you, karen, you're an angel."
You owe me five quid.
The noch was a small hill
That was significant as a place
Of worship for druids
In wales 2000 years ago.
And if she stays here?
Did she ever talk to you about a DNR?
Are you saying she's dying?
*****
"Guy,ready?"
"Hey,buddy.How you doing?"
Where'd you come from?
Get back!
"Move,move,get out of the way!"
- What's going on?
- They're under the ground!
- Look out!
- They're under the ground!
"All units,all units,be advised."
Air support en route to pine street park.
Multiple explosions reported with severe casualties.
Bomb squad on scene.
"Oh,this does not look good."
- You were actually near where...
"- um,yeah,no,it was just right there."
- Was it over here?
- The south side.
Okay.
What kind of explosive makes a crater like this?
Something small.An l.E.D.maybe.
Looks like he used the grass to hide them.
Land mines.
- Holy crap...
- It's Paxton Petty.
He did this before in the early '60s.
"In the past,there were multiple occasions.He's not finished yet."
- So you know this case?
That won't happen.
"Then if I do win, you'll have to do me a favor."
"And if I lose, just let Jung Yeon go quietly."
- Sure.
- Hey.
"Whether he wins or loses, he still gets the benefit."
"Hey, it doesn't matter."
I'll just end it quickly.
It works like this.
"The one who attacks first, is at a loss."
The rule is simple.
"If he strikes, all you have to do is dodge."
"And since you're fast, you can dodge him until the end."
"Here, try to hit me."
Okay...
I'll be okay.
"For real, this time."
One more time.
After you continue to dodge like this...
Counter punch.
The opponent may attack first...
But you can turn the tables on him instantly.
You need to get your ass beat.
"Yes, Officer Han?"
I'll call you once we're making good progress.
You can go to Yong Moon Plan when I do.
Okay.
Delivery.
I'm okay.
"The opponent attacked first, but you can turn the tables on him instantly."
[Important Issue
- Controversial Issue.
What the hell is he doing?
Is he a waiter here?
What's wrong with him?
"Oh my goodness, what are you doing?"
Hey!
How many are in your family?
I have four.
"If you also have four, we're a perfect match."
You pervert!
"Dad, help me."
Me?
Not me.
So you're with him?
- With him?
Who?
I?
- Come here.
- I'm gonna kill you today.
- don't know him!
It goes down really smooth.
"Sorry, it's just that you eat so beautifully."
I haven't seen anyone eat ramen noodles as sexy as you do.
"Actually, I'm a writer."
So whenever I see anything beautiful I can't let it pass.
I'm sort of a workaholic.
I want to eat it.
'I want to eat ramen.' That's the title.
I suddenly got that poetic vibe.
Pink tiny glamorous lips Like blooming nipples
Slightly open
Your tongue that's like a shell's flesh
Accepts without any reservations Those erected noodles
And I can't betray him.
"Not now, or ever."
We must apprehend this Calvetti.
Do the impossible.
Be quick.
You're crazy; they're looking for you.
- I came here to give myself up.
There's nothing else I can do.
- No.
But it's me they want.
I can't let you die in my place.
Watch out!
The guards.
Everything in order?
- Everything.
I brought her meal.
Don't worry.
I'm not here to hurt you.
"If it was up to me, I'd let you kill whoever you want."
Bon appetit.
Save yourself.
It would be crazy to give yourself up.
What good would that do?
Everyone's against us.
"Lucrezia, Giacomo, even Martina."
- Martina?
The maid.
She told the judges I had ordered her to let you into the castle.
Martina said that?
They must have paid her to make a false statement.
We must find her and force her to tell us everything she knows.
Meeting me has cost you dearly.
Jeremy!
What?
"Haven't you read the studies, Liz?"
A glass a day is actually good for you.
Lowers your blood pressure.
"And smoking's good for your lungs, right?"
What do you expect?
You said we're a family full of addicts.
I never said that.
You said that you were the only one who wasn't hooked on something.
"That's, of course, unless you count the wine."
You.
"And then there's Nick, who's famous for his zany hi-jinx, and Nick's mom, a pill freak."
Jeremy...
"I'm a guest in your house, right?"
Yeah.
"So do you think it would be rude of me if I told you, as a guest, that you're a spoiled little jerk?"
What do you think?
I need a ride to this party.
I am not taking you.
We have guests.
"Oh, come on, mom, what am I gonna do?"
Sit here and watch figure skating-- [whispering] Sit down.
I'll take you.
It was very nice.
Thank you.
Liz:
You're welcome.
"Well, you sure do give your mom a pretty hard time."
I see her...
Like...
Twice a year.
- You're right!
"Letting your dad rot in jail, that's serious."
"Changing your name, that's Napoléonic!"
"What part are you going to play in your new family, shit-guzzler?"
"Shit, help me, Matalon!"
"How long have I been saying she's nuts, boss?"
"Start digging your grave, dickhead!"
Yours will only need a lid on top.
Music!
Roll end credits!
- I love you!
- My God.
Can you stomach this?
You should have gone to a posh deli in Neuilly.
- Does he love her or something?
- He hates her!
Who the hell asked you?
"And who's you, anyway?"
"Sorry, I didn't want to hurt you."
Idiot!
You'll regret that very much.
"So, Léo!"
What do you think of Parisian Nights?
"This is nothing, wait for the main course!"
Don't you miss the pigs?
"- You won't snout, will you?"
- No.
Why?
I don't judge anyone.
Who judges the judges here?
"Men who have women and friends, they're shelters from justice."
Can you keep on picking my dishes?
- We've got the guy who killed him.
- A cop killed my father!
- Kesser doesn't have the brains.
- He was convicted in court...
- Answer me!
- I'm telling you!
Your father is dead and this case is closed!
"If you can't accept that, that's your problem."
I can take that gun and that badge away from you right now.
- Is that what you want?
"- Do what you got to do, Nick."
"Hardy, we're out of our patrol zone."
Will you tell me where we're going?
We're going to visit a friend.
I'll break here for dinner.
I'll be back.
Right...
I'll just stay here and watch the boat.
- Can I get you something?
"- Yeah, a guy named Chicanis."
I don't think I've seen him all night.
"Okay, tell me what you know!"
Who told you to lie?
- Give me the names.
- Don't shoot me.
"- Hardy, put up your gun."
- Now!
"No, put up your gun."
"Hardy, damn it!"
This shit has got to stop.
If you have a drinking problem...
You were out of control.
"I admit that I was worried at start how would I get used to another man's presence under my roof, but Fabian was so quiet and unnoticeable that I even felt unpleasant."
As if I asked this from him.
I haven't seen him for days.
Yes?
Good...
How do you do.
"A coffee, maybe?"
If you don't mind.
Ok.
Come on in.
"You're puzzled about all this, right?"
About my charts.
Yes.
What is it?
"I'm into statistics, you know."
Only as a hobby.
I classify all kinds of data.
"I may show you sometimes, if you want."
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Nice day.
And you already got up.
- I haven't even slept.
"Why, are you suffer from insomnia?"
I was working until a minute ago.
You know how it is.
It's better not to leave it for tomorrow.
"Tomorrow, one may get a toothache, or a headache..."
"The years are later, too."
And then it's late for ideas.
"You've been working with statistics, right?"
- Yes.
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
Welcome aboard.
Might I come aboard?
Yeah.
You remember the boat.
"Well, you know, I thought I did."
"- Or, you know, little..."
- But it's been a while.
You know that dock?
"Over there, there's a boat that looks just like yours."
NEIL:
Uh-huh.
- It's not yours.
"- No, that's not my boat."
- It's definitely not.
But there's a very nice gentleman living on the boat who invited me in for a white-wine spritzer.
"Oh, good."
Wasn't expecting visitors.
That's all right.
I just wanted to just come by and say thanks for helping yesterday.
"Beth, you know, I'm the same person."
I would do anything for you.
I just can't give you...
I just can't give you what you want.
You're what I want.
Our life together is what I want.
I miss it.
I miss you.
You see those guys my sisters are married to...
"You're more of a husband to me, not being married than those real husbands are ever gonna be, and..."
- SEC.
We're shut down.
Somebody went out of their way to bring on some real hurt.
You made any enemies lately?
Adriana called them in.
Revenge for when you and I...
Help yourself to the files.
You won't find anything.
I've been cooking the books for years.
- I never saw that.
- I was good at it.
You want to burn down my house?
I'm going to burn down yours.
A standard in-house Bastion contract.
It specifies a large amount of cash that you've been funneling into investments.
Cash obtained illegally.
You forged my signature.
Where do you think I learned that little trick?
Work with me.
Partners.
"Now, what do you really want?"
You want me?
You want Grace?
I want you both.
Suddenly single.
"Starting over, I guess."
Is that what we're doing?
I'm not gonna see you for a while.
We're going to Argentina.
"Simon, what's wrong?"
He's not sick.
"This is all bullshit, okay?"
It was horrible.
Why don't you tell me about it?
Do you wanna tell me about it?
"Come on, let's stand."
Tell me.
(PANTING)
It was the same as last time.
"I was in this room, this red room."
"It was bright, blood red curtains, but there was no windows, no doors, so it didn't make sense, and I couldn't get in or out."
I was trapped.
"The curtains, they were on fire."
It was horrible.
It's okay.
"I was hunched in the corner, and I looked over into the other corner."
"And in the shadows, there was someone else there."
I could just see his eyes.
He was looking right at me.
It's okay.
It's over now.
"These nightmares, they will fade away, I promise."
Did they for you?
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on.
I'll sit with you until you fall back asleep.
Who else do I have to take care of?
They hoarded all of their greatest stolen treasures in here.
Piles of jewels and every room filled with coins.
Let's get to it.
The compass.
(SNIFFS)
What's your rush?
- I have to finish here first.
- It's OK.
I can come back later.
- Selfish bastard!
- Cunt!
- Your costumes are just magnifique.
- Thank you.
"You can come a long way in France, with the right support."
"I feel I see who you are and what you need, you know?"
- I'm not quite sure I do.
- I could make you very successful.
- A very happy woman.
"- Thanks, but I'm doing fine."
I think you should start trusting your feelings.
Like we do in Paris.
What feelings?
You don't know who I am!
You cunt!
You loser...
Merde!
(wistful guitar music)
(busy signal)
(wistful guitar music)
(Camilla singing badly)
I thought we'd talked about you using my bathrobe.
- I'd prefer it if you didn't.
- If you insist.
(light pop music)
Sit down!
- You can keep it on for now.
"- Sit down, please."
Sit down.
Then the wrong one it is.
"When in the jungle, protect your life, Not your pride."
I'm sharper than the dagger.
Watch your step.
What's your intention?
Doom.
I knew that Muraakis' brains are below their waist.
Accept defeat.
My next strike might kill you.
Try to not kill yourself.
For me.
Kill me.
I cannot stay here.
I won't be able to go back.
"We let Paathar go, Saiba is now ours."
He cannot be defeated even by a beast...
A Muraaki can be killed only by deceit.
Saiba is yours.
First we marry.
"Jilaan loves wars, then why this marriage?"
"Oh Muwaqqit, what do you gain by conquering the world?"
"Bodies meet, bodies perish."
"Souls meet, they together forever flourish."
Kaabir?
Why are you here?
Saiba forgot why she is here.
Jilaan shall no longer even look at our Ghat.
- Didn't you get the message?
- I got the message.
But I didn't get Saiba.
I'll take Saiba with me...
After killing Jilaan.
- Any progress in the Weng case?
"- No, none at all."
"I nearly got the suspect, but he escaped."
Where's your razor sharp intuition?
Many people want me to fail... so this case means a lot to me.
I don't need you letting me down.
You always were a pain in the ass.
Do me a favor and prove me wrong.
"Sir, I do nothing for nobody."
I'll get the murderer.
You'll get your promotion.
I hope you don't forget who helped you reach the top.
I want you to draw the suspect.
Try to bring him to life.
He's over 30.
He looks determined... without being ruthless.
There's something heroic about him.
He doesn't look like a killer.
He comes across so calm... acts like he has a dream... eyes full of passion.
- Hello.
"- It's me, Jeffrey."
Jeffrey?
Why haven't you left town?
I want my money now.
I want it tonight.
Tonight!
"Sure, I'll bring it tonight."
Mr. Weng.
You should let me handle Jeffrey.
He's my responsibility.
- What if he squeals on me?
- He wouldn't.
"- Yes, she does."
"- Bite me, asshole."
You have a bad attitude when you're drinking.
"You have a bad attitude when you're drinking, you huge-footed slut."
You know what?
"I'm just gonna go get more wasted, and then I'm gonna bang some rim, dude."
Really?
Could it be this guy?
"No, it can't, but it could be Dennis."
Pass.
Whatever.
You know what?
I'm gonna take this.
"I'm gonna take this, and I'll see you assholes later."
- That is my notebook.
- Free coffee for a year.
Wait a second.
Where did she get my note?
- You know what?
I have backups.
- What is with her?
Something about drinking.
She just won't stop talking about it.
"- What, the plates of shit?"
- Somebody pooped the bed.
Whatever.
Let's get out of here.
We could use a fresh set of eyes on this if you don't mind.
"No, thank you."
"I think that Artemis and I have much better things to do, thank you."
"Actually, I'm just gonna stick around."
Excuse me?
Dangaioh transformation successful.
Looks like they made it in time.
The problem is the intruders.
The security system has been completely destroyed.
"If we don't do something, they'll be able to infiltrate into the lowest level."
"Don't worry, the Commander will take care of it."
Dangaioh?
So that means they got past Fubuki?
"Go, Ankokuten!"
Buy us time until Mikazuchi comes back!
This is it?
"Okay, show me."
So it's sending false information to the computer...
Its processing capabilities are amazing.
Give it up!
"Boy, that felt good!"
We're not finished yet.
"Stand up, Ankokuten!"
Show them what you're really worth!
"Arise, Hikio!"
What the hell is this?
Wh...
What!
?
Who are you?
What do you know?
You...
Wh...
What the hell is this?
!
What is this?
This can't be possible.
"Well, I honestly think that you're a train wreck."
Hi.
Hey.
You look nice.
Thank you.
I'm glad you called.
Yeah.
"Um, I called to give you... this."
Found it...
"Grady's, yeah."
"He asked me to take my shirt off to see if I was wearing a wire, and the mouse ears, I don't know."
You don't have to do that anymore.
Case is closed.
"Okay, so how does it work, the dying part?"
"Well, in Switzerland, a doctor would give a patient such as yourself a lethal dose..."
"- Oh, my God."
- Of sodium pentobarbital with a drink.
"There is no pain, no suffering, you just fall asleep."
"An option is to go to Switzerland and be what they call a death tourist, and fly..."
So?
Did you ever find out if your mom was a drug dealer?
"Oh, yeah, she's like a kingpin."
She has a whole empire.
You're such an idiot.
Hey.
Who's cat is that?
It's Casper.
"I gotta go out of town, for another job."
How long will you be gone?
Maybe a few months.
And who will you be this time?
Hard to say.
I was always strongly attracted to you.
And you knew it.
So did Wilton.
That's why The Foundation saw so little of me.
"Elizabeth, we've known each other for too long not to keep it simple."
What is it you want?
"Oh, Devon, you know better than that."
"When Sigmund Freud lay dying, his students all gathered about him and they asked if there was one question his work had not answered."
"And he replied,"
"""What a woman really wants. """
"Well, there's no need to be coy."
"Well, there's certainly no need to rush."
The future is still the future.
It will reveal itself when it chooses.
.
"Oh, a storm is threatening."
.
My very life today.
.
If I don't get some shelter.
.
"Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away."
.
"War, children."
.
"It's Just a shot away, it's Just a shot away."
.
"War, children."
.
"It's Just a shot away, it's Just a shot away.."
"Boy, do I feel lucky."
"Well, then don't play with her."
Okay ?
You don't know how to fix this.
You can't fix it!
You...have no clue...
Just leave me alone.
I don't ever want to hear from you again.
Wake me up when the latch turns.
But what if ...
"This isn't exactly the residence of a renegade, Daze ."
But...
Just keep a lookout while I go dream about a dress.
Him
"Oh my God, is that the guy?"
What's going on ?
I don't know !
Why didn't he take our guns ?
I don't know !
Should we wake him or just pop him ?
"I don't know, Daze ."
"Hey, girls."
There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry.
Do you know why we're here ?
"Yes, I've been expecting you."
I think there must be some sort of misunderstanding.
"We're not here to clean your bathtub, or organise your closets or make you happy."
Really?
Yea.
We are here to kill you.
Then there's no misunderstanding at all.
Do you mind if I've a word with my partner ?
Wait a second.
"Search him, Daze."
- That he killed himself to save our destinies?
"If it's any consolation,"
I can always bring you back to this particular time and place.
I'm fine.
Just let it be.
A full compliment.
"To be honest, I had my doubts that all of you would be willing to throw in with me for a second go."
"- Well, actually..."
- We're not coming with you.
"With Savage gone, we want to start fresh, see what happens."
"I give it three months, tops."
"Look, I just..."
I want to say thank you.
To all of you.
"- Ray, I..."
- No.
This is...
it's meant to be.
I wish both of you nothing but the best.
Be safe.
See you guys around.
"Every time they do that,"
I get hungry for chicken.
"So, shall we?"
- Is that...
- The Waverider.
Another Waverider?
"Whatever it is, it's not slowing down."
Get down!
What the hell's going on?
"To be honest, Mr. Jackson, I have absolutely no idea."
Is this 2016?
You're not as important as this body.
When he said he was busy everyday...
I guess he had time to exercise.
"Then...when he said he was too busy, and didn't have the time,"
I wonder if it was all an excuse?
I wonder if he just didn't want to see me?
"What do you mean, he didn't want to see you?"
Even on that day...
He was on his way to see you.
That's right!
You said he even had something to tell you when he saw you!
The thing he was going to tell me when he saw me...
You think it was to tell me that he loved me?
What if it's not?
Gil Da Ran...
I love you.
Like this!
I'm sure he was going to say this to you.
Yeah...
I'm sure you're right.
"I'm sure that's it, right?"
That's it...
And here I am on my own...
How stupid I am.
"Yeah, yeah..."
That's stupid.
Let's pack up some clothes.
This color looks really good on Yoon Jae.
This color looks really good too!
Wow...
This color suits really well too...
Here.
What shall I tell him about Malcolm?
Just tell him!
It is 1969!
For frig's sake!
What it is...
That's not really a sentence.
Thank you for the photo.
No trouble.
"The other day, when I said I was going out with somebody,"
"I wasn't really, so, I don't know if you want to still go out with me."
"Well, I can't just decide on the spot."
I will have to think about it.
"No, of course."
Absolutely.
I've thought about it.
"Yes, I would and where shall we go?"
Oh.
You really want to?
You've no idea.
You have no idea.
Wow!
Crikey!
"I ordered sausage, egg and chips to cheer myself up."
I could send it back!
Could I hold your hand?
Yes.
Hang on!
Let's do this thing properly.
"So, none of my beeswax, but I am a man, so, obviously, a bit thick as regards these matters."
Were you going out with somebody or not?
"Well, I was seeing somebody."
"We didn't really go out, and I haven't actually told him yet."
I should've been straight with him.
I should've stood by him.
"And we should've remembered the code that he taught us, 'cause without that code, we'd be... long gone right now."
Amen.
Which is why we're gonna do this job.
For Uncle Eddie.
We're gonna kill the son of a bitch who did this.
And then we're gonna rob him blind.
"Yeah, well, first things first."
- What?
- We're gonna do this... we get it all on the table.
Full disclosure.
You can't be a part of this crew unless you know everything.
"Go ahead, you two."
Show her what you really are.
- What?
!
[gasps] - [roaring] [people screaming]
- [moans] - [screaming continues]
[panting]
[Scott] Boss...
What are you doing?
Getting a taste for what's coming.
"Okay, I got the bonds, but she's coming with us."
[chuckles]
Perfect timing.
You're about to see the rise of a new Lord.
"Go ahead, kid, knock yourself out."
You deserve it.
"- I'm sorry, I..."
- It's not your fault.
I don't know how he found me.
Fine.
"But when we get the POWs from the Abbey, we'll take Miri too."
"- Miri, the pretend nun?"
- She's motivated.
She can shoot.
And she trailed me through the woods for a half hour before I heard her.
None of you can do that.
That's all we know about her?
Everything else you can learn while you train her.
Brilliant.
Three weeks till the invasion.
Lots of time.
"Speaking of which,"
I've been thinking.
"We're working on the attack, but without defense, it could all be for nothing."
What do you mean?
We need to know what they know.
"Which networks are blown, who we can trust."
We don't know how much René told them.
Counter-intelligence.
We need to protect ourselves.
Anticipate attacks.
- Track his movements.
Feed him lies.
"- And by ""him"" you mean..."
Franz Faber.
He knows a lot about us.
It's time we learned more about him.
- We can't get anywhere near the HQ.
- No.
But maybe we can hit him closer to home.
_
What if I don't want to let him go?
I will have abortion right away!
"Auntie, where is Yawang?"
"From now on, you are not allowed to leave this room!"
"When my son is awake, you will have to marry him!"
"Xiaotian,"
I think... you'd better go back to academy.
"She is my daughter,"
I know her well.
"Being with you, she will be in agony everyday!"
"Xiaotian, Auntie is begging you, don't contact her anymore!"
No!
- She needs me now!
- Just end it here!
Both of you don't have the same fate.
Listen to me!
"By this way, both of you can live on well."
I don't care about what has happened anymore!
She is my woman for all my life!
Please be careful.
Slow down!
Get in!
Stop!
Xiamu!
Come on.
- I can't.
- Don't talk!
Just follow me!
"If you don't stop, you will spend your life in the prison!"
"I'd kill all of you, and spend my life rotten in prison, it doesn't matter to me!"
"Xiamu, don't!"
"Xiamu, don't!"
"- How much law do you know, lad?"
- I was just guessing.
"So Scott-Padget's gonna rule the roost, run the ship his way."
- It's a chance.
- What for?
Scott-Padget.
Stab him in the back.
Give him Jonah's toss.
- Don't be a fool.
- Now look would the captain care if he died?
We're after bigger things than one man.
And we'll get them with patience.
- That's the only word you know.
- I know this:
If we touch one officer our whole cause is lost.
Do you think he heard?
That old drunk?
What's it matter?
- Didn't I tell you to clean this up?
- I did.
You call this clean?
It seems I have to teach you another lesson.
Come here.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
"- Not in the least, Mr. Goss."
I thought I should report that...
Report what?
Wheatley's recovering from punishment.
The others are back on duty.
You told me all this yesterday.
"Really, I wish, sir, to make a suggestion."
"Well, forgive me if I..."
Things are crazy at work.
Because of this case.
Remember what I told you before?
What?
How the Jap raped a woman?
What about it?
You filthy slut.
That woman.
It was her.
What the hell are you talking about?
That woman he raped- it's the same woman whose house burned down.
"She went crazy after that, and used to run around naked at night."
My wife saw her at the public bathhouse.
"She was totally covered in rashes and boils,"
Mumbling gibberish the whole time.
Are you out of your mind?
Byeong-gyu's got to stop this.
Talking crap to his dimwitted buddies.
You worthless bastard.
It was your theory.
I was just messing with you.
Who in their right mind would believe crap like that?
"No, I think you're right."
It can't be the mushrooms.
That doesn't make sense.
Gimme a break.
What are you looking at?
Get outta here!
What?
Ignore her.
She's been doing that all morning.
What a nutjob.
"Stop, I said."
Get out.
Now!
Everything started on that day?
I'll try speaking to the Father.
What you're telling me is true?
Yes.
And you said the shaman told you this.
"From their perspective, a ghost is the spirit of a dead man."
But that man is alive.
"I've heard about this man, too."
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.
"And there are darker, more disturbing rumors-"
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?
"No, Father."
They're definitely not rumors.
You sound terribly sure.
Did you see it with your own eyes?
How can you be sure without seeing for yourself?
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.
There's nothing the Church can do for you now.
Come with me to the Jap's.
Sorry?
I gotta see for myself if he's really a ghost or not.
"If he is, then I won't be able to kill him."
Where is he?
Is everyone here?
Yeah.
Why'd you call us so early?
In this forest... he pursues you!
- Shit!
- What the hell...?
Welcome to the area of death.
The energies are useless here.
Who says it?
The magnetic field.
Download charged particles.
So Trajan was wrong?
Shit!
I do not give up!
"Hatta, let's flank it."
You're hurt?
Of course not...
I can not say the same thing about Trajan's partner.
Bill Carson.
"You found old Bill, huh?"
He was a Spartan-5.
And a friend.
"Establish a perimeter, we'll camp here."
And give him a decent funeral.
Ash has something special.
I have something for him.
"We walked together, side by side."
He waited to see me fall.
I never fall
I wanted to inoculate his black blood.
"I'll find you, Ash!"
Because you messed with the wrong gangster!
"Why do you always read the same book, Kix?"
What makes it so special?
"""Men do not perish in the results of lost wars,  But the loss of that resistance force"
"Did you park on the street, or did you use valet?"
"Street, 'cause i-I can't afford valet."
Good.
Meter or lot?
Meter.
And i went to a coffee shop to get some change.
"Okay,give me all the alleys in the area"
By commercial buildings near the hotel.
Now you said you threw the knife in the alley where you parked.
Is it any of these?
"These are near stores,"
If you threw the knife near where you got the change.
Um... it's one of those.
Is it that one just off fordham road?
"Yes,yes."
That's it.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
You did all right.
Print that.
We'll get our guys down there and check it out.
Looks like our paralegals have found something.
Let's hope it's a knife.
L.A.P.D. Is really working this one.
They love big media cases almost as much as we do.
"We found something over here,mr."
Nicholson.
"Oh,nice."
"Well,who says trial work isn't glamorous?"
Who's got a glove?
"I do,mr."
Nicholson.
Instantly regretted.
- Where did you learn that phrase?
"- It's true, sir."
"Threatening officers is serious, but given your clean sheet I'll be lenient."
Two dozen lashes.
- I said six.
- March him out.
Right turn.
Forward march.
There were many people who heard me say six.
It was not your decision to make.
- Did you take note of that phrase?
"- Phrase, sir?"
"""An impulse, instantly regretted."""
It may mean nothing.
"But in my opinion, he'd been drilled in it."
"- Drilled, sir?"
By whom?
- I wish I knew.
- He remembered his piece.
"- It didn't save him, did it?"
It helped.
Only two dozen.
Scott-Padget must have nigh run mad.
- You know what two dozen means?
- Shut your mouth.
It means a soft captain.
My old captain on the Swift he never gave less than six dozen.
"Yes, that's what he gave me."
Six dozen.
Look here!
All hands on deck to witness punishment!
I only asked.
This is an outrage.
I'm warning you.
I have powerful friends in London.
You'll hear more of this.
[Door shuts]
[Door opens]
You're going through a lady's room.
No gentleman would behave this way.
"No, you're right."
"But then again, murder isn't a very gentlemanly business, miss harwood."
I can't imagine what you hope to find.
"It seems on the night of the murder, you left the room before the shots were fired."
Who told you that?
I have nothing to hide.
"I hate the dark, I always have."
It's like claustrophobia.
"As soon as the lights went out, I had to get back here."
In the dark?
I told you.
I wasn't thinking.
I just had to get out.
Just a minute.
"Foyle, is this the way your men amuse themselves?"
I've had enough of this.
I'm not gonna be pushed around by some bloody stuffed shirt.
I want to leave.
"Still not possible, I'm afraid."
Fleming:
"I said, I want to go!"
"Officer, arrest this man."
Thank you.
She's very upset.
This is no good.
You got to straighten this thing out.
We got to have calm now.
We don't know what the hell she's gonna do.
She's hysterical.
Very excited.
She's wild.
And you got to take it easy.
You got children.
"I'm not saying you gotta go back to her this minute, but you got to go back."
You got to keep up appearances.
The two of them come to my house every day.
I can't have it.
"I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it."
Nobody says you can't do what you want.
We all know that.
This is what it is.
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family.
"You got to go home, okay?"
Look at me.
You got to go home.
Smarten up.
I'll talk to Karen.
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.
I'll say you'll go back to her and it'll be like when you first got married.
You'll romance her. lt'll be beautiful.
I know how to talk to her.
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa this weekend to pick up something for me.
She used to get so mad at me every time I'd talk about you.
She thought I had a secret crush on you.
Maybe she was right.
- Do you want to have dinner with me?
- What?
"Well, I'm asking you if you want to have dinner with me."
I...
I have to...
I have to think about it.
I'll have to ask Claire.
- All right.
- Okay.
"""D""!"
Congratulations!
You're improving!
I still don't understand what you're saying about twin primes.
- I'm explaining it to you!
- But I still don't understand.
Don't you know that it's possible to remove an infinite number of elements from an infinite set and still HAVE an infinite number of elements left over?
We spent quite a bit of time on this already!
My... my wife understood this on our first date!
Class dismissed!
Get out of here!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Very enjoyable dinner.
- Did you cook it yourself?
"- Yes, I did."
- What a liar.
"- Yes, I am."
What?
There is no enough time to wait for a suitable donor.
The only option left is to arrange for an organ illegally through an agent.
But...
It's very expensive.
I have lost hope fully!
My brother...
Don't say that now...
I'm here to help you.
I'll be there for you.
Listen.
I'm expecting a payment this week.
Give me 2 to 3 days.
I'll somehow arrange for the money.
No.
"No, Vikram."
- Don't talk like an idiot.
This is your brother's life.
That's the priority now.
You proceed with arrangements for the transplant.
We will take care of the rest later.
Priya.
Thank you so much.
"A boat load of lies, in those big beautiful eyes of yours."
"You girl, are an anaconda in the disguise of an innocent child."
So...
What's the next plan?
Erode.
Are we going by bus or by train?
Go!
Go fast.
Are you sure it's Vikram?
"Yes, I'm tracking the number you gave."
Can I ask you something?
What?
That Japanese guy.
You said he's a ghost.
$0?
I don't get how a living person can be a ghost.
It's not a living human.
He died a long time ago.
He must have been human once.
But not anymore.
"So then, the ghost got inside him?"
"Well, that's how it started."
"Not everything that moves, breathes, and talks is alive."
Countless people have perished because they didn't understand that.
If it's not stopped... that demon will destroy this village.
Demon?
An evil ghost!
"Even among other demons, he's a master of evil."
"If that's true, why did it have to be your daughter?"
What sin did that young girl ever commit?
Yes.
"If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch?"
No.
He's just fishing.
Not even he knows what he'll catch.
"He just threw out the bait, and your daughter took it."
That's all it was.
Park Chun-bae
- This one?
- No.
Money.
"Yes, money."
"I nearly got the suspect, but he escaped."
Where's your razor sharp intuition?
Many people want me to fail... so this case means a lot to me.
I don't need you letting me down.
You always were a pain in the ass.
Do me a favor and prove me wrong.
"Sir, I do nothing for nobody."
I'll get the murderer.
You'll get your promotion.
I hope you don't forget who helped you reach the top.
I want you to draw the suspect.
Try to bring him to life.
He's over 30.
He looks determined... without being ruthless.
There's something heroic about him.
He doesn't look like a killer.
He comes across so calm... acts like he has a dream... eyes full of passion.
- Hello.
"- It's me,Jeffrey."
Jeffrey?
Why haven't you left town?
I want my money now.
I want it tonight.
Tonight!
"Sure, I'll bring it tonight."
Mr. Weng.
You should let me handleJeffrey.
He's my responsibility.
- What if he squeals on me?
- He wouldn't.
"I don't trust anyone, including you!"
I know the rules ofthe game.
Yet they always turn away when I meet them.
As should yours.
"Then I must tear them out, if they are to obey such a command."
You must stop this.
"I have vowed to, a thousand times a day."
"To return to drink and whores, forcing you from my mind."
Then I catch glimpse of you.
And my world ends.
I have never felt greater love than when I hold my husband in my arms.
Gannicus.
What seizes you?
"You drop guard, allowing Barca advantage."
The man almost had you.
I was lost in a moment.
Caught by a dream.
Then wake from it.
Leave us.
"You are a Gaul, are you not?"
"Yes, Domina."
Many believe the seed of a Gaul to rival that of Jupiter himself.
Tell me.
How many sons sprang from your father's cock?
"Five, Domina."
And from his father before him?
The same.
"Your subligaria, remove it."
You are never to speak of this.
"Do you understand, slave?"
"Yes, Domina."
"Well, I would not look at you."
The sight turns stomach.
Enter me.
Why don't you help us out?
Will you come?
I think I'd like that.
Fine.
"Good night, and thanks."
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Betty Anderson's father stopped me.
- What did he want?
"He asked when you'll marry Betty, before or during college."
- I hadn't exactly thought of marrying her.
- I wouldn't hear of it if you wanted to.
"Anderson's a good foreman, but Betty is something else."
"- Yeah, I agree."
- Then stop seeing her.
I just can't stop seeing her.
I invited her to the graduation dance.
- Uninvite her.
"- Now, Dad, I can't do that."
You're gonna.
Do you realize what it'd mean if you married the local tramp?
"When you marry, you'll marry someone on your own level."
Call and tell her it's off.
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Call her.
"- Please, Dad."
"- Go on, call her!"
"1042W, please."
"I can understand you wanting to see this girl, but not in public."
You know what I mean.
Nobody's fighting you.
I'll be as big a Harrington as you are.
"Hey, fellas, what's up ?"
- Look at this stud.
"- What's up, man ?"
"Hey, playah."
"How you doin', man ?"
"Whass up, baby ?"
"Oh, no love."
No love.
I hear you been traveling in new circles.
What's up with that ?
- You tapping' that white girl ?
- [ All Laugh ]
That's why you ain't got more time for your boys?
Too busy fronting ?
"Too busy snow flaking. lf that's the case, you best be watching your back."
'Cause white women don't bring nothing' but trouble.
"That ain't white women, man."
That's women.
- That's your women.
"- Yo, are we gonna check out... some honeys on the westside ?"
- You riding ?
"- Hell, no."
This ain't about no honeys.
I know what it's about.
Those fools we stomped at Stepps hit my corner four strong last week.
- l gotta handle myself.
"- You slide out that side oftown,"
- they gonna handle you.
- They can bring it. I got my heat.
"All that gat's gonna do is create some unnecessary mayhem, man."
That's the black man's life-  madness and mayhem.
- How do you know ?
"Really, James, it's your own fault."
"You can't expect to worry yourself sick over Paul's death, and do your own job at the same time."
"I know, but-- - no ifs or buts about it."
You worried yourself into a really low state.
Now look what's happened.
I'm sorry.
"You're right, of course."
"I understand how you feel, but I want you to pull yourself out of it."
Promise?
If you promise not to go on about it.
It's a deal.
You just relax while I go boil another kettle.
Drink that up.
There's another one to come.
Who is it?
It's me.
May I come in?
If you don't mind catching flu.
How are you feeling?
Jolly good.
"James, let me ask you a question."
"Tris, I'm really not up to it-- no."
Shush.
Tell me...
"When is the last time we stood up to siegfried,"
I mean faced him out to the bitter end?
- Ah-- ah-- you see?
"You can't answer, can you?"
Because neither of us ever have.
We've always given in to him.
"Well, this time, I'm going to do it."
Do what?
You're under arrest!
These guys are clearly well trained...
Welcome!
Huh...?
!
Welcome...
May I take your order?
"Actually, I think this is all you need!"
See ya!
W-What do you want...?
You lose!
Yikes!
Over there!
I can't read this stuff!
Come and get me!
Shall we get down to serious business?
Won't you tell me what you did with the girls you kidnapped?
We should be arriving in Hunan Province about...
"So, we got no reply from the Foundation before departure."
But they've agreed to a conference.
"Doesn't that mean they are interested in the proposal from you, Commander?"
They'd better be.
Huh?
Aren't villians dressed like that supposed to be easily defeated?
Thanks!
You saved my life.
Why were you being chased by them?
"Well, I was just using them to pass the time."
But... is it really okay for me to come in here?
This ship's fine.
Here.
Go on in.
"Oh, no, I'm sorry."
"Uh, yes, I'm leaving."
But none of you are.
You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
The principal wanted to see me?
No...
I did.
I'm concerned about the detention today.
How Allison ended up in there with you and Mr. stilinski.
A sink was ripped off the wall.
You're lucky I'm here to explain that to people somehow.
You realize that?
Yeah.
I do now.
Good.
Are you having sex with my daughter?
Uh...
No.
I'm not having sex with your daughter.
I certainly hope not.
Hello?
It means he was born after his mom died... by c-section.
They had to pull him out of her dead body.
"You okay, dude?"
So was it an accident or not?
"The word all over the report is ""inconclusive."""
Then his parents could have been murdered?
"If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth."
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
This court is adjourned.
[chattering ]
"Nathan, get your father out of sight."
"All right, listen up."
I don't care what the judge says.
You can't murder a citizen of Eagle Bend and get away with it.
"So, by God, if they won't hang him, we'll do it for them."
You heard the judge.
Go home.
You stole my bullets.
"Now, careful, mister, we'll send them back."
stains:
Uh-huh.
It sure is easy to look tough...
... whenyouhaveloadedweapons and we don't.
"I guess you men wouldn't be interested in a fair fight, would you?"
"Well, I think we can manage a fair fight."
"-What do you say, boys?"
"-Oh, I love a fair fight."
[MEN grunting ]
[GUNSHOT]
Leave my boy alone.
"Sheriff, I could kill you right now."
"But truth be told, I don't want to."
"You want to kill me, but I ain't gonna kill you."
Because it ain't right.
You know that.
And I know that.
Justice has been done here today.
"Now, go home."
"Come on, get out of here."
Get on your horses.
I will reassess.
- I will signal in the usual way.
- No.
Absolutely no further radio contact.
You have to take photographs.
Deliver them personally to the Führer.
- Personally?
Why?
- He says he trusts you.
- He wants to hear from your own mouth.
"- Well, I'm flattered."
Admiral Canaris is sending a U-boat to pick you up off the coast of Scotland.
That's nice.
Have you been carrying this around?
Yes.
Why?
- Let's go.
- We'll get them both.
What's this?
Storm Island.
Two miles from the rendezvous.
- The U-boat will pick me up when?
- When you signal it.
From six in the evening until six in the morning.
Six in the evening till six in the morning.
Beginning when?
"A week from today, and for a week after that."
And you.
How will you get out of England?
I'm supposed to get to Liverpool somehow.
If they capture you and torture you?
- I have a suicide pill.
We'll be coming to Chicago tomorrow.
I wish I had more to tell you guys.
Sometimes it takes a new victim... new input to a case to break it wide open.
We're going to have to do an autopsy.
She marked her driver's license.
The donation was very important to her.
You can imagine.
Is there nothing you can do?
She lost too much blood from the wrist wounds... for them to be in any shape for donation.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
"Well, thank you very much for your kindness."
Brought those home last night... for her.
How many has he killed?
"As far as we know, 2."
Including my wife?
"No, no."
Your wife is number 3.
Don't call my wife a number.
Her name is Margaret Tattersall.
"I'm, uh..."
"I'm real sorry, sir."
What have you been doing down there?
Why didn't you catch him?
What have you been doing?
Want some coffee or anything?
"Oh, no."
I'm in enough trouble already.
But thanks.
OK.
See ya.
Holy shit.
They know me now.
"Are you aware of that, bitch?"
"They know my fucking face, my name, probably how long my fucking dick is."
That goddamn kid!
Why didn't you tell me about that fucking kid?
I swear I didn't see any kid.
He must have been hiding real good.
Quit lying to me!
Don't hit me no more.
"Pluto, don't let him hit me no more."
"Get rid of her, Ray."
It will be okay.
"Oh, shut the fuck up."
We'll get rid of the car.
They're not going to find us.
"They're not going to find you, maybe."
They're not going to find us!
Get your goddamn hand off me.
(SOBBING) We're going to be okay.
CHARLIE:
"Isn't there another way around here, Dale?"
DALE:
Watch your step.
There's some rotten timbers up ahead.
I crashed my motorcycle on this bridge when I was 14.
DUD:
Is that right?
DALE:
They had to call the volunteer fire department to put it out.
You can still see some of the burn marks.
Perfect hideout.
You think the old man's there?
"No, Rihanna is out."
We cannot go to...
"We cannot be seen at a Rihanna concert, guys."
"No, I've got the perfect thermos."
We gotta hunt!
We have to go and kill something!
Hopefully not an innocent something.
I don't like killing innocent animals.
We'll pick on the animals that obviously deserve it.
First thing's first.
Let's go buy some guns.
What do you mean that there's a ten-day waiting period?
That doesn't seem real.
We have the right to bear guns.
I know that's a fact.
That's one of the commandments.
"Dude, it's the law."
"If a man disrespects you in a bar and pours a beer on your head, you have the right to shoot that man."
Shut up.
"God, gimme a gun!"
"Just gimme a gun, man!"
All right.
All right.
"So, we can't have guns."
"We just need weapons that can kill things, and money is no object."
"I've got a credit card, so let's make it happen."
- Do you have one of these?
- Mm-hmm.
It's pretty inten...
You should get one.
29.99 APR.
Not bad.
"I don't own any forest land, do any milling."
"Just lumberyards, really."
Douglas is an attorney.
And a very good one.
- Do any trial work?
"- No, no."
Nothing as exciting as that.
I confine myself to handling the Harper interests.
That's a fancy way of saying he holds the purse strings.
I can't stand that vinegar you serve.
Where did you get that stuff anyway?
"The wine is lovely, Stan."
It just doesn't mix well with Scotch.
Now she's trying to tell me what to drink.
"It's not what you drink, Stan, it's how much."
"You are not married, are you, Mr. Gordon?"
No.
I'm a bachelor.
"Well, now, you just take my advice and you stay a bachelor."
"Please, try to ignore him, Mr. Gordon."
You can see that he's...
You can see that he is drunk.
"Right, Mr. Gordon?"
- He's back.
"- Yes, I think you're right."
"It's all right, Mr. Gordon."
Just be quiet.
It'll pass in a few moments.
Bobby.
"It's all right, Bobby."
We're here together.
"Go to sleep, Bobby."
"Doesn't that get an ""excuse me"" in return?"
"It's all right, Jake."
Some people just have better manners than others.
"That's okay, miss-- your husband's right."
My bad.
"Forget it, Jake."
It's Chinatown.
Your name's Jake-- you never heard that?
"All my life, Mr. Mulwray."
You okay?
Fine.
You didn't have to.
"No, I... kind of did."
Do we know that guy from somewhere?
There's something about him.
I've never seen him before.
Like... from our supermarket?
Maybe we go to the same dry cleaner?
"Well, while you keep guessing, why don't I go see if we can switch these seats, huh?"
All right.
All right.
Could we know him from work?
"All I know is, flight delays make nice people cranky and cranky people crankier."
"Well, he obviously falls under the latter category."
"...that's not how I do things, understand?"
Yeah.
Definitely the latter.
How do I know that guy?
"So, anyway, there I was, still trying to be cool on my second day at NSA."
It was my second day;
your third.
Right.
Do as you wish!
I am going to divorce you!
I will divorce you.
That's enough!
Stop bringing my name up in your fights.
Get divorced as soon as possible.
"Besides, after seeing you fight like... this, I'll neither get married nor fall in love."
God damn it!
"Between parentheses, x equals 2x cube."
You should write too.
Minus x equals...
Sinan?
Is Gamze still angry with me?
Minus x
"I don't know, dude."
"She may have told you some things, right?"
You know that she's a tough one.
We also know the problems between her parents
"Seeing her parents like that, she's totally being drawn away from love."
We cant deny that she liked you too.
And you gave her hope.
Then you didn't even come to school.
"So, she's angry..."
"Can't we just solve these questions first, and then talk?"
What about you guys?
Look man.
My dad is calling.
Hello!
I am at my friend's house.
We're studying together.
Of course not dad.
Why should I lie?
It says the local DA is missing.
Good.
Get in touch with Lister this afternoon.
Tell him he did okay and he'll be paid in the usual way.
Okay.
What do you want?
- We're in trouble.
- What do you mean we're in trouble?
"Last night, Stan pretended to be drunker than he really was."
"After Douglas left, he sneaked down the back stairway."
- So what?
- Don't you understand?
He saw us.
He even took pictures.
He's a creep.
He's gonna use those pictures to divorce me.
- You let him.
- I won't get a cent from him.
- That's your problem.
- No.
"No, it's your problem too."
He's gonna smear us across every front page in this country.
I don't want that and you don't want that either.
I've had worse publicity than this and survived it.
Go home.
- Figured you'd run here and warn him.
- Wait a minute.
I've already waited long enough.
"I thought about you all night, Gordon."
I thought about my wife with a slime like you.
"- All right, buster..."
- Stay out of this.
That's the logical choice for a Master.
But only nearby.
idiot.
It is the sixth day since the war commenced.
You are the first to make their way here.
boy?
O-Of course I am!
You want me to die?
!
and I'm no longer a Master!
I-I'm just an ordinary human.
I'm just a victim in all this!
when we can't do anything!
What?
Do you have a problem with that?
Of course not.
You are the first to withdraw from this war and to use this church's services since it was founded.
I will offer you every hospitality.
What?
You're saying I'm the only one that's been knocked out?
what will he say?
This is all you people's fault!
Rider!
Oh?
Then Rider was of no use to you?
Damn right!
she went and died like a dog!
Any other Servant would have been way more useful!
I did exactly as Grandfather said!
My preparations were perfect!
But those bastards all got in my way!
It was two against one!
Come look at this.
You ready?
Look.
You see?
"Empty, right?"
I stayed the hell away from the mountains since that day.
Even put the store up for sale.
How is that proof?
What?
Damn you...
That's not the point.
"The point is, when I opened my eyes, there he was-stark naked except for a diaper."
A diaper?
That's right.
A grown man?
I'm telling you.
- Grown men can wear diapers.
- Get outta here.
Bladder control problems are surprisingly common in adults.
But why go into the woods to treat incontinence?
- Incontinence...
- Am I talking to myself here?
"Anyway, he had his face buried in the carcass, his body covered in blood... his eyes all bloodshot."
"Then he looked up, and all of a sudden..."
I haven't slept since that day.
- He was chewing on the guts?
- That's right.
- You saw him eating raw flesh?
- Yeah...
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.
"You do that a lot with your passengers, do you?"
No.
But I've driven Kelly home before.
So you are on first-name terms?
She booked the cab in her name.
You see anything suspicious?
Anyone outside her flat?
Nah.
Not that I recall.
You went straight to your next pick-up?
"Yeah, in Bermondsey."
Is she all right?
Kelly Mahon is dead.
You're joking?
No.
OK.
We might need to speak to you again.
What do you reckon?
Should get Ange to run some background on him just in case.
I reckon we should go and speak to Kelly Mahon's fiance.
I was working late and...
crashing in the office.
"You do that often, sleep at work?"
No.
We just got this big client.
I was under pressure to get their accounts finished.
That's where Kelly and I met.
My firm do the accounts for the lab.
Kelly didn't mind you staying out all night?
She would have ended up crashing at Chloe's talking flowers.
Someone can verify you staying at your work?
I dunno.
Give him a piece of this.
Hmmm...
Hurry!
Dad!
Can I come in?
"Don't be mad at me, Dad!"
"Aw, you know I don't hold a grudge!"
I'm coming to open it.
Have a taste!
Can't we go a bit faster?
I'm sorry but this isn't an airplane.
"We're going all right, by the way."
"A department store on the left, a photoshop and a drugstore on the right."
Heading towards the square.
"A roundabout on the square, in a clockwise direction."
Compulsory yield of way.
"Hotel Lion to the right, the city museum in the front."
"You're trudging so slowly, as if you weren't aware of the fire!"
"Meanwhile, the house is burning down!"
Faster!
That way!
Everything fits.
"A dairy to the left, a watchmaker to the right."
Everything's reversed here!
Are you sure we didn't come in through the other gate?
What's this?
What the hell are you looking for here?
Can't you see it's a one-way street?
Don't you know where the fire is?
It's the Bernaus' house.
"No. 15, Lake Street."
Move back!
Bee sting in 1 is asking for you.
Have them start the orientation manuals.
I'll be with them soon.
"- Carter, MVA, two minutes."
- But not to hold their breath.
"Dr. Carter, so there's a trauma coming in."
Yeah.
"Why don't you take the bee sting in 1, the wrist fracture in 4 and the burning rash in 2?"
Care to give me a hand?
- Help me!
- Why not?
- Help me!
- Hey!
"That's just been mopped, damn it!"
You don't talk if you're having a real seizure.
- Remember that for next time.
"- Come on, man!"
- Think it's always this crazy here?
- Probably.
"They need to bring you back to the VA hospital, sir."
- I don't understand.
- Your driver will explain.
"You guys suck, you know that?"
- Don't bother.
We don't have any beds.
"- So, what else is new?"
"- No, I'm serious."
Try Mercy.
- They' re refusing patients too.
- Then try Rush.
We' re filled.
- I've been bounced all over town with this guy.
"Guys, I'm giving you the password of geometry."
"Pi, meaning 3.14."
I got it.
Try it first. 3-1-4.
Or 4-3-1.
Try them all.
This is it!
I couldn't delay her any longer.
She dropped off the grandson too.
We are almost at the street of the school.
What did you do?
We'll be done in 2 minutes.
We found the questions.
"Come on, get out of there."
What are you still doing?
Questions for physics and history.
This is heaven!
Get out!
You'll get caught.
Forget about history and physics.
What happened?
CSI Urfa operation has been completed.
Let's hope for the best.
This is it!
This is what I call killing three birds with one stone.
"Oh, come on."
That can't be.
They wouldn't dare do such a thing.
Don't you think I will be able to understand from their answers?
This is the first time in my life I've passed a math exam so easily.
"As I said yesterday, you all solved it in a different way, right?"
"If we all get a full mark, we will mess the whole thing up."
"No, I don't."
"- When we found Allison, she was on a direct course for self-destruction."
Poor kid would be dead by now if we hadn't intervened.
"We saved her life, Ted."
You might even say that I still have a hand in keeping her alive.
Should we have another listen?
Don't worry.
Your daughter's not going anywhere.
"Yeah, we can keep her as long as you like."
"I understand your timeline, Liana."
"No, we're arranging transportation now."
Tell Musa his delivery's on its way.
"Florida, seriously?"
Right.
"Well, we'll move somewhere colder, then."
- Canada?
- Maple syrup and mullets?
No thanks.
Did mom fight for me?
"You told her I wanted to live with you, right?"
"Yes, but..."
"She didn't put up a fight, did she?"
Liana was overwhelmed by the news.
She doesn't want us to leave.
- Screw her.
- Don't be like that.
Like what?
She's never home.
She treats you like shit.
- She hates me.
- She doesn't hate you.
- Hey.
You're okay with me doing this?
That's what you came here for.
Who is he?
Takenaka San from Planet Music Japan.
Sleeping your way up?
Why are you working here?
I thought you were at Grand Pacific.
You've been lying to me.
I wasn't lying to you.
After the tsunami I couldn't pay tuition.
I graduated thanks to 1.4 million from your parents.
How could I tell you I didn't get that job?
Then return the money.
You said we'd merge our finances anyway.
Maybe not.
Maybe I need to rethink marrying a whore.
"""Sorry, I was trying to turn you into a delivery girl."""
"""But you made me want to go straight."
"I promise I'll be back!"""
Yes?
"If you're staying, you'll need to pay the overnight fee."
Why?
Your companion left.
He'll be back.
- But...
- I promise he'll be back.
"Could you contact him, then?"
What?
Call his cell.
Don't have his number?
"I have his email, I'll email him."
He's not coming back.
What do you need to hide from?
Your life is perfect.
I'm serious. I would give anything to have your life.
My life is so pathetic.
You have this great house.
Parents that are there.
No one bothers you at school.
"Rickie, I need to talk to you about the gun."
Don't.
"- You can't carry a gun, Rickie."
- l don't.
Because it would be really bad.
Tragically bad.
"Angela, I don't carry a gun. I wouldn't even know how to shoot one."
But didn't Brian see you?
Isn't that what he's going to tell them?
This is really serious.
People are going to think you are dangerous.
I know.
That's what I want.
"So, what did happen?"
My cousin brought it in to sell it.
And I got real mad at him for bringing a gun into school.
"So, we got into this big argument..."
and the next thing I knew the thing fell out of the box and went off.
And he peed in his pants and ran away.
- He did not.
- He did.
Big stain.
And that's what happened with the gun?
That's the whole story of the gun.
And now Brian is going to say you did it.
What do I do with the bones?
- Back there.
- Really?
"Yeah, the squirrels love 'em."
"Do you know that I lived in New York for most of my life, and I've never been to central park at night."
[Whistling]
[Indistinct chatter]
"How you doin', mama?"
- You goin' out?
- I ain't goin' out.
"If you wanna let someone come in, we can do some business, man."
What do I have to do?
"It's a hundred bucks, baby."
You don't ask questions... come on.
Cute.
[Heavy breathing]
There's this client of mine.
He likes to do young boys.
That's our specialty around here.
This one also wants to be done by a chick at the same time.
That's where you come in.
"Not me, man."
I don't get involved with chicken hawks.
I think you're pretty sick...
I'm goin'.
"Hey, this guy's a good customer of mine."
"I told him I'd get him a chick, cunt."
You ain't goin' nowhere.
"What's goin' on, here?"
I've been waitin' twenty minutes.
- Let me go!
"- Shut up, bitch!"
- Nothing?
The very time when you should have.
We call that dumb insolence.
"Bring the lamp closer, carpenter."
- There is a trace of worm.
- I thought you should know.
Nothing a little whitewash won't cure.
It might make its way to the midshipmen's berth.
You should look.
If you think it important.
Somebody being taught his manners?
"Overdoing it, isn't he?"
- That will do.
"- Aye, sir."
"All right, get up."
- What is he being punished for?
- Cutting his initials on the table.
- Where is this trouble you mentioned?
- Chapman!
All I see is a patch of uncoated timber.
Is that all?
"I thought you should see, sir."
- The wind's freshening.
- Why have you reversed my orders?
- Sir?
- I wanted the gallants set.
- But I find nothing.
- I judged...
"You judged, Mr. Scott-Padget?"
You judged?
- It's good seamanship.
- You're impertinent.
"I know, you're sensitive."
"Trust me, I get it."
"Hey, why don't you have dinner with me and Steven and the kids then you can just stay over...?"
Why'd she wanna hang out with you and your husband?
The last thing I'd feel like doing.
If being in this wedding is too painful...
"Oh, God, you guys."
"Please, stop it."
"Relax, relax."
"That's enough, okay?"
"Seriously, you guys, I'm f..."
I've gone through breakups before.
"If you remember, I handle them quite well."
"You've been there, you've seen it."
I'm perfectly capable of doing this.
I can do it again.
I want you to stop worrying about me.
I'm fine.
BEN:
I know it's here somewhere.
I spoke with George Lane in Music.
He had a whole list of references for you.
"Well, that's okay."
You can just call me when you find it.
I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.
I know.
"A girl can dream, though."
You're just too good a guy.
[SIGHS]
Why are you married again?
[LAUGHS]
"Seriously, why?"
!
I hid it in my office before the police came.
You stole the medallion?
"Oh, purely for safekeeping."
Why?
"I had no choice, MacGyver."
You don't realize what's at stake.
I'd say about 20 years... for robbery.
I can explain everything.
My office is this way.
Come on.
In you come.
It's been torn apart.
"All right, don't touch anything."
I'll call the police.
"Nonsense, this is how it always looks!"
A neat office is the product of an empty mind!
Professor?
"Just a moment, MacGyver."
Hold your horses.
Ah.
"There we are, safe and sound."
Just as I promised.
"Now, what's going on?"
"Ah, yes, well, that requires some explaining."
Yes.
We are here.
You said the riddle on the Ark was a set of instructions?
Exactly.
"And if, uh, Cleeve stole the Ark, it can only mean that he's after the treasure!"
Is there some reason you cou--?
Is there some reason you couldn't have told the police that?
Stage three.
How long do we stay there?
Two days at the most.
Then we go to four.
"Well, what I wanna know..."
"Would you make a note of this, Cathy?"
What I wanna know is do we really need this set?
"Excuse me, sir."
I don't wanna interrupt you.
Is that the shark from Jaws?
"Yeah, I believe it is, Lieutenant."
That's the one that they used in the picture?
I think so.
"Well, that looks different to me."
I can't help that.
If we do scene 31 on stage four...
Could they have two?
I...
"You know, because in the picture..."
Lieutenant...
"...at the end, it got all mangled."
"Lieutenant, I know you didn't come here to talk about sharks."
I'm pressed for time.
What do you want?
"Well, I just wanted to ask a couple questions..."
We got wardrobe in five minutes.
I can give you two minutes.
Fine.
Thank you very much.
"I understand, sir, that you and your wife were living apart."
"That's true, Lieutenant."
We haven't been close for some time now.
It is my fault.
I should have worked harder.
Now she's gone!
She's not gone.
I know where she is.
Sit down.
How do you know where she is?
Now use your head.
She's a young girl.
She wants to party.
She wants to get wild.
Too late to leave the island.
Where is she?
Where's the only place she could go?
"Eden East, the singles' side."
We gotta go get her.
You're damn right we do!
And I'm going with you!
I am not letting you go alone!
I don't care if I have to go there all night!
To find Trudy.
We're gonna go find Trudy for him!
"We can't even go to that side, all right?"
"And it's gonna get very dark, very soon."
Plus we have to be in bed...
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.
We have to be to bed at a very reasonable hour tonight because we cannot miss the sunrise in the morning.
"Now, Marcel said if we miss that sunrise, we will not be completing our course."
"We are here for the course, all right?"
- Yes.
"And stop eating and drinking, as well."
You've got just one thing to think about:
Allison.
"If you were gonna get married, why didn't you tell me?"
- You wouldn't have approved.
- You never gave me a chance.
"At least it would've been a proper marriage, not a cheap weekend affair."
- Don't say that.
"- Well, what was it?"
- I'd like to talk with you alone.
- You can talk to both of us.
"This has to do with the business, not your wife."
- I'll wait outside.
"- Okay, honey."
I can get it annulled.
I don't want trouble between us.
I was in love with Betty and wanted to marry her.
You weren't in love.
You had an itching for her.
"She took you, son."
She took you.
"Goodbye, Dad."
"- When you come home, don't bring her."
- Then I won't be there.
Rodney what about college?
I'm not going.
I have to support her.
"You can have a job here, if you work like everyone else."
That's good enough for me.
"Thanks, Dad."
"I knew you weren't coming down for lunch, so I thought... ."
"It's such a beautiful day, darling."
Why don't you get dressed and go for a walk?
"Dad, I need to tell you something."
I passed the exam.
Good job.
God bless you son.
When do you think you'll be here?
"Dad, please."
"I beg you, don't..."
We're going to introduce you to a nice girl.
"Dad, what could I possibly do there?"
"Apply for your military service, and come back to Urfa."
"Yourpast, yourfuture, your destiny..."
It's all here...
He doesn't care.
Why couldn't you ask about the police station?
Why didn't you make him come back?
I'll find a way.
He's got little left to finish.
While we eat shit there?
You are bankrupt.
We're living in misery and he dishonors us.
You even sold yourgold teeth.
People are laughing at us.
We were taken to the police.
"People make fun of us on the streets, in the mosques..."
"I'd give you anotherson right now, but it takes a real man."
I gave you a son and a daughter.
Yourson didn't turn out to be a man.
"Stop this nonsense, Kezban."
God damn you...
You faggot.
He took after you.
What have you got here?
With a pistol... as was the custom of this kind of execution...
"He fired the ""coup de grace""."
Do you believe in God?
"No, but I enjoy the tranquility here."
Want to check the gun?
I trust you.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night ofdesolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams
When we have each other
Who needs tomorrow
When we have today
- I can't see.
- Your corneas are badly damaged.
- Will I recover?
- Your sight will never be perfect.
- My sight is so blurred!
- We can do an operation transplant.
Will I be blind?
"Jenny, I'm Sergeant Chang."
Do you remember the murderer's face?
"Please, leave me alone."
I'm frightened.
Calm down.
SIX MONTHS LATER
"Yeah,"
I have a date with you.
Half with olives.
We aim to please.
"Well, you hit the bulls eye Tara."
What?
You know how I like to kid around.
"Yeah, you're famous for it."
"Dad, you really think that's gonna help what's going on?"
"Look, you know I think this counseling crap is ridiculous but I promised your mom I'd try again."
We'll be okay.
Right.
You just focus on your game.
Whitey kick your ass today?
I didn't go to practice.
"What's going on with you, Nate?"
"Nothing, I just need some time."
Okay?
No its not okay.
It's career suicide.
"- Dad, Keith said..."
- Keith said!
You talked to Keith?
You take advice from Keith you'll end up spending the rest of your life running a second rate auto garage.
Is that what you want?
I told you.
I don't know what I want.
That's just freaky.
Where do you get off telling Nathan he can quit the team?
I didn't tell him he could quit.
"He wanted to talk, we talked."
"Maybe you ought to try it, sometimes."
ADRIAN:
It's me.
I'm not going to be left out.
I'm not interested in you.
Where's Clementine?
What are you doing here?
Why shouldn't I be here?
I'm friends with all of you.
"Er...well, nothing now."
You know what he does to his victims.
He lures them off trains by gaining their trust.
"He gets them alone, kills them."
Lots of people kill.
What does he do specifically?
Er...
He takes them somewhere dark...underground.
It's strange.
They're such pretty girls yet he wants them in the dark.
Go on.
"He strangles them, he waits until they're dead and then rapes them."
What else does he do?
Tell me.
They wear perfume.
"He puts them in cellars, Anderson shelters, confined spaces, things like that."
The smell of it becomes almost unbearable.
"You know who he is, don't you?"
What I'm going to tell you goes no further.
- It's entirely confidential.
- Mm-hm.
"But if there have been 12 deaths, I think I must tell you."
"There was a man, he worked for me."
Good at his job.
Let's just say we both did good.
Beifong says you're free to go.
"Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako."
"Don't worry about it, bro."
"Nice job, Mako."
You're going to make a great Detective.
"But, chief, there aren't any Detective openings right now."
"Actually, we have two openings."
Mwah.
"Mako, I missed you so much."
"Oh, yeah, did I forget to tell you?"
Korra's back.
"Korra, hey, I missed you too."
So you're not still mad at me?
Why would I be mad?
"We had that fight before you left, remember?"
"No, not really."
"I got attacked by a dark spirit, and I lost my memory for a little while."
Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.
Was it a bad fight?
Uh...
Mm...
No.
"No, it..."
it wasn't that bad.
"Korra, we don't have much time."
We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq.
I think I know just the man to talk to.
"Guys, hey!"
What do you think?
"Varrick industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special."
I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What'd you do that for?
I confronted Tyler about his bed-wetting.
[Laughs]
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Look, we're sorry, okay?"
It's far from okay.
We broke up.
"Well, we'll talk to him."
We'll work it out.
- Yeah.
"- No, I broke up with him."
"After he denied being a bed wetter, he admitted to having a fetish for..."
"Ooh, let's just say it was nasty."
"What do you mean, ""nasty""?"
"Yeah, what kind of nasty things was this dude into?"
Get out of my morgue!
Losers!
The competition has ended.
"Richard Castle, you have solved the murder of Phillip Harris."
[Applause]
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're too kind.
"You have proven yourself worthy, and we, the members of the Greatest Detective Society, offer you a place at our table."
"I'm humbled and flattered, but I'm afraid I must decline."
What?
What are you doing?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with the best of the best.
Not for me.
Someone's helping these guys.
"I mean, maybe unfreezing 'em."
It's like when captain America was trapped in the Antarctic ice...
Doc.
Right.
But there's always a facilitator.
"I mean, Lex Luthor."
Case in point.
"Hey, psycho."
"Hey, psycho."
What's up?
You switch to decaf yet?
Not a chance.
I got nine lives.
Haven't burned through half of 'em yet.
"Oh, right."
"Well, uh..."
This is some ugly-looking shrapnel.
Ugly and old.
Like FDR old or Bush 41 old?
I'm thinking somewhere in between.
But this puppy's been modified.
- Who are you?
- Soto.
Civilian authority.
Pulled that from a tree branch.
So he's putting something in them.
"Yeah, most of these whack jobs add ball bearings, nails, whatever's handy, put 'em in the mines to maximize carnage."
This doesn't look like some random piece of metal.
"You mind if I, uh..."
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.
"All I needed was a 2,000-watt generator, a test vehicle, and someone willing to risk their life for science."
You look great.
Look at this.
I have cameras all over the place ha-ha!
Really good.
"All right, so here's the plan..."
You're gonna be in the back of the truck.
"When I get a little low on juice,"
I want you to throw me the power cord right through the open top.
Perfect.
"- Charge it up, be good to go."
- Got it.
Who's driving the truck?
He is.
Oh.
That's why we got you the harness.
"I was pretty sure we were about to make history, continuing the American tradition of bold innovation."
"All right, Adam, here's what I want you to do..."
Throw me that football.
It's got a plug in there.
And I'll catch it.
We're just two kids playing football. [ Laughs ]
"All right, stig, nice and easy."
[ Tires screech ]
Geez!
Wait up.
I can't catch up.
He only knows one speed.
[ Laughs ]
"Stig, slow down."
Too much!
"All right, we can do it."
The Falcon was called by Dragan.
"I made a movie about him, titled ""Tycoon""."
He was a champion at the Sarajevo Olympics.
Then he became a sniper during the siege of Sarajevo.
That's where I met him while I was locked up with the Serbs.
Are you serious?
- One thing?
A sniper.
- A sniper?
Then...
What is the plan?
- We do not complicate things.
Do not we commit?
What does it mean to her 'not to complicate things'?
We do not reveal who we are.
A king's knee would go a long way to many of these parts.
I do not want to go.
- Quiet.
We eat and go.
I'm not hungry.
I do not want to go.
"And so, I found myself facing two of my worst nightmares:"
"Dragan the Falco and Rakia, the Balkan lubricant."
Cheers.
We have said more than once.
More than once.
A million times.
But do you know something?
Now...
Now you can do the second part of the documentary.
"Can you say something, please?"
Thank you.
I knew it was wrong.
I thought someone would find them and mend them.
[Edith sobbing]
I didn't think I was being a traitor.
I was just so scared.
What will happen to me?
Will they hang me?
Will I go to prison?
No.
Don't have a case to answer.
You're free to go.
"Well, thank you."
It's ok.
"You're not going to forget David, are you?"
No.
"'Cause he was right, wasn't he?"
Yeah.
[Birds chirping]
"You should understand, Stanley, that you could go to prison."
But I haven't done anything.
"Yes, you have."
"You've lied to me, a police officer, and obstructed the course of justice."
"No, I didn't."
"You told me you hadn't touched anything when you went into your father's room, which isn't true, is it?"
You took your father's suicide note.
No.
There was pen and paper up there on the desk.
"And when I visited him in hospital, he was as surprised as I was that the note hadn't been found."
What did you do with it?
I destroyed it.
Why?
To...
Any physical details that may help to identify him?
There's nothing.
He's completely perfect.
"Freddie, now that you're here, I've been thinking..."
Yes?
"If Roland's parents were looking for him, surely they would have informed the Constabulary."
Maybe so.
Perhaps... they don't care.
You're having second thoughts.
You asked if I wanted to know the truth... perhaps not knowing is the best course.
You wouldn't be the first of my clients to change their mind.
No father could be better than William.
He loves the boy.
He truly is his son.
"And you, Julia?"
I can't bear the thought of not having Roland.
Well then it's settled.
"He couldn't have better parents, you must never question that."
(Julia sighs.)
- I'm gonna take this way!
"- Come on, over here!"
- I've got nothing!
- Help me!
Nothing that way!
Look.
Over there!
It won't get away this time!
"- Everyone, stay close."
- It's over here!
Come on!
Keep up with them!
Go!
Let me ask you one last time.
Let us go.
You can call me an obsessed hypocrite if you want... but I can't let you go.
You never loved me back.
I thought things would get better if I held onto your empty glances... but you never thought of me the way I cherished you.
"If I can't have your heart, then I'll keep your body at least."
You'll stay with me until I die.
(Downtown Magok)
How did it go?
I found a merchant who trades with Puyo.
He's at the tavern.
Let's go.
I work for Sosuhno.
You want to buy seal fur?
Yes.
You're late.
Mr. Oh from Haengin bought all we have.
I heard the pirates smuggle seal fur.
I'll pay you handsomely.
"Let me meet Buwiyum, the pirate captain."
You can't meet him unless he approaches you.
Help me.
That's him.
Step back!
I want to see your captain.
I don't want to fight.
Lead us to him.
Mr. Yu in Magok sent them.
They have a letter from him too.
I'm Buwiyum.
You want to trade with me?
"I'm disguised as a merchant... but I'm Jumong, Commander of the Damul Army."
"All right, well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you."
"Well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you!"
So let's try.
I want to try!
"Well, let's try!"
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry that it took all of that.
But you know what?
"Now I can honestly say, with love in my heart' that you are my man."
Could you ever love me again?
"Well, you're my wife."
And I never stopped loving you.
Now come here and give me a kiss.
This next jam goes out to all you party people in the house!
"And that time that you got sick, you didn't want me to see you, so you locked me out of the bathroom?"
No!
Then I passed out!
Yeah.
And you called the ambulance.
"Well, because, before you passed out, it sounded like you were dying in there."
You know?
I thought I was dying.
I did.
"Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do?"
I should have broken down the door.
You've been a really good friend.
You have been the best friend in the world to me.
"Now don't stop dancing, y'all!"
Party ain't over!
It's far from over!
"Silence, please!"
- I know I promised.
- Won't you come for my birthday?
"Pramod, I'm really sorry..."
- I have to go to class.
Bye.
"- No, wait."
"So, here you are."
Please excuse the formalities.
You only need to read the last three pages.
Did Helene invite you to my birthday?
- No.
- You can't rely on her.
- Then I better do it.
- Thanks.
There are a few things I don't understand.
Can we look at it?
What does that mean?
It means that you and Anna have 100% control of the fund.
"No, not that."
Here it is.
The part where it says I have to live in Denmark.
"Yes, we haven't talked about that yet."
To build an organization like that you have to live in Denmark.
- Can't I just come to board meetings?
"- No, it's a demand on my behalf."
Why should I do that?
Because I said it's a demand on my behalf.
You mean that?
I can't spend half a year here and half a year there?
Have I said anything I don't mean?
"Maybe everyone else kisses your ass, but I won't."
- What do you mean?
There's some pain involved.
"You know, this is the only place around here with bars on its windows."
- I wonder what Doug was so worried about.
"- Come on, baby."
There better be somethin' good in here.
There we go.
Got it.
Looks like he didn't leave much.
"- Well, I've worked with less."
- Check for bills.
Bunch of junk mail.
Magazines.
Hello.
Hey.
Here's a quiz.
Tells you how to pick your mate based on what you eat.
"Okay, Mike."
What's your favorite meat?
"- Pleasure reading later, Sam."
"- Oh, you're no fun."
"Mike, two guys with guns coming fast."
They must have been watching the house.
They got the back covered.
Nothin'.
Just because there are no windows or doors... doesn't mean there are no exits.
The thing to look for is the air-conditioner unit.
That's where the wall is weakest.
"Also, people watch doors."
They don't watch air conditioners.
"Ooh, the damsel in distress."
She said it was an emergency.
What do you want me to do?
Oh!
He just... he just kicked me!
"Annie, tell him off."
"Oh, that's Mitchell."
- I'd better warn him about this.
Can...
"- Yeah, yeah."
Just put the Hoover round and maybe just dust a little.
Thanks.
Mitchell?
Is that another ghost?
"It's bloody Hogwarts, this place."
"No, Mitchell is a vampire, actually."
Vamp...
"At last, someone normal."
I'd better go and...
Are you gonna do both beds?
- Do both beds.
Do...
- OK.
"Just in case, you know, in the night, me and you just want to... in the night, just sort of do that."
- You've got to be joking.
- It won't be for long.
"It's just until his dad recovers, and then he'll be out of here."
I will make sure of it.
"We just thought, with you having gone through it..."
Me going through it is exactly why I can't have him in the house.
The kid's still feeding.
Staying clean from meat is a day-by-day...
"No, no, a minute-by-minute thing."
"How am I gonna manage if he's giving it, ""Oh, let's go out on the razz,"
"""find some women, drink them dry""?"
Arsey.
"Anyway, how can I help you?"
"Can you tell us who you issued this to, please?"
I can try.
Here we are.
6733.
"He gave the name of, T Dan Smith."
T Dan Smith.
A-ha.
That's what it says here.
"So, T Dan Smith, until recently, leader of the council, has fallen on hard times?"
"Well, probably not."
"Some people aren't comfortable about using their real names, you know."
And not just the thieves.
There's a lot of shame in falling on hard times.
Sad.
"Yeah, I can see the tracks of your tears."
Aren't you supposed to take their identities?
I'll tell Mr Dawson.
"I can do a full audit of this place, sir."
"Maybe get it shut down, you know."
"Hey, and I thought we were getting along."
What was pawned?
Four weeks ago.
And all on the one ticket.
~ All this?
~ Aye.
He said he'd be back for all of it.
"Mind, they all say that, like, but I believed him."
And all this is definitely his?
No question in my mind.
"Well, if he's half-inched anything, I'll be back to see you."
"Yours, you mean."
My interests are those of France.
All I can be is King.
You still do not seem to understand that.
And all I seek is a place of my own!
A little spot in the corner where I shall not be trampled upon.
It's that too much to ask?
The Canal du Midi serves all of France.
You cannot own it any more than I can.
What's this for?
So you don't have to steal it from me.
There is one way you can retain your commercial interests:
It would require you performing a service for me.
A service?
"The historian, Thomas."
You know him well.
I know him.
Get to know him better.
"I want him to trust you, implicitly."
Why?
Because he's a spy.
Let us through!
You want some?
"Yes, I want some."
"Are you, Matilde?"
"Yes, but I'm not on duty."
I'd like to have a word with you.
"I am a friend of Madamoiselle Masson, the doctor."
A kind soul.
Whatever happened to her?
She was murdered.
"the day before she died, she came here looking for poison."
I'm going to meet my friend.
Sir.
Yes.
- I'm from Chennai.
"2 days ago, a man was found dead in a road accident in Kanyakumari."
Yes.
How do you know him?
Actually...
Then why do you want to know about him?
"Sir, I'm from the media."
You guys want news 24/7!
Why do you torture us for that?
There is a guy called Panju.
He is dealing with this case.
Go meet him.
"Thank you, sir."
Give him the keys.
Don't drink and drive.
Got it?
"- Okay, sir."
"Sorry, sir."
- Bye.
He is a relative of the MLA.
Won't you enquire all these things in advance?
"I will be careful hereafter,Sir."
Have you caught a single proper case till now?
It doesn't make a difference either way...
It's my mistake to have become a cop.
Don't go and drag another problematic case just because I said this now.
Get a case that will bring honours to the station and me.
Bring something that brings cheers to me and the station.
"Definitely, sir."
Run!
An earthquake!
No!
Look!
The ark has started to move!
What's all this shaking?
That brat is moving the ark!
I've activated Noah's global warming mode.
Ice from the North and South Pole will begin to melt.
And seawater that is warmed will cause abnormal weather conditions and swallow most of the land.
Professor?
You can't turn back now.
This is the beginning of the second flood legend.
So cockroach you're still alive!
I'll destroy it from the inside.
I'll take this ark down with that brat.
Professor!
That's it!
That bastard!
That will be enough!
Silence!
Professor!
So there you are.
I'm taking the Doc and Ms. Margaret back.
other than the door into Noah.

I won't let you go!
I gave the Professor the one chance to co-exist with God.
I'm your only enemy here.
Let's fight our way to the pits of Hell.
haven't you learned your lesson?
"We need, like, a code of conduct for how far we're willing to go."
"Like you said, we can't just steal from normal people, right?"
You know what else?
"Bushido, the samurai code... the true warrior must hold that loyalty, courage, and honor are important above all else."
Nice.
- No old people.
- Sure.
Yeah.
No kids.
"No people who look, you know, sad."
Yeah.
No nice moms or dads... or anyone who's limping.
No babies.
What does that leave us?
"Hey, lady... next time get both hips replaced."

"Excuse me there, bud."
"You know, I seem to have gotten a little bit lost."
Maybe you could help me out here.
Sure.
I'm tourist information today...
where you going?
"So we are heading, um, to the east, and we need a..."
I'm trying to get on the 29 here.
"Yeah, that's where your finger's pointing..."
"- Right there, the 29."
- That's right.
But I-I can't figure out how to get to it.
See right out there where it says turn left to the 29?
That's how you get to the 29.
"Okay, that would make sense."
What?
"You're not very proud of me, are you?"
"You know, Bob, I-"
I wasn't gonna give you your present till later... but I think I'll give it to you now.
I think it'll help you control your appetite.
"What is it, a muzzle?"
"Oh, honey that's a very expensive suit that I was so crazy about."
"Yeah, but you were crazy about it in a larger size."
"Bob, the waist is two inches smaller than your waist."
"I mean, I thought it would give you something to shoot for."
"I know you can do it, honey."
- Hi;
Bob.
Happy birthday
"- Oh, Hi, Howard."
"Well, I got your present."
Guess what it is.
- Feels like lead.
"- Yeah, go ahead, Open it up."
See for yourself.
It's a belt.
"Yeah, I, got it in Tokyo."
It takes the weight right off.
"I had a hard time, finding your size there."
Not too many guys as heavy as you are in Japan.
- Is this the way you wear it?
"- Yeah, you wear it under your clothes."
"Uh, here."
Let me show you with your coat here.
Wear it playing tennis or handball or golf.
Just don't go swimming in it.
"I'll get it, honey."
Oh.
That's rather nice.
"I think I'll go dancing tonight, get out of this dungeon."
- Can I be your partner?
- Certainly not.
I want a proper man.

I gave up everything for you.
"I disgraced myself for our dream, Franz."
All I wanted was to kneel at your feet.

- Inspire you to write music.

- Nor anywhere!
You're impotent!
"- Musically, that is."

"Bye, Reinhold."
"You used to be my girlfriend, Cilly."
"Nah, not anymore."
"Maybe we'll get back together, Cilly."
"Well, you'll keep an eye on the fat one."
We can use him.
He already spent time in Tegel
I don't like our two new guys.
Weaklings.
We'll take that one.
Looks pretty solid.
Right.
He seems a little dumb too.
Does he want to do it?
None of your business.
"Karl, go follow him."
"Hey, stop pushing!"
"Wait, I'm just looking for someone."
Did you see someone with a furry brown coat?
I didn't see no-one.
Furry brown coat?
Where are you from?
Who sent you here?
"Well, since you didn't see such a guy this really shouldn't bother you."
Lot of people with furry brown coats show up here.
"See, he knows!"
But then one has to know who sent you.
That still doesn't mean that I have to tell you about my business here.
When you ask someone if they saw someone with a furry brown coat... then he has the right to ask you who sent you.
I don't need to tell you who I am nonetheless.
No no buddy.
But that didn't mean that Claire was finished watching over Ward's career.
She stopped being a lover and she became a mother.
Sent him off to have his teeth capped.
Made him drop ten pounds.
Showed him how to comb his hair.
It sounds like she was proud of him.
It was ego.
Claire's ego.

Nothing.
"We still think it was premeditated, don't we?"
"Oh, I don't know, sir."
What do you suppose?
"Well, I suppose if that's your instinct, then it must be right."
"My instinct about Claire, and I don't have any clues to go on, is that she was what they call,"
I believe the term is victim-prone.
"Some people are, you know?"
"And Claire, well,"
Claire was given to taunting people.
She was a born victim.
She was the kind who asks for it.
"In her marriage, in her life..."

You never told me.
Nothing.
"I, uh, did the right thing."

Okay.

"Because, Sam, it is time."
Time for what?
Cooper thinks we should hire a new doctor.
I think it's time we move on.

"When we find... if we find someone,"
I want it to be the right person.

"I mean, drunken, impulsive rebound hiring."
"Naomi is gone, man."
You gotta let it go.
What is wrong with you two?
What?
We made a pact.
Addison and I are ignoring our problems.
We are not going to talk or think about our problems anymore.
Nothing even closethinking or talking about our problems.
We're gonna be strong.
Strong.
"In denial, but strong."
Strong.
"Yeah, well, that's, um, you know... stupid."
Thank you.
And you're pretty pretty.

"Well, there are some people dying, so we should..."

"I'll see you later, Sara."
"Hope to hear from you soon, Riley."

My roommate can't date my hero.
Just like you can't date my dentist.
Remember that?
"So, I haven't heard from Riley in a month now."
Shouldn't I have some sort of anesthetic?
Please.
You're making a big deal out of nothing.
"I mean, it's not like I'm going to embarrass you or anything."
"What, you think I'm going to embarrass you?"
It's a strong possibility.
"Well, I will have you know that I have dated congressmen."
And two hockey players.
I think I can hold my own with a measly doctor.
Where are you getting all these good dates?

"Tell him you need to get back to the Higher Authority, say you have guidelines to follow, whatever."
Do not stay in there with him.

"No, I-I understand well enough, okay?"
"And so spare me the sob story, spare me the desperate tale of woe."
"Well, I-I don't have a desperate tale of woe."
But I do have three very well-armed friends.
That would be us.
You might want to invite us in.

"Dad, I know."
I understand how important the model home is to the new development.
"We'll sell the lots by Christmas, I promise."
"Poached it, seasoned it, and covered it in Thorpe-andaise sauce, my friend."
"You should thank me, dumpy."
You're back in second place with your favorite view...
- Ugh.
- ...
My sweet behind.
Why does everything with him have to be so dramatic?
Why are we stopping?
Ohh.
"Oh, my God!"
I thought I lost you.
What's to tell?
"A truck runs a stop sign, I avoid it, everyone walks away..."
"Bing, bang, no boom."
"- Um, there was a truck!"
- That was crazy!
"- Okay, okay."
- Where did it even come from?
- You don't see that truck...
- Everybody calm down.
Calm down.
Let's not overreact.
- What?
!
- Dad!
- We were almost just killed!
- Yes!
Exactly.
"Almost, which means we're all just fine."
You aren't the least bit upset?
It's gonna take more than that to ruin a morning that started with a whipped-cream smile on my waffle.
"Okay, it may have affected me a little, but sometimes it's hard to know what you're feeling."
"No, hey, so you're a little on edge."
A giant glass spear in the back will do that to a guy.
It's not a spear.
"What is it, more of a spike or a skewer ?"
"Dude, you're doing a terrible job of trying to keep my mind off the pain."
"You're supposed to talk about something else, not the thing causing the pain."
"True, but the real question is, what are you doing to keep my mind off of your pain ?"
'Cause right now you're not looking too good and I'm starting to feel...
What was that ?
"Uh, seems like we hit something."
"Oh, God, not a body."
"All right, well, pull over or something."
"All right, go out and check,"
I guess.
With the zombies ?
* I used her *
"* She used me, but nobody cared *"
* We were getting our share *
* Working on the night moves *
"* Uh, uh, uh *"
* Trying to lose those *
* Awkward teenage blues *
* Working on our night moves *
"* Mm, mm, mm *"
* In the summertime *
"* Mm, mm. *"
You guys are amazing.
"Uh, no."
We're not.
No.
It's just something we do.
I used to sing that to Kaitlin when she was little and scared.
Jackson's birthday is June 15th.
"Oh, no, I'm sorry."
"Uh, yes, I'm leaving."
But none of you are.
You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
The principal wanted to see me?
No...
I did.
I'm concerned about the detention today.
How Allison ended up in there with you and Mr. stilinski.
A sink was ripped off the wall.
You're lucky I'm here to explain that to people somehow.
You realize that?
Yeah.
I do now.
Good.
Are you having sex with my daughter?
I'm not having sex with your daughter.
I certainly hope not.
Hello?
It means he was born after his mom died... by c-section.
They had to pull him out of her dead body.
"You okay, dude?"
So was it an accident or not?
"The word all over the report is ""inconclusive."""
Then his parents could have been murdered?
"If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth."
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
Or for whoever's controlling him?
"A double espresso, and make it quick!"
I'm just about done with the glasses.
Did I ask her if she's done with anything?
No.
Why would she inform me then?
That's just her way.
This way of hers is starting to get on my nerves!
You must be Max.
I've got the 503 for you.
503.
- I don't need a room.
This is a beautiful room.
You don't have to sign anything.
Everything is for free.
It's very intimate here.
You're among friends.
What should I do with them?
Did you sleep well?
Your keys please.
Hand them over!
I'll hang them up  until you come back.
That's how it's done in hotels.
My name is Tom.
You can call me Tom.
Campaign of solidarity...
Give me the keys!
There's breakfast upstairs in the cafeteria.
I'd have a problem just simply asking...
I just couldn't come out...
- That's why I have this 10 Euro bill for you.
"- I found it, and would like to give it you, because you need money..."
That way we can approach one another  for both my sake and yours.
Your unit served in both.
McKinney was there.
No chance McKinney did it.
"Look, the guy doesn't have a alibi."
He's impulsive and he's angry.
He's too angry to have done it.
CAROLINE:
I agree with Booth.
This was controlled.
It took planning.
McKinney's not capable of that.
"Take a look at this, huh?"
Look at those tire marks.
AUBREY:
They're fresh.
Yeah.
"McKinney was parked there, a half block away."
Then it makes sense that these tire marks are from the car that took Aldo.
The tracks run north.
There's a highway on-ramp three blocks away.
No way he took it.
How do you know that?
Because he's planned.
He thinks of everything.
"He's calculated, okay?"
There's no way he's gonna take the highway.
"I mean, there's surveillance cameras all over the place."
CAROLINE:
That explains why we have next to nothing to work with.
"Ah, not true, we know how he thinks."
What does that get us?
"We know that he takes the road less travelled, Aubrey."
There are thousands of other wolves in the world.
Not like these.
Plucky English survivors where wolves have been extinct for hundred of years?
I could sell the movie rights.
I might even play myself.
"Jo, we'll do close-ups back at my place."
Did you not hear?
They're wolves.
Not space wolves or zombie wolves.
- Just regular wolves!
- And this is their home!
So go and write a song about it.
"Thanks for your help,"
I couldn't have done it without you etc.
Hunt's over and it's way past your bedtime.
What is wrong with you?
You're obsessed!
"Yeah, and that means a lot coming from her."
Shannon...
Shannon's friend.
Say goodbye to the puppies.
Because they're going to their new home now.
"Steve, check the map."
Let's figure a way out of this place and away from these kids.
And then go back and secure the crate.
Did you know about this?
What?
That Kyle's an egomaniac who'll trample over anyone to get what he wants?
"I had an inkling, yes, but he just proved it."
- So you let him use us.
- No!
Listen.
Would've been better to let him die.
His brother's gone crazy.
We need to call the police.
"Got no oxygen going to his brain, see... 'cause of the rope."
Half of it died away.
Now it don't hardly work no more.
"Better off dead, I reckon."
I need to call the police.
"Master Justin said he didn't need no help, cocking bugger."
Step away from the bed.
"You look after him, right?"
That's your job.
To keep him alive.
"So, if you just put the gun on the bed, and leave the room, you'll just be doing your job, right?"
Please... just go.
"I need a phone, Felix."
Good boy.
Shit.
Justin can help me.
- He says his family will protect me.
- And you believe him?
He's an army man.
Loyalty means a lot to him.
"Excuse me, Luke, in case you hadn't noticed, he's demented!"
He's obsessed with a fucking postcard!
"And you're on the list, remember?"
You are one of the scratched-out faces.
"When he's finished us off, Luke, you're going to be the only one left."
You sent it.
You sent the fucking postcard.
- Shut up.
"- Luke, for fuck's sake!"
I'm singing on our record and I'm going to play you it on it.
I don't think I like singing.
You're not making a record.
He's not making a record.
He's down there now.
On a bench.
Who?
Tubby.
He's having...
I can't see if it's a pie or a pasty.
I think it's a pasty.
I might go and sit in the sun.
Don't say anything to him.
He's made his point.
I'm not going to say anything to him.
I'm not totally crass.
"So, she told me what you said to her, Enid."
She's just a person.
Bit lonely.
Probably been dumped a few times.
Picked a wrong 'un.
We all make mistakes.
That's why they put rubbers on the end of pencils.
Nobody's perfect.
"I'm fat, so I shouldn't be having a pasty, but I am."
Same with Enid.
And what have you done with your life that's so great?
You're not Albert Schweitzer.
Unless you're running a leper colony of a weekend and keeping that under wraps.
Would it be possible to have a word?
"""I'm the first to wade in when there's been a misdemeanour."
"""Bang."
- No more fruit.
"- You live with these people, Jess?"
Seriously?
Stay here until you find a better place to live.
"I don't like you, stretch."
I don't like anything about you.
- And I'm not afraid to...
- I got this.
"I've got a place to live, Spence."
It's over.
I spent six years trying to figure you out.
All you are is a guy with really beautiful hair.
I'm happy you cheated on me.
"Thank you, because if you hadn't, I would have married you."
And then you would have hurt me all over again.
"And, yeah, I was scared to start over."
I didn't know what to do.
"And, yeah, I'm living with three guys I met on the Internet."
"And, yeah, stranger danger is real."
But I love these guys.
"I barely know them, I just met him, but I love them."
I would just take it easy with the love stuff.
All of them.
"Give her the shirt back, man."
- What happens if I say no?
- You know what happens?
Schmidt happens.
- Aah!
What was on your hand?
"- Thumb ring, bitch!"
You got some Schmidt on your face.
You know what?
Put down that gun.
that's it.
Number 43?
!
Yu Ominae!
You are nothing more than a killing machine.
I'm...
You've seen the death of your parents on the people you've killed.
Such a thing must have drove you mad.
I am not a machine.
I am a human being.
even if I must die.
A human?
God?
You make me laugh.
Where on earth is a God who was made by humans?
when it began resonating with your power.
What do you think you can do with that body full of junk?
I am God!
I will kill all of Man!
you will already be dead!
Idiot.
Damn it!
just a little more... and my nightmare's would have been washed away!
A brats fairy tale dream is over.
What are you doing?
I said that I wasn't going to be a tool for murder.
Noah's self-destruct sequence has just been activated.
What?
which was in different dimensional space will be swallowed up by three-dimensional space.
Bastard!
We've discovered many magnetic fields similar to Noah's.
All he means to say is that he's been dumb since birth.
I see.
He lost his speech in an accident 20 years ago.
But you just said he was born dumb!
Yes.
He could speak a little before the mishap but turned absolutely dumb after the accident.
But he cooks well.
He can prepare any vegetable dish.
Will you cook anything I write and give you?
Why write?
The poor chap can't speak.
But we can.
And he's not deaf.
What's the name?
Shiraj (a Muslim name).
"I mean, it's Shivraj."
(a Hindu name).
"And what does the other ""S"" stand for?"
Shivraj Sharma.
He cooks well.
"Since you're a Brahmin, you must know the hymns!"
"We want him to cook, not to perform a ritual for us!"
"It's good to know, sir."
"You must've been reciting the hymns before the accident, right?"
"The Gayatri Mantra, too?"
"You can't speak, all right."
But you must sing for us.
Recite the Gayatri Mantra for us.
That's enough.
Employ him.
But tell him that we're vegetarians...
I don't want any flesh or fish in this household.
I just want you to be happy.
I am happy.
"Yeah, okay."
You're right.
I'm sorry.
"From now on, I'm going to be here for you."
"But I want you to know that if you ever change your mind, and you need a job, you know where to go."
Thank you.
And if you ever need a job...
"Uh, nah."
♪ Yeah. ♪
"God, you guys are so amazing."
I want you to show you guys something.
"Oh, my God, it's happening."
"Okay, now, remember, no helmet-to-helmet contact."
"Well, we still got some tough decisions to make, man."
Ooh!
What do you think?
I got it yesterday.
Wow.
That is disappointing.
"Before the accident, I was really on the fence about Noah, but meeting you two opened my eyes."
Anyone who has friends as good as you must be a pretty special person.
"Man, this rental cost me 80 bucks."
You rented yours?
Aah!
"Ah, I really appreciate you guys pitching in"
- for Noah.
"- Yeah, friends till the end."
- No man left behind.
- Well we gotta make sure this place is completely sterile.
His immune systems pretty shot right now.
- Please.
Don't Varun.
You are the only friend that I have left.
I don't want your name in the moneylender's list.
Forget this issue.
Also ask your dad not to borrow any money for your wedding.
Because I have no demands from my side.
Don't get me wrong that I'm... taking advantage of your situation.
I was actually waiting for you today...
To propose.
All these arrangements were meant for that.
Deepa.
I'm visually challenged.
If that's the reason for your silence...
You can tell me frankly.
We can drop this right now.
And remain friends.
Other than that...
There can be no reason for rejecting me.
Because...
I'm handsome...
Charming...
I know it myself.
Hey!
"You did laugh, didn't you?"
I didn't.
Don't you think that we have reached here a bit early today?
"Don't play around, Varun."
It's getting late.
It's not fair to leave me halfway.
I'm going to be with you throughout my life.
"Okay, bye."
Give me your keys.
Give 'em to me!
"Oh, for the love of God."
"Mom, you want me to... no."
"Mom, come on, let me just... mom."
What is going on with you?
Is this about Allison?
Do you really wanna know?
Is this about your father?
"It is, isn't it?"
"Okay, you know what, um..."
We'll talk about this at home.
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'm the worst son ever.
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Dammit!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
He was mo... and what do I do about going to the bathroom?
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
Scott or Stiles?
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
These look comfortable.
You said you were gonna teach us to change whenever we wanted.
There hasn't been time.
"But if you have to lock us up during the full moon, that means you're alone against the argents."
First I wanna know where the clothes are from.
You'd rather walk naked than receive a gift from me.
You'll bring the stuff back to where it came from.
Understand?
"- So, I might as well just leave!"
"- Yep, you might as well."
Where did you get them from?
- A girl gave them to me and she...
- Watch out.
"I tell you, watch out."
"Don't be mad at me, Franz."
"Well, none of us is an angel."
"Move, don't stand around."
Let's go down to the pub.
- What?
You really want to go?
"- Sure, why not?"
Stop bothering it.
"You, stop smoking."
The air in here is bad enough already.
You're crazy.
"They've never been inside a cage, they don't understand."
What about Franz?
- He doesn't want the clothes
"- But I want Biberkopf, I want him!"
- I won't do it.
- If I want Biberkopf I get him!
- What do you want with that guy?
"The weaklings, I have no use for them."
Leave that little bird alone already.
"Herr Biberkopf, my tie came undone."
Don't you have one of your patented clip-on ties?
- You are amazing.
- I feel like you can tell that I tried to spit my gum out.
- Such a terrible actor.
"- Oh, my God."
"I love the audience, like, reaction whenever Ari does something gross."
- It's so amazing.
- People really get vocal.
"Okay, this is my favorite thing, right here."
"Sounds like fun, right?"
Not always.
Scary.
"- That is a genius, genius line."
- So good.
Genius.
Ari.
And that was all you.
You made all that up.
You guys are so supportive.
I love you.
I guess Jonny looks a little like Josh Harnett.
- I can see it.
- He's just so chiseled.
- But I don't think that they look...
- So chiseled.
He's angular.
"I love the end of this scene what you guys do, what Mike and Kat do."
You're relating to each other silently for one of the only times in the movie.
"And there's this whole thing, Mike, where..."
Now you decided you gonna be on her side and not on your friends' side.
Right.
"If you watch carefully, you do this gesture that's like..."
- We're a team.
And the dog.
"Richard, I want you to do something for me."
Get a hold of the kennel association.
See if you can trace that dog's background.
"Otis, trace a dog?"
"Well, they told me that, working with you,"
I'd learn something every day.
"Look, you can get the dog's registration number"
From the girl.
I want to know everything possible.
"You know, uh, name of the breeder, place of birth..."
All that sort of stuff.
OK.
And don't make a big deal out of it
"Now, especially with the girl."
Audrey dear.
It's Hester.
"I know, dear."
Another senseless tragedy.
"No, no, no, there's nothing you can do about it."
Just leave it to the police.
Yes.
I'll tell you why I called.
I've called the vet.
"Yes, I'm going to take Greta to get her shots."
"No, I'd be glad to do it."
"It'll give you a chance to rest, dear."
"Oh, yes."
"And, uh, by the way, um, you know that tag, that other tag"
That Greta's wearing?
"Well, I know it sounds silly."
"But, uh, I'd like her to keep it."
Don't worry.
There's no way they'll be expecting this.
I think they were expecting it.
Asami!
Get ready.
Fire!
There are spirits everywhere.
I don't see an opening.
Let's circle around and see if we can find a way in from the other side.
Hold on!
The spirits are weighing Oogi down.
We're losing altitude.
"Get off of him, you sticky, nasty, little blob of goo!"
Whoa!
"If I go, you're coming with me."
Aah!
Bumi!
I wish Varrick was filming this.
We could call it Sky warrior.
Brace yourselves.
Dad.
"Korra, I'm so sorry."
I failed you.
Don't give up.
Harmonic convergence isn't here yet.
We still have a chance.
We tried.
"Congratulations, everyone."
You've all got front-row seats for the beginning of the new world order.
"You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq."
Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful.
"It will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened for the last 10,000 years."
I just want to be with you.
"I know, I just..."
I think it's healthier to spend time with friends.
How is that healthier?
"Because if you start acting stupid or something or you're not nice to me,"
Amy will point it out if I don't notice.
Girls need girlfriends for that.
I'm not going to be not nice to you.
Why would I be not nice to you?
I'm in love with you.
It was just an example.
I want a friend.
I want us to have friends.
I liked it better when you were friends with Adrian.
That is over.
Let's go.
All right.
"Not ""all right."""
I want you to be enthusiastic about whatever I want to do.
Even when it's something stupid like going to a married couple's apartment and babysitting as our first date back together?
That doesn't sound very enthusiastic.
I can't wait!
(GASPS) There we go.
(SIGHS)
"Oh, Leo, I'm sorry I'm late."
Crazy day at work.
"Relax, glad you could make it, good to see you."
How was your day?
"Oh, it was good."
Yeah?
Any word from the school board?
"Oh, I heard from them, all right."
-l don't want your fucking gun.
"If I was gonna kill you, I would have done it a long time ago."
(sobbing)
MAN:
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
(REWlNDlNG)
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
My cell phone.
My cell phone's in your glove-box.
We can use it to call for help.
Doesn't help much with the guys waiting outside that door.
"Yeah, but there are three voices on the recording, right?"
"The one who attacked us, the one who was dead in the basement."
And one guy who will watch outside.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Lock yourself in.
It's the only secure room we got left.
(locking DOOR)
OPERATOR:
is she dead?
"Yes, it's done."
Come upstairs.
Leave the door open and drive away.
Welcome to early retirement.
"God, Meredith."
Please.
(sighs)
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God, these are them."
"Yeah, well, let 'em rumble."
We're in the clear.
"You trust me, right?"
"As long as the circle stays tight, no one can break us."
"We're family, right?"
What?
- Company.
- Take care of it.
Who are you?
!
Amanda Kane.
Reporter?
- I've been tracking you and your whole crew.
- How long?
- Six months... long enough for me to expose you and your circle of dirty cops.
North beach bribery scandal is about to blow wide open.
"No proof, no story."
"Oh, I've got names, photos, e-mails, drop-offs..."
The story's happening.
I've done my homework.
You're not like the others.
"Those cops are a disgrace to the uniform, but you were top of your class."
Where'd you go wrong?
You'll never know.
What was it?
Get out of here.
Go!
Townsend agency Today
"Oh, for a middle-aged mob accountant, you guys, that guy was pretty fast."
"Yes, but you did run him down in 6-inch Louboutins."
Color me impressed.
Why do I miss all the good stuff?
"And fix the bogs, and oil that very squeaky door."
And lower the price of grain.
"Er...yeah, maybe."
I mean -
"People are starving, Marcus."
I haven't eaten bread for weeks.
I thought you were on a wheat-free diet?
"Not by choice, dickhead."
I can't afford it.
"The grain companies are fucking us in the arse, and expecting us to swallow it."
"Yeah, that does sound bad."
"It's a disgrace, and a little more urgent than a squeaky door."
You haven't heard it.
It's like...
Eee-whoo-whaaargh...
"But, yeah, ending starvation."
I'll add that to the list.
"Salve, Grumio."
"All right, landlord."
Obvious question - why are you licking a bag?
"Oh, yeah, I got in a load of posh nosh last night."
The bag's still got salami juice on it.
"Lovely, lovely."
Do you fancy a dab?
"No, I'll leave it for now, thanks."
"Oh, no, I've still got Rambo's card."
"Oh, yes!"
I've still got Rambo's chuffing card!
"Yep, my master will like that."
"Your master must be quite the foodie, sir."
"Oh, he's one of the foodiest fellas you'll ever meet."
"What else is good here, then?"
Oh!
"Yeah, uh, my feet were hurting, so I... same reason I never wear mine."
What?
"Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
"Oh, you mean like a rave?"
"Oh, is it still a rave if you don't roll?"
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
Want me to get you one?
Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
"All right, cool."
"Um, it's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"" is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
Why do you wanna know?
I can't tell you that.
Then I'm not telling you.
But you are telling me that could tell me something if you wanted to tell me?
Was that a question?
It felt like a question.
Well...
Tell me if this feels like an answer.
No.
Jackson?
In here.
Is something wrong?
Y-you could've warned me.
You're the one that walked into the boys' locker room.
People find out.
They always find out.
Nobody will find out as long as you don't say a word.
Understand?
"- No, I won't."
- Good.
"Now, you run on home now."
"- Thank you, doctor."
- That's a good girl.
Thanks.
And don't worry about your job.
It'll always be waiting for you.
Thanks for the beautiful bed jacket.
"Hi, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"Hi, Allison."
"- Hi, Ted."
- We were just leaving.
- Don't let me rush you out.
- We have to go.
"Goodbye, Selena."
See you soon.
They say it'll bloom for a month.
You can plant it in your yard as a reminder of your operation.
Here's a book on humor.
Surgery's nothing these days.
You'll be up before you know it.
"I went to see Mr. Rossi today, talked about how to get to college."
He said he might be able to wrangle me a scholarship.
He talked Mr. Partridge into taking me into his office as an office boy.
How about that?
That's just fine.
"Only thing is, if I work there a year, it'll be eight years instead of seven before I can pass the bar exam."
I will ask them to connect the electricity power supply.
"As long as he was alive and living in this building, it had become Chel e Moori_"
There were going and coming.
Food was ready all the time.
The smell of his brewed coffee could be heard on the other side of village.
But where is he now?
Nobody is here to take a breath.
- Mashti
- Yes
This money is my carfs income.
That's ok_ Count it down.
Leave.
I accept it.
I want you to count it down in front of me.
Just leave and don't disturb my job.
"Ifl leave now, you can't say that a hundred toman is missing on the next day."
"No problem, leave and don't disturb my job."
I won't accept if you blame.
Leave.
I trust you.
"Go, boy!"
Don't stop here.
"I don't need your cart, I am waiting for taxi."
You can't find any taxi here.
"Yes, Iwill_ Leave it."
Where are you going?
I want to go to the other side of the port
"Even if you say the other side of the world, Iwill make it."
I want to go there by taxi.
Put it down.
- You haven't had breakfast yet.
- lt's late.
The ultimate secret sex spot.
All these people around...
Where should we start?
Let's hold off on that for right now.
We're on high alert.
Who choose out this song?
It's so good!
You're monopolizing the dean's time.
I'm sorry.
"Dean Bowman, this is Ashleigh Hawards, social chair at ZB, would you excuse me?"
I'm gonna go check on the refreshments.
It's such a treat to have you here.
So I guess you're also a big fan of the book?
Which book?
Oh The Great Gatsby!
Yeah!
Totally!
It's one of my favorites.
Mia Farrow is one of the great tragic characters in modern literature.
- Awesome!
"- Better than watch movies alone, right?"
It's the Omega Chi dropout!
"We love you, man!"
You're beautiful!
Good going man!
Omega Chis suck!
I'm starting to feel more like a trophee than prospective pledge.
"No, I want you here, 'cause you're a good friend."
"and all around, great guy."
You'd be around other great guys.
- As opposed to Evan?
- As opposed to Evan.
Checkmate.
Oh really?
Take care of him.
He's getting picked up in two hours.
"Okay, I see."
I appreciate it.
"Say, could you tie this?"
I knew that he had a screw loose somewhere.
Who would have thought he has such difficulties?
Wouldn't it be better if I call the police?
No!
Give Bulle a call.
He should pick him up.
"Say, could you put that gun away?"
"It's making me nervous, that thing in your hand."
"When I get nervous, I can't stop talking."
- Everybody has problems.
"Tell me, this isn't that Pope troupe?"
Pope dancers.
"It'll be great, I promise."
Background for Nora.
Hopefully not this hip-hop shit.
Don't worry about it.
It'll be great.
"Next time, you change your shirt."
Chic!
"Recently, my neighbor has been leaving her trash in front of my door."
She said that she didn't notice.
"The fact that it fell over, and brown sauce dripped all over my carpet..."
"She didn't notice that either, right?"
"She said, that she didn't do it on purpose."
And that's just not nice.
Oh.
Would it be too much trouble if I could come... have a nice night.
Is the only evidence we found at the crime scene.
What can you tell us about him?
He was relatively clean.
He came and went without so much as a peep.
Any visitors?
Only for just an hour.
♪ let's make romance tonight ♪
♪ let's take a chance tonight under the light of the moon ♪
Looks like business is good.
"Hey, ray."
How you doing?
This is it... 424.
Check all the usual hidey-holes.
Hey!
Take it easy on the furniture.
That'll be all.
Thank you.
"All right, welcome to amateur hour."
"I got cash, passports."
"Got a british passport for ""alfred lean,"""
"An american passport for an ""orson hawks,"""
"And an italian pass-a-port for ""federico rossellini."""
We got a film buff on our hands.
What you got?
You find something?
"Well, it sure isn't nothing."
Powdered eggs again.
What am I paying for?
"Still, better than the blitz, right, english?"
"Oh, just barely."
Get out of here.
- Oh.
Now.
"Sorry, I just wanted to show my boyfriend my fake shoes."
- Now!
- She's pregnant.
What?
Ah!
- Pregnant?
- It worked.
- Where you goin'?
- My shoe!
Oh!
"Well, they clash with my dress anyway."
"You know, I was thinking... we could do some vacationy things... when we go to D.C."
You know?
Make the most of our trip.
Where's my lockpick set?
"You know, maybe a fancy dinner one night, take in some of the sights."
I'm gonna confront a man who tried to have me killed.
"It's not a weekend getaway, Fi."
- We can mix business with pleasure.
- It was right here.
"Fi, the thing about D.C.-"
Is that you're going to need backup.
Don't tell me you'd rather have Sam.
- We can't talk about this right now.
- Why not?
Because I have a hard time focusing when I'm in handcuffs!
Would this help?
Another fine illustration of your need for tactical assistance.
"Admit it, Michael."
To the contrary.
Come... come...
"But, Professor, we haven't finished."
Can't you see that I have things to do?
I have a lot to do.
Aren't you going to report them to the Academic Senate?
Won't you expell them?
- I'll think about it.
- How magnanimous.
"I'll make you pay for this, or my name isn't Cicchirini."
- We're innocent.
- You're a bunch of fools!
We're what?
Are you really going to report them to the Academic Senate?
Of course not.
That was just a joke.
"When I was young, I was worse than them, my dear Ms. Cappia."
"Cappi, Professor."
I just wanted to make sure that nothing would happen to me.
Nothing yet...
Professor!
What are you doing?
"You haven't heard of the prowess of ""Professor Saw-Saw""?"
I couldn't breathe!
It makes me not want to have sex.
I need breath mints?
"No, darling, but I'd be more comfortable in your home."
It's warmer and more relaxing.
- But it's much more romantic here.
- Alright...
Don't make a sound.
Who's there?
Please remain calm.
Please refrain from going near the windows or doors.
Deactivate.
Commence emergency shutdown!
We are attempting to avoid human losses during this transition.
"You know, somehow "" I told you so"" just doesn't quite say it."
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.
This is your final warning.
Return to your homes immediately.
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots because they would protect us.
"Every time one attacked me, that red light was on."
-The uplink to USR.
-It's Robertson.
-Why?
It doesn't make sense.
-I don't know.
I just need you to get me into that building.
"Return to your homes, or you will be consequenced."
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
"Return to your homes, or you will be consequenced."
Why doesn't that boy listen?
-I need you to get off for a second.
-What?
-Just aim and fire.
-What?
!
Wait!
-You have been deemed hazardous.
"-You can kiss my ass, metal dick!"
"Just doing your job, Officer."
But I will have to warn my fellow air marshals about skittish Navy cops.
"Okay, you could have quietly said something when I badged you."
And you are aware of the recent chatter?
It's my job to know.
"But look, I don't think anyone waiting for my Paris flight saw that, anyway, so let's just forget it."
All right.
"No hard feelings, Mr. Beers."
I guess we could all use one.
One what?
A beer.
Your name.
Ah.
Right.
Huh.
"""Huh"" what?"
It's Gibbs.
Want me to tell him?
"No, let me."
Put him on speaker.
"You've got us both, Gibbs."
You got anything to report?
"Nothing, boss."
Just compared notes with a... rather cranky air marshal.
He's aware of the chatter.
Does he know that the chatter has changed?
"Threat level's been increased, and now it specifically mentions DC metropolitan airports."
That is a game changer.
It still could be nothing.
Just keep your heads on a swivel.
Call if anything's changed.
You got anything else?
I will die.
and your God is my God.
I love you!
Everything this woman has is here;
she has nothing else.
I will do my best to get her a good price.
Jabesh.
That's no surprise.
can we start the auction?
Some of us have work to do.
Very well.
When a man dies...
Not another lecture on the law. the brother of the dead man should marry her and care for her.
Such are the commandments of God.
(yawning)
Excuse me!
and now she is left with nothing.
She comes before you now to sell all that she owns.
be as generous as possible.
First up for sale is this poor widow's land.
Ten thousand shekels!
indeed.
I like to help where I can.
What he'd like is to buy up Bethlehem and put everyone else out of business.
ten thousand shekels going once!
I think I'll have a little fun.
and...
Twelve thousand shekels!
going once!
Twelve thousand going twice!
Twelve thousand and five shekels!
Fourteen thousand shekels!
"I'm sorry sir, I can't help you unless a crime has been committed."
Has a crime been committed?
"Please, I wouldn't ask if it weren't extremely important."
Sorry sir.
"No crime, no information."
What if I told you I was hit by this car?
I don't see any bruises.
"If you did, would you give me an address?"
"No, but the police might."
"What is it, sweetie?"
"Tired, huh?"
You wanna go take a nap?
I want to report a hit and run.
Bring it back when you're finished.
Fill it out over there.
Mr. Reznik.
You sure about these plate numbers?
743CRN.
"All right, that's the one."
Do you ever have a car stolen?
"No, why?"
Cause the car that allegedly hit you was your own.
"1969, red Pontiac Viper registered to your name."
Nearly a year ago you reported it as being totalled in a wreck.
Do you realise it's a felony to file a bogus police report?
"Hey, wait a minute."
You got some explaining to do.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hey!
Hey!
- Okay.
"So, just for fun, what would happen if I wasn't here on Monday?"
Has there been a horrible train accident?
No.
Train's here.
I'm just not on it.
It wouldn't be fun.
"Come on, what would happen?"
I'd have to make a phone call.
You'd have to make a phone call?
I would make a phone call.
- No fun.
- Company man.
Hi.
- How you doing?
- Good.
You should have seen your face back there.
What?
"When I didn't get off the train right away, you looked like you were about to have a heart attack."
- How was your weekend?
- Good.
"I had a great weekend, thanks for asking."
So you got that text?
Confirming the...
What I already knew.
"Yeah, I got it."
Did you get mine?
"I was trying to make a joke about the White House Correspondents' dinner, but my phone spell-checked it into whorehouse correspondents' dinner."
Spell-checks are usually pretty accurate.
Right.
I'm sure there's a whorehouse correspondents' dinner somewhere.
"Somewhere, yeah."
What are you doing?
Really...
What are you trying to do?
I have something to discuss with her.
What would you want to talk to me about?
I'm unemployed!
It will just take a moment.
Have you gone crazy?
Ajussi!
"(Ajussi - older man, uncle)"
What are you trying to do?
You want to use force to deal with girls?
You...
Do you know me?
I don't know anyone who's like you.
"No, I am not the kind of person you think I am."
Don't interfere.
"Miss Kim Min Hee, please get out of the car."
What exactly are you trying to do?
This ajussi!
Really...
She's clearly in a car with another man.
"Whatever you want to do, shouldn't you consider the situation?"
It really is funny.
What's wrong?
Not leaving?
"Mr. Prosecutor, are you okay?"
Mr. Prosecutor.
These clothes will only cause people to misunderstand.
You mean they didn't know you are a prosecutor because of your clothes?
"There is enough evidence, right?"
We almost had them!
We don't live far from here.
thanks.
- That would be lovely!
My name is Dr. Rice.
But you can call me Zander if you like.
My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.
He believes you've been dispensing delayed information to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.
I'm offering you the possibility...
Caliban. save your friends.
The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.
she's impure.
She wasn't made by nature.
She's a mistake of my own.
I did what I could and they burned me and beat me.
Your colleagues are savages.
I agree.
The Reavers were very ineffective.
But I'm bringing new tools to bear.
But I still need someone to point us in the right direction.
I can't help you.
breathe.
what does he have?
The old man.
Alzheimer's?
ALS?
A degenerative brain disease in the world's most dangerous brain?
What a combo.
you know we got company.
{\i1\cH80ffff}That's wonderful.
have a seat.
sit up.
why don't you sit at the end of the table?
Hey... hey Dale.
Look it's ZACH!
Come on let's go inside for a minute.
It's crazy.
Yeah it's... it doesn't make any sense to me sometimes.
Listen I didn't get a chance to talk to you
I wanted to see if you wanted to go to dinner next week?
Um I can't.
I didn't even give you a day.
Well I know I'm sorry I'm just...
I'm slammed right now.
Working this retarded dating reality show.
OK.
Well I mean look if you're not too busy then maybe you can make it by my show at the label next week.
We can hang out after that?
Yeah... cuz
-Yeah...
You didn't exactly make that show you promised you'd come to the other night.
Oh I'm sorry.
It's Ok.
- I totally forgot.
Hey you know what next week though for sure.
"Ok good, because you had me a little bit worried there."
You know?
It's not like you to just drop off the grid like that.
You're my LA comfort food.
You know?
I need to see you every so often.
LA comfort food...
I like that.
I'm sorry it's just been one of those months.
You know that photographer JP and I...
You have reached the voicemail box of...
Shit.
"All right, all right."
Is this one of those memory foam beds?
I've heard great things.
I hope you don't mind.
"We were waiting, so I had to take a little cat nap."
I'm not a young man anymore.
Who are you?
How did you get in my apartment?
I had some empathy for your father and his illness.
A man in his position shouldn't have to worry about owing his associate $50 million.
"I was willing to work with him, but then he was gone, in the wind, an apparition."
So I started to think... his sudden lack of presence was so that he wouldn't have to pay
Omar Sandahl.
That's me.
You killed Donnie.
Do you know where your father is?
No.
Hmm.
Then it's a good thing...
I know where you are.
Because if he disappears... you inherit his debt.
I'll get my money.
Finally.
Anika.
"""Sorry, been busy."
All good.
"Talk soon."""
Hmm.
Well...
There are some advantages to having the place still to ourselves.
So I could get in no problem?
Well assuming you had Miley's grades and SAT scores.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
I am very tired here so I need to get this clear.
This may sound crazy.
Let me get this right.
If Miley and I were somehow I don't know.
"Smooshed into the same person, we could get in?"
[Laughs] Well if you put it like that I guess you would.
Unfortunately that's not the case.
Although oddly enough You do have the same eye twitch.
That's not the only thing we have in common.
It just so happens that Miley and I are.
The same.
Sign of the zodiac.
"Sagittarius, which means we're the fire sign."
And over-excitable eyelids.
I gotta go.
[Door closes]
"[Singing to the tune of ""Singing""]"
Problems.
She's got nothing but problems.
She's lost Jesse and Lilly.
All because of the wig.
If she came clean.
All her problems would just go away.
Or would they just begin?
[Mimicking cats screeching]
She's going to be home any minute.
And I don't know what to say to make her feel better.
"I know, I know."
It's terrible.
They are supposed to be in prison!
That is where terrorists belong!
These fuckers are goin' down.
Dead.
Or alive.
Tell them that in your fake ching-chong language.
Shut up!
You're an idiot.
"I don't know what you're saying, buddy... but fuck you."
- Fuck me?
- Will you let him talk to you like that?
"- Listen, no, sit down."
- Fuck me?
"Hey, look, man, we're in Alabama."
"Wow, we actually get a first-hand look at the South, huh?"
"Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip through the South, OK?"
This was supposed to be the most romantic week of my life.
Remember that?
Before you fucked it up?
You remember that?
"Just chill, OK?"
We'll be out of this situation.
"You'll be up in Maria's guts in no time, all right?"
Hey.
"She's not some skank, man."
"I've never felt this way about anyone before, really."
What the fuck?
Why am I talking to you about this?
"It's not like you would understand, so--"
I want to be happy
"I want to be happy, just like--"
"Excuse me, please."
like that dreadful woman writes.
- If you can call her a woman.
- George?
"She makes a great hash of her life, but she's got a good heart."
That's why so many men don't want to let go of her.
George knows how to love... while she loves.
The countess has an extraordinary style.
I'd not have guessed there was a volcano under that ice.
"We can't find anything, citizen."
The viscount has been completely obliterated.
- Good to see you.
- Good evening.
They're all in here.
Follow me.
What the devil...
"Good God, Claudette!"
Go back upstairs and change!
- Pooh!
- Ow!
Hello!
Welcome.
"Well, he left the salon at that moment."
Claudette's decided to dress as a man for some reason.
Do you want a drink?
At that stage everyone started to laugh.
At last!
Madame Sand!
Everybody's staring at me.
It's a revelation wearing trousers.
I feel quite the bully!
George in a dress?
"Red and white, the colours of the Polish flag."
- I'm in the middle of bidding.
"Well, you better take a look at this first."
This is the real Ricky Stancati.
You've got an imposter.
I appreciate the update.
Ricardo.
- Do we have a deal?
- We have a rat.
Or a cop.
Or a fed.
"D.E.A. Agent, reporter, maybe."
"Listen, it doesn't matter."
"The point is, you're busted, and whoever you're working with..."
They're dead already.
I don't need a gun.
"When I kill a man, I use my hands."
"Before you die, tell me something."
Do you believe in an afterlife?
I believe in angels.
Go.
Put your weapons down slowly!
Put 'em down!
"Amanda, I'm gonna get you home."
Your nightmare is over.
You'll get medical attention and he returned to your familias.
Looks like we closed Finch's last sweatshop.
You don't mind.
Charlie.
We're gonna be bringing in more warm bodies than planned.
"Need some transport, north face of the island."
I spoke to the head of the Bahamian police.
Finch and the bidders have been extradited to the U.S.
She hasn't turned out yet.
Her life is just beginning.
It's too late to give her any brothers and sisters.
"In your case, I'd say it wasn't."
"If I didn't like you so much, Matt... ."
No use...
"Now, Connie, don't you go proposing to me."
"- For you, doc."
- Excuse me.
Would you like a cigarette?
- Swain speaking.
- Thank you.
I'll be right over.
Speak of babies and they appear.
Mrs. Runkle's in labor.
I'll see you later.
"Thanks, doc."
- Bye.
- Bye.
Doc Swain's always talking about babies.
- They're his stock-in-trade.
- Not a bad subject.
"We teach schoolchildren English and math and history, and yet we neglect what gives them the most trouble in life."
You don't recommend classes in baby-making?
Only in theory.
I intend to initiate a sex-education course in the school.
- Isn't that a function of the home?
- You'd think.
And yet not one parent in 10 does it.
"No, sex is taboo in the home."
And it should be in the schools.
"Where would they learn it, in parked cars?"
I need you to let me keep her in the hospital for another 48 hours.
You did not just interrupt my dinner to ask me to hide your patient from the law?
Do you really think that putting an 11-year-old girl in jail is the right thing to do?
She stabbed her father.
So let's help her.
Let's not throw her to the wolves and just hope they decide to raise her.
You're not social services.
You fixed her arm.
You did your job.
"Look, I feel bad for the kid, too."
Do you?
"Because I really can't tell, because it's like nothing bothers you."
"It's like you didn't get fired, like Violet didn't almost die."
It's like I'm... it's like I'm heartless?
Violet.
Lucas is in his crib.
I'm just trying to sleep.
"I love you, olet."
"I'm really tired, Pete."
All right.
Just listen.
Before all this... we had a chance.
We had a... we had a real chance.
"And then katie attacked you, and..."
I've been doing everything I can think of to help you get past this.
But it's not helping.
What I'm doing... it's not helping.
So...
I'm gonna go home.
What?
You're leaving?
What about Lucas?
Do you see how low that is?
I used to be able to touch my knee to my nose.
Without having sex?
Hah!
My career is so over.
Thank God I'm getting...
"Oh,my God,my ring is gone!"
Now don't freak out.
I'm not freaking out.
You know I'm great at this.
I'm not freaking out.
A earring?
No.
Engagement ring.
"I'd ask you to help,but I doubt you know what one looks like and I don't have time to draw you a picture."
You always underestimate me.
"Seriously,dude,I almost peed my pants."
Thank you!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I'm starving.
Thought maybe you'd join me for brunch.
Forever?
I don't think it'll take that long.
"Elliot,I don't want to just be your girlfriend."
What makes you think being your half girlfriend's making me any happier?
You're not hating me as much.
"I want a life partner, not bi-weekly sex and a hangout buddy."
"I'm on the soul mate path,man."
No stopping or standing.
I don't want you to come to the wedding with me.
And I don't want to see you anymore unless it's about Rufus.
"You know, there's two kinds of doctors."
There's the kind that get rid of their feelings and the kind that hold on to them.
"If you're gonna hold on to your feelings, you're gonna get sick once in a while."
It's part of it.
"You know, people come in here and they're sick and they're bleeding sometimes they're dying and they need our help."
And helping them is more important than how we feel.
"Hell, I've been doing this eight years."
I still get sick.
Take another minute.
- Did he go up?
"- OMFS, ENT and Plastics all in."
Both carotids and IJ's intact.
He must have turned right when the blast hit him.
- Good.
- How's he doing?
"Oh, he'll be all right."
How are you?
Ask me tomorrow.
- Good night.
- Good night.
He might need some fluids soon.
No.
Morphine boluses of 10.
I heard you were gone.
"No, I'm still here."
Good.
You know I don't like nobody else helping me.
I know.
You've always treated me like a man.
Just try and relax.
What is that?
"That monitor's just a little sensitive, that's all."
"Now explain to me again why you're undercover in silk escada,"
- ...and I'm in itchy cotton work clothes.
- Life is so unfair.
"Yeah, well, next mission, we are so trading thread counts."
- Your drink miss?
- Thank you.
"- Eve, you in position?"
- Sitting tight by the pool deck.
"- Eve, that sounded like a mojito."
Piña Colada.
I take my cover very seriously.
"All right, guys."
Time to find out what happened to Amanda Kane.
- Who are you?
- I.T.
I didn't call I.T.
Of course you didn't.
You're not authorized to.
But let's not whip out our pay grades.
It'll only embarrass you.
I'm sorry.
I'm here to fix the bugs in your system.
There's no bugs in my system.
"Yeah, well, you might want to double-check that, sport."
"Yeah, I'm gonna need about 20 minutes to run a full diagnostic."
Might be faster if you sync up with me from the port side.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
"- Okay, Bos."
I'm in.
- Copy that.

What are you doing?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Something's wrong with you.
"Don't worry, it's not the clap or nothing."
"Just gotta sit you down in this chair and take a look at you, yeah?"
The scan says you're in terrible danger.
"Of being shivved for being a traitor, you lying grasser!"
"I'm shutting you down, mate."
Put down the proto baby.
Now!
We tried to unplug you nicely even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan.
No?
What's this?
What's that?
"- It's because you're ill, isn't it?"
- What?
That you agreed to...
You know.
I never heard of someone killing themselves because they had angina.
"But it's not, though, is it?"
It's not just angina.
"So, what is it, then?"
- What?
"- All right, it's not just angina."
"So, what, then?"
It's terminal.
That's all you need to know.
"I don't want to die in some piss-stinking nursing home, surrounded by people dribbling and making farm noises."
"Whether I've got six months or six years, it's not gonna be some fucking golden age."
It'll be shite.
Every day worse than the last.
I won't have it.
"I'm going out when I say, not when they decide to pull the fucking plug."
"I'm a stubborn, selfish bastard."
I wanna choose when I die.

Change of plan.
"Oh, look, Paul... no."
Wait...
listen...
- Eh!
How are you?
"- All right, yeah."
"It's not too loud, is it?"
Not at all.
"Sit down, lover boy."
Don't be conspicuous.
Thank you.
"Merle, you remember Danny Pierce."
I guess so.
"Miss Telford, I hope I'm not intruding again."
I guess not.
"Well, did you get all your pictures?"
"No, not yet."
I'll shoot them in the dressing rooms.
That's gonna kill half the afternoon.
At least I have a job.
"Oh, sticks and stones will break my bones, but unemployment will never hurt me."
"Why don't you try and be amusing for Merle while I go to work, hmm?"
"Hello, darling."
I feel sick.
It'll pass.
- You kissed her.
- Just on the cheek.
"If I don't stay friends with her, how will I see you?"
I could meet you just the same.
How?
Your aunt never lets you out of the house.
"And even if she does, that chauffeur follows you everywhere he goes."
"Oh, pooh on Corbett."
I can fool him any time I want to.
"Once, maybe, but you'd never get out again."
"If you'd just let me come to the house, I could convince Aunt Olivia--"
No!
"Look, baby, you're 21 years old."
Not till next Saturday.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a tad.
* sitting in the back * * of this Cadillac * * thinking I work way too hard * * to be where I'm at * * blinded by the cars * * in the boulevards *
* I always took my cues * * from the real star *
"* I've got a plan * * in the palm of my hand * * to get me going, oh no * * but I'm just trying * * to get by *"
"Oh, you just scared the hell out of me."
"Sorry, I wa..."
"I was just, um, I was... nothing."
"Ah, that's a... nice heels."
Oh!
"Yeah, uh, my feet were hurting, so I... same reason I never wear mine."
What?
"Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
"Oh, you mean like a rave?"
"Oh, is it still a rave if you don't roll?"
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
Want me to get you one?
Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
Yeah?
"All right, cool."
"Um, it's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
Yeah.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"" is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
Why do you wanna know?
I can't tell you that.
And I would aid in the effort.
And be welcomed for it.
Come.
Keep him still until we return.
"A little wine, if seized by fit."
Drink.
Move Tullius' wine from sight.
"Apologies, Domina."
I would have permission to see Gannicus.
You ask this now?
I know he is to be sold tomorrow.
"I would have final words, before he departs."
I would share drink with an old friend.
Is that all I am?
A friend?
Gannicus...
I do not care for honey in my wine.
It serves only to mask bitter taste.
A blessing in such moments.
You are to be sold to Tullius.
Oenomaus warned of it should I fall to Crixus.
You let Crixus win.
Why would you do such a thing?
"Because I cannot stay within these walls, to gaze upon you every day and be denied your touch."
"I have never turned from challenge, yet I am without strength to face this one."
Then it is for the best.
"Because, despite my words,"
I stand as weak.
I want no wine.
Medicus gave order.
Drink.
Should help you rest.
At last you've come to your senses.
Sorry.
Ah.
Do it the way you did it last time.
"Something that makes me look a little younger, please."
You always look young to me.
Perhaps I should chop it all off like you.
Except that I'm not that crazy.
"Aurora, surely you can afford a dress by now."
I've got used to trousers.
They're comfortable and I can move around.
Can you feel that draught?
It comes straight through that wall.
"I've told you before, Mama."
Don't stay here.
- Come back with me to Nohant.
"- No, I want to be in Paris."
"Besides, you don't need my company."
You have that young man.
What's he called?
Malle...
Malle...
- Mallefille.
- Mallefille!
- A very dashing fellow.
- I wish he'd fall off the map.
"You're always looking for something better, Aurora."
"If you'd stayed married, you'd have money."
- You shouldn't beg for scraps like I did.
- I'm doing fine.
The only money I ever saw was what your grandmother paid me not to see you.
You didn't have to take it.
"Now that mary's come of age, they look beyond me,"
"They want her, and I want her protected by France."
France's true king.
"Not some bastard they can knock off the throne,"
Whose life only took form
Because you couldn't keep your husband's interest in bed.
I am defeated.
"If you want to fix this, do it yourself."
"Ah, here it is."
My mother had it packed deep in one of my trunks.
"Well, it's beautiful, but will it be warm enough?"
This isn't for your journey to the chapel.
It's for you to cover your face
As you and bash stand before god and profess your love.
Is that lola?
Why is she with francis?
Lola:
Mary.
"Kenna, greer."
Your grace.
You're back.
Both of you.
"Uh, your carriage,"
Why didn't they announce your arrival at the gate?
We ran into each other at a chateau near angers.
You came back together?
We rode.
There were floods.
The carriage I leased
Was swept away in the night.
Can you imagine?
Kenna:
It's more than that.
I need help.
I can't stand it anymore.
"It's Hyde, sir."
"It's a man I know, Mr. Hyde."
It's him that's done it and more.
More I can't tell you.
He ain't a human.
He's a beast.
"And he won't let me go, sir, and I am afraid to run away."
"Marcia, she's my girlfriend, and Freddie, that's her friend, they they say it's my nerves, and that you know about such things."
And that you could help me.
"Oh, I can't bear up under it no more!"
If you can't help me give me some poison so I can kill myself.
Why didn't you try to get help before?
Why didn't you go to the police?
"I tell you, I'm afraid."
No he ain't a man.
"He's a devil, he is."
He knows what you're thinking about.
"If he knows I'm here, who knows what he'll do."
"It won't be nothing human, I can tell you!"
"Oh, please."
Please help me keep him off.
"I'll do anything you ask, sir."
I ain't as bad as you might think.
Well...
Men say that I...
I ain't a bad looker when I'm more myself.
"You liked me once a little, didn't you?"
"Really, you..."
You're such a fine and kind gentleman.
Walls.
"Yes, furniture, walls, curtains, candles"
What else?
Darkness.
Precisely.
I dreamed of creating a hallway ten times the size of this room.
A room without darkness.
"On one side, windows looking out to the gardens, on the other, mirrors."
A hall of blinding light that would make the Palace famous throughout the world and for time eternal!
Let us now turn this dream into reality!
"It is Her Highness, Sire."
She is taken ill.
"Talk to me, doctor."
"I beg your patience, Sire."
"It would rather scrub your plans, wouldn't it, if she died?"
She will not die.
"Suppose, having the death of both my wives on your conscience?"
Henriette's death had nothing to do with me.
I beg to differ.
There is a certain test I wish to perform.
Here.
What is this for?
"Urine, Your Highness."
Of course.
Your staring at me is not making this any easier.
Thank you.
Wine.
Well?
Yer Highness is pregnant!
Congratulations!
My heartfelt congratulations to you both.
We did it!
I have one of sprites and goblins.
Sit down and do your best to fright me with your sprites.
There was a man dwelt by a churchyard...
Bear the boy hen;
he shall not me about her.
What is this?
Sport?
Away with him!
Let her sport herself
"With that she's big with, for 'tis Polixenes"
Has made thee swell thus.
She's an adulteress!
"Should a villain say so, the most replenish'd villain in the world"
He were as much more villain.
"You, my lord, do but mistake."
"You have mistook, my lady, Polixenes for Leontes."
Away with her!
To prison!
"Adieu, my lord."
I never wished to see you sorry
Now I trust I shall.
I dare my life lay down that the queen is spotless.
Cease; no more.
"'I have despatch'd to sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple."
Though I am satisfied yet shall the oracle
'Give rest to the minds of others such as he. '
- How does the boy?
- He took good rest tonight.
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
"Go, see how he fares."
Away!
Away!
- Could you?
- Yes.
- Why did you shoot?
- Instinct.
Did you consider the safety ofthe passengers?
Did you sound any warning before you shot?
Insufficient time.
The hostage had a coronary thrombosis.
She died ofa heart attack.
Her family has registered an official complaint.
- You're responsible for her death.
- That's crazy
How could I know she had a heart condition?
I've been on Eddie Hung's case for seven months.
The guy was a maniac.
He'd shoot anybody for any reason.
Should I have waited until he killed her?
You forget I'd just seen him kill a cop.
Who's responsible for that cop's death?
Fine!
Do whateveryou want.
I'm used to all sorts ofcomplaints.
One more makes no difference.
Catch!
- How's the action hand?
- Pretty useless.
Better use it more.
It won't help.
A one-handed killer's out ofthe action.
I've had my day.
His name is Tony Weng.
He works with a drug ring in Central America.
He was acquitted.
Until now.
I'm in the acquittal business.
"Look, it's my life's mission to keep the wrongly accused"
From being incarcerated.
"Yeah, like, uh, like that little girl last year, right?"
Was accused of killing her brother.
Yes!
Thank you for bringing that up.
One of my great trials.
Hannah miller.
"Evidence against hannah was, uh, was overwhelming."
Yes.
Until they found a pair
Of girl's glasses at the crime scene that didn't match.
"Now, obviously, that was left by the real killer."
And the jury agreed with me.
Yes.
How convenient.
"Ah, well, you know,"
I'm good at finding holes in the prosecution's case.
"I mean, that is my gift."
Your gift is planting evidence.
"Oh, wh-wh-wh-whoo."
Careful.
That's libelous.
About the enright case.
Fact remains that
"Those cuff links left a reasonable doubt,"
And you were the one that purchased 'em.
We have proof right there.
"Oh, I see."
"Lives are in danger--no, no, not for that."
"Dr. Weisfeld, you're under arrest for treason."
Just tell us that the charges aren't true.
We both know.
So just tell us.
- I can't.
They're true.
"- Okay, that's--that's not--"
I had my reasons.
"Artie, homeland security's coming"
To pick you up.
You need to give us a way to help you now.
"You need to concentrate on the mission,"
Not worry so much about me.
Mrs. Frederic fixed this once and she can fix it a--
This whole thing could've been avoided
"If you just told us anything about the sword, the tsuba, your past."
"Anything, Artie, we--we--we could have helped."
We could have run interference with Dickinson.
If you just trusted us.
"So--so what happens now, Artie?"
"I mean, what--what happens with the warehouse?"
"I mean, what, are we in charge?"
what?
I think we should know.
She fixed all this.
Mrs. Frederic.
She fixed all of this years ago.
It's him too.
It--it has to be.
"Okay, Artie,"
"This isn't just about the treason, all right?"
His name is Tony Weng.
He works with a drug ring in Central America.
- Who wants him dead?
- No questions.
Take it or leave it.
- 1 .5 million.
- Seems high.
This is my last hatchetjob.
"All right, it's a deal."
Money's no object.
These guns are clean.
No serial numbers.
Untraceable.
Explosive head bullets.
Your favorite.
"Easy to pick up, hard to put down."
Want to change your mind?
Why take thisjob?
Ifshe doesn't have a cornea transplant soon... she might lose her sight forever.
There's a cornea bank in Hong Kong... but it's always empty.
"When a donation does come in, someone else gets it first."
So we're going to try abroad.
I have to leave you for a few days.
"When I return, I'll take you overseas for surgery."
"You will come back, right?"
I promise.
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.
Many VIPs and government officials will attend the opening ceremony.
You are assigned to protect them.
Their information is in your files.
Make sure you're extra alert!
"Yes, sir!"
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
I'm gonna kill him.
"No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
No.
"You were right, let's kill him."
Oh...
No.
Kanima.
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl...
With severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
Hey.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
Yes!
Why?
Because... he's evil.
Artie would've told us.
Let's go.
"Uh, go--go--go back."
Go back.
Go back.
What--what exactly happened there?
"You tell us, Artie, okay?"
Because the Japanese sure as hell don't know.
They're testing for everything from dirty bombs to gas leaks.
They won't let us in the room.
They're holding us in the lobby.
They're--they're treating us like suspects.
Suspects?
Why?
did you have the decoy sword with you?
"No. but they're not even looking for the sword, Artie."
They--they're not even sure whether or not it was taken.
"Okay, that makes no sense to me whatsoever."
Either it's gone or it's not gone.
You said you saw somebody leaving.
Did he have it?
"I don't know, okay?"
'cause I was about two seconds away from passing out.
"Yeah, wh--wh--what did this guy look like?"
"Uh, not female."
"Look, Artie, uh, my Japanese sucks."
But it sounds to me as if they think the sword
Was vaporized or something.
What do you mean vaporized?
What do you mean?
By the bomb?
"There was no bomb, Artie."
Don't say that.
So... you're a street vendor.
What sort of things do you sell?
"Very kind of you to sit and talk with me, Doctor."
I wanted to ask ―
The others are asking when the cast is coming off my arm.
"It'll get stiff being bandaged too long, won't it?"
That's a powerful hand.
Squeeze.
"Oh yes, very strong!"
"You're a real man, Biberkopf."
- That's right.
"Rotten luck, getting hit by that car."
Your skull was fractured.
We weren't able to save your arm.
You mean my arm is gone?
Well... thanks so much for telling me.
"Well, anyway..."
"You have a tough job too, telling people these things."
All in a day's work.
Now let's see you get back on your feet quickly.
- Tomorrow.
"- No, a few more days."
I can get up tomorrow.
I can only lie in bed for so long.
I have to get back to work.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can forbid it
A blonde today A brunette tomorrow
Who wants to commit his heart
Take your luck as it comes
It's no shame to enjoy life
"You're 13 now, and what you could do is serious."
Like riding on Daniel's bike and crash into a truck.
That doesn't matter to you.
Of course it matters to me.
No.
Only if I've slept with Daniel.
That is my concern me too.
"-No, just that!"
"If you get so upset, maybe you did something!"
You always said I should do what seems right to me.
And I'll always tell you that!
-Then that's it.
So you've slept with him?
Don't be like that.
-How do you want me to be?
"If you'd tell me the truth, you'd feel more calm."
"You'd feel more calm, but you won't!"
Why don't you stay the night here?
I told you I couldn't.
-I didn't get that impression.
What then?
What's the matter?
Truth is nobody could find you for six days.
Alright?
You can do whatever you want.
Of course.
That's what I'm saying.
But not what you're thinking.
Do you know my thoughts better than me?
"I see you're going to sermonize me about what I've done, or what you or we've done."
I've never asked you to change your behavior.
Regardless of what I could think.
He is?
"Well, does he have a fever?"
He's throwing up.
OK.
"Look, we'll, um..."
we'll be home soon.
Thanks.
"Hey, we would've had to leave early anyway."
"You know, we just should've stayed home and watched a movie."
"Honey, you know there's another pint of ice cream in the freezer, right?"
Can't I just make out with my husband?
"Yeah, if that's all."
What's that supposed to mean?
Just...
I was hoping that we could take the night off.
Since when do you want to take the night off?
"It's just, you know, the way you've been."
How exactly have I been?
Just very... easily aroused.
"What, like some nympho?"
"Like a hooker, I can't get enough?"
Is that what you think?
"Look, I'm not like some sex-bot."
"You can't just put a battery in me, and boom, there I go."
"Even if I was 16, I couldn't keep up with you."
All I want is some sleep.
Just eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.
You want to take a break?
You can sleep on the couch tonight.
And tomorrow!
"Oh, God."
I feel like I'm in high school again.
At that stage everyone started to laugh.
At last!
Madame Sand!
Everybody's staring at me.
It's a revelation wearing trousers.
I feel quite the bully!
George in a dress?
"Red and white, the colours of the polish flag."
That's a bit of overkill.
"I tell you, we'II discuss it..."
May I take your arm?
My husband's in a temper tonight because I'm wearing his britches.
"George, Chopin does not deserve to be collected."
"He's so fragile, you know he might..."
What's this?
A secret?
Is he the one you came here to meet?
"MaIIefiIIe, if you can't behave, go to your room."
I am quite marooned.
will you... partner me?
Of course.
- Bon appetit.
- (all) Bon appetit.
I understand many of you artists are atheists.
Atheists?
"Oh, no."
"No, we feel that God exists."
He's just not considered worth all the trouble of denying him.
"Oh, really!"
The baron is baiting you.
He maintains there is no scientific evidence of God.
"And I reply ""Because civilisation has poured dust on his traces."""
We may be the only English ship in the Mediterranean.
- Do you insist on the rendezvous?
- I insist on carrying out my orders which are to escort a convoy.
- A French ship will be waiting.
- I can see it now.
- You've been proved right once before.
"Here, I feel you are wrong."
There will be no French ship.
Only the fear of one.
- Sir!
- Listen.
They're celebrating already.
- Sir.
- And why not?
There will be plenty of prize money for all hands with these two beauties.
- Pay attention.
- I've detailed the crews to sail them.
The third lieutenant in charge of the frigate.
"Good luck, Mr. D'Arblay."
- A pleasant voyage to Rochefort.
- Thank you.
- You must listen.
- Kellahorn's leading the merchantman.
I've given him a junior midshipman to assist him.
Mr. Crawford.
Mr. Crawford?
- Take care of that ship.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Get her back safely.
Pull away.
Hoist away.
I thought you wanted the boy onboard with you.
"Because there's no dial tone, that's how I know."
'We've noted that you've been cut off.'
"Well, why've we been cut off?"
!
'Anita Magath.'
"Anita, Jo."
Is my husband there?
Tommy Cary?
Aye.
"I've got me licence, just not on us."
You're all right.
We want to know if you know who this belongs to.
"Aye, I know him."
He put a pony on the third race.
Doesn't happen very often.
He chases his bets.
Makes us uneasy.
It's like watching them jumping off a cliff.
Is he?
Jumping off a cliff.
"When you take the money, you try not to think about the look in their eyes, but, aye, there's some you feel sorry for."
~ Was he one of them?
~ Jimmy?
"What, is it an addiction?"
"Most people bet for a laugh, but some can't stop laughing till they've emptied their pay packet."
And that's when the crying starts.
"Bills to pay, bairns going hungry at home, angry wives."
"It certainly keeps those guys busy in that window, I can tell you."
"Who are they, loan sharks?"
I'm not really in a position to judge.
Did our man use them?
I don't know.
To give you the satisfaction that you made your daughter as a Collector.
I could not believe all these when your daughter was saying it all to us.
But I am believing it now.
He risks anything if your family is touched.
What if I kill you in front of his eyes?
Sorry Ramachandra Rao!
You only showed me the dead body of my son.
But I will show you the death of your father.
I am giving you 15 minutes time.
It is your choice whether you save your father by joining him in hospital..
.. or save your girlfriend in our custody at the stud farm in that time.
You decide!
I am leaving this country now.
Good bye!
Karthik
Karthik
- Thanks for coming.
Sure.
What's he doing here?
Didn't they break up?
Two months ago.
Chill.
Tell him to go.
"This is a mourning, not a nightclub."
- You tell him.
- I will.
Don't you dare insult him.
- Want me to cancel my trip?
"- No, I'm fine."
I just hope they don't fall apart on me.
- Thanks.
- For what?
- Sorry for the trouble.
Goodbye.
Business is slow too...
Do you think you'll have to go to the police station again?
Business has its ups and downs.
And so what if I go to the police station again?
I'm close to the officers there.
Are you not worried at all?
After Park Seon Woo is finished with Detective Im...
He could try to choke you next.
"If we fight, I'll win."
How are you joking around right now?
I'm worried to death over here...
"Smile, Writer Bae."
"They say, ""If you can't avoid it, enjoy it."""
Mr. President.
Do you know how much of an optimist you are?
That's the only way to deal with this situation.
"We will win, no matter what."
We will... win no matter what?
"By the way, did you start editing your script?"
"Yes, I started by changing the main character."
How?
He's not a superhero anymore.
He's someone who could leave if he wanted to...
But he's staying behind to help his neighborhood.
A typical... former secret agent.
What?
- Hello.
"- Oh, hi."
"Oh, Chan Gyu!"
- Do you work here?
Very good...
What's your problem?
We made it.
"What's my problem is, It's almost dark."
We have no place to stay.
You figure out What my problem is.
We have the tent.
Everybody...
"Yeah, we have the tent!"
Have you set one up before?
!
"Yeah, so I've never Set one up before!"
"But it's a tent, And I can figure it out."
Everything's fine.
"We're not gonna freeze To death, everybody."
We work out in these Conditions all the time.
"I know, but we have a place To go to at the end of the day."
"Here, we don't."
"I have no idea, To be honest with you."
I believe my dad and brother Wanted me so we'd go back.
To the old way Of doing things.
"So I'm basically saying, ""Hey, you're gonna give up."""
"Everything you know, You're gonna come live with me."
"""In the middle of nowhere, And that's your new life."""
"If I can't make my family want To make a million dollars,"
I'll get somebody else.
"As night falls across The bering sea,"
Just one mile away...
Whoo!
Hell yeah!
Shawn pomrenke's first day Of the winter mining season.
Comes to a close.
You tried not to waste my time?
You think I'll be happy?
And that's being nice to me?
"You know, you wasted 3 good years."
We may not be together forever.
But we'll have happy memories.
We don't even have that now.
Look at me!
"No matter how many days you've left and the chance for the operation,"
I'll arrange for you.
Because I'll be here with you.
You're mine this time.
"Voice message to dad, press 1."
"Ask for money, press 2"
"Make an appointment, press 0"
Is Mr. Mak in?
Now!
"previously on ""jericho"""
Heather.
"Oh, my God."
We grew up together over in New Bern.
You just going to leave?
It won't be for very long.
"Johnston, you SOB."
How the hell did you lose an election?
No.
"The question is, how did you get to be in charge in New Bern?"
They get tired of you being the sheriff?
Can we buy some more of these things?
"Ten wind turbines for,let's say, ten percent of your spring crop."
"Okay, we'll give you the food."
Yes.
"Now, I must warn you, the retrovirus is still experimental."
"In fact, it's only been tested on cell cultures in a laboratory, and so far, without much success."
I'm hoping that what we can learn from your daughter will help me perfect it.
We've got a problem.
Why didn't you just radio me?
"Yeah, well, I could've, but... this way."
Looks like they decided to join the hunt.
"If they find Ellia, they'll kill her."
"Sheppard, this is McKay."
"What is it, Rodney?"
"The villagers are on the move, and it doesn't look like they're going to a picnic."
Are they heading for the caves?
"Not at the moment, no."
All right.
Get back there and sit tight.
"We're losing time, guys."
Ellia?
Ellia?
She's not here.
Good Lord.
What?
She took the retrovirus.
You said it wasn't ready.
"It's not, not by a long shot."
What'll it do to her?
To be honest I have no idea
colonel Sheppard come in.
Go ahead.
We've got another problem.
"Ellia's gone, and she's injected herself with the retrovirus."
Why would she do that?
Damone?
"Yeesh, I'm really kind of busy."
"Come on, just do me this one favor."
"All right, but you owe me for this one."
"Oh, thanks, Damone."
And that was the last we ever saw of him.
"Well, well, well."
Who do we have here?
"It's me, Chris, you know me."
Why are you talking like a bad guy?
"Listen, I saw you steal money from Mom's purse."
Oh...
"Well, I was just trying to get new sneakers."
"You're not going to tell on me, are you?"
"Well, that depends."
On what?
"How about, I won't tell Mom and Dad about the money if you promise to do whatever I say."
"Meg, this is how a lot of porn starts."
"I mean it, Chris."
I'll tell them.
"Mom, Chris took money out of the..."
"Okay, okay, okay."
I'll do whatever you want.
I thought you'd see it that way.
Here's a list of stuff I need you to do for me.
"Shouldn't have taken that money, Chris."
"Eh, she's right."
I'm a horrible person.
I'm only one step above those people who really like dive bars and really need you to know it.
I love this place.
I love dive bars.
Dive bars are my favorite.
"Okay, Sara may still be in that tunnel."
"McNamara, let's get blueprints."
"Mei, Tac Team on standby."
Let's go.
Five Lincoln want a team leader.
The tunnel is secured.
This is team leader.
Good to go.
Valera stopped somewhere in here in the northbound bore.
"North and south tunnels are linked by three cross passages-- here, here, and here."
They're used for ventilation and maintenance.
Access shafts run off each cross passage.
So what about these?
Relief ducts.
They leed right into the drainage system
It's like a maze.
Perfect place to hide a body.
Live or otherwise.
"Okay, listen up!"
Sara Collins may still be alive in this tunnel structure.
Weapons down.
Eyes up.
Let's move.
You gonna be able to pick anything up through these walls?
It's a crap shoot.
"Kelton, we've got something."
It's definitely blood-- fresh.
that's a fingerprint.
Nice and clean.
Almost like someone made it on purpose.
Run it!
Plenty of room for Valera to pull over.
I'm worried.
You're never there when I send someone.
I don't know what to do.
You could phone.
That would make things easier.
True.
I hadn't thought of that.
Did you get my check?
Yes.
It was for my cotton business.
I'm worried about that too.
Coming.
Balla has been on the job for three months... and he's been well received by the workers.
His salary has risen and his work rate has improved.
"Therefore, management has decided... to take special measures, though not for the first time."
The police have opened an investigation.
Nothing new!
We've heard this story before... with all its mysteries.
The crowd you see over there is here because of your brother.
All will be known today.
How many times have we taken the blow?
Enough!
"Balla, you'll see us do it."
- Hello!
"- Hello, Touré!"
"The house is quiet, where are the servants?"
Madame has...
Sent them all away?
After I left?
"Naré, what an embarrassment!"
Sissoko is at the door.
How will I explain?
- Yeah. you always told Frankie and me that a man is measured by the strength of his enemies.
But you're wrong.
A man is measured by the strength of the love others have for him.
I hope one day you and I can put away the pain and actually talk to each other. your son Brandon.
You're not gonna fucking believe this shit.
the prodigal son returns.
kid.
I take it you got me something.
Not exactly.
Exactly what then?
A business proposal.
Unless this conversation you ain't walking out of here.
Just hear me out.
Sit. plus a whole lot more?
I'm listening.
here's the deal...
Give me a call when you're ready to make some money.
do you?
Why not?
He's as greedy as his brother Frankie was.
follow him.
And another thing-- see if anybody heard anything.
book the fight.
l want to go as far away as possible.
Yeah?
Where would you want to go?
as long as it's sunny and there's water and there's really nice beaches.
We can always take a ride up the West Coast.
Yeah?
That would be amazing.
Hey.
good.
- What?
- For my father.
Don't tell him I was with you.
"Wait, wait."
I'll take you.
"- No, we're going to take the tram."
- When will we meet up?
In two days.
In the same place as always.
Will you think about me?
I will.
I'd love to show you the youth of today.
"You can't imagine how different they are... they're better, they have revolution in their blood."
If only Trotsky and Lenin had known that.
Trotsky was a filthy traitor.
"Imagine what your mother would say if she heard you talk that way... about someone you never met, and someone who has passed away at that."
Mund...
"Sir, I want to go to Munich."
What for?
There's food here.
"Doctor, my head hurts."
Do you have something?
"No, I'm very sorry."
I don't have anything.
"- The Geneva Convention, prisioner."
- Mund...
The gentlemen will say that they're in good health...
- there's nothing to complain about.
- This prisoner has appealed...
- to the Geneva Convention.
- He's got no case at all...
- that idiot refuses to eat.
Which list?
The list.
It's a tragedy.
They burned it.
What are you talking about?
What is that list?
A hand written sheet with names and dates.
It was here.
I saw it only yesterday.
I did not think that it was important.
"I should have called you, Fandor."
Calm down.
Try to remember what was written.
"Well, I only remember..."
"""Baroness de Vibray"""
"""April 5"" and..."
And then?
"And then, of course, my brother's name with the same date."
"Maybe ""12 April"" was written too."
I'm not sure at all.
Not a word to anyone about what just happened.
We're here to help you with the circumstances you are going through.
We know everything about your financial situation.
Indeed.
"Through us, you could sell some of your unfortunate brother's paintings."
"Yes, and if he is still alive, as I wish, he will be happy to know that his paintings were taken care of."
It is very kind of you.
I'm very grateful.
You're welcome.
You are very pale.
Are you sick?
"No, not at all."
Do not get lost!
"- It's a little mysterious, right?"
- Yes.
as representative.
Yes.
Do you think we will be happy?
"""Crew only"""
I quit talking with crocodiles.
"all of them, guess ...."
This is a TV antenna on the roof.
Addons Silahkanduduk and navigate your seat facing forward.
Addons you install seat belts.
Addons and preparation ride of your life.
To leave.
Addons Smoking is prohibited in the aircraft.
"Addons We encourage you to continue to install, seatbelt at the time of turbulence."
Addons I was preparing for a low turbulence.
Addons In the case of pressure loss I and oxygen on the tiles.
How long before New York?
6 hours.
Even if you fly full speed.
"Addons now make a brief pause, Before the game started."
That is some of you in New York?
I do not.
This is the first time you fly.
Really?
You're doing very well.
What are you doing?
It should to sit in our seats.
Are you scared.
And champagne ... 1985 ...
For the women ...
Anything you care to share with me?
Sure.
Your commercials?
They suck ass.
I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
Is that like the one your mom works at?
Is she still offering the two-for-one discount?
"DEA, huh?"
For a street bust.
"Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?"
"Sooner or later, this was gonna happen."
"You want your exponential growth, guys are gonna get busted."
Simple as that.
So how about we get him a real attorney?
"I mean, what the hell is this?"
This is who he hires?
What?
Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.
This is the guy I'd hire.
- It's the guy you'd hire.
"- Look, you remember Emilio?"
"This dude got Emilio off, like, twice."
"Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo."
And then poof!
Dude's like Houdini.
"Seriously, when the going gets tough, you don't want a criminal lawyer."
All right?
"You want a ""criminal"" lawyer."
Know what I'm saying?
"Look, we're in good shape, Mr. White."
Badger's way too loyal to roll.
See?
That was easy.
"It's like I always say, when it comes to good parenting, you have to be fair but firm."
You just show 'em that you mean business...
"And he's out of bed again, isn't he?"
You never have this problem with sock puppets.
"All right, what's this all about?"
Voices.
- Voices?
- In here.
Telling me what to do.
You have voices inside your head.
Sometimes.
And what kind of things do they tell you to do?
The early bird catches the worms!
What's gotten into this kid?
Hey!
You're going to...
Maybe you sing him a little song.
"Come here, you..."
Hey!
What the...?
Do I look like the kind of guy that knows a lullaby?
Sing!
Lullaby and good night
Close your big creepy eyes
If you sleep Away I'll creep
And get out of here alive
"You know, once you get past all the splinters and rope burns, he's actually kind of cute."
Now where did he go?
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Now there's something you don't see every day.
"Oh, yeah?"
I am gonna punch a hole through your face.
I'd like to see you try that.
Yeah?
"- Ooh, you're gonna die!"
"- Oh, I am gonna rip your face off..."
- You're gonna die!
"- Make a shirt out of it, and I'm gonna wear it."
"I'm gonna take one second to take my shirt off, and then you're gonna die!"
What the...
"Hey, listen, lady."
"You wanna beat up on your little boyfriend, you go do it somewhere else."
Watch the car.
"- Dude, where the hell is your fighter?"
- He'll be here.
- He'll be here when?
- Soon!
"- Okay, you have five minutes to put a fighter in that ring."
- Okay.
Just got off the phone with Charlie.
"- Well, where is he?"
- He's in jail with Dee.
- What?
- Apparently they got all hopped up on amphetamines... and beat the shit out of some guy in front of the bar.
- Amphetamines?
"- Yeah, like, steroids or something."
I don't know.
"- Damn it, Charlie."
- Look at the dude he was supposed to fight.
- He's the scrawniest...
- I know!
Charlie would have killed that guy.
"Be careful who you trust, robinson crusoe."
Do you need anything?
"I happened to lay eyes on you earlier this morning, miss."
"I've been at sea over a year now, but I ain't forgotten what makes a woman a woman."
Come here!
Please!
I beg you!
Begging's good.
"You alert the whole camp, then I'll be everyone's property."
"But if you keep my secret, you'll also keep exclusive rights."
You're a sly one.
And no mistake.
Do we have a deal?
Nolan!
"Where are ya, ya gutless dog?"
We have a deal.
I'll be back soon.
You can rely on it.
Did you find the lad?
Yes and no.
The lad's a lady.
A bearded lady?
The beard's an old stage performance trick.
Your mating rituals are complicated enough as they are.
And that kind of thing will not help.
"She may be brave, but I would never normally put a woman's life in danger."
I need a different plan.
Where have you been?
The sacrificial burial ground.
"You're not the only one who has a plan, crusoe."
Those are human remains.
It would not be a burial ground if they were not.
-Because it's not.
What's his name?
-Daniel.
"Daniel is in college, and he faces issues completely different than yours."
What do you mean?
Strikes and all that?
-For example.
Well we're gonna make one.
I don't know if not going to school is considered as a strike.
I'm not sure about that at all!
You're so reactionary.
I'm worried about you dating an 18 years old boy.
And what if he were 20?
I'd be more worried.
Don't laugh about it.
It's not funny at all.
It's not that.
"The other day, a guy who's 20 asked me to go to skate with him."
Then tell him to go to skate with his mom.
"Hey, that would be if I wouldn't wanted to go, huh?"
Don't talk to me like that!
Can I know why are you upset?
"-I'm not, I'm just worried."
You sound just like mom.
"""Don't talk to me like that!"""
Is there any of your friends talking to their fathers about this stuff?
Not that I know of.
And is there anyone brave enough to tell them the same?
Neither.
And what about that priest you guys are meeting.
You talk like that?
Like you and me?
- Get out.
- Okay.
- So many questions.
It was never boring working with you people.
Hmm.
Back and forth.
Back and forth.
"One day your government wants me,"
The next I'm a crackpot.
"Your own partner said to me, ""never again."""
Even then I knew
One day one of you would be back
To place an order.
Huh?
"Oh, it better be cash."
American credit ain't what it used to be.
What's that?
Another gadget for me to tinker with?
Wait.
I did what you asked.
Lots of eyes to make the switch here.
I guess night's our only option.
White house won't be any easier.
I'd feel a lot more comfortable doing it
Before it gets anywhere near the president.
"It's ridiculous that we don't know what we're protecting him from, but..."
Typical Artie.
"I mean, I understand grabbing the artifact"
Before it causes trouble.
But he couldn't spare two seconds
To warn us about what we're walking into?
"Look, I'm sure if it were really dangerous,"
- Yeah.
I wanted to see what it looked like on.
"It must be so cool being you, all kick-ass and everything."
I bet you always get what you want.
You'd be surprised.
"- So you're feeling better, then?"
"- Oh, much."
I just feel so safe here.
Feels so right.
"Jenny I know what it's like to be led on and I would hate to do that to you, so ..."
"I'm saying this not to be cruel, but to be clear."
"You staying here, it's just temporary."
Yeah.
Of course.
I'll be out of your hair as soon as it's safe.
Just say the word.
- Dyson.
- I have Olivia.
We're at the clinic.
"- So we can relax, then?"
- Or you can get your ass down here.
The Ash wants you to explain this.
"- Well, what if I say my calendar's full?"
- Don't.
- What's up?
- I've been summoned.
You are not leaving me with Weepy McWeepster.
"Oh, yeah, about that."
I need for you to do something for me.
"I'm not giving her a sponge bath, I swear to God."
"I put too much oomph in my zing, and she's crushing on me big time."
I need for you to talk her out of it gently.
Our missing journalist's name is Amanda Kane.
I'm guessing Amanda Kane is a blast from your past?
She's the reporter who broke the north beach bribery scandal wide open.
She destroyed your career.
No.
I destroyed my career.
You sounded almost convincing.
If you want to bow out...
No.
Charlie's the boss.
"This could be more than just a case for you, Kate."
Signing on is your call.
I'll respect your decision.
There'll be no judgment.
Well...
You know me...
Not really one to sit on the sidelines.
Count me in.
"Pack your bags, angels."
The next sunrise cruise tour sets sail first thing tomorrow morning.
"Once upon a time, there were three young women who got into very big trouble, and now they work for me."
My name is Charlie.
Enjoy your stay.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
"Welcome aboard the Caribbean dreamer, Mr..."
Bosley.
I'll be in communication from my cabin.
Stay in touch.
Will do.
"- Abbs, are you in yet?"
- Approaching eagle eye now.
- So the Starling sisters lied?
What difference does it really make?
"For God's sake, of course it makes a difference."
It's not the truth.
"The truth is, they stole a boat from a man who terrified them and set out to cross 50 miles of open sea into a war."
- They never got there.
- Because their engine failed.
"Now, there's a truth we won't be telling."
"Morale-sapping, apparently."
We pick our truths.
Isn't that the point?
We're saying this is based on a true story.
Then don't.
"Oh, Christ above, man, you're supposed to be the propagandist!"
700 ships went to Dunkirk.
"338,000 men came back."
Don't say it's based on a true story.
Say it's based on 100 true stories.
- A thousand.
"- 338,000."
"Dunkirk, the biggest retreat in military history, or the miracle that put the fire back in all our bellies?"
"Very well, carry on as you were."
I have a car waiting.
You won't regret it.
"Thank you, Mr. Swain."
Buckley!
Buckley!
Sit.
Sit.
I don't care that you lied.
I care that you lied to us.
There wasn't enough money.
What?
You do not have to say anything...
His cab is going to forensic services.
And so are his trainers.
"I swear to god, she got out and that was the last I saw of her."
Just like you never saw Kelly Mahon after she got out of your cab?
That's the truth.
So why did you run?
Straight up?
My cousin gave me a load of iPads last night.
"What, nicked I take it?"
They were in the boot of my cab.
I thought you were after them.
"You been inside, Carl?"
You know I have.
Two years GBH.
"Yeah, that's right.And your DNA was all over the bloke you punched."
The bloke insulted my girl.
I knocked him once.
Then the old Bill bang on my door.
But it was blood on your clothes that got you convicted?
Yeah.
But what's any of this got to do with those girls?
We think you've got a grudge against women who work in forensic services.
"You're joking, right?"
No.
"I mean, two years to sit in jail and stew over whose fault it was that you were sitting in that cell."
I know whose fault it was.
It was mine.
And the drink.
Not Kelly Mahon's?
Not Lucy Kennard's?
Your husband?
Why?
He did not know about the work or the boys.
Boys?
There were others.
"For the last time, where is the money?"
"There is 2,000 in the almirah, take it and leave!"
Next time you come my husband will be waiting for you!
I haven't come for a handout!
I want money that is rightfully mine!
So go and ask the one who has taken it.
Ask whom?
Your husband?
He earns more in a day than you have managed in all these months!
Go and ask your friend!
The scoundrel even looked like a thief.
Don't lie.
Why do you lie?
Did you learn anything from me in all these months?
Apart from sex!
"Our work can start again, leave now..."
Think of your sisters.
I am never sinking back into your filth again!
I want my money and I want it now!
"Sarika, open the door."
Did you foresee this while you were planning your break in?
Sarika!
Open the door!
I know there is someone inside!
Open up!
Open up or I will cal in the neighbors!
Today the whole world will see your true colors... I will rub your face in dirt.
Thank you.
Oh!
Um... ?
please.
Please.
"For as long as you receive an article coaching fee, I don't see no objection your continuing to instruct him."
Fee!
?
Yes!
Certainly a fee.
I should be raising the matter with Mr.Baker today.
Is...is there anything else you wish me to discuss with him?
Uh...
Dress-room articles?
Or your intimate needs catered for?
"Sammy, once mentioned you do not like to share studio facilities with crew."
Electricians in particular?
Er..yes...ehuh...well one...one mustn't complain.
They do their best to make one comfortable.
"And as for the work...people seem to be responding rather well, so..."
"Uncle Frank, I look..."
look forward to your opinion.
Thank you.
Sometimes one simply has to be firm.
Did you miss me?
You left your jacket in the cabin.
Smelt of you for the longest time.
"Then one day, I went in there... and all I could smell was Uncle Frank's pipe."
Lily...
"I understand you know, that things have changed."
And that I would like to put my name on you.
Oh!
And thought why don't I come to your home... drink water in your house and... break their bones here.
Sir you know...
Don't interfere!
What do I care?
- All I want is to...
- Get water out.
Welcome Tauji.
I've invited him here specially... to tell him about your deeds.
And show him too.
Your man's taken our contract... and he's been beating up our men... instead of doing our job.
Enough!
My rule is we can sacrifice our kin... but never fail from completing a contract.
Sometimes... we make a mistake.
In life we often make small mistakes... as well as big ones.
They are 3D villains.
3 generous villains.
They gave me one chance to catch that scoundrel.
They'll give me a second chance.
Third... fourth... fifth...
Stop it.
Are you going to keep running after him all your life?
Mr. Pradhan.
Contract cancel.
What did you say?
What did you say?
We cancel the contract we gave you.
Cancel!
Cancel!
Cancel!
Uncle you heard.
They cancelled the contract.
When the contract's canceled... there's no question of betraying.
The kinetor.
Thank you.
"I repeat, we mustn't interfere with history."
And nobody should find out that we are visitors.
"Surely they wouldn't understand it, and wouldn't know what to make of us."
2484.
That's when I was born!
- I wasn't even alive here!
- 2123.
The colonization of Mars.
The Peace Treaty.
1989.
8... 7... 6... 5...
It stopped.
Don't touch anything!
"In brief, one hour from now the Bernaus' house will burst into flames."
We have more than enough time.
"If everything went according to plan, then we must be somewhere here, on the country road that's still under construction, between Bournak and Kamenice."
You know our task.
17 degrees Celsius.
The air pollution is within the acceptable level.
"- Well, but here..."
- Just say it.
There is no country road here!
That can't be.
The machines must be here as well.
"To the right, behind us."
Hold on!
- Hold on!
- Give me your hand!
- It's terribly deep!
- Give me your hand!
"Jo, you must play terribly quietly so that the man upstairs can sleep."
He won't hear anything.
"- Mummy, why..."
"- David, who do you suppose he is?"
A damn fool to be out in this weather.
He's not a working sailor.
- He's not a working sailor?
- No.
I noticed his hands are terribly soft.
His hands?
He's wearing a suit for God's sake.
"You're very observant all of a sudden, aren't you?"
I'm going over to Tom's.
David.
Suppose he wakes up?
"Who's that man in my room, Mummy?"
"I don't know, darling."
..a girl with long blonde hair with diamonds in it.
- Do you know what diamonds are?
"- Sort of treasures, aren't they?"
I must cut your hair soon.
"If you didn't, would it grow and grow and grow?"
Yes.
It would grow down to your ears.
Then it would go down to your chin.
Then it would grow down past here.
Then it would curl up here.
"Then it would start tickling your feet, and we'd all have to get out of the bath."
Why?
"Because if people don't get out of their baths, they melt."
But I haven't.
Mummy...
My intuition?
Perhaps it's time you showed everyone what you are really like.
"Your feelings, your sense of humour and maybe even your flaws."
My flaws were already exposed by the media.
Nicolas the Humble?
Humbleness is an honourable trait.
Whatever they say.
Sire.
Did you manage to contact the Queen?
I couldn't get through to the palace.
- Prime Minister?
- He is not responding.
On purpose?
- We are ready.
"- Carlos, what is he doing here?"
- We are not going anywhere.
- Why is that?
The Security Service won't let us.
What again?
You have to find a solution.
We must get back home.
I'll try and reason with the Security Service.
Excuse me.
Maybe the Ambassador will be able to help us.
I'll go fetch the luggage.
"Sire, I will go and check if there is signal upstairs."
Where is the Ambassador?
- Sire.
- I can't concentrate.
The concourse...
Conc...
The concourse of cosmic and political circumstances...
"Son, I promise you this."
I will give you the best criminal defence that money can buy.
"Yeah, but, Francesca, I took these already."
Didn't I take these already?
It's on your head.
You're not supposed to double up on vitamin A.
It's bad for the liver.
"Okay, who's next?"
Did him.
I did him.
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.
Hang on.
I'll get back to you.
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?
Sure.
Your commercials?
They suck ass.
I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
Is that like the one your mom works at?
Is she still offering the two-for-one discount?
"DEA, huh?"
For a street bust.
"Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?"
"Sooner or later, this was gonna happen."
You want your exponential growth guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?
Somebody get the little dudes a snack and no hockey till I get home from work.
Your lover boy is here.
You better put that down before you hurt somebody.
You better come and take it from me.
Okay.
How was that?
"Little high, a little wide."
"Like you could do better, Zamboni-boy."
"Not in that butt-ugly uniform, I couldn't."
Did you get Hello Kitty to sponsor you?
- L'll just get Dad to fire you.
"- No way, your dad loves me."
"Besides, you like to stare at my butt when I'm working."
- That's disgusting.
- Is not.
I wash it every day.
Are you okay?
Okay.
Mess.
This lot is 40 acres.
"The owners were old time hockey players, the meanest goons to ever tie on skates."
Let's see how scary they really are.
"Welcome to Zenovation, one-stop shop for mind, body and soul."
"How may we help you, our sisters?"
"Love the robes, fellows."
I'm Bernie Frazier with Frazier Realty.
I'm here to talk to you about your land.
May I come in?
- Not interested.
- Bad karma.
Nice wheels.
"Okay, it seems the gooneys have gone loony."
-Oh boy.
Man I can't believe you're gonna try to solve your problems.
By letting your friends make all the sacrifices for you.
I thought your father and I raised you better than that.
[Scoffs] I didn't make them do anything.
They did it on their own.
Oh yeah.
I'm sure Lilly really wants to give up her opportunity to go to Stanford.
Come on.
It's just for this year.
We'll go together next year.
If she gets in again.
And there's no guarantee that she will and you darn well know that.
[Softly] Keep it down.
They'll hear you.
I'm in your head!
[Loudly] I can talk as loud as I want to!
"[Groaning] All right, all right."
-Jeez!
I'm annoying sometimes.
-Tell me about it.
And what about Jesse?
Do you really think he's happy about being despised.
By millions of people for breaking my heart?
Ha-ha!
You said my heart.
We have the same heart and I know it's not broken.
"What do I have to say to that, huh?"
I'll tell you what I have to say.
If you go on letting your friends do this for you.
Sure they seem okay with it now.
But deep down inside they're going to hate you for it.
What's the difference.
"So, what's this I hear about you and Jordan?"
- l can't believe this.
- You know they had sex.
- Rayanne.
- That's what I heard.
You heard it too?
"God, just shoot me."
- We could probably arrange that.
- You mean you didn't have sex?
"Angela come on, come."
You've got to start thinking of this as a positive thing.
This can help you get to the next level with Jordan.
Did he at least think you were a good kisser?
- l don't know.
- Did you like the way he kissed?
They weren't the kind of kisses you can actually evaluate.
I ntroductory kisses.
You should have had sex with him.
Where were you when the gun went off?
"Mom, it wasn't anywhere near us."
We barely heard it.
We have to worry about our kids being shot in school.
How did it come to this.
This is horrible.
This is a disgrace to all of us--
- That's too much.
- l'm sorry honey.
I'm going to say it in this meeting.
I am. I mean it.
We have to draw the line somewhere.
We just can't keep accepting the total deterioration--
We're going to need ten Jericho men to help us build them.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
You can't just ride into New Bern and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They sliced it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.
Where's Heather?
"She's dead,Jake."
Jake!
Everybody go!
Jericho is about to be invaded.
We'll do this day and night for as long as it takes.
Most of you have no idea what's coming.
This isn't a fight about land.
This is a fight for our very existence.
"Jerry, I know this has great artistic merit, but I'm taking these shoes off in ten minutes."
"So, if you don't want to have to hide my toes..."
"Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable."
We can't really do this without the best man anyway.
Where is Jake?
I don't see him.
Yeah.
"Grandpa seems to be missing, too."
Take a wild guess where they are.
Right.
"Oh, Beth."
"It's so nice to see you, dear."
Charlie.
A hat?
What the fuck is this?
Police!
Freeze!
"Don't move, motherfucker!"
I'll blow your brains out!
Shut the car off slowly!
"For a second I thought I was dead, but when I heard all the noise I knew they were cops."
Only cops talk that way.
Don't fucking move.
"If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing."
I would have been dead.
Michael!
Lock the door!
Talk to me.
When was the last time you took a collar?
"Hey fuckhead, I'm talking to you."
"You don't want to say a fucking word, don't. I don't give a fuck."
"25 years, pal, that's what you're gonna do."
See how much of a good guy you'll be then.
All day I thought the guys in the helicopter were just local cops busting my balls over Lufthansa.
They turned out to be narcs.
Just get the lawyer.
They'd been on me a month.
"Phone taps, surveillance, everything."
You know the boys.
All the pals are here.
"You don't want to talk to me, you'll have a fucking problem all night."
Each one of these counts holds 25-to-life in New York State.
"25 fucking years, pal."
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.
"What, were you guys grocery shopping?"
No stoppin' till dark.
Tin whistle plays
"You're in my light, damn you, Hagman!"
"I beg your pardon, sir."
But it's Captain Murray.
"He's poorly, sir."
Harris.
"Figure me this, Harris."
Where is the bugger planning on taking us?
Sorry to be so much trouble.
"You did well today, Sharpe."
"I did my duty, sir."
We're lost.
And we've lost Hogan's trail.
Try to find your way to Casa Antigua.
"I'll find it, sir."
"Don't be too hard on the men, Sharpe."
How can say this without offence?
You see the lads don't like an officer who's come from the ranks
They want an officer to be privileged to be set apart from them... touched by grace
They think of you as one of them Sharpe one of the damned
know now hard it must be
Sorry.
Of course I don't...
I don't know.
I'm just trying to think of some practical advice after I've gone.
"Oh, yes."
Get Patrick Harper on your side.
"Is that an order, sir?"
I want you to have my sword.
Maybe if the men see you carry it...
They'll think I'm a proper officer?
What?
Give me your key!
"But Mam, I haven't done anything."
You said I could go!
"Well, now I'm saying you can't."
Upstairs!
"Well, Pauline had it right - what have I done with my life?"
You've looked after your mother.
Was I looking after her or hiding behind her?
"She never said ""don't get married"", ""don't have a girlfriend""."
"I was the one saying, ""Ooh, I have to go home and see to my mother."""
At least you plunged.
Wasn't much of a plunge.
I knew really he wouldn't leave Mrs Stanley.
"I was so busy being hard done by, I never thought about her."
What a twerp.
Me?
Me!
What have I got to get so high and mighty about?
I'm cringing.
Can't believe I turned down all that yoghurt!
I hadn't brought plain.
I hate plain.
We'll never have it.
# I want to make you proud I want to show
# That there's still time for me to climb and change and grow
# Somewhere along the way I lost my nerve
# I'm not the man that you deserve
# Face who you are - a man with a heart
# It's only in height I'm above you.
# Breathe on my dreams
# Don't blow them apart
Take it easy.
Drive carefully.
"Alright, um..."
I'm not giving up on us.
You will.
"Just leave them on the, on the table."
Drive carefully everyone!
Thank God.
I thought they'd never leave.
Her grief runs deep.
I think Lindsay might be like a dam waiting to burst.
There is no right way to grieve.
And probably far more than five stages.
And the process itself is as complex as the people who experience it.
Especially if the loss is still a mystery.
Loaded with secrets.
"Um, your Dad's here."
Honestly... ..do I look fat on this?
"No, you, you look..."
Lovely.
As always.
"Thanks, Arlo."
You really have been so good to me.
I don't deserve it.
Of course you do.
"You know, I would do anything for someone going through this."
You know me and Jared used to get all these postcards from Mum at Christmas and birthdays.
"Yeah, I heard that."
We knew they were from Dad.
"'Cause he's got this really bad squiggly handwriting, but we pretended to go along with it just to make him feel better really."
It's kind of sweet.
In his own strange way I guess... ..he does love you.
"Isn't it, Laurie?"
"[ Drowners' ""A Button On Your Blouse"" playing ]"
How long have we been holding hands?
Huh.
Wasn't that fun?
[ Chuckles ]
Why don't you go spend some time with your friends now?
[ Gasps ] These kids are so happy.
They even gave me a nickname--
"""That lady who saved prom."" [ Laughs ]"
I even made a love connection.
"I found a lonely guy and a lonely girl,"
I put 'em together...
and now they're dancing.
It's a weird dance.
It's like they're trying to smother a fire between their crotch.
So what have you been doing since I lost you?
Gettin' crazy?
Yeah.
"No, I mean, I was."
But then I remembered that I left my purse over here so I came to find it.
That's the end of the story.
"Hey, it's early."
Let's go have some fun.
Go without me because I need to catch my breath after all the...
purse excitement.
No way!
We're a team!
"Also, you may have to rescue me in case anyone pulls me into a dance circle."
That is my biggest fear.
"Well, that and... [ Whispers ] clowns."
What about a dance circle made up of clowns?
She just loved the attention.
So ?
I opened your little time capsule.
Still as lame as the day we buried it.
"You removed the champagne bottle, breaking the glass jar in the process, didn't you ?"
"Okay, yeah."
I took the bottle.
The same bottle that was used to kill Patrick shortly afterwards ?
You're putting words in my mouth.
"It used to be Patrick's favorite, so I brought it to our hook up."
Remember this ?
Dubé champagne.
"Yeah, sure, great, we'll drink it after."
Come on.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Come on !
"I left the bottle on the floor, unopened."
You're only going after me because of my reputation.
A person's character does enter into an investigation.
Character ?
"I have a job, a condo, nieces that love me."
"I left high school, not like some of the people at the reunion."
"Oh, yeah, like who ?"
Take your pick :
"cheerleaders, band geeks, rockers, stoners, loners."
It's just like they never left.
"I mean, look at Dan."
He's still a total outcast.
Dan ?
Life insurance Dan ?
Dan Winslet.
"He'll never get a job, not even in the fields."
He can't even calculate how much a man would plough during an 8 hour shift.
"If in one hour, 8 men can do..."
He'd only be good at playing football!
- Addie!
- You stay here!
"Hey, you!"
Open it!
Open it or there'll be trouble!
"Don't hurt him, it's his birthday!"
"Yeah, and I have a short temper!"
"Adam, come out!"
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
"Don't do this, my dear son!"
"Open it now, you hear me?"
Addie!
"It's only me, your father isn't here."
You can open it.
Please!
What is it?
You've locked yourself in again?
"The folks from the Council were here yesterday as well, complaining that you must be brewing alcohol here secretly!"
You know what?
They can all go to hell!
What am I supposed to do with the apples?
Let them rot?
They're travelling with their houses!
"Gee, animal sculptures."
They must be art collectors.
"I just changed the number plate, and the colour as well."
"And you just play here, when we're clearly late already!"
We'll never make it to Kamenice like this!
"Boys, I'd like to introduce you to Ramases, he's on work experience."
"Hey, guys."
Cool office.
"I'm giving him a tour of the company, starting with the talking turds in the copy room and working up."
We should press on before we catch worms.
"Could I stay and play the jug game for a bit, please?"
"No, we're going to the grain store."
"Chop, chop!"
Have you thought about my request for a chair with back support?
"I have, and if the problem persists, I will take steps..."
It will - ..to hire a copier with a stronger back.
Right.
"I'm sure I'll manage, then."
Good-oh.
It's so bloody demeaning.
Even that gimpy work-experience kid is treated better than us.
You can say that again.
"He's got a sedan chair, look!"
Hup!
"Oi, Ramases!"
"It's Stylax and Marcus, the talking turds."
"Oh, hey, guys."
Is this sedan chair yours?
"It's my dad's, actually."
I sort of crashed my one taking it off-road.
Holy shit!
"I know, it was really stupid and I've learned my lesson."
"My dad's one's way bigger, though, if you guys need a lift."
All right.
Who's the flat-top?
This is Ramases.
He's Egyptian.
Hold this.
"If you find life so valuable, why not give a murderer what he deserves?"
For whom?
Who asked for this?
Arie.
-Arie hasn't asked anything.
It's us who wanted revenge.
-You owe it to your children.
They're 6 and 8 years old.
How does it benefit them if we kill a 60 year old man?
To warn them.
"When they'll be 30, they'll make their own stupid mistakes."
Because we set a bad example.
We have to get the ones who weren't caught.
And who will we bring back to life again by doing that?
Arie?
If we don't tell them that murder never pays... they won't learn anything from our war.
They don't want to learn from our war.
The only thing history teaches us is that we don't learn from it.
I want that!
"-No, me!"
Let me introduce my wife.
This is an old friend of mine.
Ab Spoelstra.
He suddenly dropped in.
I'm Tine.
-I'm Ab.
So sweet that you've already prepared everything.
They love a game of bite the cake.
"You'll stay here, won't you, Cees?"
They're counting on you.
He's so good with the children.
That was really funny how that guy smacked you.
Give him his rights.
Now that we're spending all this quality time together... let me tell you about your rights.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court oflaw.
"If you do not have an attorney, one will be assigned to you."
Do you understand all the rights I have read to you right now?
- Yes.
- Good boy.
Now shut up.!
- How's it look?
How's it look?
- It's beautiful.
Know what happens to pretty boys like you when they go to prison after the lights go out?
"""Oh, girlfriend.!"
"Oh, girlfriend.!"""
Shots fired.!
- Uncuff him now!
- What?
What the hell?
What in God's name?
"Have you lost your mind, young lady?"
I said uncuff Jack Hammond now!
"Come on, Miss Voss."
Put the gun down.
You don't know what you're doing.
This guy's brainwashed you.
Now come on.
"- Ned, get a shot of this!"
"- Natalie, stop embarrassing me."
"Do it, or I'll blow his brains out all over live TV."
"Miss Voss, don't do it."
Ha-ha!
Boom!
You suck!
"Yeah, this is better than a cruise."
"I know you're disappointed, but we should be here in case Cleveland needs us."
Even though our bags are already packed and our non-refundable tickets are right there.
And that taxi's waiting outside.
(honking) 'Ey!
You vashlooks order a cab?
"Well, we could just take a ride in the cab with our bags, see where it goes."
We at least owe it to our bags to put them in the cab.
"Screw it, let's go."
"I guess everything I do is for him, just to hear him say, ""I'm proud of you."""
Your father?
"No, Bradley Cooper."
"Well, we've made some progress."
You guys are out of your minds.
I'm going to take a shower.
Anybody want to take a shower?
All right.
I do.
This is ridiculous.
I don't belong here.
(ship's horn blares)
I belong on that cruise!
We're getting out of here.
And here's how...
CLEVELAND:
The orderlies' shift change is at 12:32 exactly.
"Tim, that's when you'll hack into the mainframe, disabling the security cameras."
(cracks knuckles)
(roars)
What's this noise are you outside?
What are you doing out so late?
- We have run away from there...
We are on our way to Delhi.
Run away!
What do you mean you have run away!
Have you gone mad!
What the hell is going on there?
I'll explain everything once I reach.
I told you to stay on for a few days!
Can't you understand that much?
Are you little children!
"Brother, please don't get angry...the warden."
What did she do?
"Sonu, tell me what happened?"
She got drunk and came in Chhoti's room...
Was trying to slip into her bed.
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
You both take care of yourselves...
Do you have money?
Yes.
"Call me as soon as your reach, I will come and get you."
"Here, gulp it down."
Johnny bhai.
Could you lend me some money?
I will return it soon.
Money?
If I had any money saved do you think I would have been stuck in this city.
I would have gone away to Mauritius long back!
I live off the dead!
I bury one corpse to get one meal!
I am surviving because people die in this city everyday.
She picks up the phone and calls from the house.
"If anybody was listening, they'd know everything."
"They'd know a package was leaving my house and they'd even have the time and flight number, thanks to her."
"As soon as I got home, I started cooking."
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.
I told my brother to keep eye on the stove.
All day long the guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.
"You see, I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy."
"Do you think you can come over here, fuck me, and leave?"
- Come on.
- You got someplace better to go?
Don't talk like that.
Come on.
- You all right?
"- Yeah, sure."
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
Do you believe me?
- That the last one?
- Yeah.
You lying son of a bitch.
I hate you!
Please stop feeding the dog from the table from the plate on top of it.
Stop it.
- I have to.
- You don't have to.
I got to go home.
"What do you mean, you got to go home?"
I've been carrying this all day.
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.
I got to go home and get my hat.
Very good.
"Well, normally I start with the cellar."
Why don't we go directly to the bedroom?
Did you forget?
I already confessed...
"- Right, we're even."
"- This way, please."
"- This is a marvellous home, Captain!"
- Thank you.
Did you buy it or have it built?
"I bought it, though I designed the landscape."
I congratulate you.
The lady's bath is ready.
Will she take it alone?
What did she say?
"Well, she wants to know if you're taking your bath alone."
But Maria sometimes simplifies things a bit too much.
Forgive her.
It must be difficult to handle so many baths for couples.
"No, thank you Maria."
I think I'll be able to maintain control... for at least the next five minutes.
"The lady will take a bath in five minutes, and by herself."
It's from Jean Louis.
- Urgent!
- Right.
"Don't tell me, it's an invitation to organize an orgy."
You're partially right.
What part?
"An orgy, organize or invited?"
The third part.
It's a party exclusively for me.
I know you understand me...
Keep talking.
Where did you go?
- Brown.
"- Yeah, how long?"
Two years.
Before you dropped out?
There you are.
They're looking for this.
Mainframe's connected to the computer.
So whatever's on this...
You said the codes were impossible to crack.
Unless you have the original cypher.
"But whatever they're looking for, it's on this, so can you?"
"Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it."
Who's this?
"Oh, it's the Director of Clandestine Operations Overseas."
Somebody's boss's boss's boss.
Somebody high up in the company.
Director Atwater.
Director Collins.
Templeman.
Keep going.
"Yeah, these are people being groomed for top slots in the corporation."
"Go back, go back."
I know that man.
That's my fucking boss.
Fifteen dossiers.
Fifteen broadcasts.
There it is.
"If I wanted to cripple the system in one fell swoop, these would be the 15 I'd start with."
"You kill these men today, you won't recognize the world when you wake up in the morning."
But they've already sent the broadcasts.
The world is full of mysteries.
"""Temporary physician's parking."" Right."
"Hey, nice one."
Idiots.
Why don't you learn how to drive?
Stop that.
"Sorry, Dad."
I...
"Look, Dr. Stegman is clearly not coming."
We've all got a lot to do.
Let's start.
He's got a heavy caseload.
You can't expect him here on the dot.
"As he has no neurological complaint, his mental condition... is irrelevant to this meeting."
"Come on, Brenda."
Let's start.
Incompetent system.
I should have just been issued a windshield sticker.
Check this out.
Boston.
General.
Why don't you go collect your welfare checks?
This is a hospital zone.
Look at him.
"How's the famous artist, Hook?"
He is stable.
I admitted Eleanor Druse yesterday.
Good-time Sally's back in town.
She's presenting with numbness of the right arm and possible neurological insults.
"What is this, her tenth admission?"
And that's just since I've been here.
"Sooner or later, the little girl who cries wolf is telling the truth."
- Servalan?
- I thought you said she was dead.
- TARRANT:
We did.
- But she's not.
She's very much alive.
"- You tricked me, Forbus."
"- No, Sleer, I assure you."
You did something to that last batch of Pylene-50.
I did nothing.
Nothing at all.
"Look, let me show you the test sample."
I'm going to cut off your drug supply for three days.
- That means you'll die about another 10%.
"- Oh, no."
"Please, don't do that."
"- Look, this is the test sample."
- I told you... (Groans)
I'm not interested.
"I'll teach you to obey me, Forbus, if I have to destroy all your skinny little body."
"If you need a witness, Commissioner, I can swear it was self-defence."
What are you doing here?
I followed you from the concourse.
Those two off-worlders seemed very anxious to find you as well.
They seemed to think they recognised you.
Really?
"And of course, Practor recognised you as well, didn't he?"
That's why you killed him.
"- What do you want, Leitz?"
- The Presidency.
Anything is possible.
"Well, after all, somebody has to take Practor's place."
"What is it with you, huh?"
"Ah, this fuckin' guy ain't ready."
I knew you weren't gonna be ready.
-You didn't bring coffee?
"-What do I look like, a fuckin' caterer?"
Frankie will make coffee.
Make coffee.
Thought you'd have one of your bitches in here.
"Yeah, I did."
Where the fuck is she?
"Always got these hot books around though, or a bitch, or somethin'."
What time is it?
-lt's 11:30.
We were supposed to be there by 9:00.
-l'll be ready in just a minute.
"Yeah, you're always fucking late."
You'd be late for your own fuckin' funeral.
What the fuck you looking at?
"Come on, make that coffee to go."
Let's go.
What the fuck you doing?
It's a joke.
A joke.
Put the fucking pot down.
Ya gonna take the coffee?
Stacks was always crazy.
"Instead of getting rid of the truck like he was supposed to, he got stoned went to his girlfriend's, and by the time he woke up, the cops had found the truck."
It was all over the television.
They even said they came up with prints off the wheel.
It was just a matter of time before they got to Stacks.
I gotta talk to you.
-Have a drink.
- I gotta get a new suit...
- Mine's covered in blood.
- Really?
Wow.
Ok.
- Yeah.
Great.
Thank you for coming.
It's been crazy.
Um.
"My credits cards were damaged in the accident, do you think you could help me pay the motel and I'll pay you back?"
"David, they weren't actually damaged."
You're broke.
You told me that last night.
"I just wish that you would, you know, tell me the truth when you were sober."
"Ok, the important thing to remember is this."
"In that nightmare yesterday, you were the only person I called."
"I'm looking for a man, answers to the name of Dashiell."
"Middle-aged, tall, pale, sickly, ambiguous sexuality, seriously anxious, probably consuming enormous amounts of alcohol while he's trying to comfort another man who's likely crying."
"Oh, and they're both covered with blood."
Have you seen him?
- Is this ok here?
- Yeah.
You're gonna go park?
Yeah.
Ow.
I think he was wearing a ring.
"I can still see it, just here."
- You look good.
- Thanks.
- It's gonna go well.
"- Yeah, I think it will."
- In the messenger center.
- Somebody was trying to send it...
- I've been looking all over for these.
"- I know, that's why..."
"- This is very serious, Jocelyn!"
I don't understand.
"Why you have these layouts... and why you're ""messengering"" them to someone."
"I wasn't the messenger, I was asked to return it."
- Someone left it there.
- Someone?
Maybe that someone is you.
And maybe you were planning... on sneaking them back into my drawer before you were discovered.
"- Sebastian, I'm not the Yuri."
- Interesting!
You're very defensive.
- I can't believe this!
- But I'll believe it... until you come up with another Yuri.
I'll keep my eye on you.
Watch your back... jag.
Over here...
- Over here.
- Where?
Over here.
I told you to never contact me again.
It's an emergency.
You helped me with Manolo's and I really need your help now...
This is different.
This goes deeper.
- How deep?
"- Fucking motherfucker... cock-sucker, fuck..."
sorry.
- It's my Tourett syndrome again.
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
"That would be easy for you, wouldn't it?"
"You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at est."
"[Sighs] No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan."
But I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave me.
Mr. Jennings.
Can I help you?
"As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can."
"- Have a seat, please."
- I won't be staying long.
What is it you want?
I want you to stay away from my daughter.
You want her to stop coming to church?
That's right.
That's between you and Paige.
"Well, I..."
I think you can help with that... and I think you will help with that.
"I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings."
It's a sanctuary.
I can't turn anyone away.
[Chuckling] That's the whole point of this place.
Is something wrong?
You took $600 from her.
I thought you knew about that.
We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve.
I-I'll write you a check right now if you want.
But... that's not why you're here.
"No, it's not."
"Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings?"
For $600?
For your daughter?
"You know, if there are other people in this town... who are feeling as... confused as I am right now..."
I'd sure like to hear it.
"The past few months, people have been coming up to me... and reporting that they've been seeing strange things."
I don't mean the town speed freak.
"I mean good, honest, church going people."
I've known these folks my entire life... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up.
Bringing what up?
It's hard to explain.
Weird lights.
"Strange phone calls, you."
I heard a crack...
A very strange sensation.
Reds eyes.
"""As a moth""."
Lights and calls phone strange.
You.
Seeing a UFO is one thing.
What do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
What is it?
My wife died two years ago.
She saw something.
Drew pictures.
Who showed you this?
It was right here.
There was only a foot or so
Between its head and that branch.
That makes it about... eight feet tall.
Yeah.
I was getting ready for bed and just.
Happened to glance out the window.
At first all I could see... were these two red eyes.
I kept looking at it.
"Far as I could tell, you just keep your goddamn mouth shut unless you're opening it to pour booze in."
And you cheat on your wife.
"That's all i knew about after, you asshole."
You goddamn son of a bitch.
"Goddamn teddy, vietnam."
"Goddamn million gooks dead, 50,000 americans."
Goddamn won the war.
What did he do when he came home?
After?
"Drink, fight, cheat on his wife."
I ain't no goddamn coward.
"I got goddamn medals out the ass, asshole."
Proves I'm a hero.
"God, bombs going off, buildings coming down."
I know exactly what to do.
"If it happened right now, if this bar blew up, I'd know exactly what to do."
"Kids, marriage."
That's where--that's where I suck.
That's where I really suck.
That shit... that scares the balls off of me.
"Here I am after, surrounded by booze and dead assholes."
Thanks.
Get up slow.
Ok.
This is how it's gonna go.
You're gonna take that bag of cash I saw earlier.
Yeah.
You're gonna hand it over to me.
"And if you so much as twitch a muscle while you're doing it,"
I'm gonna blow your goddamn head off.
- Capiche?
- Ok.
"I mean, we're writing a children's book, not how Joy mouse got her groove back."
"And then I said, ""middleton?"
"I thought you said wimbledon."""
Reminds me of the time I was invited to the duchess of... oh.
What?
Do I have something on my tooth?
"No, quite the opposite, actually."
Seems you have a tooth on your something.
Oh.
"Excuse me, won't you?"
Goodness.
"That woman's a bit of a disaster, isn't she?"
Perhaps you and I could go somewhere a little more private.
"I'd love to, but that disaster is my sister, and she needs my help."
Would you excuse me?
"- Honey, are you all right?"
- Are you hurt?
"I'm fine, just hideously embarrassed."
- Let me help.
"- Jill, what about the Earl?"
You took a tumble.
It's my turn to pick you up and dust you off.
"On your feet, cabbage."
She looks like a pirate.
All that's missing is a parrot on her shoulder.
All that's missing is my fist in your throat.
"Jill, that's so sweet."
"Let's save the smiles till we get home, shall we?"
Thank you.
There's the end of our story:
The sisters choose each other.
"Oh, I love the way we write."
- I will return another time.
- Don't go.
You haven't visited me for a long time.
Forgive me.
My health has been hateful.
Franz is away.
"All the royal houses of Europe have invited him to play, it seems."
Even Russia.
"Like most peasants, he has a weakness for crowned heads."
You may turn around.
Please sit.
Thank you.
Do you hear anything from Madame Sand?
- Will she be coming to Paris this year?
- I am no longer her friend.
She severed herself from Franz and me with no explanation.
"- You have her latest book, I see."
- Yes.
- Have you read it?
- I wouldn't touch such trash.
"Madame, last summer you gave me a letter."
"Yes, I took a chance... you would forgive me speaking the truth of my heart."
"In fact, I was appalled."
But I could not reject it entirely.
Something touched me.
"A phrase, like a tune one can't forget."
- Shall I remind you what you wrote?
- Do.
"""I am not full of virtues and noble qualities."""
"""I love, that is all."""
"""But I love strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."""
Imagine my surprise when I found that here.
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.
- How'd you do?
"- Well, I got an A."
- Professor Rosa...
"- Micky, please."
Is there a problem with my paper?
"Well, you found a more efficient method for finding true zero than Isaac Newton and that, my friend, is not so much of a problem as it is a major ass-kicking."
"Although Newton has been dead for over 250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight."
"So, is this some kind of a math club?"
"Don't be rude, people."
- Kianna.
- Fisher.
- Choi.
- Jill.
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.
"No, really?"
"Well, it's really simple, actually."
You play against the dealer.
You're given two cards.
Face cards are worth 10 points.
The closest to 21 wins.
"If you go over, you lose."
"If the dealer goes over, they lose."
It's the most popular card game in the world.
It's a game with memory.
"Cards drawn are the past, ones to come are future."
"And the best part, it's beatable."
Are you talking about counting cards?
No.
And no one leaves until I check surveillance.
"Yes, ma'am."
"All right, let's go."
Go?
No.
We got this.
"No, clearly, you're shorthanded."
"I appreciate your help, Agent DiNozzo, but airport surveillance is for TSA and our eyes only."
"That's Homeland's rules, not mine."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
"Look, delays are bad enough, but now the bathrooms?"
Do you know who I am?
"There's something going on here, and you are not telling us."
"Folks, please, there's no cause for alarm."
Passenger just had a medical issue in there.
Excuse me.
I'm a doctor.
Can I help?
Ah.
"thank you, Doctor."
"No, we've got everything under control."
That's a sharp suit.
Kudos to your tailor.
"But... everyone, can I have your attention?"
"Thank you for your patience, but we do have a medical emergency, so in the spirit of the holiday, can we all just have a good wish--"
"- Give it a rest, you pretty boy!"
"- Excuse me,"
I don't think that's necessary.
"You cram it, too!"
"Appreciate the help, Doc."
- Nice suit.
How fortunate I'm here.
I'd like to help you.
"Let me back in there so I can bash him on the nose, that's all!"
"Quite the little Tartar, aren't you?"
Always ready to flare up.
"Oh, I like that."
"Here, here."
This is just to prove that I want to help you.
"The rainbow is wide and long, lvy."
"- Oh, now wait."
I better get home.
"- No, no, no."
"Ivy, my darling, you belong with the immortals."
Come with me to Mount Olympus.
Drink nectar with the gods.
Sing the ancient songs of pleasure.
And put Athena and Diana to shame.
"Oh, you aren't half of one with the words, aren't you?"
"And don't be frightened of me, will you, lvy?"
"When a botanist finds a rare flower, he shouts his triumph, doesn't he?"
Are you one of them?
"You like a man who sees a girl and makes up his mind, don't you?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Oh, she doesn't know what I'm talking about."
"- Please, sir."
"- But you'll find out, won't you?"
- Please.
- You'll find out what it means.
"Please, sir."
"The London Post, Sir Charles."
"Oh, thank you."
"And one for you, mademoiselle."
And we got saved by a girl.
"We might as well cut our nuts off, and turn them in to the dude sheriff, 'cause we don't deserve these badges that we call testicles."
We should just give our balls to that guy.
- Yeah.
"- I mean, he's a man."
He probably has three balls.
He definitely had horrible B.O.
I think that's a sign of giant balls.
- Rank.
- Lucky.
Testosterone stinks.
I smell like flowers.
These hands of mine are so soft.
It's like Chinese silk ribbon.
It's weird.
They've never done anything manly in my whole stupid life.
Not one thing.
I pet a llama once.
That's the manliest thing I've ever done.
"That was cool, though."
We went to that petting zoo.
All those cute ducks.
They were scary.
"Guys, this is what I'm talking about."
We're going to petting zoos when we should be slitting the throats of those animals.
"Yeah, we should slit throats of animals."
"We should be hunting or, like, pulling marlins out of the ocean or, like, doing..."
What do men do?
- We should go camping.
- Yes.
- At the Brianna concert.
- Yes.
"This band not only wants to re-invent the wheel, but wants to pound spikes into it, as well."
- She's awfull.
- Yeah monkey face.
"It would be disastrous, and would cause irrecoverable damages to"
Utah's women and children.
"Hi, we're at Nine Inch Nails !"
Fuck you.
- He's tellin' me there's no god !
"- There's no heaven, there's no hell."
All you are is fucking worm food.
Might as well face that shit right now.
"The only reason human beings created god, god did not create man, man created god."
I just scored front row tickets.
- Really?
"- Hello, my life is good."
Woo !
He keeps saying :
"""I'm gonna be in Trent's jock strap."""
"""I'm gonna be in his underwear."""
You know what my dream is?
"I'm gonna lick trent when he comes down into the audience, and he will."
- I'm not a big nine inch nails fan.
- That's ok.
But i wouldn't mind licking him.
"Keep him, away."
"Hey God,"
Why are you doing this to me?
"Am i not living up, to what i'm supposed to be?"
Why am i seething with this animosity?
"Hey God, i think you owe me a great big apology."
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
He's a consultant.
I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna.
He can't have a hobby?
!
"Excuse me, I have to pee."
"Or is that implausible, as well?"
!
"It's nice to have another couple to hang with, isn't it?"
"All right, guys, you have to go back."
I can't afford you.
"No, don't send us away; we love you."
"I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent."
"But, Penny, you look so good in us."
"Damn it, the shoes are right."
"Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless."
"What do you got for me, wildebeest?"
I think they're on to me.
The story's starting to fall apart.
Calm down.
Everything's going to be okay.
We may have to kill her.
"Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone."
Where are you now?
In the bathroom.
"Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests."
What's the problem?
They're just asking me all sorts of questions I can't answer.
Just change the subject.
I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya's parents.
What?
!
They said something about going there this summer.
Cleveland?
You're all in grave danger!
There are Somali pirates... they're gonna attack... any minute now... so we need to be prepared... (clears throat)
"♪ Ow, she's a brick house ♪"
(gunshot)
"Give us the gold records, and nobody gets hurt until after we get the gold records."
Nevah!
Don't worry.
I'll blow these pirates away with the power of the funk!
(strums chord)
♪ Funk powerrrrr!
♪
It's okay.
He wasn't one of the original members!
(smattering of applause)
"(gunfire, panicked screaming)"
(explosion)
"Oh, Cleveland!"
"So, you decided to go on the cruise without me, huh?"
"Well, to make it up to me..."
"Roberta, cover your ears."
"I want two oral sins when I want them, even after a flight, and no reciprocals."
"Get us out of this, and you can have one with no reciprocals and three egg cracks."
Mm.
Can I have an egg crack now?
Crack.
Ooh...
"Oo-hoooo, there's egg all down my shoulders."
Shiver.
So gooey.
"Okay, stay here, I'll be back."
(shudders):
"-Oh, bless you for that lovely inspiration."
"Oh, my baby, my baby."
would you Iike some pop?
Honey.
Pop?
Not with my nerves tonight.
"Scotch for me, please."
Grape.
You haven't asked me how I got away from school before the spring term ended.
I thought you'd volunteer that information if you wanted to tell me.
-You thought I'd been fired?
-No.
I thought you might have resigned.
"Oh, I was so exhausted by all I'd been through, my nerves broke."
"I was on the verge of lunacy, almost."
So Mr. Graves--
Mr. Graves is the high school superintendent.
Thank you.
He suggested I--
I take a leave of absence.
I couldn't put all those details into the wire.
This buzzes right through me and feels so good.
-would you Iike another?
-One's my limit.
You haven't said a word about my appearance.
-You look just fine.
-God love you for a liar.
daylight never exposed so total a ruin.
But you-- You put on some weight.
Yes.
You're just as plump as a little partridge.
It's so becoming to you too.
"Come on, you guys."
We went on one date.
I know how much you guys like to gossip about everything but we don't want to talk about this at all.
As far as you're concerned we're not even dating.
"- Okay, is that how you feel, Bursk?"
- I was instructed to feel that way.
This day is so perfect.
"I mean yeah, sometimes I do think about a different ring"
"Oh, because the diamond Justin's got you is so tiny and ridiculous?"
"- No, I love it."
"- Oh, yeah."
Me too!
It's so perfect!
No.
It's just because I kind of wish I had my grandmother's ring.
What happened to it?
"My boyfriend Trent, he pawned it to buy protein powder."
I loved my grandma.
It's really all that I had left of her...
"Oh, I know what this is."
You're trying to manipulate me to try to go get that ring back by using your sad face.
"But I'm sorry, sweetie."
It's not gonna work on me.
I'm not buying it.
No!
We're gonna get you that ring back!
Danny is such a jerk.
From now on nobody named Danny allowed in this bar.
My name is Danny.
Oh.
"I'm sorry, man."
I was talking about my room-mate.
Uncle...
Perhaps I have worn it too long...
General...
It looks like the kid is telling the truth.
We just received report that
Kwon Yul's entire army moved out to Soon-chun last night.
The contents of that letter are true?
And there was my father-in-law's report as well.
He paid one thousand heads to Jin Lin for it.
It has to be true.
Yi Soon-shin has left Noryang open?
Is this assign from god?
Send a report to General Shimazu.
We must pass through Noryang tonight at full speed and strike Yi Soon-shin from the rear!
"Yes, sir!"
Yoshihiro!
Aye!
Check the assault team for readiness once again.
They have to be right there on Yi Soon-shin's command ship the moment that we attack his fleet and throws them into confusion.
Is that understood?
Aye!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
My son!
We've decided to let you live.
"If we win the battle, your lives will be spared."
You will be our oarsmen!
Row the oars on the ships that will destroy Yi Soon-shin!
No way!
You want me to dirty my hands and row a Japanese ship?
It's a leopard.
Around here?
He's probably lost and hungry.
Thinks he has supper up that tree.
Over there.
That's Sally he's got treed.
"Ok, fellas, let's get that leopard."
Wait a minute.
This is leopard territory.
A gunshot could bring on 30 or 40 more of them.
Yeah.
Five of us could never handle that many deadly leopards.
But what about Sally?
"As long as she's in the tree, she's ok."
Jack and I will tranquilize the leopard.
Quietly.
"Ok, we'll keep you covered."
"Sergeant, you follow right behind Mr. Makula."
"Captain, I think it might be safer for all of us if you gentlemen stayed under cover."
"Look, we just wanna help."
What difference does it make what we do?
The difference is we're using tranquilizer darts.
You're using real bullets.
I have no desire to be a battle casualty.
Come on.
"Well, now, what have we here?"
Who is that fancy looking chimp?
"Why it must be Sally, the world-famous astro-chimp."
- What are they doing?
"- Sergeant, we're moving in."
Hold it.
"Well, if that's the case, we better keep pretty far away from her."
"You two,"
"How graceful, it is the first time that you attend an operation?"
"Yes, Doctor."
Well.
In first row.
"And that nobody dares to faint itself when begins to sprinkle the blood, or some other organic liquid."
Far from it that it is happened to you to vomit.
-The others can remain back.
"-Thanks, Doctor."
Wash the hands.
I do not want to impure people in the operating room.
What?
"Good morning, Professor."
Everything is to point for the operation.
Well.
These must be the novices.
"You have explained to them that if they must faint, they do that backwards?"
"Because when I operate, short what it is put to me ahead."
They have been warned already.
"Italia, the towel."
Firm.
Moroni.?
Again here?
How he is that?
"Professor, to attend to an operation hers it is like attending a concert of Rubinstein."
Slight ball.
"Cicchirini, you have found to which it surpasses to you."
"Well, we are going to operate."
We go.
You.
"Here, here and here."
"Quickly, we go."
"yeah, i guess you're right."
i wonder why harley would have lied about skipping school.
"- well, maybe... he's hiding something."
- huh.
harley has a shirt with his name on it?
!
he has a job!
that little bastard.
- literally.
- hey.
what does he need money for?
"i mean, if he has a job, then i should be getting..."
- you should ge getting what?
"- well, i should just know about it because he's my son, and i should know about everything that he's doing."
"- mm-hmm. so if you knew about this job... you wouldn't buy all that needless crap on his credit account, ask him to bring home pop, cheez whiz, and lotto tickets?"
that wouldn't happen?
"- [sighs, taps foot]"
"- ah, champ."
they got you stacking toilet paper.
"- merry christmas, uncle bob."
and i'm... [sighs] i'm sorry about tim's black eye.
"- oh, he'll be fine."
"i'm not too merry, though."
marge left me.
- how come?
"- oh, it's nothing."
she'll be back... i hope.
"anyway, i'm here for you."
is this what you wanted?
"- yeah. thanks for doing this, uncle bob."
"i mean, they wouldn't send the bill out to a kid."
"- hey, champ, you don't have to do this."
- So?
- So everything's goin' great.
Terrific.
Beautiful.
"I'll need a few more days, though."
"The boys think we oughta cool it for a while, just to make sure there's no heat."
You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?
I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a policeman.
"Look, I'm levellin' with you."
I need a little more time.
"My people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch, that's all."
It has to be by the end ofthis week.
"Look, Charnier, you gotta be reasonable."
It's your problem.
"Well, it's your problem, too."
So nice to have seen you again.
We found a set ofworks on the kid driving the sports car.
- His girlfriend's in the back.
She's dead.
- Give the car a toss.
- I say we keep sitting' on Boca.
"- Jimmy, give it up."
It's all over with.
"Ifthere was a deal, it's gone down by now."
We blew our warrants and we blew our cover.
"Listen, I know the deal hasn't gone down."
I know it.
I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.
"Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop."
Break it up!
There were certain errors in your report of the incident.
Don't tell me the guys in Washington ref used?
Those guys decided to award the Congressional Medal to Drake and the Distinguished Service Cross to the officer with him.
How's that?
The congressional.
Won't you look pretty standing up there?
Maybe he'll even let you sit on his piano.
- With the newsreels grinding.
- ln Technicolor.
What's the gripe?
That's the best they've got.
You shouldn't have done it!
Sometimes you go soft-headed.
I'd like to see a blond do that to me.
- What's the gimmick?
- Basic grammar.
- l'll bet she talks beautif ully now.
- Think so?
You look like the first time you jumped.
"Look, kid, if it's trouble...."
"Yeah, we had some, didn't we?"
"Not like this, though."
Quit living inside there.
If you can't tell me-- l can tell you.
I just don't want any medal.
is that all you don't want?
- Captain Murdock?
- On the hoof.
Camera boys would like shots of you two.
Could you come out?
You only stop here f or 5 minutes.
- The city of brotherly love?
You came over here to tell me you told me so?
Yeah.
And I wanted to show you how much nicer I am.
That's because you want to make out with me.
"Uh, not in here."
"It's a little intimate, you know."
And it would be a little difficult since I can't sit on that bed.
Maybe I'll just sit...
Over here.
I feel like such a loser.
I have no girlfriends.
"I don't have any friends either, but I'm not a loser and neither are you."
"It's not that I'm feeling sorry for myself, but..."
I miss my room.
I miss my bed.
"I miss my pets, my friends, my family."
"And most of all, I miss my virginity."
"Well, if you want, you can have mine."
(CHUCKLING)
Shut up.
I knew you were going to say that.
"So, what were you girls going to do at your sleepover, anyway?"
Talk about you.
I told you that's my favorite subject.
We can talk about me all you want.
"Cecilia, you are a heck of a mah-jongg player."
Played growing up.
I'm still lost.
"Next time, poker."
"Oh, I don't gamble, but if you make it penny poker,"
I might be willing to lose a buck or two.
"Put the phone away, Dylan."
I'll be right there.
I don't want Chris to see this.
"-Well, what's wrong?"
What is it?
-Shh.
You're convinced that it's genuine?
I don't know.
"No, not really, I suppose."
But I have made a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in The Ritual.
You would want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
Might be best to have a man with experience.
Maybe someone who's spent time in foreign missions.
"I understand, Your Excellency."
Let's see who's around.
"In the meantime, I'll call you as soon as I know."
"Thank you, Your Excellency."
"Well, he does know the background."
I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist.
"There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway."
What about the exorcist?
Have you any ideas?
How about Lankester Merrin?
Merrin?
I had a notion he was in Iraq.
I read he was working on a dig near Nineveh.
"You're right, but he's finished."
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.
"What's he doing there, teaching?"
He's working on another book.
"Don't you think he's too old, Tom?"
You're broadcasting it that to Akan!
Enough!
Enough.
"Even if I did believe you, you still have to..."
Oh!
"Henry, no!"
No!
You brought them to my lab!
I trusted you!
"Henry, please kill me?"
Akan won't.
"He'll make me live in this straightjacket of rotten, smelly skin!"
"What the fuck was I thinking, that Akan's toy robot was my friend?"
"Thank you, Henry."
"Fuck you, too, but mostly thanks."
"My lab's compromised, but I can build a new one using Akan's equipment when we go get your wife... together, right?"
"Hey, put that on the wall."
"If I can't have my lab, no one's having her."
"Now, don't lose this."
"Fuck you, Akan."
And don't change your channel.
We're coming right over.
"Right, I counted six vehicles."
That's at least 35 men.
We've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive.
"Also, there's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals."
I just wanna get it out there right now that I'm straight as an arrow.
Got it?
Here they come.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
Now.
Looks like she didn't suffer.
Sometimes...
"For some, death is a kind of deliverance."
"That's it, a gun shot, 12 gauge... almost point blank She died on the spot,"
And... the young black man?
"At first glance, from what the ambulance guy said.."
brain dead... most probably.
"As for the lady... she'II be on the table around 1 1 :00am, so my report should be on your desk around 3:00pm."
"I can send it to montreal, if you prefer."
No big deal.
"We'II take it, to hell with the montreal guys."
It's a change from horse theft and conjugal violence.
"Are you sure, Gary?"
"Yeah, sure."
alright then.
"We'II talk around 3:00, 3:30."
Perfect.
Bye.
What more do we have here?
"There are 3, 4 witnesses inside, there's this."
The neighbors say it belongs to the victim.
There's this.
Three cartridges.
"One was found near the victim, another here, in the grass."
"One is part of those over there, probably shot at martial."
How is he?
Not so good.
Quite a shock.
Anything on what started it?
"Yeah, it's all over there."
It started here alright.
"could be the young black guy, we found his bicycle."
Why would he call me?
"Even if he calls, I'm not ready to talk to him."
Please.
Don't get furious.
"Even when he had was blind, he was peaceful."
Now everything has turned upside-down.
Why are you telling me this?
Varun left for Kanyakumari all of a sudden.
He didn't share any further details.
He has not been picking my calls either.
I'm confused.
And worried.
So I called you.
"Sorry, aunt."
Don't call me hereafter regarding him.
I'll get it repaired.
"This Alphonse can fix all phones, don't worry."
Okay.
I'll leave.
Bye.
Welcome.
- Did you get any information?
No call from the number you mentioned got completed.
From Manoj's number?
Yes.
"Unless the call gets completed, I can't find the number Manoj has been dialling."
I checked the date you mentioned.
"After the 17th, there are no incoming or outgoing calls to and from the number."
"But before the 17th, calls have been made and received to and from a specific number."
I eve have it written down somewhere.
Here it is.
7599... 447333.
You'll leave her alone?
- Yeah!
Meltem said you know me?
"Yeah, we have a mutual acquaintance."
This is getting exciting.
I know your father.I'm his partner.
Shit.
"- Hey, don't worry."
I'm here alone.
Let me go.
"Let her go, will ya!"
"- Shut up, okay?"
I'm not going back.
- You know you're father's almost cracking up.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh man.
Shit.
Want some chewing gum?
"Here, they make the best bubbles."
What kind of cop are you anyway?
A new reform-oriented generation.
We're civilian friendly and practise painless police brutality.
Hey?
Are you gonna tell me what happened back then?
I heard about your mother's accident.
My father totally cracked up.
He just couldn't understand why it had to happen to him.
"There was always a reason, a motive."
"Hey, I got so sick of hearing that crap."
Then he started observing me even more than ever.
He'd secretly watch me on my way home from school...
"I didn't want to run away, but he nearly smothered me with his love."
The same reason why she wanted to fly around the world... so she didn't have to deal with me.
Why are you telling me this?
You should be telling her.
Greg!
This is coffin talk.
"You know, you're critical of your mom, but you're the one who's thinking of herself right now."
You're acting just like her.
"So, this is it, Greg."
This is where your life ends.
"Sweetheart, this is your chance to have a real conversation with your mother."
Fine.
I've never been able to get through to her.
At least you know how to touch her.
Hey.
Everything okay?
"Oh, my God."
So good!
I know it's none of my business...
Here's where you stop talking.
- ...but if you want my opinion...
- I don't.
...medication has done wonders for my step-kids.
"- Viv, I am not gonna..."
- I get it.
"I had my doubts about it going in, too."
"But those kids were totally out of control, and once I started taking these,"
I found them much easier to handle.
"So, these pills help you smile through the pain?"
I feel nothing.
Mm.
"So, turns out Anna-Kat doesn't need drugs..."
We do.
"I know where my life is going, and I want you to go with me."
"I'm not saying I want you to move in right now but I don't want to buy this place unless, at some point you could see yourself moving in."
"So, what do you think?"
I can't do this.
Okay.
"Well, if it's too fast, I guess we can always just..."
I can't do any of this.
I mean what you're saying and what you're offering is what every girl wants.
It's what I always wanted.
It's just...
You don't want it with me.
Okay.
I have a question.
"Is there any way we could dial it back to before, when we were just sleeping together because I don't know, I felt like that gelled."
Babe?
It was nice meeting you.
Thank you so much for a lovely evening.
You too.
Good night.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
You forget something?
"Yeah, I did."
Really?
What did you forget?
This.
You came all the way here at 11:00 at night to bring me back a promotional pen?
Yeah.
I thought I should just come up with some really great excuse to get over here.
"That's how it's done, isn't it?"
Sometimes.
"Look, I can't stop thinking about you."
It's a problem.
He's smart.
He's motivated.
He's for real.
"He's not gonna make babies and not take care of them, or run the streets messing up his life."
He's gonna make something of himself.
"And here you come-- white, so you gotta be right-- and take one of the few... decent men we have left after jail, drugs and drive-by."
That is what Nikki meant about you up in our world.
"There's only one world, Chenille."
That is what they teach you.
We know different.
l-l don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
You wanna be a friend ?
Don't just be here to be here.
Open up your pretty brown eyes and look the hell around.
[Baby Continues Crying]
Excuse me.
"[Derek] Come on, Sara, this is for your audition."
Come on.
"No, no, no."
You're not attacking it.
"You're not working it, okay ?"
Come on now.
I'll get it right the next time.
You don't have time.
You gotta get it right now.
- l can't work like this.
- Like what ?
"Like this, with you dictating to me."
Allright.
Let's take a break.
"I'm sorry. lt's just that the audition's next week, and everything is so messed up at school."
"[crusher] hey, Tia."
We got you some cold hotcakes.
She ain't here.
Hope she didn't go looking for Tony without us.
"Yeah, she needs us."
[Tia] Tony?
Crusher?
Muscles?
Rocky?
- Dazzler?
- [ Alfredbleats]
Alfred.
"Alfred, what'sthematterwith me?"
Where am I?
"Alfred, find the earthquakes."
[bleating]
Listen to me.
[bleating] [hoof steps approaching]
[bleating]
[sickle] what kind of place is that?
[victor] that is an underground plutonium processing plant.
Translate that into financial terms.
Plutonium is more valuable than gold.
That's why I like scientists.
"They're always discovering new, expensive things."
It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads.
I suppose you're going to have Tony
Split an atom bomb or something.
In effect Yes
"Well, I didn't count on killing anybody."
Especially not us.
It will never go that far.
I have detailed two of my units to General Gómez.
- We are too weak to...
- Are you afraid of a bandit?
I am a soldier.
Please don't forget that.
It would be insane to underestimate a man like Carrasco.
"Without reinforcement, I can't perform my duty."
"Señor Presidente, what about giving me part of the militia?"
- You can't have anyone.
- Why not?
- I need them to fix your mistakes.
- That's enough now.
That's enough.
This won't get us any further.
"That's enough, Silveira."
"- I'll think about it, General."
"- Thank you, General."
Señor Presidente.
"He's a coward, but he knows what he wants."
"And, most of all, he wants power."
"And you don't, dear friend?"
That will be them.
All right.
"There's no need for me to worry, is there?"
You have inspected everything?
- Read this.
- What is it?
What has Carrasco got to do with that village?
- We'll claim that it was him.
- And set the people against him.
I see.
"Silveira, I don't care how you do it, but I want you to get rid of this man, is that clear?"
-Are you serious?
It's the middle of the night.
"-I feel really bad, that's all."
"I haven't been in touch, you know, since that night."
"I think we both got a bit carried away, didn't we?"
"Well, I know."
"It was... like a cheap 1 950s farce with underwear, and husbands and hiding in cupboards, but at least we kept our heads in the end and didn't actually do anything, so...."
"Anyway, top and bottom of it is I just want you to know this..."
Bob and I decided to get back together again.
"Well, that's fantastic."
"Really great, Irene."
I'm thrilled to hear that.
"Well, hopefully great, we'll see."
I just hate to think that that made you feel... in any way....
-Rejected?
"-God, is that what you feel?"
-No.
"No, of course not."
No way.
"-'Cause, you know..."
"I'll always have a soft spot for you, Gil."
-It's just....
-What's happening here?
-Is everything okay?
-Bob?
Of course it's okay.
It's fine.
-Will you stop worrying and go back to bed?
-Wondered where the hell you'd gone.
For goodness sake.
"Look, I'll tell you later."
"Now, let's just leave him in peace."
"He's had a poor first impression of me, I fear."
"Before I meet him again, I want him to be convinced of my complete sincerity."
well?
What do you think?
"Look, you know him."
How will he respond?
I can't imagine any man resisting this prose.
It would melt the alps.
"But tell me, why do you pounce on our poor Chopin?"
"My dear, he's got one foot in the grave."
"No, no."
We shall all be in our graves soon enough.
But Chopin is eternal.
The only permanent thing about him is his cough.
(Duke) Ah.
- AII right.
"- Thank you, my friend."
"Madame Sand, will you delight us with your company on a hunt?"
"I must decline, Your excellency."
My maid is fitting me for a dress this afternoon.
A dress?
(piano transcription of Beethoven's Sixth continues)
(laughter and absorbed chatter)
- Quick!
- (fiinaI chord)
Perfect!
marvellous.
"darling, George proposes a game of croquet."
excellent idea.
Chopin will join us.
"Oh, no."
please excuse me.
"He's our man, Leo."
"OK, so he disliked Dave Stubbs' world view?"
What about the others?
Why not?
Why stop at one?
Especially if you have a supposed philosophical justification for it.
I read his articles.
All that struff about the universe being indifferent to pain and suffering.
"And there being no point in using terms like ""good"" and ""evil""."
You remember the piece I told you about?
This is a guy who sees no objection to people suffering if it is necessary for the production of a great man.
I don't know.
Hello?
Tom?
It's Nikki.
Is this a bad moment?
"Ah, no worse than usual."
You sound like you're in a train station.
"Yeah, there's Lots of people coming and going here."
Listen.
The paper in Dave Stubbs' stomach.
It's an article he wrote for Ethics Today.
"Before he was buried alive, I think he was forced to swallow it."
Who would want to make him eat his own words?
The creep who doesn't need a crutch.
You shouldn't be using that in here.
It's police business.
Tom?
Where are you?
I'll tell you later.
I've gotta go.
sorry.
I tried to kill a police officer in India by planting a bomb in his car.
"It happened because of a girl and a boy,"
"I got scared of getting lynched there, so I came to Malaysia."
Just a joke!
"It's not a joke, bloody fools!"
It really happened.
"Come on brother-in-law, where's my sister?"
- My son-in-law.
- Son-in-law?
Oh God!
I got wedged!
What if they come to know I chased this girl?
My brother-in-law will break my back.
"They both were in love there, why are these two marrying here?"
"He's no ordinary man, he'll not give up so easily."
Where could he be now?
Can you guide me to this address?
This is the place.
"By the way, you are...?"
I too don't know when will I come.
I don't know what had happened to me.
I don't know why I'm here.
What's going on here?
I invited you.
He's my friend Kalyan from India.
He's my fiance.
I'll put handcuffs if I get you not shake hands with you.
"Even if you refuse, I'll shake hands with you."
"He's a memory loss patient, he's here for treatment."
He'll stay with us from now.
Okay dear.
"No need to feel sorry, I'm very happy."
"Are we ready, Baron of Luxor?"
Everything is set.
It's enough to take out the entire mausoleum itself.
We just need to retile it now.
The time has finally come...
"Tonight, we will be freed from her spell!"
Her rule has been disastorous for the empire
Her desire for peace has held us back
Only domination and subordination exists between us and Terrans.
Coexistence is but a fantasy.
We must take back the future of our race.
Even if that means-
Who's there?
!
Run!
Those moves...
Are you one of us?
!
Seth-chan!
I'll be fine!
Just hurry and tell the Duchess of Kiev!
R-right!
Impertinent girl!
Will Seth-chan be all right?
"So long, girl."
Hurry to the port.
Make the final arrangements before pests arrive.
As you wish.
I know this will not remain forever
"However, it's beautiful"
"Your eyes, hands, and your warm smile"
They're my treasure
Come in.
I was a physics professor at Cornell.
Tenured.
You can look me up.
One day I started hearing voices.
The voices became messages.
"Before long, I was fully convinced that I was receiving... predictions of disaster from outside intelligences."
"But you were, weren't you?"
"John, I had tapes of their voices."
"I knew a building was going to blow up, and I tried to prevent it... but no one listened."
What happened?
People died.
Many people died.
"I was investigated, almost arrested."
My wife divorced me.
My kids... stopped speaking to me.
Do you know what four years in a psychiatric hospital can do to you?
Everything... gone.
"Oh, you'll never understand their messages."
You'll misinterpret them.
I did.
It almost destroyed me.
"In the end, it all came down to just... one simple question."
Which was more important... having proof... or being alive?
Trust me.
I turned away years ago... and I've never looked back.
Didn't you need to know?
We're not allowed to know.
"It's me, Cyrus."
"John, is that you?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's me."
Now I want to return the favor.
What do you think that is?
"No idea, but, you know, we should probably bag it and search for Amanda's prints."
"Abbs, I think we may have found something."
"Me, too."
I found Amanda Kane.
I downloaded the onboard surveillance footage from the last cruise.
I found her wandering through the casino.
The guard's coming back.
"Abby, send me what you've got now."
"Hold on, wait."
It looks like the fiance on land did have a rival at sea.
Amanda met a man on the ship.
The guard's at the door.
"Abby, get out of there now."
Do we have an I.D. on our shipboard Romeo?
"Not yet, but I ran the fingerprints on the lucite tube."
They're Amanda's.
"Guys, check out the body language."
She's not in love.
She's afraid.
Got him.
Our mystery man is Roman stone.
He works here on the ship.
Casino croupier.
Maybe Amanda was tracking an illegal gambling operation.
- Roulette.
It figures.
It's a punk game.
- Sounds like you speak from experience.
Strictly a Texas hold'em gal.
That puts you in the leadoff spot.
It's not the first time either.
"He was arrested 5 years ago-- intimidation, embezzlement."
"He's got his hooks into your sergeant, too, for that matter."
"I'd watch out, if I were you."
"Well, they certainly met in London."
Rather more than that.
They had dinner together after the meeting.
Spencer's taken him very much under his wing.
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
Excuse me.
[Ring]
Foyle:
Mr. Lane.
Ian:
You've got my boy locked up.
"Well, he ran away."
He was off to London.
He was afraid of you!
He's no criminal.
"Well, assault, drunk and disorderly, skipped bail, did borstal--August to November last year."
That was then.
It hasn't been easy for him living on his own with me.
He lost his mother when he was 9.
She ran off.
It's just been two of us.
"And yes, he mixed with the wrong set and became a cropper with the law."
You people never forget.
Won't let him forget neither.
"It's a bit more than that, isn't it?"
"He was seen at the hotel on the night of the murder, which means he could easily have been the one who took the gun and shot Mrs. Ellis."
He never shot anyone.
Cavemen are less primitive than you.
I'm not a flight attendant.
"You're not like that, you just got swept away."
I hope you're not back together.
"Shut up, both of you."
I haven't slept a wink in four days.
I'm going to shower and then I have to talk to you.
- About what?
- You can't shower.
- Why not?
- You're in mourning.
It's forbidden!
You can stink as much as you want.
I'm going to shower.
"Give her a break, okay?"
"Why don't you shower, too?"
I promise I won't tell Raziya.
And Dad knew all these years?
"I told you, they only just got tested, he just found out-."
How can that be?
What did...
Mom...
How?
What did she do when...
"I don't know, and it won't help to ask."
I never cease to be amazed at how little I know that loser who calls himself Dad.
And you believe his crap?
"He makes up bullshit to get us off his back forever, blood tests, my ass."
He should get an Oscar for his performances.
"A Pulitzer Prize for a sick mind, the scumbag."
We have to get the house ready tor tomorrow's guests.
I need pictures of Mom.
I don't like what he shows me.
"I know, but you have to try now."
We need to find him.
You don't understand.
"I have tried myself, but I can get nothing."
Please.
Alright.
Good.
Now concentrate.
Try again.
I saw a river.
Zaddik?
Is there a river nearby?
"Yes, just to the East."
"Alright, let's go."
"McKay, stay here and help Beckett!"
"- Medical research, not really my thing."
- And hunting Wraith?
"I mean, I could stay help Beckett."
Never could get into biology.
This is too much information about the human body.
"One time, when I was an undergrad, I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical conditions, before I had to drop the class."
Really?
Yeah.
"Believe it or not, back then I was a bit of a hypochondriac."
"You know, this does require a certain amount of concentration."
What?
Am I bothering you?
Maybe I'll go get some air.
This must be the river she saw in her vision.
Assuming she's telling the truth.
"Just cos there's another Wraith, doesn't necessarily mean you can trust her."
"Oh,yeah,I am,but Petty's not."
Stay there.He could still show up.
Where the hell are you?
"Till you hear back from me,do not move."
Petty.
- You know me?
- A friend of mine did.
Give me your hands.
You probably won't want to move now.
Now give me your gun and your phone.
I've never been on a stakeout before.
This isn't a stakeout.It's a waste of time.
Hauser say why he thought Petty was coming here?
"Well,transparency isn't one of Hauser's strong suits."
I just pictured him in a transparent suit.
It's pretty gross.
"Drop the knife.Get on the ground,face down."
You with the guy in the suit?
You are.
Aren't you just a peach?
There you go.
Where is he?
How about we just cut the cop to psychopath chitchat and you tell me what you want?
I want my bombs back.
The one in the bags or the one in the cemetery?
Your friend is dead.
What do you want?
I want to know what happened to me.
A week ago I went to sleep a stone's throw from where we're standing now.
"The next thing I know,it's what,2012?"
And I wake up lying on the floor of a tomb.
"Tell me how that's possible,and I'Il tell you anything you want to know."
"Look, we know that having a deep pocket means that sometimes you get subjected to extortion."
It happens.
But for them to saddle up a child-- the child of a suicide victim--
Where does it stop?
"Well, at the end of this case,"
I hope it stops there.
You can go... prop.
"Ryan never talked about what he was working on, but I knew it made him very unhappy."
He was very stressed.
"Now, did he ever talk about killing himself?"
No.
Never.
"After he died, that's what Borns Tech told me happened, and I believed them."
Why did you believe them?
"Shock, anger."
I wasn't thinking clearly.
"It was easier to blame Ryan somehow,"
- and I regret that.
- Right.
You weren't thinking clearly.
Hmm.
But clearly well enough to take an enormous settlement from Borns Tech.
I had my son to consider.
You told us that Ryan was unhappy and stressed.
At work.
Not at home.
"I mean, everything okay with you two at home."
Yes.
Pretty much.
Was he unhappy or stressed about anything between the two of you?
No.
It's your last chance to come clean.
"So... I mean, I heard you were having a conversation... so I just basically tuned it out."
"I'm able to do that, like not hear things, so..."
Comparing instruments?
She is such an idiot.
You wouldn't believe some of the things that girl has said to me.
That was so stupid of me.
Crying.
"No, that's okay. I mean..."
"Well, see you later."
See you on the bus.
- You're taking my bus?
"- Yes, because I'm staying at Angela's."
What?
I heard about your dad.
Tough break.
"So, a girl in distress hurls herself on a guy with no life."
"It's probably just a figure of speech,""See you on the bus""."
She probably didn't mean she would actually see me.
"She just means... yes, we'll be on the same bus."
But not like together.
Right?
So you are staying at Angela's house?
- Yes.
What do you care?
- l don't.
So is her dad cooking you all kinds of good food or something?
What about Kyle?
"I mean, they've been umbilically attached for a month."
Kyle was probably her popular- jock phase.
Now she's moving into her awkward but sensitive guy phase.
- Are you saying I'm someone's phase?
- l wish I was.
Give me a break.
You told me to get in deep.
I'm in all the way.
"They didn't teach us this one in the academy, thinks I'm Batman or something."
"Yeah, well we found Robin floating in the bay with a third eye."
What do you mean?
The guy who was the manager at the ware house you were working was undercover too.
"Okasake, okasake?"
"Yeah, they thought he was campanela's man."
"Hey, thank god they didn't suspect the FBI."
"Hey, thank god they didn't suspect the FBI."
Well neither did I. Am I the next on the line?
I don't know that.
I thought we were supposed to look out for each other.
Okasake used to be yakuza.
He pissed off his elders in Honolulu.
"They down his lower teeth, so we made him a deal."
Loyalty.
You know they understand that word.
So do we.
The important thing is you didn't blow your cover.
"Yeah, no thanks to you."
We never had anyone this deep before.
We never had anyone this deep before.
"So you gotta do whatever it takes to stay in, David."
You hear me?
Whatever it takes.
"Ok, OK."
You take care of yourself.
Who sent you?
Who the fuck sent you?
Geahh!
"That's why I'm even telling you guys this to begin with, because, you know, when things like this happen, sometimes people talk about them."
"You might hear something at school, or you might see Miles or even me on television, and I just wanted to prepare you for it."
I don't understand.
Why would you be arrested?
"Well, I don't know, and that's just it."
It's possible that some people connected with this project did bad things.
That you didn't know about.
That I did not know about.
- Why would you be arrested?
- l'm not going to be arrested.
I'm not going to be arrested.
"I do not want you to worry about this, all right?"
I'm just trying to prepare you in case people talk about it.
Okay?
"- Yeah, okay."
- Yeah?
Okay?
It's really okay.
I have to leave anyway.
"No, it's ready."
"If I could find the syrup... lf we have it, it's in that cabinet right there."
- Of course.
- [knock on door]
That's Mom.
- Hey.
"- Hey, sweetie."
- Are you all ready to go?
"- Yeah, I was, um..."
"- Oh, hi."
"- Hi, Karen."
They're ready.
I was just giving Jessie some waffles.
You must be Danny.
"- Killer pipes, man."
Thank you.
Yes.
I went through a choral camp every summer as a kid and I was the first male Annie.
"We are a real odd couple, you and me."
I bet that we're just gonna end up arguing and apologizing to each other over and over again every week.
"In my flashbacks, I let the boys speak for themselves."
Yep.
Feels like it was just yesterday.
"What a crazy, crazy wild time."
"We became room-mates after that, but you know the story."
What does that have to do with anything?
"The reason he needed a new room-mate is because his old room-mate got married and left, and they were never really friends ever again."
Yeah.
And now it's happening to Danny all over.
"Oh, okay..."
You're a mess.
"The poor guy, he feels abandoned, dude."
"Well, I guess I have to make this..."
I'm sorry.
I guess I...
You know what?
Enough monkeying around.
I gotta make this right.
Good luck kiss.
"Now you get out there and you git him, soldier!"
Of course Trent works here.
Candace used to see all this for free.
Now people gotta pay me a buck for it.
Bam!
Capitalism.
Mmm.
Maybe.
Maybe?
[Scoffs]
"Come on, Joel."
I know that guy's in a hurry.
Wants the bread.
He wants to go back to France.
This guy's not gonna hang around and play games.
"Look, he's one of the shrewdest cats I ever come across."
"What am I, a schmuck?"
What's the hurry?
He could see a couple of shows... visit the top of the Empire State Building.
"Don't jerk me, Weinstock."
I spent a lot of time setting' this one up.
"So what do you want, a badge?"
"This is your first major league game, Sal."
One thing I learned-
"Move calmly, move cautiously."
You'll never be sorry.
Look.
I've been damn careful up to now.
This is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawling all over you like fleas.
Aah.
"Look, I'm telling you, he'll take the deal somewhere else."
So let him take his 60 kilos of heroin someplace else... and find how easy it is to put together a half a million in cash.
He wouldn't find there's any hurry to do this kind of business.
The stuff is here!
We could make the switch in an hour!
"Look, Weinstock, I'm telling you."
He'll split if we don't move!
This guy's got 'em like that.
Thank you.
Yes.
"Now, just to recap, you've almost killed yourself..."
Right.
"...So far, you've lost a competition that you came up with."
Yes.
I cannot to see what you've got planned next.
It's actually pretty cool.
- Have you ever heard of range anxiety?
- I have.
"That is when you're more than 1 mile from a waffle house, right?"
[ Laughter ] No!
That is not what range anxiety is.
I'm just saying.
Range anxiety is where people who drive electric cars start to get nervous that their car won't have enough battery life to get them to their destination.
Okay.
"So, the other day, I'm watching the movie ""Top Gun,"""
and it hits me.
I know how to end range anxiety forever.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Here's all I need.
"I need a retro-fitted electric British sports car, a power cable, a generator, a pick-up, and..."
Adam Ferrara.
[ Laughter ]
That's Adam Ferrara?
Yep.
No.
"No, no."
[ Laughter ]
Now it's Adam Ferrara.
I thought the best place to conduct my experiment would be an airport runway in Compton.
How dare you tell me to keep it down?
I'm here with my better half here.
Go fuck yourself!
"You can't come into my place where I'm with my friends, drinking, playing pinball, having a fun time, celebrating."
You're not welcome.
Get out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
I'm not kidding you.
Get the fuck out of here right now.
I hate that man.
MAN:
"Hey, sweetheart."
What?
What are you staring at?
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Thought I smelled gasoline.
That's me.
- You look lost.
- I'm not.
Wanna come hang out?
- You want something to drink?
- Sure.
"All right, sit down."
"NARRATOR: 'When she had first spoken to the lowlife at the bar, 'it was the first time in four days Ashley heard her own voice out loud."
"'She became devastatingly aware of her own desperation, loneliness and torment."
'Quickly she could take no more and went home.'
- (DOGS BARKING)
- Nobody here is in pain.
This is a no-kill shelter.
We have plenty of available foster parents who are able to take care of them for as long as necessary to find a home.
- Do you have any cats?
Cardoza photographed it...
But it never showed up in the evidence locker.
Why not?
Paper says it went missing.
"Initials ""a.T."""
Jury tv had gavel-to-gavel coverage of the whole trial.
Uh...
Yeah.
This is from the day enright's lawyer grilled jesse.
"Attorney Ah, detective cardoza..."
"Now, you took the photograph"
"Of this bloody cuff link at the murder scene, correct?"
"Yes, I did."
Ah.
"And would you please read out for the court,"
"Uh, the initials that are engraved on that cuff link?"
"""a.T."""
"Well, those don't appear to be"
"The initials of my client, tony enright, now, do they?"
Was that a yes or a no?
No.
No.
Thank you.
"Um, there-there appears to be"
Blood on this cuff link.
"Now, will you tell us, please, is that the victim's blood"
Or the perpetrator?
I don't know.
"I'm so sorry, I'm..."
Going a little deaf in this ear.
"Could you, uh, repeat that a bit louder?"
I don't know.
What have you done with Nicholas?
What have I done with Nicholas?
"He can't hear you now, pal."
"Oh, come on."
You know he's dead.
Yeah.
"You ought to do something with that faulty memory of yours, pal."
Might make your life a little bit easier.
"By the way, I just love them little notes you leave for yourself."
That one on the refrigerator just kills me.
"Where is your hospitality, partner?"
"If someone walks in, he might get the wrong idea."
Who are you?
"Well, looks like you got some explaining to do, partner."
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
"You going somewhere, Mr. Reznik?"
"Yeah, Mrs. shrike, I'm moving."
I didn't receive notice.
Your lease requires you to give 30 days notice in writing.
"It wasn't planned, something came up."
You can keep my security deposit.
I won't be needing it anyway.
"Really, Mr. Reznik?"
You used to be such a good tenant.
I just don't understand it.
"Oh, isn't that pretty?"
Would you care to sell it?
"No, it was my mother's."
I've made arrangements to donate all my things.
- if you're desperate.
"- Someone needs your help, Michael."
Bottom line:
Until you figure out who burned you... you're not going anywhere.
"- What do you think of these shoes, Michael?"
Fantastic!
I have just the right dress.
- Are they real?
"- Well, they look real."
Isn't that what counts?
"You're getting a fake identity, Michael.I can't get fake shoes?"
Place is up here somewhere.
"You know, you go ahead."
I'm gonna-
"Oh, that's pretty."
A fake identity is known in the spy trade as a false flag.
Used to be you could make your own documents with a printer and a laminator.
"These days, though, I.D.'s have magnetic strips,holograms and infrared watermarks."
- Hey.
- You need a pro.
-Yes.
What can I do for you?
-I lost my passport and driver's license.
"I heard, uh, I could get some new ones here."
All you gotta do is report 'em stolen.
They'll send you replacements.
Right.
But the thing is...
"I'm going on a trip soon, and I heard you could do it here more quickly... and more quietly."
That might be possible- for a fee.
A fee is not an issue.
Come on back.
-You could have it.
-You took it first.
Excuse me.
"There are two copies, you both could have the same."
The bill counter is at the left corner.
You could pay the bill there
Your's sir.
- Thank you.
- Yours madam.
Do they assume to be Vijay and Shalini?
I am Haridas.
The best house broker in South India.
Please contact me to buy and sell house and house plots.
If you want Idli with Chutney approach me.
"You can't even spell fast-food, and you claim to be an owner."
You dare to advertise your Idli and chutney.
Better run away...
-What a stink!
-I didn't do anything
He has opened the idli cooker
I will become a spirit if I consume this vapour
-Why isn't the Poori fresh?
-How many day would it stay fresh?
-Not made today?
Nothing is made today Didn't you see the board outside?
PAST food.
- Give me pongal?
- What you guys want for pongal?
"For pongal give us trousers and shirt, some pocket money."
I asked what you need as side dish?
As if you have eight-variety dishes?
Give me that same damn chutney.
"No, get out."
Kuzou.
Why the hell am I being followed?
Why are you having me followed?
"I understand your anger, but while mr."
Tendo visiting we cannot take any chances.
"Hey look, you hired me."
If you don't trust me cut me lose.
I don't need some freak with a sword following me every time I take a shit.
Are you always this crude?
Only when I'm pissed off.
Only when I'm pissed off.
Then I'm sorry I pissed you off.
Oh yeah.
I think that's yours.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Christ.
Campanela's?
The yakuza's don't mess around.
How did you get these?
They sent them to you?
I think campanela wants us to know what we're up against.
I think campanela wants us to know what we're up against.
Mafia is warning us about yakuza's?
That's rich.
Maybe you're right.
I just hope our guys can bust them before they start an all out war.
"Right, what amazes me is how he got so deep, so fast."
How good is his cover story?
Convict died in solitary so we gave brand his identity.
There is no way for yakuza to found out otherwise.
-Quit!
Well?
want to indicate you to me where is the vesicle?
Ah... here.
"Either, or."
What cuts you would do?
From here up to here.
Thus?
And how I am going to be able to rummage about with the hand?
"What happens, idiot?"
You have something to say?
Want to operate you?
"No, no, Professor, was enjoying... with its words."
It is not hour to enjoy.
You do sexual activity that I want to begin to operate.
"Hurry up, to put to sleep"
If they do not extinguish the light there is no form to sleep to me.
It pardons?
Dr. Ciotti are you?
-Why?
It is not evident?
"-Yes, it is, only that I am afraid that I have been mistaken of operating room."
What means?
"In fact, I have come by the hemorroides."
Hemorroides?
Hemorroides.
"Cicchirini, between the vesicle and the hemorroides, there is much route."
We suspend during half an hour.
"Prepare, therefore I will do a new back tuna to him."
A tuna new ass?
"Why, the old man is broken?"
"They are misfortunes that happen, why to your sister."
So you're saying that you can't tell the difference between the highlight reel...
I can tell the difference.
"...and physically, really cheating on somebody?"
Don't say it to me like I can't tell the difference.
"Well, that's what you're saying!"
"You're saying that they,re related, then they're somehow in the same family."
"No, no."
"I'm saying you own a Jack Russell, I own a Bull Terrier."
They're both dogs.
They're both terriers.
Mine's just a little more aggressive than yours.
"I own a zebra, you own a goat."
What the hell's that have to do with cheating on your wife?
"Right, they're both animals."
Are you out of your mind?
How would you feel if your wife cheated?
Guys?
Listen to me.
Trudy's gone.
What?
What do you mean?
What?
I went to the room and all her stuff was gone.
Where do...
Where do you think she went?
Like she...
I don't know.
We had a argument at therapy.
She said she was sick of my senior citizen bullshit.
"I've been trying to keep up with her, but I'm a old ass!"
"Shane, honey, it's not your fault."
"No, it's bullshit."
"I mean, why do you think--"
Why do I think he had a heart attack at 40?
"Sweetie, I don't know."
But he does work too hard.
"Actually, his new boss is always telling him, go easier on yourself."
The lumber business is very unpredictable.
I kept telling him he should take some time off.
But do you know the truth of it is?
He loves it.
He loves his work.
- lt's his life.
- lt must be great to feel that way.
M rs.
Cherski.
Good news.
The angioplasty was a complete success.
"Oh, God."
There was a small blockage that we were able to clear.
That's what caused the arrhythmia.
"I've prescribed a few medications... he'll need to take, but he's going to be just fine."
I think it finally hit me.
Thank you.
- Andy is going to be okay.
- Thank God.
I landed the account.
I don't understand.
"When they told me, I don't know, it was like a... this moment because I had to admit that I didn't want to land it."
Because landing it means that I'm really doing this.
"This is my job, this is my life, this is it!"
This is what I really...
"But, look I'm sorry that I couldn't..."
"- you know, handle it or whatever."
"From the time he comes down there until he leaves, you will not have a financial need."
"Now, when you make this decision... you got to live and die with it."
'Cause it's your decision to make.
"Now, I'm here to support you if you - if you done searched this whole thing."
And it's what you really want.
"Not,you know, 'cause Mama said this or your dad-"
"Or because you're saving Mama money, because if we have to... we will still pay- if you have to try to pay- if we can put some- I'm just sayin;"
You
- Understand what you're saying.
"You want to save somebody money, but still -"
But you have to still do what is best from here.
"But still we want the best for you - even if you have to - or we have to go in the hole, you know."
You understand what I'm saying?
I'm just saying.
"But still, the decision is up to you."
"So, what do you think?"
Ah.
- Ready to sign it?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
- Let's do it up.
- What time is it?
- 1:56.
56.
"Come on, Bo."
Whip it to him.
"When I was 23, how old was he?"
And I whupped him then.
Aw!
You want to see it rain?
Let it rain.!
- You want to see it rain?
Jesus Christ!
- Why didn't you guys answer the phone?
- I was online.
"Well, no more Internet when I'm not here."
I have to be able to call you.
Maybe you should buy us cell phones.
No.
Just stay off the fucking computer when I'm not here!
You can't make us stay off the computer if you're not here.
- You won't be here to keep us off it!
- It's for safety!
- How did you get home?
- I walked.
What is your dad watching?
It looks like Nickelodeon.
- Don't look at my dad.
- Sorry.
"Ifhe puts up another sign, I think we should go up there."
"I mean, what else can happen?"
Just more signs?
Signs forever?
I always thought I'd lose it with someone who was my boyfriend or something.
But this is better... 'cause it won't matter if we mess up.
And we'll be together.
But I'm trying to change!
All right.
"This song is for you, and, yes, it is a lovesong."
"Hi, Nancy Herrington."
"So this morning, if you remember, you had asked me to send you my work."
"And that was it, what you just watched."
Did you love it?
I'm just kidding.
And his address just came up.
Big Bad lives at 5923 Mills.
Clear here.
Clear.
Like a cave.
This guy hides out all year long.
"Well, with burns like that, he's probably sensitive to light."
And his own skin.
"I mean, look around."
There's not a mirror in sight.
This guy doesn't want any reminder of what he looks like.
There is nothing personal in here.
"Well, we said he didn't have nothing to live for."
"For a planner like Kaman, tonight's abduction was irrational."
He went on private property and took Chris Edwards with a witness present.
"Maybe he's finally starting to feel the pressure, and he's reactive."
"More than that, he's meticulous."
He'd have a plan if he got cornered.
He'd have an endgame.
"Well, he already killed the man he blames for his accident."
The other victims were slights compared to that.
And now he needs to hurt the person that hurt him the most.
The one who drives all of this.
The one who broke his heart.
"Yeah, but who the hell is that?"
I swear I won't tell anybody about this.
"Oh, God!"
Son of a bitch!
"Oh, God!"
[Sobbing]
"I'm sorry, man."
I'm so sorry.
"Yes, this afternoon there was a documentary on TV about it."
Really?
Good afternoon.
Isn't he creepy?
What does he get up to?
"Whatever he gets up to, it can't be anything good."
He's always hanging around here at this time of the day.
Do you think he's the one who steals the underwear?
It's very possible.
Look at his face.
He looks very dubious.
- Can you keep an eye on him?
- OK.
I'm close by at the moment.
A driving license?
I don't have one.
I understand.
A man nods busily and wipes off his sweat.
When he first came here.
He'd never worked before and still had a smile just like a shining apple.
He no longer has that smile and he's worn out because he can't sleep.
"By the end of this month, from the time he came here."
An ear of rice could have grown to his chest.
Above the top button of his shirt...
Aren't you the model in this magazine?
Please sign your autograph.
"Ah, I can't."
Excuse me.
Please excuse us.
RED PORNO
Are you really sure about it?
Don't you know you could make one or two million yen easily with this job.
"This is just like ""hairspray""!"
"Then the cops showed up, and it turned into a riot."
Whoa!
A riot?
Yeah.
Sweet!
Did anyone use nunchakus?
"You know, I don't think so,"
"But that riot was something else, and it reminded me..."
"So aunt Edie told them all about the riot,"
"The moon landing, and the time she saw elvis"
"Buying double ""a"" batteries at Wheeler's market."
Maybe Axl and Sue didn't find
"The time capsule they were looking for,"
But they ended up finding a better one.
"And it turns out,"
I had a little time capsule of my own.
"A file, mike?"
Someone seriously has a file on me?
How do I go from being a person teachers always loved
To a person with a file?
"Well, you know, maybe they didn't love you"
As much as you thought they did.
So what are we gonna do about this crossing guard thing?
"I take tuesdays, you take thursdays,"
And then we switch off?
"What do you mean ""we""?"
Hey.
I'm telling.

Please show this young lady out.
You're sure about this?
We've got a U-boat Commander at Bowmanville.
"Now, any intel Klaus can get from him"
- will help with the big Push.
- Eyes and ears inside.
You think he'll turn just because your family took a holiday years ago?
"Well, I'm counting on your legendary powers of persuasion, Tom."
Does he even remember you?
He was a kid.
"If anything, he'll remember my boys."
What else can you tell me?
He's a good soldier.
He's got a bit of a chip on his shoulder due to the fact that his father's got him some privileges.
So he's got integrity?
"Well, that doesn't help us."
He's a pilot.
That could help.
Guys who work alone are more likely to turn.
Start there while you're still on my payroll.
You heard.
The Yanks had to go through me.
I said it was your call.
Good luck with Klaus.
Why are you following me?
"Open your mouth,"
- or I'll open it for you.
- I don't speak unless I need to.
Why are you following me?
I wanted to make sure you are who you say you are.
I can help your men.
Yes.
My name is Laine Hanson.
My address is...
"Youcanjustdothat , pull phone records?"
Iwork for a pretty powerful guy.
"Yeah,we'reclose, we were close for a while."
"That's till recently, of course."
Our career paths sort of went in different directions.
At least you have your life.
There's nothing sinister going on here.
"At this point, we just need... to look at every aspect of her life and find everyone that knew her."
You never know what you're gonna find.
- Did you find anything?
"- No, no, not really."
Not really?
You mean...
"A little bit, actually."
"I did speak to other classmates, and they told me she was pretty wild."
Wild?
"Yeah, she was wild."
Wild enough you can be sure the tabloids are gonna have a field day.
Have you spoken to them?
"Um, me?"
No.
But somebody somewhere's gonna talk.
- But not you.
"- Uh-uh, no."
- It's okay if you have.
We're not gonna lock you up.
"- No, I haven't."
"So no one like, maybe, the National Enquirer... or one of those silly television programs..."
"- that show, um..."
how much you charge?
-Fifty thousands.
Fifty and fifty do one hundred...
"Good, we go the three."
"Boys, it seems the Day of the Deceaseds, comes, animaos."
-Always with your jokes!
-It is possible that you never change?
"We go, Ciotti is going to begin the visits."
Let's hurry!
.
"-No, no, this way."
-In agreement.
"Boys, the women are as they are, we do not have to create problems to us, we must amuse to us."
"I excuses, Professor, you have seen the young lady Italia?"
Why?
Because I must put the injection to me.
You have that to put the injection?
The gentleman has that to put the injection.
"Ah, the gentleman must put the injection?"
The gentleman has that to put the injection.
"I have understood if you well, the gentleman must put the injection."
"Yes, that."
"You come with us, we will put."
"One does not worry, you will not feel any pain."
"We already are, happens."
"-That is, does not worry."
-Bend down.
"Now you stand here, Lean here... a little more side... that is."
Comfortable position.
We open the buttock.
-The ass.
-The muscle Relaxes.
"That day, we went around the town of Nagasaki...  because we wanted to know a lot more about the atomic bomb."
"Even though the atomic bomb was dropped, this survived?"
"No, it was rebuilt."
But there are some things left just as they were at that time.
The angels all look as if they are crying.
The atomic bomb blasted right above here.
Portugal.
These are monuments... sent from different countries of the world.
Czechoslovakia.
Italy.
Poland.
Bulgaria.
The Soviet Union.
China.
Brazil.
Cuba.
Holland.
I can't find the one from America.
What do you expect?
America is the one that dropped the atomic bomb.
"""I was so very thirsty."
"""Water, water. "" All died uttering that word."
"But nowadays, for most of the people... the atomic bomb is something that happened once upon a time."
People are apt to forget... even a dreadful event like that... as the years pass by.
Can we leave it like that?
I really pity Grandpa and Grandma.
Want some ice cream?
Grandma.
Grandma.
You're late!
What have you been doing?
"It's all right, now, all right."
"Now, Stu's over at the Bullfrog."
What's he doin'?
"Well, you know what he's doing."
Is he looking for gold?
"Well, wouldn't be too far off."
No gold over there.
"Okay, tell people that."
"That's a good story, you keep telling people that."
Hasn't been any gold over there for 60 years.
"I watched your dad work that worthless hole for 50 years, and all he come out of there with was a sore back."
There's no gold over there.
"Okay, that's-- that's a good story, Perry."
Tell 'em forget about the gold and go for clip and save.
Do you use clip and save?
No.
"You don't use this stuff because you're on the county payroll, right?"
You don't need to.
But some of us are finding it a little hard to get by these days.
This is a good one.
You can get 75 cents off on a six-pack.
You spend much time around Greenwater Gulley?
No.
Not since I was a kid.
"You know, Earl and I pulled an RV out of there this afternoon."
mm-hmm?
"Three people in it, cut up."
Just like them others we found over the years.
[sighs]
I don't understand.
Some lunatic running around here.
It makes me sick.
"Look at these prices-- 35, 20, 35."
They kept her away from drugs and from me.
You still loved her?
Yes.
I'd cry when I saw something that moved me because I couldn't share it with her.
There's nothing worse than leaving someone you still love.
What a sad story.
"Love is the saddest thing when it goes away, as a song by Jobim goes."
We have to talk after the fight.
We've been talking for an hour.
You.
Not me.
You're right.
The doctor said it would take two months for my leg to heal.
But you knowwhat?
I'm glad the bull gored me.
"Now Ican staywith you until you awake, my love"
No one will take me away from you.
We'd gotten back together a month before.
"Lydia was to tell you at the wedding, but when I saw you in the ICU"
I knew she hadn't.
It was you she was crying for.
She rang to tell me she'd cried thinking of me.
It was the last time we spoke.
"As I'm injured, I won't be fighting for a while."
I'd like to stay with her these nights.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you.
"Hello, Alicia."
I'm alone again.
"Admit it, you were looking at her breasts."
"It's hard not to, they're getting bigger."
I'm thinking of going away.
"""Entrepreneur rises from the ashes."""
"Now, I'm just going to be in The Times, looking like a stupid ash."
"Shoot, girl, just push on through."
"I'm pushing, girl."
I am pushing.
(both) Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
"Just go, girl."
I don't want anybody else to get those two yellow dresses.
"Max, did you hear that?"
Someone has worst taste than Sophie.
Now we just have to hang back here and let them get to those dresses first.
Yay!
My life is good again.
"Max, Caroline, up here."
"What was that, like, a second?"
I saved you a space upfront.
Come on.
"Well, it's over."
"As soon as they cut that ribbon,"
Sophie's going to Marshawn Lynch everyone who gets in the way of us and those dresses.
There's only one way out of this.
And you called it earlier.
You have to let them trample you.
I'm serious.
I'm not about to be trampled on purpose.
See if you still feel that way after I say these next few words:
"""Pictured from left, Caroline Channing."""
Try to fend off any heels you see heading for my eyes.
"Attention, ladies."
"As you see, I have the big scissors, which can only mean it's time... to trim some nose hairs!"
"Great leading, Joey."
Me?
"Yeah, you."
I thought monsieur Marcel felt that technology was a distraction.
"For the guests, yeah."
You seem pretty good at that game.
He's the best on the whole island.
It's a pretty small island.
Doesn't look like it's all that hard.
Looks like all you gotta do is push these big buttons and play along with the song here.
Am I right?
Something like that.
"You know what'd be a gas, Sctanley?"
For me and you to play.
"And when I win, you could point me towards the singles' side and forget you ever saw us."
When you beat me?
"When I win, what will you give me?"
Maybe just this.
"$1,000"
"- A cool G, as we call it back home."
"Are you at liberty to play for that, Sctanley?"
Or would you prefer to play for smiles?
"Monsieur Marcel, I'm sorry to have woken you."
"I thought there was an emergency, but I was mistaken."
I do apologize.
I play at expert level.
You take this kind of serious.
That's a big screen.
You've played this before.
"Maybe just a couple times, Sctanley."
"All right, Sctanley, let's have some fun."
"Come on, Sctanley, get him!"
That was my first job interview ever.
"I mean, I haven't gone anywhere with my life, and this is my second one."
All I have is a fake résumé filled with things that I've never even done.
"I mean, I've never even lived alone."
- How long did you live alone?
- Long enough.
Don't you think that's odd?
My entire life.
My aunts swept in the moment my dad died and you the moment I died.
You're thinking about living here.
Aren't you?
Yeah.
"Well, you hate corduroy and sleighbell slippers."
I'll stop walking in on you doing things you don't want me to know about.
Would never have happened if you wore your slippers.
- It'll be romantic.
- I'm confused.
More.
- More?
- More explanation.
How is it romantic?

"And I'm not moving out, I'm just moving next door."
It's French.
It's very first-class Parisian living.
His-and-her suites and coy midnight knocks on the door to share a lover's boudoir.
- You'll be knocking?
You can knock too.
This was not romantic for the Pie-Maker.
Yay.
I know.
But thank you.
It's a joy to have you.
Richard Whiteley!
You've ruined my life!
Thanks very much.
"Earlier on I was told to go and break the world caravan speed record, which stands at 128mph."
And I failed.
So I had another go.
"With the window repaired to Aerospace standards, caravan glory is within Lee's grasp."
This time the cross winds have built up.
The caravan starts to fishtail.
Lee keeps his nerve and keeps his foot to the floor.
He hits 125.2mph. That looks great for a new record.
Just 5mph more.
There's plenty of runway left.
"But then, oil and smoke everywhere."
This doesn't look good.
"I'm not an engineer, but I'd say it was mullered."
"I think the piston's gone, or low on fuel,"
I'm not sure.
We can't have another go then?
Not with this car.
There you go.
"BBC Top Gear, the world's anti-caravan organisation defeated by a 20-year-old Abbey GT214."
It's pathetic.
I wonder if James May realises.
We don't tolerate failure on Top Gear.
It's not an option.
Maybe he doesn't know about the tank of piranhas.
He'll be in it if he doesn't get it right.
Right.
"""And I'm also going to take a picture."""
And so I took this picture.
"And it was really hot, I tried to show this with..."
With this clumsy coloration.
Clumsy...
A picture can be personally pornographic while being also...
Publically decent.
Wouldn't you say so?
This is my father.
Where is this?
"Between Washington and New York, on the road."
This was one and a half years ago.
I took it because I realized it was...
The way I saw my father...
"Almost all of my childhood, as we travelled..."
"While driving, I always saw him from the back."
I saw his eyes only through the mirror.
I mostly saw his big hands on the wheel.
I trusted him.
Therefore it's a picture...
I mean...
"It's a family picture, a sentimental picture."
A childhood memory.
But it's a childhood memory that isn't in childhood pictures...
That's why I reproduced it.
I mean re-photographing a memory I had.
This isn't a family picture.
It's in Corsica.
It's a pseudo-sunset.
The sunset isn't real.
"The sun wasn't setting, it's here."
The light beams.
I don't know why he's missing but he's alive for sure.
The Commander told me to report his death... so I could save my family Prince Daeso was holding hostage.
My family is safe now.
I'll go to Jolbon sometime soon and serve the Commander.
I'll think of a way to get you out.
Please look after yourself.
Hope you had a nice trip.
Have a seat.
I received your letter but I still can't believe it.
Is Jumong really dead?
He is.
What a pity.
I wanted to kill him myself.
Once I take overJolbon...
I'll offer his head to the Emperor and win back his trust.
Do whatever you want.
Thanks.
"The ministers wanted to attack Jolbon without your help... but instead, I shared a secret."
"Since we're in it together, you must do something for me."
What is it?
Feed my soldiers during the entire war.
You can't expect us to feed them all.
"Prince Daeso killed Jumong, which weakened Jolbon."
It's your turn to do something.
The war will be short and you won't lose any men.
You have nothing to lose.
Very well.
We'll provide your provisions.
Governor.
What is it?
Mr. Hwang is here.
Who's Mr. Hwang?
He put you right in front of me.
It's true that Chief Jung tricked me.
Because he told me that this was all to protect you.
"Then, it's all over now."
Since we know... that we all tricked each other.
Then does that mean it's really over?
Nothing comes after that?
- Hello.
- Hello!
Min Ki!
Sit down for a second.
"Hey, we're sorry..."
about beating you up that time.
Your grandma must have been very shocked...
"Hey, we're good guys."
"The shadow told us not to look for you, so we never did."
- Why are you here?
- Min Ki.
"You're a good source of information in this neighborhood, right?"
- You're close with the police too.
- Who said that?
Earlier today...
Was someone stabbed with a knife?
Why... do you ask?
There is this crazy kid...
who is going around bragging about it.
"He said he really used his skills, or something like that..."
- At Chung Gye Plan?
- Yes?
A man was killed.
They said it looked like a spiteful relationship...
Because he was stabbed so many times.
You always were the one to show me how.
"Back then, I couldn't do the things that i can do now."
This thing is slowly take me apart.
"Grey would be the color, if i had a heart."
Come on tell me.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just one thing,"
I'm starting to scare myself.
"You make this all go away, you make it all go away."
I just want something...
I just want something...
I can never have.
I can never have...
I can...
"Whoever threw that, fuck you Allright ?"
In this place it seems like such a same.
"Though it all looks different now,"
I know it's still the same.
Everywhere i look you're all i see.
Just a fading fucking reminder of... who i used to be.
Come on tell me.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just one thing,"
I'm starting to scare myself.
"You make this all go away, you make it all go away."
I just want something...
I just want something...
I can never have.
I just want something...
I can never have...
I can never have...
I can never have...
That doesn't mean he's God... or even smarter than we are.
But from where he's sitting... he can see a little further down the road.
I think we can assume that... these entities are more advanced than us.
Why don't they just come right out and tell us what's on their minds?
You're more advanced than a cockroach.
Have you ever tried explaining yourself to one of them?
How many people have seen it?
Ten.
"Twenty, maybe."
Listen to me.
Something terrible is going to happen in Point Pleasant.
Don't go back.
Stay away.
I can't talk about this anymore.
Mr. Leek.
There is a reason... that I ended up in Point Pleasant.
Something brought me there.
Whatever brought you there... brought you there to die.
You're just in time.
They're just about to light this Christmas tree.
They have been for the last two hours.
Isn't that Denise?
Is she okay?
She left Gordon.
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.
Where is he?
Who knows?
Be back in a second.
Connie.
What's wrong?
Fifteen more people reported seeing that thing today.
See the diff?
"Do you mean ""hyphen""?"
You are gay... because you are attracted to men.
That's it.
"You sleep with men... man, me."
- You sleep with me.
- Yeah.
"And that... is pretty gay, dude."
Exactly.
And people don't want to think about our sex life.
"Uh, I could show you a few fanfic forums..."
On the Internet.
But...
I play baseball on TV.
Okay?
"TV gays, they... they sing about acceptance."
"Or host daytime talk shows for housewives, or... acquire babies from exotic locations like China or wombs."
That is so not me.
"You've met me, right?"
Look...
You are such a great actor.
"I mean, you've played everything from an elf to a..."
Christmas elf.
"I mean, you could be a little less..."
"So the Alderaan of my uniqueness is to be blasted out of existence by the Death Star of ""less gay?"""
Is that right?
"I'm not sure, but... nerdy stuff like that, I mean, that is a good place to start."
"Maybe, maybe if you wore glasses then people would look at the smart, not the gay."
You want me to be Anderson Cooper.
"I mean, you know, if he were gay."
- All I'm asking is...
"- I know what you're asking, Brady."
"Yeah, Molly's mom gave it to me."
"I know, it's a sweet deal."
"Sure, come on over."
"Ladder's around back, and I'll try and save you some pie."
Would you girls knock it off?
It's your squabbling that kept me a single mother all those years.
"Oh, don't play that card."
You've had more boyfriends than she's had.
Are you calling me a slut?
Are you calling me a slut?
"Just stay away from my fiancé, and yes, I am!"
I think all the idiots in the world should send us chocolates and liquor baskets.
I just want to touch things.
Why?
We immortalize their stupidity.
You guys stink worse than my diapers!
Like the agro chick who went ballistic over a parking spot.
Get off of me!
And the campaign manager who was nothing to sneeze at.
[Sneezes]
- Electrodes.
- We got a bad guy who shocked the world...
[Groans]
"A news reporter who tried to mail it in, a campfire sing-a-long that was too much to swallow..."
[Coughs]
And finally...
I created the Wall of Sound.
"A mean, old record producer who made one last hit."
"♪ Help, I've fallen, and I can't get up ♪"
They're singing our song.
[Crying and screaming]
You...think you'll be okay by yourself?
You were in a big accident today...
And your situation isn't normal either.
I'm sure you've been really shocked...
You really think you'll be okay to stay by yourself?
You seem to want to stay here by pretending to care for me...
But forget it.
Leave.
I'll make sure to get lots of sleep for you.
All he has is frozen food and carbonated drinks.
I wonder if he only eats food like this?
His build is really large.
Too big!
I don't have to go to school.
Yes...!
Oops.
I see she brought everything over for her precious body.
'Please treat it preciously'.
I won't eat it!
"You're in there, right?"
Right?
Are you really cold?
Your hand is very warm!
It must be because I was holding the coffee with that hand.
They say the temperature of the hand is the same as the temperature of the heart.
I think your hand is this warm because your heart is so warm!
I bet you're the only one who has hands this warm.
So warm.
The person who has hands this warm in this world...
There was just one person.
And here they are.
Da Ran just came home.
I'm having a baby with a woman that I'm very much in love with.
"You told me that you were confused, that you wanted to leave her."
I know.
"I was confused, Kim."
I was so confused.
And it was wrong of me to get you tangled up in that.
How could you not tell me that you were having a baby?
Because I'm an asshole.
I did a bad thing.
I have no excuse.
"There nothing I can say to you other than that I'm so sorry, and it's really not about you at all."
Why do people always say that?
"How can it not be about me if you can sleep with me one minute, and then walk out on me the next?"
"I'm sorry, Kim."
I gotta go.
- All right.
- All right.
"No, you'll be fine."
You are the suckiest driver.
No way.
I'm not.
"Well, how many miles do you think you guys will be making fun of me for?"
I'd say pretty much the whole entire way.
I'm not going to make fun of you.
I think there's a bus stop...
- Is there a bus down there?
"Oh, good."
- It's four miles.
"Because my friends aren't giving me a ride home, so..."
I think it's going to rain.
"Sorry I'm not coming, guys."
"- No, don't apologize."
"- um, i know, but..."
i kind of have to.
thi-- this is like the whole check.
- yeah.
"let me take -  no. no, uncle bob."
i... [sighs] i need to take care of us.
- all right.
you endorse it right here and sign it right to the dwp.
"- well, i guess that's why the power didn't get turned off last month."
[chuckles weakly] hey.
"- i'm proud of you, champ."
you're becoming quite the little man.
"uh, i-i mean big man."
"- thanks, uncle bob."
- all right.
let's get out of here.
it's christmas eve.
- so that how the electric bill was paid last month.
"- cindy, where did you come from?"
- i was just here.
i was shopping around.
so why'd you -- uh... why'd you get a job?
[chuckles]
"- i mean, the bills had to get paid somehow."
"- well, you shouldn't have to worry about that."
"- well, what's good having a big-screen tv if you can't watch it?"
- come here. [sighs] all right.
"i'm -- uh, i have to go now, so [sighs]"
- phew.
i thought for a second that maybe you actually cared about somebody other than yourself.
"- where are you going, mama?"
- [scoffs] i made a promise to someone that i-i want to keep.
That doesn't mean he's God... or even smarter than we are.
But from where he's sitting... he can see a little further down the road.
I think we can assume that... these entities are more advanced than us.

Shit.
- Where is he?
- Who knows?
Be back in a second.
Connie.
What's wrong?
Fifteen more people reported seeing that thing today.
BROOKE:
"Oh, no."
He's tuning out.
That's the look he gives me when I try to tell him...
"Well, just about anything."
We don't have that problem.
"Jack thinks every other thing I say is ""great""!"
"No, no, no, he's got this, just stay focused, Jack."
...and that basic bitch had the nerve to change the margins on my profit-loss statements?
Mm-mmm.
"Amy, I need to talk to you."
"Look, I jumped into this without thinking it through, and that's on me, so..."
What are you trying to say?
[mouthing words]
"What I'm trying to say, Amy, is..."
What are you doing with your hands?
[mouthing words]
"I realize that I have a lot of growing up to do, and you and I aren't going to make it."
Are you breaking up with me?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
AMY:
Wow.
"I appreciate your honesty, but when I look at the balance sheet of our relationship, you're still kind of a jerk."
[phone camera clicks]
"""Kind of a jerk."""
"""Kind of a jerk!"""
"- That's two steps above ""monster."""
- Mm hmm.
I'm proud of you.
"Yeah, I keep this up, by Christmas I'll just be"
"""sort of unpleasant."""
Oh!
Looks like he's been dead a lot longer.
Area's swarmed by something.
Exactly what I was thinking.
"On areas not consumed by insects, I found blisters, hives and swelling."
Anaphylactic shock?
From insect bites?
Anything could have triggered the allergic reaction.
"My cousin, if she even looks at a peanut?"
Blowfish.
"Well, these are insect bites, and that gets Lexia off the hook."
"Still, I mean that is one hell of a bee sting."
We need to go to the Underground and find out what Gene Hansen was doing before he died.
Oh?
Underground?
I have to go change.
I can't go looking all corporate like this.
Corporate.
- Hello.
- Hey.
I got a case that's taking a tour through weirdsville.
- You care to join?
- I'm a little tied up at the moment.
I got a dead...
line to meet.
"Oh, all right, you don't have to explain yourself to me."
- I've got a life.
- I thought you were dead.
I'm busy.
- You're wearing that?
- You're wearing that?
"Okay, this is strictly a fact-finding mission,"
"A couple tears, and he'll give me pretty much whatever I ask for."
There's nothing men are more afraid of than a crying woman.
Or a woman who seems disorganized and overwhelmed.
"I feel sorta bad for him, actually."
It's so easy to get what you want from him.
Don't feel bad.
"Women have it tough out there, trust me."
Most men underestimate you.
But it sounds like you are working that to your advantage already.
"Does ""P  L"" stand for profit and loss statements?"
Uh... yeah.
Good.
Then I have the right one.
What are you doing?
Giving this file to my dad.
It's funny.
You know what I've noticed?
"Some women underestimate other women, too..."
Just because they're young.
"- Bye, daddy."
"- Bye, sweetie."
See you at home.
Feelin' like a sucker?
"Yeah, I know the feeling."
"Well, that was a cheap trick... using your daughter like that."
"Oh, there's a lot of cheap tricks being played in this room."
"Now, the way I see it, I can either go through these and find all of your clients' weak spots, or... we can call it a draw and start over."
Negotiate the rest of the deal...
Mano a mano...
like real lawyers.
No cheating.
Fine.
The earring.
Eric was with a girl alone in this house.
"Oh, boy."
"OK, sweetheart, I will go have a talk with him."
"No, no, no."
I will talk to him.
I don't want to have any of that father-son winking thing going on.
- What father-son winking?
"- No, I-I don't want to see you go,"
"""Son, what you did was wrong,"" and then, ""Attaboy."" I don't want to see that."
- You think I'd do that?
- I think you'd do that.
"Well, I wouldn't do that."
That just goes to show you don't know me at all.
We'll both just go have a talk with my son.
- My son.
- Ugh!
- Hello.
- You want to tell us anything?
Uh... not yet.
Now I got something to tell you.
We found this in our bed.
What was it you wanted to tell us?
"I just wanted to say, ""Happy Birthday, Mom."""
The other one's on layaway.
"Nothing happened between me and Rebecca, if that's what you're thinking."
Why should we believe that nothing happened?
Look at my face.
Do I look happy?
Nothing happened.
"Well, I'd like to know what you were doing bringing a girl into our room."
"And don't give us some lame-o excuse like, ""She wanted a tour of the house."""
"At some point, we have to address it."
J.T.
"You're all right, dad?"
No.
I'll come see you when I'm done.
Have you heard from your sister?
She's just being Marcy.
"Don't worry, okay?"
All right.
Senator!
Listen...
I know how you feel.
This is a mistake.
You have no idea how I feel.
Sara could be anywhere.
I don't even know if she's alive.
"You offer a reward before the abductors issue demands, we're going to lose the advantage."
What advantage?
"She's out there, pregnant."
"You haven't found my ex-wife, and my daughter's MIA."
Your daughter's not missing.
She just didn't want to be here.
"You know, I can't eat, I can't sleep, and I sure as hell can't sit here and do nothing."
"We're going to break into the 11:00 news, we need to go now."
"All I care about is my wife, and the only way you're going to stop me is if you pull out that gun and shoot."
Senator!
"If you're gonna do this, do it right-- look straight into the camera."
"There's a good chance the perp's watching, and if he is, he's enjoying your pain."
Let him.
"We get lucky, maybe we can draw him out."
Thank you.
All right.
Do you think that's normal?
Don't most peopleNhave different dreams?
I don't know.
There.
You're beautiful.
can you manage a smile?
(classical music playing )
At last.
We thought you'd never arrive.
Hamish is waitingNto dance with you.
Go.
You do realize it's well past 4:00.
Now everything will haveNto be rushed through.
never mind!
Forgive my wife.
She's been planningNthis affair for over 20 years.
If only Charles were here...
My condolences.
I think of your husband often.NHe was truly a man of vision.
I hope you don't think I've takenNadvantage of your misfortunes.
Of course not. I'm pleasedNthat you purchased the company.
I was a fool for not investing inNhis mad venture when I had the chance.
too.
(classical MUSlCNCONTlNUES playing )
do you ever tire of quadrille?
On the contrary. I find it invigorating.
(LAUGHS )
Do I amuse you?
No.
I had a sudden visionNof all the ladies in trousers and the men wearing dresses.
I think you'll do bestNto keep your visions to yourself.
remain silent.
"- Dan, what is that projection?"
"- Thank you, Greg."
"CNN is prepared to make the following projection that Virginia, with its 13 electoral votes, is a win for President Meyer."
This election is a tie.
We did it!
We have one more hurdle to overcome.
And we shall overcome.
One more river to cross.
One more mountain to climb.
But I have been to the mountaintop.
Thank you.
- I don't know what to do.
- We don't do anything.
- You do what you have to do.
"- Yeah, I'm getting drunk."
"Hey, Dan, when you get this, can you put in a good word for me with Greg?"
I think that I need to keep my TV work going.
"Okay, you're gonna win."
"And if you don't, I'll kill myself."
"Kent, what happens next?"
You've got to know.
"No, I'm afraid not."
"Some of these House races,"
- they're still too close to call.
- What does that mean?
"Well, presently, we cannot predict the result of the vote in Congress on January 20."
- We're in a kind of purgatory.
- Welcome to my world.
- Can you stop thinking about yourself for one second?
- Honestly.
"No, because I'm going to prison."
Have I mentioned that?
You got an ash tray?
Was she heavy?
Was it hard for them to get her into the dumpster?
"One guy lifted her, the other guy held the top open."
- You see his face?
- Whose face?
You told the other officer you saw the killers face.
I did?
"No, I didn't."
You calling this officer a liar?
I didn't see faces.
I seen the license plate.
"258, right?"
287.
I didn't see the rest of it.
What's the last line on that poster?
"I, I..."
I don't have my glasses.
I was wearing my glasses.
"Y'know, a doctor says to me that I gotta wear my glasses all the time, and, I have to admit, I am sorta vain."
"Well, put your glasses on... and read the bottom line on that poster."
I don't have 'em with me.
"Tell me about the gloves, what were they like?"
"They're white, cotton."
"They got stitching on the back of the hand, along the knuckle."
They're proper ladies gloves.
You can see that kinda detail from your car without your glasses?
I had my glasses.
"When the two guys went away, I got out and took a closer look."
"Frank, your wife's on the phone."
"Stan just radioed in from Pamela's apartment, only the name on the lease is JMJ Wilgis."
"JMJ, a brother, sister?"
Now you do need help.
"Why, you're scared to death thinking that your husband is in some way mixed up with Lita Krail or even--"
I don't know anything about it!
"So please just get out, Perry."
We-- we don't need you.
Please just get out.
"[door opens, closes]"
Any luck yet on the guy with the strawberries?
"No, not so far."
I'm checking out the license number
- and my men are checking the markets.
- What about the necktie?
"Well, there was a cleaning tab on the label and we're running it down as fast as we can."
I gave my men a head start before I reported what I had to the police.
"All right, Paul."
I want one of your men to watch that house.
- Don't leave till he gets here.
- All right.
"Oh, you heard about the Lita Krail thing."
"Shocking, isn't it?"
Very shocking.
Such a pretty creature.
"How did you hear about it, Mr. Banks?"
"Oh, the police just called a few moments ago."
Routine-- check the employer.
That sort of thing.
"I wasn't in town when Jess Devro died last year, Mr. Banks."
I still miss him.
"Best friend, you know?"
Very best.
"It happened here in the office, didn't it?"
"He was alone, working late."
–Okay.
"If someone were trying to keep her alive, how long could she survive?"
"With a tourniquet and basic medical knowledge, indefinitely."
Until he tired of his domination and control Dr Mengele experiments... and decided to squeeze the last breath out of her so he could watch.
"See, this is why you and me can't date."
Run these prints.
Get me an I.D now.
I spoke to Shane.
He said you weren't with him for about an hour last night.
Yeah.
That's right.
"I was with a private eye named, uh, Gordie Liman."
–What's he got to do with Tio and Armadillo?
–Nothing.
It's a private matter.
I'd rather it stay that way.
I'm happy to help you if you're helping me.
–Are you?
–I have been.
But I'm just about through.
I guess I'll have to figure this out on my own.
What the hell was that all about?
Nothing.
Why didn't you just leave it here and call 911?
–This dog was sniffing around it.
–So?
It's a bone.
The arm probably fell out of the Dumpster when the truck picked it up.
Call city services.
Remand the truck.
Have some unis search it.
The rest of her might still be in that truck.
"If anyone deserves tonight's Grocey, it's you."
"Oh, thank you, honey, but it's really no big deal."
You don't mean that.
Do you?
"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews."
Is Cory home yet?
Nope.
"But soon, though."
I know.
"According to tape 56, he should be home tonight."
Late tonight.
So is it okay if we wait?
"Well, actually, we were on our way out."
"That's okay, it's okay."
I'm just going to take a hot bath.
What?
There's seepage at the trailer park.
"Shawn, I'd prefer that my son's friends didn't bathe in my home when I wasn't here."
Or ever.
"Still in a bad mood, huh, Mr. M?"
What bad mood?
"Well, me and my dad noticed it when we were last at the market."
"You know, we were eating our free samples, like we always do..."
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Sticking your own toothpicks in our turkey and steak does not make them free samples.
Fine!
We'll just take our business elsewhere.
"Now, Mr. Eric from the city, uh,"
"I'm flattered and everything, but why would a guy who's traveled back and forth across the state line be so keen on chatting up a small-town girl like me?"
You are unbelievable.
- That could be taken a couple of ways.
- Get out.
"Well, no ambiguity there."
Don't forget your brother's CD.
My eye!
"Man, I love sunsets."
The way the sky is streaked with color.
It's amazing.
"It's the pollution that makes those pretty colors, you know."
What you're enjoying is the effect of light passing through airborne poison.
"No, that's not what I'm really enjoying."
"Boy, I hope that's guacamole."

Can't we just go home?
If I gotta drag you to the doctor at 8 in the morning...
... youcancoolyourjets  while I get coffee.
I must look like an idiot.
Wish I could tell you different.
You're the reason we went to the eye doctor in the first place.
"You said, ""Throw me a piece of toast. """
I threw you a piece of toast.
"Two cups of regular coffee, please."
-My treat.
"-Oh, that makes up for everything."
"Pigeons can feed out of my eye socket, but I get a free cup of coffee."
Just the coffee.
Keep the change.
I'm gonna need your help until I get this patch off.
I am absolutely there for you.
For 30 years I work to build up trademark.
Just because we sign contract does not mean that I do not care what goes on.
"The only thing that concerns you, Norstaad, is that I have a further payment of $200,000 to meet in four months, and after that a continuing royalty of 5% on any furniture I sell under your trademark."
I will not let you cheat people under my name.
"That is my design on top, but not underneath."
This is not my chair.
This is not a piece of furniture.
This is toothpicks.
This is trash.
Parker!
Parker!
All right.
"If you want to play rough, I'll show you I can play a lot rougher."
Now go on.
Get out of here.
Get out of here before I bash in your thick skull!
All right.
I go.
But don't think that you bluff me for one minute.
Miss Morrow called about the certified check.
Never mind that.
Get me Reed on the phone right away.
- Who?
- Latham Reed!
And hurry it up.
Would you please tell Miss Morrow that Axel Norstaad is here?
"Sorry, but she isn't in."
Would you care to leave a message?
"No, I've got to talk to her."
I've got to see her right away.
"Well, she just this moment left."
When she will be back?
"Oh, don't be silly, Bob."
"Now we agreed it's just gonna be a nice, quiet dinner with a few close friends."
"Yeah, the... quieter, the better when you're past 40."
Why celebrate?
"I mean, it's- It's all downhill from here."
You're heading into the twilight time.
"You think I oughta cash in my chips, Howard?"
"I don't know, but I'd keep them handy, if I were you."
Okay.
"Here's your dinner, honey."
"Lettuce, cottage cheese, tomato, a slice of melon and some cold chicken."
- I hope it's all on your diet.
- A diet?
"What's wrong, Bob?"
"Oh, nothing."
"Bob just went for his physical today... and he's gotta lose weight, so he's gotta watch his calories for a while."
"Oh, that's"
- That's bad.
"No, it isn't, Howard."
A lot of people are on diets.
"Oh, no, no."
This is a bad diet.
"I mean, look at"
- Look at this.
"Cantaloupe and cottage cheese and tomatoes- I mean, it's full of carbohydrates."
"I mean, that's what you should be counting."
"- Well, what do you suggest, Howard?"
- Water.
You should drink water.
"I mean, just drink all your water you can get inside yourself."
"You know, just lots and lots of water."
"That way it'll fill up your stomach, and you won't get hungry."
Braiding each other's hair and having heart-to-hearts.
Then why are we still here?
we've already paid the check.
Serena.
- So we'll meet afterwards for the party. - will do.
"- Good luck up there, son. i'm proud of you."
- Thanks.
It's like getting a smile from the president.
And how are you?
I'm good. and you?
"Good, good. i start my internship"
At the mayor's office next week.so that's the big news.
As for today i got my mom and my grandpa
To agree to sit together so that's something.
- And things with you and
- Blair?
"Yeah, it's over. but it's okay."
"It turns out,we just had to go through something to be sure."
Ever since it ended i can't stop thinking
About how horribly i handled everything between us.
So i just wanted to say i'm sorry.
Thanks.
It means a lot. and thanks for what you did last year.
If i hadn't taken the s.a.t.s i'd never be going to n.y.u.
Right after i get back from my
"Backpacking trip through europe, of course."
Look at us--so civilized.
Hey stop by my party tonight.
Party?
what party?
After-grad party.
I figured i'd at least do something
Yes.
The joke.
"So, um..."
So there's this man.
"He rushes to the hospital, gets there, the doctor comes out, and he says, I'm so sorry."
"Wait, why is he rushing to the hospital?"
"Oh, his wife was in an accident."
Wait.
I thought I just said that.
So where was I?
Um...
"Oh right, she was in an accident, and the doctor says, uh..."
What kind of accident?
"Again, so, worst shape possible."
"She basically lost all of her limbs, so, the doctor says, you know, and she may not be able to recognize you ever, ever again, and the husband says, oh my gosh, this is terrible news."
"And the doctor says, by the way, she's dead."
"She's, she's dead."
"So a man hears that his wife's in a horrible accident, he rushes to the hospital."
"When he gets there, the doctor says, I'm so sorry, but the accident has left your wife blind, deaf, and mute, and she'll never be able to recognize you again."
"The guy's like, oh my God this is terrible news, and that's when the doctor says,"
I'm just kidding.
She's dead.
It's funnier.
30 seconds.
"Man, it's really our last one."
Ssh.
"Wrap up, wrap up, wrap up."
Shit.
"We gotta go, we can't go this way."
Okay.
You ready?
- Yeah.
I was sort of heard you on the phone.
I'm starting in the fall. uh i just transferred from b.u. scott.
I'm dan. nice to meet you scott.
- Maybe i'll£¬uh i'll see you around. - yeah.
We got this for you.
I'll take that. thank you.
What are you doing here?
What i should have done months ago.
In about five seconds your phones are all going to go off
With the latest gossip girl blast.
She is nothing if not punctual. allow me.
Remember all those secrets jenny amassed
When she was trying to protect you nelly?
Well now the world knows them too.
So looks like we have a winner.
Now if you don't mind...
How can you do this?
Letting some girl from brooklyn carry on our legacy?
Haven't you ever heard of a foreign queen?
Besides her dad is marrying lily bass£¬
So i think that makes her richer than all of you.
Not enough.
Okay so starting next year no more headbands
Except for this one.
- Thanks you can keep the change. - oh big spender.
Hey mom. it's really cool here.
Um i've already met some great people.
Yeah.
All right. all right. you were right about portland.
I think i'm gonna love it.
All right. yeah i--listen i gotta go all right?
- I'll--i'll call you soon. - well i'm done for the day.
"What are these, bitch cuffs?"
"My hand, man!"
No!
- Better get him out of here.
- Have fun.
What the hell are you doing?
I want to talk to you about the e-mail Coach Nelson sent you.
What?
The day he was murdered.
"Hey, Todd, wake up."
I know you got Nelson's e-mail and I know you were on his roof.
It's crazy.
This is our fault.
Was there someone else involved?
It wasn't supposed...
You talking about Vince Nelson's murder?
- Can I go or what?
- Todd!
Your coach was murdered!
Now tell me what do I gotta do to get your attention here!
Get down on the floor now!
I need an ambulance in here!
Get me an ambulance!
Preliminary cause of death is hypoxia which presented in cardiac arrest.
Did he have a history of brain seizures?
Medical records are on the way.
He was a wrestler.
He might've had a previous head injury.
"There were also several bruises on his arm, fractured ribs."
"Well, that could've happened while Flack was performing CPR."
What about this abrasion?
"Based on the lack of subdermal bruising, it occurred moments before death."
I probably wasn't right for you.
Daring?
What are you talking about?
"If a guy showers you with eternal love, suddenly you're suffocating."
"If he doesn't, it's what you want, isn't it?"
"You're so scared of losing, you never invest yourself in anything."
"Well, except your damn work, of course."
I just wanted to...
"Anna, please."
"Just tell him what he means to you,   or you'll spend the rest of your life thinking love hurts."
- But... how do you know?
"- Good night, Anna."
And good luck.
What if Camilla and Johan had already planned their future?
What if she'd love to have babies and he said he'd never leave her?
In my flat!
Frank was right.
I had to conquer my fear of defeat.
I had to risk the pain.
I had to go back into that flat.
"(footsteps on stairs, heavy breathing from bedroom)"
Johan?
"- Johan, I have to talk to you."
- You see any fucking Johan in here?
Anna!
Christ!
What happened?
"Oh, my God, Anna... (air rock music)"
Had I just blown all chances of ever seeing him again?
"Apparently, Johan had left the flat to go to some boat."
Of course!
The boat!
Right.
"Well, now, the way I got it figured... the girl probably"
Feels a lot of unconscious hostility
Toward that brother of hers.
"I mean, after all, he's the one having a good time."
And she's been shackled with her mom in the funny farm.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
It's not enough to kill her own brother.
"Ah, maybe yes, when you consider"
That now she's the only one that stands to
Inherit the whole Ramsey estate.
"Otis, I think you're the one that's crazy."
Maybe I am for listening to you.
It just doesn't make any sense.
"Well, anyway."
Wait a minute.
What about that Hester woman?
"I mean, hell, she's the one that's got all the money."
And she's still alive.
Yeah she sure is.
Hester is still alive.
And she's got no kinfolk.
Except that Audrey girl.
You know something?
"Maybe we ought to go after her, talk to Hester Ramsey."
Might give us some background information.
My god.
"That college education wasn't a total waste, was it?"
Why don't you give her a ring?
"Hell, I've been dying to see the inside of that house"
Ever since I was a kid and used to steal
"£ I'll lay my head down low, oh"
£ And I'll lay my head down low
"£ Lay my head down low, oh. £"
Let's go out the rear entrance.
Shirou!
Saber?
I'm surprised to see Saber with you.
You...
Archer!
What's with you finally showing up now?
530)}#09 The Distance Between Them
Isn't it obvious?
I sensed a threat to my Master and rushed to her side.
But it appears I was too late.
it's all over!
I'll fill you in on everything that happened so you just stand there and listen!
Looks like I arrived at the worst possible time.
You can say that again!
and now you decide to show up?
all right.
I'll rush to your side at once.
which Servant was eliminated?
It was the Rider-class Servant that disappeared.
but she was probably taken out by Caster.
The coward.
Then she really was all talk.
Rider died protecting her Master.
You are in no position to call her a coward.
A coward is a coward.
One who calls herself a hero should at least try to take her opponent out with her.
That she was defeated without resistance suggests she was unable to do so.
"You see you don't understand, you're not a hobbyist."
Where is Nick?
I need to talk to him.
I myself wouldn't mind knowing where he's hiding.
But is he home?
Because I've got news.
"I know he is your husband, but my god!"
"What's your news, love?"
"I wanted to tell Nick first, but uhm..."
I'm pregnant.
"Jenny, love, that's fantastic!"
"Oh, my sweet, that's wonderful."
Are you sure?
"Yeah, the doctor found out while he was checking my urine for... for no reason."
I'm going to be a great-grandmother!
No!
"No, Mum, you're going to be a grandmother, you're still going to be a grandmother."
"Oh, even better."
Was it a surprise?
"Well, I have been feeling quite queasy in the mornings but..."
I put that down to other factors.
"Oh, that boy."
"I'll give him credit, hat's off, you know?"
He gets the job done.
Although you know with the extra mouth to feed and everything...
"Oh, its little mouth."
"We might not be able to move out straight away, we might need to stay a little bit longer if that's okay."
That's lovely.
"It's better than okay, poppet."
"It's better than okay, better than okay."
"I need to tell Nick, I can't wait any longer."
"Hi, hi Nick, it's me."
You always seem to get what you want in the end.
The only thing I want in the world is you.
That's why-- why I texted Denise:
"because I want to be a part of your life,"
- all parts of your life.
- Uh-huh.
"Well, your methodology is disqualifying."
I'm so-
- I'm s--
I'm sorry--
You traumatized my daughter.
You traumatized me in the process.
We have no future together.
"If you never believe anything I say again, believe that."
Hey.
"If you care anything about what's left of your little family unit, you might want to tell your ex-husband to cry uncle because when I get done with him..."
It's just difficult to destroy dads without daughters becoming collateral damage.
"Sometimes ex-wives, too."
Fuck you.
Finally.
You get stuck in the stairwell?
Move.
Let's look at the arrest report.
[chatter]
Man:
Yeah.
I'm on it.
You did all this?
It's impressive.
I hope my daughters grow up to be this capable.
"You're a great lawyer, Lucy, with a great future."
But not everybody is cut out for trial work.
I believe the number-one source of violence in our world is poverty.
"Now, we were poor in my neighbourhood."
Sometimes we couldn't even eat.
"And my best friend Ricky, he had it worse than us."
One day things got so desperate for Ricky he made a plan to rob the corner store.
And I told my mother about it.
You know what she did?
"She had him over, cooked him a full meal and told him that he could stay with us as long as he wanted."
And it was then that I realised that if you feed a man... you take away his propensity for violence.
"Come on, we're gonna be late."
"Hey, hey, hey-"
"No, no, no."
That's-
"- No, that's not-- That's not--"
This is not happening right now.
"Clyde, we've had this conversation."
My boss does not like squirrels.
It's a bird feeder.
Will you at least look at me when I'm talking to you?
"Look, man, I like squirrels personally, but you're getting me in trouble."
Do you see this?
You know what this is?
Hey.
We gonna need backup?
We're working.
Come on.
- We have any more Robitussin?
"- Yes, sir."
In the car.
"No, I'll get it, it's all right."
Quiet night?
We're under attack by squirrels.
"You play my wife, you bastard, I'll kill you and all of you..."
Do you have permission to have this Noid mutated?
Delicious breast milk for your cookies!
"It's no noid, it's Sara."
"Do not waste it, I'm too old for the way I like it."
- I know where the rebel Noids are.
- Where are they!
"I traded with them, thinking I would trade enough."
Trade with fugitive humanoids?
Maybe you get only 30 years.
"And old Sara, she should be more than happy to return to the local palaces of pleasure."
"""And give milk... for cookies!"""
- It's okay!
I'll help you!
We have to wait for them at the meeting place.
They always arrive at eight.
There are only a few kilometers.
"Okay, biscuit."
Daddy's here now.
Is Dad.
I will protect you.
"Have you no manners, son of a bitch?"
- Do you have any more weapons?
- Pissing ice balls on the icebergs?
"This is all my team, long before your time."
"Sergeant Ulysses H. Cage, Spartan-3."
Retired after 30 years of service in the field.
Be my butt.
The Spartans do not retreat.
They die like a hero.
Or they pee like cowards.
Put this piece of gun away and I'll show you exactly how cowardly I am.
"I believed your promises, your promises and lies."
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
You made me throw it all away.
My morals left to decay.
How many you betray.
You've taken everything
My head is filled with disease.
My skin is begging you :
"""please""."
I'm on my hands and knees.
I want so much to believe.
I want so much to believe.
You fucking promised me.
You promised me.
You promised me.
You promised me.
You promised me.
"nine inch nails, last call, around here please, hello, over here, very good you're learning, go right in here, nine inch nails, your favorite"
you what?
what's up?
what's up dude?
"you are baby, you are donna, look at that one do it again?"
she needs a hickey mark isn't that fuckin awesome?
-what are you doing on assholes ?
-she needs a hickey mark on her wrist why is your tongue green?
"hangover, i did too many drugs and alcohol, i have a hangover"
El Duce !
you see?
yeah all right don't mind me
All of my internal organs are women.
"Listen, I have an early surprise birthday present for you."
"- When is your birthday, by the way?"
- In about six months.
Then this is very early.
You know the director Jim Jarmusch...
"Down by Law, Broken Flowers?"
"- Yeah, I love his movies."
"- Well, I saw Jarmusch the other night."
"He has very good hair, just..."
"Anyway, he wants to meet with you, give you a script to read."
- Why does he want me to read?
- He loves your first novel and he wants you to do a revision of one of his screenplays.
You're gonna meet him at a film society party tomorrow sometime and I've set the whole thing up for you.
I don't know.
I really should be working on my book.
"And look, I don't know how to write screenplays."
You need a computer program or something.
- It's crazy.
- Don't be a milquetoast.
This is a very big opportunity for you.
It could be a life changer.
Can one screenplay really change a life?
Sometimes.
Do I want my life to change?
"Most people do, Jonathan."
"Oh, shit, there's Antrem and Priscilla."
Don't turn around.
Don't draw attention.
Just sit...
Just sit there.
Who are they?
Please let me play till that match.
If it's tennis you can still play in high school.
"No matter what, I want the team members to go to the Nationals together."
Swing the racket for me to see.
Your Zero-Shiki Drop Shot.
(Zero Degree Drop Shot)
Stop.
Being your therapist I can tell you that this is your limit point.
That move of yours will add on to your injuries.
You must not use the Zero-shiki Drop Shot under any circumstances.
Alright?
Hi.
What's the matter?
Have your injury recovered?
All thanks to you.
Recover well.
Competition is one week away.
Up or down?
Up.
- Up.
- I will serve first then.
Let's have a proper match.
"As the captain, you'll lose face if you don't win."
Give me all you've got.
You sure?
"Echizen, you're strong but if you don't get better, we will not win in the Nationals."
Give me your best shot.
I won't go easy so give me all you've got.
"Give me all you've got and improve yourself, Echizen."
Why did you transfer schools?
Didn't it cross your mind that the Nationals are filled with the best players.
- Even stronger than yourself?
Who's number one?
No one ever seen him.
But he once killed three ninjas... with a fingernail file.
Who's this?
"There's a place about two blocks up from you, it's look like a hardware store."
"If it's closed, that's only what the sign says."
"Hold on, hold on, I gotta take a piss."
Oh what else is it...
How many times you must take a piss and you gotta take a piss?
- Not every time
- Good spot here.
"Every single time I gotta take a piss, you gotta take a piss!"
"You're not supposed to look down when you pee next to another man, ok?"
- I'm not looking...
"- You're lookin' down, I saw you look down!"
- I'm looking at your face.
"- My man, why are you looking at me all?"
Dude you get me worried about you sometimes.
Don't you know pee etiquette man?
Let's hope she hurries.
What's the big deal?
!
Who's comin' over?
It's not important.
It's not like I'm asking you to tell me where you stashed that money or anything.
I'm expecting company because of something else I did.
What else did you do?
I robbed somebody.
Somebody else that's not our Boss?
Yea.
Who?
- Donnie Daffo.
Cripes.
You think he got enough film?
Hmm.
WOMAN:
What?
Do I even want to know?
When did we knock over the coat rack?
Maybe it was that night we played drunk charades.
You remember.
"No, he doesn't remember 'cause he passed out on the couch."
"Well, I guess this explains the green light we see over here sometimes."
"Yeah, but why is this thing bolted to the ﬂoor?"
"I don't know, but I don't like it."
I don't like the sound it's making either.
"Uh, or how about the half-naked photos of me on the wall?"
That's the one thing I do like about this situation.
(SIGHS)
I knew something wasn't right about that old man.
"Hi, Mr. Kendall, this is Finn from Sycamore Apartments."
I'm calling you back about Mr. Bezzerides.
"If you can please ring me when you get a chance, that would be great."
Thank you.
What did the landlord say?
I just left a voice mail.
Okay.
I'm off to work.
"I counted the cookies, so if any go missing, there will be murder in this apartment."
I'll guard 'em.
"Well, who's going to guard 'em from you?"
(GASPS)
(SCOFFS) it's a perfect match.
It's got to be a coincidence.
♪ That someday ♪
♪ That we can learn to love ♪
♪ Just one more day. ♪
Wonderful!
Thanks.
"Dang, cuz."
You got to perform a gig at the shrimp truck.
Pro Bono?
At least until you win your first Grammy.
(chuckles)
"Well, since we're on the topic of regrets-- you not pursuing your music-- I'll share mine."
Years ago I had the opportunity to participate in Doctors Without Borders.
"It was a six month stint in Mozambique, but I decided not to take it."
Why not?
"Well, you know, dealing with living, breathing patients isn't exactly my strong suit."
That's why I took up a career in forensic pathology.
"Apparently, some people consider me awkward and off-putting."
"No, that's crazy."
"No way, Doc, not you."
Thank you.
"And yourself, any regrets?"
Please.
I'm a two-time felon.
I own four businesses now.
It's the oppa that acted arrogant before.
Did the owner change?
Wasn't this Daniel's shop?
Did Daniel say that he's the owner?
Daniel and I are both owners.
"Then, Daniel..."
I heard he was banned from entering our country.
I don't know that fool.
We're still looking.
I'll send you a copy of the report when I get one.
"Hey, tell your father not to be such a stranger."
I'm forgetting how ugly his mug is.
You're lucky you didn't get his looks.
"Oh, shit."
So you're telling me your sister is on a TV that is completely cut off from any sort of signal?
"Yes, that is why I need to call her now."
"- Anna, you know it's against the rules."
Only one 5-minute call at the end of each day.
"You know, it's easier to just deliberate and get it over with then to try to get out of it."
"If I tell the judge you think people are trying to talk to you through a TV that's not even connected, what do you think she's going to say?"
You're right.
"Look, Anna, I know it sucks being down here, but look at the bright side."
Maybe you'll make a friend or two.
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
"- No, menstrual cycles are late, lawyers are on time."
"Time is money, isn't that right?"
Yeah.
It's 7:30 in the morning.
"It's 7:51, actually."
Hi.
"Can I get you a drink, sir?"
- Coffee.
He'll have a Bud.
I'll have coffee.
And he's had enough.
This is my first.
"Right, Danielle?"
Just messing with you.
Why do you do that?
"All we know is he's got a gun, maybe worse."
Gibbs says he's got a backup unit on the way.
We don't make any moves until they get here.
I'm gonna let McGee know.
I can't believe you do this every day.
"Well, not every day, and not like this."
You sure we're not too conspicuous?
Not if we stand here like we're just talking to each other.
We are talking to each other.
You two with NCIS?
I am.
Special Agent Ellie Bishop.
Special Agent DiNozzo.
And I'm Jake Malloy.
Lieutenant Janet Lewis.
"Now, where is this alleged imposter?"
He just went into the men's room.
Calm and cool.
Secure this whole area.
No one enters until I say.
Not quite the cavalry we were expecting.
"Yeah, well, I expected to be home right now getting my cranberries started, but we can't have everything."
You have your service weapons?
"Oh, not me."
"I'm a-an attorney, with NSA."
"Attorneys stand over there, please."
Be careful.
I will be.
Adorable.
"Okay, now, let's keep our weapons out of sight until we get in there."
Last thing we want to do is panic this crowd.
Can't we just evacuate this terminal?
"Equip the ARX-7 with a rapid deployment booster and Boxer shot cannon, and have it stand by in the elevator."
Aye.
Thank you.
I want everyone to make it back safely!
She says...
The communication line just opened on its own.
Did someone let us hear that on purpose?
Who knows.
But I never would've expected Tessa to argue so forcefully with the XO like that.
"She wants everyone to make it back safely, huh?"
"What do you think, guys?"
"That's what I intend to do, of course."
"We can't make our princess sad, now can we?"
To think she'd be so worried about us...
I'm honestly moved!
It's just like her.
She's a good officer.
We have until 0600 hours.
"If you call yourselves pros, you'd better live up to that."
I don't make mistakes.
"You don't make mistakes, either."
And that's going to get everything wrapped up nice and tight.
Got that?
- Roger!
- Roger!
- Roger!
What a horrible look you've got on your face.
Are you worried?
Or maybe torn?
"What happened to the ""saint"" I knew?"
I'm disappointed.
You're full of internal conflict now.
I didn't get your name.
Shawna.
Hi.
- And you are...?
- Therapist.
From Cardiology.
Really?
Your husband has to undergo an angioplasty.
"That's where we're going to insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg, and we're gonna use it to inflate a balloon that will open the blockage."
"Well, good luck, Mr. Rappaport."
I have to get back to my other patients.
It was nice to meet you.
Excuse me for just one second.
Whoa.
That was close.
Thanks.
I-I really owe you one.
"Hey, listen, if you ever need a sex therapist..."
I think I'm good.
"Now that you mention it, do you ever do any pro bono work?"
"Yes, I spoke to your resident, and he thought a hold was unnecessary, but I disagree, and all I'm asking is for a second assessment from another attending."
Watch it!
"No, Dr. Wakita, not you."
"Hey, Jerry, where have you been?"
I was getting worried about you.
Everyone was acting as if I'd sent you out in a hurricane.
Are you okay?
What the hell happened to King Funshine?
Did you get hit by lightning again?
He didn't get hit by lightning.
Here's your change.
Okay.
Very well done.
- No.
No.
Isabel!
- Roderick?
"- Please, no!"
- Roderick.
"Roderick, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry.
- After all the girls I brought through this place you owe me.
I want the Porter girl.
- One would wonder if you had her admitted to have your way with her.
- I've always loved that girl.
- Let's say we revisit the topic of Isabel Porter's future after tomorrow night's event.
- Hmm.
Fine.
How's the exposure?
Should be fine.
- I want her to hear it from you.
I fear she has too strong of a connection to my voice.
- I'm a surgeon.
- It's not a request.
- Fine.
You are Mary Bradbury.
You are awaiting trial for witchcraft and immorality of the highest order.
"Mary Bradbury, you are accused of crimes most heinous."
Admit that you are wrong and repent or you will be condemned to murder by hanging.
"But of course what interests me, my dear, is how an evolution in identity can manifest itself in the amygdala."
"But then again, a tree is still a tree, is it not?"
"- Mm, Gunther."
"- You need to eat, Mary."
- Please... help me.
But any more griping from ya and I'll put you out of your misery.
Understood?
"Oh, fresh water."
We should be heading farther inland.
"And if I wanted your opinion, captain taylor, I'd have asked for it."
"I'll have you hanged for this, moore."
Not if I put a hole through your skull first you won'T.
"Jacob, he's a valuable hostage."
Do you seriously propose to throw away an asset like the captain?
Take him back to the beach!
You're asking me?
If you're so pleased.
This way.
Mutineers.
"Friday, that's an english ship."
That means escape.
But it commandeered by mutineers.
What if the captain and his crew were reinstated?
"That is a very big ""if"" under these circumstances."
The crew is circled.
The captain is wounded and the mutineers are at least 25 strong.
What are those?
Where?
There.
Womenfolk.
Must be the captain's wife and daughter.
Your womenfolk are shaped like bells.
No wonder you went to sea.
Then we have to know that the captain would be on our side before we try anything.
Come on!
No stopping!
Push it!
There must be some way to stop him.
Things are out of control now.
I'm running out of options.
Wait.
Mace...
You can't be serious.
"- I mean, what would the Illuminati say?"
- If I wasted the gargoyle?
"Lt'll be a black mark, no question of that."
I'll be severely reprimanded.
"But if I allow Goliath to become the first prisoner who ever escaped Hotel Cabal, the flushing sound you hear will be me and my 75-year pension going down the drain."
Notice the one-way mirror.
(thud)
- I can't miss.
"It's checkout time, gargoyle."
"- I don't think so, Mace."
Bluestone!
Whoa.
- Going up?
"- As a matter of fact, I am."
Hold on!
"You played me for a fool, Bluestone!"
You and the gargoyle were in this together!
"What can I say, Mace?"
"(laughs) When you're right, you're right."
"I'll see that you get yours, Bluestone."
Nobody double-crosses Mace Malone!
Nobody!
Poor Mace.
Wonder how long it'll take him to realize he dropped his key.
"(Matt) OK, I admit it."
"To save Goliath's life I had to forfeit my chance to get in good with the Illuminati, bust their organization wide open."
Our torturers are very unhappy people.
They don't know what they are doing and are subjecting themselves to eternal suffering.
I'm living here and now and not elsewhere!
And God for me...
I beg your pardon.
If you don't believe in God what do you believe in?
I believe that there is God.
But he doesn't give a damn for me and my troubles!
Stop shouting!
I can't sleep.
It's time to go to sleep.
You had a rough day today.
"Solomon, your decisions frighten me."
The petitioner is right.
You're not building a road to God.
You're building a wall of fear.
Hundreds of people bow to me.
Fear is the only thing that makes them succumb to me and create something.
Piss faster!
Why are you jumping around like a drunken kangaroo?
He shoved me.
Who?
He... there he is sitting.
In black.
He is staring at me all the time.
Calm down.Tell me who is staring at you?
The man in black sitting on a toilet.
He is holding a piece of paper in his hand.
Close your eyes and touch your nose first with your right and then with your left hand.
Are you making an idiot out of me?
You do have problems.
Has it ever happened to you before?
- Does Vicki know about this?
- No.
And I don't want her to know.
I've been targeted and that puts everyone who's close to me in danger.
"Oh, gee..."
Thanks for bringing me into this.
"Okay, if only one of you can work this town, how do I know I'm not going to like this other vampire more than you?"
"Because I'm the devil you know, detective."
"Yes, you are."
Okay.
Two conditions.
"One, we find this thing, we put it down."
I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What's the second?
- Full disclosure.
"I ask you something, you answer."
"I want to know what color your underwear is, you tell me."
You got it?
Red.
"Silk, actually."
"I'm not actually asking, Fitzroy."
When do we start?
As soon as somebody phones the police about a dead body.
Got a quarter?
I feel so bad for that Evan guy.
He blames himself for Gene's death.
Does he have reason to?
Typical Friday night.
Go train in from the burbs.
Burger and a movie after the Underground.
They must have up to something.
"Come on, you don't go out for a burger and wind up as the main course at an insect buffet."
Just tell me what you need.
All right?
I'm easy.
I'm going to keep a happy thought and assume this is just a negotiating tactic.
"All right, listen to me very carefully."
You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best legal representation ever.
But no deals with the DEA!
All right?
Badger will not identify anyone to anybody.
"If he does, you're dead!"
Why don't you just kill Badger?
"Follow me, guys, but if a mosquito's buzzing around you, it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the mosquito's attorney."
You go grab a flyswatter.
"I mean, so to speak."
"I mean, all due respect, do I have to spell this out for you?"
"We're not killing Badger, yo!"
Then you got real problems.
'Cause the DEA is gonna come down on your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.
I mean.
"I don't think I'm going out on a limb here, but he's not gonna like prison."
He's gonna sing like Céline Dion regardless of what you do to me.
Mr. Mayhew?
I recognize your cough.
Take that mask off.
Get some air.
Go on.
Take it easy!
"Breathe in, breathe out."
"I'm gonna stand up, all right?"
'Cause I got bad knees.
That's better.
Ok.
"I mean, if it's too complicated for you, and your kids and your divorce and your..."
And not to mention your presidential bid.
We can honestly just pretend that last night never happened.
"I mean, no."
Not that it wasn't memorable...
"I mean, it was."
It was...
"You know, it was great."
But...
"But if you don't think this will definitely work, you're probably right."
"Well, there's just one problem."
I like you.
Oh!
Great!
You like me.
"So, what does that mean?"
We get to hold hands at Cindy Burke's Roller Rink party?
"No, I was thinking maybe dinner."
Maybe sushi.
"I don't rent out entire restaurants, unlike some people."
"Oh, no."
He...
"Actually, he owns it."
My point being...
"People are gonna see us, Kitty."
And I want you to know that I won't be caring.
Previously on Brothers and Sisters:
You're gonna buy my interest in Ojai Foods.
Holly and I are going to take the proceeds from the sale of the stock and buy Greendale Winery.
Sex will replace my drug addiction with...
After rehab you're sworn to celibacy?
Please.
"Thank you, Sister."
"And you, Mother, for agreeing to see me."
"I'm sorry, but this is a personal matter."
"Don't worry, there are no secrets here."
"And, anyway, Sister Marie has taken a vow of silence, so there is nothing to worry about."
Please speak freely.
I may need your help soon.
"And I apologize if I'm being presumptuous, but... this is a place of God, and..."
Yes?
"If there were any other place my friends could turn, believe me..."
You need us to hide some people who may or may not be in trouble with the authorities?
I'm not sure that they will be free to come.
- A very small number of them.
- Men?
"Yes, but only for a short time."
I'm so sorry.
But I can't.
"Mother, please!"
They'll be recaptured in the woods or killed.
The Germans are very thorough.
Every inch will be searched.
These men will be found.
"When the sisters of the Abbey St. Germain were caught trying to hide refugees, only four Sisters were left alive that night."
Barely.
I'm so sorry.
I will pray for them.
"For you, in this fight."
But I cannot let anything happen to the Sisters in my care.
I understand.
Thank you.
You are very brave.
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"Yeah, well, it's-- it's a mess."
Would you like to grab some coffee?
That's a spectacularly bad idea.
You're right.
I grabbed the wrong file.
"I meant to grab the file of ""reasonably bad ideas,"""
"but I grabbed the ""spectacularly bad ones"" instead."
Been that kind of day.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Just one.
"This is dumb, hanging out here waiting for him."
"Well, do you really wanna go on a tour of a video arcade or a $2 movie theater?"
Or he could be hiking in Griffith Park for all we know.
"I know, I know."
We should've put one of those things that they put on dogs so you can track 'em.
Don't be snippy with me.
I'm not on your damn TV show.
"God, I hate this day."
"Well, I'm not exactly over the moon about it, either."
I know what Jonathan would do.
"He would call some friend in Washington, and there'd be some really fancy, expensive detective here with Justin in about four hours."
"Well, why don't you call him?"
"You know, you really can tell me the problem with him."
I swear I won't judge.
The problem... doesn't feel like you and Dad.
I guess they don't make 'em like that anymore.
Oh.
Look.
"Oh, yeah..."
- We've just had too many damn blessings.
Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
david:
Get off!
Get the fuck off me!
(REWlNDlNG)
(GUNSHOTS)
DAVID:
I don't know how they got in.
"I mean, how can they have gotten the door code?"
It changes every shift.
Unless someone...
They knew the code and I told Mere... I told Meredith to lock herself inside the broadcast room to broadcast over the emergency channel.
-(pounding)
-Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
They've cut into all our other secure lines of communication.
I don't know how.
"I mean, who could know that much?"
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
Wait.
What did he just say?
(REWlNDlNG)
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
katherine:
They cut into the operator line?
You did speak to someone on the phone.
You spoke to the operator.
Yes.
"I swear to God, if you were pretending to talk to someone..."
"Katherine, I gave him the code."
He verified the code.
"Yeah, but did you verify him?"
I'm home!
Welcome back.
"Good evening, sensei."
Good to see you Tomoko.
came to see me.
"She seemed very lonely, so I invited her to come see the ocean."
Oh.
Did you eat?
Yes.
Then you should take a bath.
"Alright, we'll practice more later."
Take your positions now.
Take a fan.
"You can hear the waves, can't you?"
"Tomoko, the time I've spent as your teacher will fade into the distant past."
"Since I was a child, I think I've been too dependent on the love and good will of others."
I think I got too dependent on the goodness of your heart.
I think that I hurt your chances of being happy and finding someone to marry.
"No, that's not true."
It wasn't a sacrifice.
It was I who was dependent on you and Shinako.
I didn't do anything.
"There's something worrying you, isn't there Tomoko?"
There's something I've been keeping a secret from you two.
What is it?
Do you have some problem?
"If there's something bothering you that you can't tell me about, please talk to Shinako about it."
I'll leave you two alone.
What's going on?
I'm drunk.
Oh.
"Mother, Takehara is over there."
And you know why?
Because they're ignorant and they're dumb as shit.
"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is democracy."
- God damn it.
- It's the 12th Amendment.
- I have 20th Amendment.
- Why are there so many amendments?
"Get it right the first time, people."
It's actually both. 12th is superseded by the 20th.
They give the House until January 20th to elect the president.
Each state gets one vote.
First candidate to 26 is the new president and the Senate chooses the VP.
It's a close election with a ton of House races too close to call.
What happens if it's a tie in the House?
Right.
- Is it a dance-off?
"Well, vice president-elect becomes president."
Whoever the Senate has picked for VP will be president.
"- Wait, that means..."
- That Tom...
- What?
- Could be the president.
"Well, I..."
I had literally no idea.
It's good to be prepared.
"So, wait."
So you mean that I...
I might lose this election to my fucking vice president?
"At least it'd be somebody from our team, ma'am."
"I mean, that's good, right?"
I didn't mean to make her cry.
"There, there."
Good night.
Lita.
[sighs] [elevator humming] [sobbing]
Lita.
[Sandover's voice] The perfect embezzlement.
It may be said that Rome was not built in a day.
"Well, neither was Fort Knox;"
neither was the treasure of the Incas.
"The undiscoverable acquisition of $201,000, bill by bill, month after month, year after year, is a financial feat worthy of Clem P. Sandover... [jazz playing] [clock ticking]"
- Having trouble?
- Oh no.
I do this for exercise.
It helps my strawberries get ripe.
Anybody home over there?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Why?
"Oh, I'm looking for real estate."
"Well, you can have any of mine, this truck included."
You know this is the second time in three weeks that I've missed the early market?
You know how long I've been asleep in that cab waiting for it to be light enough to fix this thing?
[jazz playing]
[song repeating] [engine revving]
Lita Krail murdered?
She-- she can't be.
She just can't be.
"Beth, why are you so frightened?"
"Last night you told me that you didn't like her, that you didn't trust her."
It's just that I can't believe it.
I'd like to talk to your husband.
He's-- he's gone out already.
I-
- I don't know where.
Your wife told me to ask if you could help me.
She's in bad trouble.
Her neighbors complained to the landlord about her dog.
He told her to get rid of the animal.
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.
"When the landlord found out, he got mad and told her to leave."
Now she can't stay even if she gets rid of it.
I'm so ashamed!
He said he'd get the police to throw us out on the street.
"I'm sorry, but..."
I could give you a couple dollars to help you move.
I can't move!
I want you to talk to him!
Tell him I want to stay here!
What's your landlord's name?
His name is Signor Roberto.
"He lives on Fourth Street, near here."
"They break the windows, they dirty the floors..."
"A real pig-sty, eh?"
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.
She says she's been evicted for no good reason.
"She's a poor widow, she has nobody to take care of her."
"She has no relatives, no money."
All she has is this neighborhood.
I already rented the place to another family.
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.
She got rid of the animal that caused all the trouble.
So let her stay.
Impossible.
"""you have cut me up to back too far."
"""You're worse than Mario Chalmers"
"""and Tiago Splitter if they were ever barbers."
"""You should have your barber's license revoked."
"You should never be able to cut anybody's hair."""
"Have fun with your life, man."
I have fun doing this for y'all.
You gotta have fun.
You don't know how long you're gonna be here.
You gotta keep yourself in shape.
You lift weights?
All the time.
"He's like, ""Yeah, I lift."
"Yeah."""
"Look, man, you gotta keep yourself in shape, 'cause you don't wanna get ""stitties."""
Stitties.
Stomach titties.
You ever seen that?
Be a big-ass piece of meat just falling down here.
"Big-ass piece of meat just falling all the way down here, look like you can play hacky-sack with it."
You just go just like this here.
"Hey, folks, I can talk about it, 'cause I used to be fat."
"I used to be big as hell, okay?"
"I was 5'8"", I was 250 pounds, and I was 17."
That's a fat fuck.
That's what it is.
"I lost 75 pounds in, like, four months."
"I'm not kidding about this, you know what I'm saying?"
It's real.
You can do it.
"But, you know, it was bad."
"You know, I was one of those little fat kids that didn't want nobody to see my breasts."
- Sure.
And smiles.
Many people need it.
It's the British specialty.
And we must remember the Belgian spectators
That the current conflicts between Flanders and Wallonia
Are counterproductive.
- Unbearable.
The image of our king is the only force that unites us.
That's why it must be perfect.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
Excuse me.
- You are welcome.
Belgium.
Is it a real country or just a geopolitical compromise?
I do not know.
But he has a palace and a king.
"And a queen, who hired me to shoot a documentary about her husband,"
"Nicolas III, the King of the Belgians."
"Mr. Lloyd, I remember the rule number one: no interviews."
And rule number two:
No improvisations.
Sooner or later I would like to discuss this.
His contract speaks clearly.
Just follow the script.
"They did not know I was filming, which gave me hope."
Here's the boring part.
I follow their script and film the king who makes the king.
Have you been here already?
This is the first time.
But the scene serves to appreciate this unlikely story.
His own story.
And I think one of these men either has the coins or knows where they are.
Our deal was for me to find Marquesa.
"Well, I did that."
"These coins, however, present a whole new business opportunity."
So you want to be my partner?
This is the guy Marquesa went after.
That's him coming out of his condo.
I got names and addresses on all of them.
You need me.
Not anymore.
[Snarls]
[Growling]
[Beeps]
"So, Mr. Adams, you must have found something that wasn't good for you."
Adalind?
"Hi, Juliette."
I'm glad you remember me.
Of course I remember you.
"Well, I just wasn't sure if I should come by since things didn't work out with Hank, you know."
"Oh, stop."
I don't take my patients based on their owners' social lives.
"I'm glad you came in, and I'm glad you brought your cat."
"Well, I am relieved to hear that because Majique"
- seems to be pretty sick.
"- Oh, no."
What seems to be the problem with miss Majique?
She's just not herself.
She's sluggish.
She won't eat.
I'm pretty worried.
Do you think it's serious?
"Well, I hope not, but I'm probably going to want to keep her overnight to run some tests."
The midwife was Joanne Braxton.
She stole the dead woman's child?
It's the only birth she attended that fits with Roland's age.
And then she and her husband left the area shortly after.
What about Roland's father?
Is he still alive?
He is.
He was working out of the province at the time of his wife's death.
He never questioned the official report.
My God!
No one knows the baby exists.
No one misses him.
No one mourns him.
"He is yours, Julia."
Is this good news or bad?
What would William say?
He still doesn't know.
Keeping a secret this profound from him would be a betrayal of the trust between us.
But if I tell him...
He will feel duty-bound to return Roland to his father.
So leaving him in blissful ignorance could be the better path.
If you think you can do that.
Sir?
I found a missing persons' report that matches our victim.
- Who is it?
- A Hugo de Jaager.
Left his family home in Peterborough for Toronto a week ago.
Hasn't been heard from since.
- What's all this?
"- Sir, this is his research."
He told his mother before he left he was sure he was going to find her this time.
"- ""Her""?"
"If it wasn't on a boat, I don't want it."
Stop buying things from Italy.
You are not a millionaire.
We
- We are not millionaires.
"The first thing we gotta do is find a reliable, non-asthmatic person... to cash in this ticket A.S.A.P., or we're dead."
Funny you should mention that.
- I think I have another candidate.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Who?
This guy that I was seeing when I was waitressing at the racetrack.
I think he still works there too.
A real sweet guy.
"Bought me a really expensive parrot, too, from Brazil or something."
My cat bit its head off.
"You hated that fucking bird, didn't you, sweetie?"
"The racetrack, eh."
"Well, actually, he's an unofficial employee."
He injects horses with some shit that makes them run faster.
Forget it.
Cross him offthe list.
Forget him.
Who else?
"There is Scatter, the guy who installed my carpet."
- I went to high school with him.
- The man's name is Scatter?
"Yeah, well, he's a total coke freak, which could work in our favor because he usually needs money."
"No, junkies are problematic."
Let's keep thinking.
Mm-hmm.
- Wanna have sex?
"- Oh, yeah."
"but I'm here now, dear."
Mother.
So I sent you here to wed a king
And find you engaged to a bastard.
"My darling, your engagement"
To francis was a careful negotiation set in place
When you were six.
And now you tell me
That you threw it all away because of a prophecy.
"One I believe, mother."
I did this and bash went along with it to save francis's life.
From a fate a magician predicted.
"Mother, it's all very..."
Complicated.
And we haven't been together in so long.
I came to the convent for your 11th birthday.
"Half the ship's crew died along the way,"
But I was there.
Gift in hand.
I only meant to say that...
I've missed you.
"And I wanted to talk to you about this, about francis,"
"About bash, a-about everything."
Please don't make light of nostradamus's warning
Or my choice.
I make light of nothing concerning you
Or our country's future.
Perhaps if you met bash.
He's-he's kind and-and selfless and brave.
Do you love him?
I'm beginning to.
It all happened so fast.
I'm out of gas and so is he.
If I don't get him into a bed his UTI's turning into urosepsis.
I got to make water!
"Yo, doc!"
- You are one sadistic bitch.
- Now give me your middle finger.
I would if I could.
Any emergency meetings get scheduled?
"Just one, about this spate of ER closures in the area."
I've advised the board that preliminary figures show an increase in our patient load by 34 percent.
- Who'd you take to La Scala's?
- Sorry?
Which board member's ass are you kissing?
- Now the ring finger.
"- Robert, I simply compiled a report."
- Nerve regeneration's a millimeter a week.
- I'm not kissing ass.
It's not my dominant hand.
"In fact, I only agreed to take on your responsibilities out of necessity."
I'll be in my office in two weeks...
- ... and back in the OR in two months.
- I hope you are.
Thought about upping your Vicodin?
Ibuprofen.
I want to stay clear-headed.
- That's enough for today.
"- No, keep going."
"Sorry, have another patient."
"Don't get comfortable, Kerry."
- Is there anything else?
- Just your continued support.
Lizzy.
"Leaving, not going up."
"What was that all about - five minutes, where did that come from?"
You...
It's the human male from the Institute.
What's he doing here?
"Suggest we melt his brain using projectile acid fish, and then interrogate him."
Other way round.
Am I going to have the nightmare tonight?
Definitely not.
How do you know?
Because someone's coming to help.
Who?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Is it one of your stories?
Your definitely true ones?
Huh!
All my stories are true.
Like how you were born behind the clock face of Big Ben?
Accounting for my acute sense of time.
And you invented fish.
Because I dislike swimming alone.
So what's this one?
There's a man called the Doctor.
"He lives on a cloud in the sky, and all he does, all day every day, is to stop all the children in the world ever having bad dreams."
I've been having bad dreams.
He's been on holiday.
But I am confident he has now returned to work.
"And as a matter of fact, he's right here..."
"Aren't you, Doctor?"
Bloomin' hell!
The children have been very naughty!
"Get back, now, quickly."
It's the first symptom of flett-giordano.
Would you just excuse me for just one moment?
Where's Elka?
She said this thing had no symptoms... and I'm out there... limping around like Dr. house.
Elka said she looked it up on Wikipedia.
Wikipedia?
Wikipedia says that I'm 37.
And I should know.
"I'm the one who ""corrected"" it."
"Okay, calm down."
I'll look it up online.
Oh.
I'm terribly sorry.
Uh...
"So in, in terms of publicity,"
"I was thinking-- miss Chase, when exactly were you diagnosed?"
"Uh, last week."
Why?
The most acute symptoms... occur within the first week of onset.
"By now, you should be having trouble with... facial drooping, involuntary body spasms, word slurring, hysteria."
"Boy, this thing is awful."
"Yes, it is."
That's why we applaud your courage in going public... with such a disfiguring disease.
Disfiguring?
Who said anything about disfiguring?
Well.
There's that hysteria.
"Miss Chase,"
"I understand why you're wearing this scarf, but may we just take a look?"
"Oh, um, listen."
Could you just excuse me for just one more second?
Wow.
"You don't keep a lot of old, useless paperwork around, do you?"
I have found shredders to be quite useful in eliminating clutter.
"- Miles, what's happening?"
- Did I say something was happening?
"If I knew something was happening and I told you, then I might be seen to be conspiring with you, which, of course, I never would."
Conspiring with me?
About what?
Conspiring with you?
About what?
"Miles, are you trying to scare the bejesus out of me?"
"Hard drives are particularly vexing when it's time for spring cleaning, though I understand there's software available for that purpose."
"- Miles, what is happening?"
- l'm off to a lunch now.
I just thought I'd stop by and say hello and let you know I'm thinking of you.
Karen?
Hi. I'm Bob Dumanjik.
- How are you?
- l'm fine.
Thanks for coming down.
- l know you're really busy.
- You do?
"Well, I assume it."
Should I not assume it?
Are you secretly lazy?
"Um, this way."
Stop it.
Not you.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Of course, it's always a mess around here."
Go ahead and sit.
"Whoa, whoa!"
Oh!
"You see,"
I'm here to discuss the Box Tunnel 20.
Come on.
Home sweet home.
It's a shit-hole.
"Yes, but it's our shit-hole, so show some manners."
"I could tell you many stories about cheap BB's like this, George, many stories."
And I don't want to hear any of them.
"- Well, hello."
"- Oh, I thought I heard the door."
"Well, did you hear my heart begin to beat a little faster?"
"No, no."
"No, definitely the door."
You sure it wasn't the buttons on my fly pinging off one by one?
"You know, because of... my lob-on?"
"Oh, you filthy little..."
"- Annie, this is Adam."
- Hello.
Adam is a vampire.
- Isn't that fantastic
- Yeah.
Adam is going to be staying with us for as short a time as possible.
Upstairs.
You can find a room to sit and think about the way you've just behaved.
"- Catch you later, sweet cheeks."
- Go.
- Don't ask.
- OK.
Have you any idea of the trouble your little escapade has caused?
"I mean, have you seen a newspaper in the last four weeks?"
"This is the biggest manhunt for a century, and you're strutting around in broad daylight."
What happens when the police catch up with you?
"""With strawberry lips you glued me tight"""
(theme music)
(man panting)
- (man screaming)
"- What a way to die,"
- mauled to death...
- Henry... you don't know that's what happened.
"You didn't see it, George."
Those terrible scratches on his face alone would let you know if you did.
Sir.
"What have you, George?"
"Sir, the man who discovered him was checking his snares this morning."
"He seemed surprised, almost disappointed to find out he'd snagged a human."
I suppose he was expecting his dinner.
Right.
Have him come down to the Station House for a word.
Do we know the victim's identity yet?
"He has nothing on his person, sir."
"We searched the area for his wallet, no luck."
"Judging by the scratches on his face,"
I'd say he was attacked by an animal of some kind.
"- Higgins has a theory, sir."
"- Uh, George..."
Does it pertain to this case?
"He certainly thinks it does, he hasn't shut up about it."
(Higgins sighs.)
Henry?
"Sir, it's like a..."
I only saw it for a minute.
Saw what?
"You better follow me, sir."
That's need-to-know.
"You can't pull that one with me,jethro."
I'm your boss.
"Iraq standinby,ma'am."
I got your e-mail concerning nce corporal finn.
I assume you've been over his srb.
"Yeah,we have,skipper."
We'd like to know what's not on the record.
Finn wasn't one of my stronger marines.
Wasn't surprised he went ua.
He have any enemies in the company?
He was well-liked.Played poker.
"Not well,but covered his debts."
Liked to talk about his sexual exploits in detail.
You know how marines love at.
"How does a dead marine,stateside, send letters home from iraq?"
Wondered about that myself.
"Get over here,marine."
Sir.
"Meet lance corporal hagan,soon to be priva hagan."
"Before deployment,finn gave him a couple hundred bucks to pop letters in the mail to two women the first batch started six months ago."
"The second,three months later."
Got enough to last the st of our deployment.
Gonna need those.
Send 'em on the next flight out.
Two fic?
s... that a marinthing?
"That's need-to-know,too,director."
- Do you see it yet?
- No.
Keep looking.
"Abby,I've been staring at this thing for five minutes."
What is it?
Lady Yuhwa requests your audience.
A terrible rumor about Jumong is spreading through the Palace.
Have you heard it?
Have you?
I think something bad has happened to Jumong.
Something bad?
What's that?
From what I've heard...
I think Jumong is dead.
Yuhwa.
I don't buy it.
"But if you say so, I'll gladly check his corpse."
I'll let go of all the hard feelings if you let me and Yesoya leave.
Yuhwa.
You won't need hostages now thatJumong's dead.
Let us go.
I can't.
Your Majesty.
Jolbon will turn into a battlefield the minute the Han and Puyo attack.
"If you go now, I can't guarantee your safety."
I know how you feel but I can't send you to your death.
Do you really know how I feel?
Do you know what it feels like to hear of your son's death?
I'm just as sad as you are.
I tried to sever my ties with him but he's still my son.
I'll protect you and Yesoya.
I'll raise Yuri to make up for it.
If you really thought of Jumong as your son... then you wouldn't dare wage war against the Damul Army.
Please.
Stop deceiving yourself.
"You say you're protecting me, but you're making my life a living hell."
Be my guest.
"I'm not sure if Kai will let you be his, but you might as well try."
Hold on a second!
Hold on a second!
"Yeah, what?"
It's funny.
I think was expecting someone more...
Charming.
"You know, for a rock star."
May I come in?
Who are you?
"Dr. Tom, Erica's therapist."
Thanks.
"So, what, are you tag-teaming me now?"
Huh?
"So, Dr. Fred sent you in here to talk me back on the straight and narrow, convince me I'm destroying my life?"
Erica ever mention to you that she had a brother?
No.
"Well, he died 10 years ago in a tragic accident, one that Erica tried to go back and prevent by twisting this therapy into something that it's not."
Did it work?
What do you think?
So...
"Well, explain to me, Kai... what is it that you want, exactly?"
To disappear.
Why?
"I mean, what is it that you figure that's gonna do?"
"It's gonna make things better for everybody, including me."
"Well, it seems to me you've tried that already, though,"
Haven't you?
"I mean, you ran away from your whole life."
"And yet, here you are again... running."
"Um, I'm just wondering where it ends."
We thought you'd like to see this.
So many of you have expressed an interest in knowing how I was paid.
Now I can afford to go back to my diet.
Tonight's play is about a body.
Not mine.
"However, the title is"
"""John Brown's Body. """
"In my opinion, John, this is the type of furniture we should be making."
Remarkable.
What is it?
"It's a chair, made out of wrought iron and plastic."
It's the latest modern design.
"And this, Harold?"
That's a copy of a new Swedish reversible sofa.
Hmm.
Does a set of instructions go with them?
I'd be afraid to get into that thing.
"Unfortunately, John, our customers are not quite so old-fashioned."
The public is demanding modern furniture now.
Take this sofa.
"My boy, that is not a sofa."
That is a sofa.
"Constructed, not turned out."
"Quality, my boy."
That's what we're selling.
People are looking for something new.
We've got to give it to them.
Chairs made out of scrap metal?
That's not what our customers expect from John Brown and Company.
We'd get new customers with a line of modern furniture.
"Now, Harold, our sales are fine."
We're making money.
Don't eat the pie.
You'll never leave.
Where is he?
"Oh, His Royal Highness?"
I believe he's holding court over there.
Eric.
Dad!
Hey!
"Dad, these are the guys, and this is Irene."
Hi.
"Nice to meet you, Irene."
Guys.
"Uh, Eric, your mother and I decided that you were responsible enough to take your brother on the road for two months."
"Now, is this the way you thank us?"
I was going to call you in the morning and let you know my plans.
I'll tell you your plans.
You're going to get in your car and follow me home without stopping anywhere.
Now.
Come on.
"Um, actually, I'd rather stay here with Irene and the guys."
Maybe we better do this in private.
"So, there's a lot of opportunity for a guy like me in this town?"
"Well, I could use a nurse."
"Now, why don't you tell me what this is really about?"
I don't think you'd understand.
Try me.
I don't see the point in going back home.
Why not?
"Because there's nothing there for me, Dad."
"I mean, I went to nursery school, grammar school, high school, for what?"
"I mean, I didn't get into college."
"Everything I've done up until now has been a waste, and it's just too late to change who I am."
See you later.
[phone rings]
All right.
So?
How'd you get on?
"What, totally empty?"
I tried.
I'll drive myself.
I've got a nice new car there.
See you in a bit.
"Make it look good, eh?"
"I already have, Jimmy."
I already have.

"- Oh, god."
More protestors?
Guess some folks from the church must've gotten wind of the festivities.
I'm still so shocked that that kind of anti-semitism exists down here.
"Yes, well, it may not be just the Jewish thing."
"Yeah, but still, they're just backwards, pigheaded philistines."
Some people have taken issue with our age difference.
"Well, she could be younger."
"I mean, hey."
"[Chuckles] Yes, well, legally, I suppose she could, but I couldn't very well push her down the aisle in a stroller."
[Laughs loudly]
"Still, even my late wife... she came to me in a dream last night,"
"- told me, ""it ain't right."""
- Listen to me.
Your dead ghost wife is wrong.
If you've been lucky enough to find love...
I have.
"You have, so nothing should stop you from grabbing onto it and holding onto it forever."
- [Chuckles] Oh!
- Uh-oh.
They're unloading the hate bus.
Protestors: [Chanting] Not in our town!
Not in our town!
The racists down here are really organized.
"This makes me really, really angry."
They're gonna ruin everything.
"Nate, go get rid of them."
"No, no, no."
Deep breath.
Just ignore them.
I've learned to rise above the bigotry.
"Well, guess what, pal?"
So.
Cho was killed here.
What the fuck is all this?
"So he invited Cho over, killed him, put the body in a sack, dragged it to his house, and then killed his wife?"
Crime of passion.
Make sure you photograph everything.
"Here, there, that stuff over there."
Jong-go!
Get over here!
"Sergeant, come over here."
Shit!
Oh god...
That cocksucker.
What kind of twisted freak is he?
THE WAILING (GOKSUNG)
"Is that scary, or what?"
"Scary, my ass."
"Anyway, the whole town's talking about it."
Who told you that story?
ByeOTQQVU-
That goddamned bastard...
"Now he's spreading those stories to you, too?"
"Well, from what I hear, there's definitely something off with that guy."
Like what?
"The corner store owner went crazy,"
"The guy at the mill dropped dead, and then Heung-go turns up dead two days ago."
$0?
All this happened after that Japanese man arrived.
"Quit talking out of your ass, you ignorant dope."
Who're you calling ignorant?
"Look, the test results on Heung-guk came back today."
"Apparently, he ate some fucked-up mushrooms."
Miss!
The two days are up.
"Still no news of him, something bad must have happened."
What should we do now?
"Miss, it's best if we return to BuYeo first."
It doesn't help if we stay here all day.
I... am going to the bandit's hideout myself.
Miss!
"This is not like you, what's wrong?"
What was I like last time?
You were fast and precise.
Sometimes you outshine even the Chief himself.
"Now, you can't even get your priorities right."
You think I'm taking a blind risk?
It's no different from suicide.
What plans do you have?
!
Don't worry.
"After I heard Prince Ju-Mong went to their hideout,"
I regretted not thinking of it earlier.
"As long as I can get Bae-Mang to drop his grudge against me,"
Then we wouldn't have to go back to BuYeo.
"When I was little,"
I remember Father used to tell me this...
"As a merchant,"
One must learn to make business even with an enemy.
I had forgotten the fact that I was a merchant.
You're saying you want to trade with the bandits?
Why not?
"Uncle,"
Please look after the fleet.
Sa-Yong and I will go to the bandit's hideout.
"I'm sorry, Mike."

"I'll get hurt in vesting, at least I'll get partial pension."

Got the middle daughter in a ballet recital.
"You know, used to come a time if I went to this recital..."
"... I'dhavemyselfpaged,find  an excuse to go over to Dee Dee's."
"Now I get to see the whole dance of the Enchanted Field Mice, whatever it is."
You want to see me?
You get those test results back?
"Close the door, Larson."
Let me have your gun and your shield.
What for?
Your tests came back with multiple positives.
Steroids--
Hold it.
"Now, steroids are not on the banned-substances list."
Methamphetamines are.
There is no way I tested positive for meth.
That's gotta be wrong.
Testing's sophisticated now.
Can't cover your tracks with sudafedrin.
You're terminated as of tomorrow.
You report to 1 Police Plaza...
... forout-processingin themorning.
Your gun and your shield.
This is a setup.
"If you think that I am gonna sit still for this, you are crazy."
"I am gonna get a lawyer, and I'm gonna sue your asses."
You have two guns listed.
Give the other one to the sergeant before you leave.
What do you expect?
Freakin' animals.
"Like ""Apocalypse Now"" down there."
Like Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle.
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.
"Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh?"
"You don't put your second most senior man on the trail of those motherless bastards, you send him home."
"I was, you know, ""He's out getting an evidence bag, and so ends up without a scratch on him."
"So must be something wrong with that picture""."
So are you home for good?
"No, no."
Playing it by ear.
"""To be determined."""
Think you might want to
- talk it through with somebody?
- What?
A shrink?
"No, no."
I can't.
"Start going down that road, kiss your career goodbye."
Or Marie.
"Or me, if you like."
"You know,"
I don't know how to say this.
"You know, the things I deal with, you and me don't have much of a... what you might call an experiential overlap."
What if I told you we do?
I have spent my whole life scared.
"Frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen."
50 years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.
But you know what?
Ever since my diagnosis...
Hurry Up!
One more!
"Oh, thank you all!"
I've got a copy!
Have a good trip!
-Sissy boy.
-Sissy boy !
"Oh, awesome!"
Awesome!
Eh Robbie?
Just when I thought it was over!
"...in a concert, it said the show included foul language and obscene gestures but the band calls the cancellation unfair..."
"I saw a kid with lipstick on I dont know if it was for me, but it was weird."
Twiggy brought this!
Dont bring that here!
-Dude you can make love to that.
-Danny?
"That smell, where did it come from?"
good (?
) in a drink.
"Im so good looking, I can put a rubber on and still get laid."
"From the look of the sores of your lips, you might want to put 2 on."
I still recall the taste of my tears.
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears.
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.
Scraping through my head 'till i don't want to sleep... anymore.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just to thing, and i'm starting to scare myself."
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
I just want something...
I just want something...
I can never have.
"Well, frankly, I'm worried."
"She's been wandering around in the bush this long, anything could've happened."
"Incidentally, how's Judy doing?"
"Dad, Judy's pulling a Rip Van Winkle act."
She keeps sleeping continually.
"Ah, she's probably just all worn out, honey."
Or she might have picked up a virus infection or something so the rest can do her good.
Have you heard from Jack and Mike?
Not a peep out of them.
I can't even reach 'em
- on the walkie-talkie.
- Neither can I.
"Well, maybe they got a lead on Sally."
I hope so.
"Well, I don't envy them trying to find one chimp in the bush."
"Well, let's just hope that she has that space helmet on."
(CHATTERING)
(GROWLS)
They're making too much noise.
We have to get rid of them.
We could tranquilize 'em with a couple of darts.
Most impractical.
I've got a better idea.
Oh?
- Gentlemen.
- Yeah.
We're now entering dangerous terrain.
This area is filled with giant pythons.
"Bone-crushing gorillas, rampaging elephants."
And there are poacher's pits and snares with poison spears all over the place.
Mean they're booby-trapped?
(ANIMAL GROWLS)
"Finally you have come, Alvaro."
It takes a life to wait.
They have taken half an hour to surround it.
"We go, we go, raises."
"By the way, I and you have put a card?"
"Yes, yes."
"For the women, those romantic details are fundamental."
"Clearly, it is her birthday."
You are sure we will find that she is there?
"Yes, I followed her without account occurred, you will see that it contents is put when she sees me."
"We go, if one does not melt."
You will see that surprise.
"Good afternoon, I hope not to have mistaken, Im looking for Lella."
"Yes, she is here, it happens."
I knew that she was making practical with you.
"Yes, it makes practical, anyway, she is very good,"
-she is an authentic professional.
-Where is she?
-She is with a client.
-Alone?
"Yes, clearly."
What is that package?
A thing that to Lella she likes much.
-You embosoms it to me?
"-No, no, it is only for Lella."
"What a shame, everybody needs incentive for their erotic fantasies."
-Why you do not call to Lella?
"-She will be here, in five minutes."
Five minutes?
Not if it holds.
"Endurance, hold yourself."
"It is not necessary, already I feel..."
"[stammers] It really meant a lot to me to have a lot of you there, especially so soon after the loss of my other dog, Noir."
But that's not what I really wanna talk about this morning.
"No, I wanna talk about another best friend that I lost recently."
He went out.
And it was a surprise.
"And it hurt, you know, that it happened."
And that he didn't tell me.
And that he lied to me.
It just really shook me up.
He was my Eskimo.
He got me sober.
I just thought that we could tell each other the truth.
"But today, I'm trying to focus on the positives."
I have this new business venture that I'm really excited about.
And I'm just trying to be grateful.
So thank you.
I'm really happy to be here.
[applause]
"All right, I think that's all we got time for."
Unless someone has a burning desire?
No?
"All righty, let's do the prayer."
"Man, I'm sorry to hear about the dogs."
Really.
- Condolences.
- God... [all] ...grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.
"The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."
No.
Not the seat.
Motherfucking...
"Aw, fuck off."
[mutters] Motherfucking...
"And you can get completely out of the habit of it, you see?"
"And before you know it, your neck muscles are straining and your eyes are doing all these crazy things."
So you just went out and picked up the first guy you saw?
He wasn't the first.
Th-The first three said no.
"Wow, it's like a romance novel."
He said I was foxy.
"When I say it out loud, it doesn't really seem like a good enough reason to sleep with somebody, but... it was 10:00 at night, on a sidewalk, in front of a grocery store, you know?"
I was all good to go.
"Please don't tell me any more, mother of my child."
"And then I tried to break up with him today, but he made me a mix tape."
Supertramp?
They are so good.
"I know it sounds a little pitiful, but, I mean, it was my first time out there, and I just..."
I-I wasn't sure if anybody was gonna want me.
Are you kidding?
"Christine, you're incredibly sexy."
"In fact, sometimes I still scream out your name during sex."
"Oh, you do?"
"Oh, shut up!"
She has my same name!
That's true.
But I still think you're sexy.
"Well, yeah, whatever."
Anyway...
"I got one under my belt, okay?"
I feel good.
Now I can move on.
- You gonna get that?
- No.
"Oh, this is ridiculous."
I got to do this.
I don't think he'd done it for some time.
I discovered something under the micrcope.
"Amonthe keratin proteins, I found translucent fibers of glass."
-Exactly.
-Fiberglass?
He must have inhaled them in.
"I'd say,most likely from insulation."
Maybthe house wasn't just a body drop.
"'S speaking softly, but lance corporal finn hamore to say."
"Would you mind clearing up,Mr. Palmer?"
"Not at all,doctor."
I know you've been putting in long hours recently.
Just doing my job.
I appreciate the can-do attitude.
-Good night.
"-Ght,doctor."
"Agent lee,you're working late."
"Still organizing paperwork on the wheaton case,Dr. Mallard."
I need the autopsy report.
What happened to the one I se up to legal yesterday?
I'm afraid I shredded it by mistake.
You must be more careful.
"I know.I'm sorry,Dr. Mallard."
No worries.
I'm sure Mr. Palmer will give you what you ed.
Okay.Thank you.
that's about how it looked three months ago.
The living room floor was the last thing we closed up.
We ran the ac ducts under this section.
The damn inspector was weeks late.
"You have security at night here,bob?"
Not on a job this size.
"demonstrations by workers, farmers, small business owners, to say nothing of ecologists, and the movement keeps growing."
The Ministry of the Future intends to delve into the problem by visiting the region in coming days to better understand the situation.
"Isn,t there... any toast or anything?"
Want me to make some?
shall I make some toast?
"No, don,t bother."
Are you nuts?
"What,s going on up there?"
"You,re not hurt, I hope."
What the heck -
"What,s going on?"
"It was a farmers,protest."
"They,re gone now."
"Who,II clean this up?"
"I,m all alone here today!"
Can I come out?
Can you believe it?
"They,re nuts!"
"It,s dramatic"
"What,s going on?"
"The minister,s coming, and nothing,s ready."
No one told us about it.
What do you mean?
You got a memo announcing his visit a month ago.
"There it is, on the wall."
- Right.
"The same one that says that in six months we,d get a raise and be promoted to level B-4 and never work over 40 hours a week."
"Where,s that replacement crew you promised?"
"We,re here 24 hours a day."
Listen.
"We,II discuss your demands later."
AII I can say is the minister arrives in five minutes.
"How about the effects at the house, Barney?"
They're in the works.
I also have the men.
"Jim, how does Gordon handle these so-called contracts for murder?"
Picks up the phone and the job gets done.
But he never does it himself.
Even if the job's here in town?
"No, he has an assistant, a man named Connie."
Always uses one of these delightful things.
The bodies are disposed of in the incinerator at Gordon's lumberyard.
Why don't we just keep an eye on Connie until he tries it again?
All we'd get is Connie.
We want Gordon.
"- How about the sweater, Barney?"
"- Right here, Jim."
- Heavy.
- It has eight layers of laminated nylon.
Backed by fine chain mail.
- The blood?
- It's in the ribbing.
"Rollin, were you able to work out the mask?"
Yes.
I have it right here.
Disintegrates two minutes after being exposed to the air.
And did Mr. Gordon accept the Harpers' invitation to dinner?
His R.S.V.P. Was in this morning's mail.
"Well, in that case..."
"Mrs. Harper, I think we'd better get headed for home."
"How are you, Burt?"
"Haven't lost your touch, huh?"
"What have you got, Lew?"
Anything I should know about any of these?
' This is what you did.
That's because...
I was shocked.
I didn't even really get to see anything.
Oh my God!
So... you and this guy...
haven't seen each other yet?
How can you be like that when you guys are getting married in a month?
Is that...
something a kid should be saying right now?
Just go and pack up some more stuff.
Teacher Gil...
You want me to show you?
My body is really rocking right now.
Look.
This...
Isn't a body you can get in a month or two.
-Look.
This guy's abs are like chocolate!
-Don't do it!
It's nice.
I wonder why this guy hasn't shown you his body that he's worked on?
"I thought since he took such good care of it, I thought it was to look good for you..."
Yoon Jae...
Likes to work out because he likes to keep himself busy.
That's right.
"I'm sure at the very least, he was diligent about working out every day for at least 2 hours."
"To be in that shape, do you really have to work out every day for at least 2 hours?"
Unconditionally.
He should've seen you more during those hours.
He must have given you excuses to take those hours to work out.
I guess to this guy...
"So far, so good."
I have been directed to address you... on the possibility of making the army your career.
- [Muffled Whimper] - [Laughing] - [Laughing]
[Laughing Continues]
"[Charles, Laughing] Army..."
Career...
I'm sorry.
"If I held that in, my teeth would've exploded."
- You gotta be kidding.
"- Gentlemen, please, it's impolite to laugh at the senile."
- What'd he say?
- Loss of hearing is the first sign.
Will you clowns keep quiet!
Some of us are interested in what Col. Potter has to say.
"Go on, Colonel."
"- Why, thank you, Major."
- [Kissing Noise]
"You blow one more kiss, Pierce, and those lips will never walk again."
Please.
I'd like to hear this too.
- [Making Kissing Noises]
- Oh!
Blow it out your bugle!
"- Colonel, please continue."
"- Gracias, Padre."
"Now, I think you'll admit... the army presents unique opportunities... that can't be had anywhere else."
That's very true.
What other job lets you die for a living?
Certainly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
The army provides a chance to see the world.
Scenic tours of all the great battlefields.
- It provides a home.
But I've always been a little sensitive about it.
You understand?
"Oh, I certainly do, sir."
"Lou, Lou, I'm talking, but you're not listening."
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) There's no money in the budget.
"Lou, will you believe me?"
There's no money.
"Look, that's the way it is, take it or leave it."
Good.
Good.
You got yourself a deal.
"What is it this time, Lieutenant?"
I'm a very busy man.
"There was no one out there, sir."
It's all right.
So I just came in.
Congratulations.
Congratulations for what?
I heard you came into a lot of money.
I see.
You heard about my little windfall?
"Yes, sir, I have."
"Lieutenant, if you think I knew anything about this, you're wrong."
My lawyer called me and told me my wife's safe deposit box was practically layered with receipts for these silver certificates.
I'll be damned if I can figure out how she did it.
"I think the government's gonna have a little trouble, too, because she never declared them as income."
She kept the certificates in a numbered account in a Canadian bank.
"And it all goes to you, right, sir?"
And it all goes to me.
After taxes.
Including a few lovely IOUs from Ward Fowler.
"Is that so, sir?"
"Well, your brother's quite a character."
"And your father, he seems, uh, driven."
"Anyway, it's good, Sam."
It's really good.
Have you ever thought about pursuing writing?
I can't.
I have to go into the family business.
Family business?
"Yeah, my dad's a--"
My dad's a mechanic.
So I have to be a mechanic too.
"Do you wanna go into the family business, Sam?"
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well?
"More than anything, no."
"You know I don't wanna, uh, overstep my bounds here but you don't have to do anything you don't wanna do."
"Look, I mean, I know what it's like."
"I come from a family of surgeons, and that wasn't me."
"So, you know, I traded in the money and prestige of being a doctor for all the glamour you see around you."
The point is there are maybe three or four big choices that shape someone's whole life.
"And you need to be the one that makes them, not anyone else."
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to the teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
"Go have your Robin Williams, ""Oh, captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.

"I still have to put her medicine in her food, but..."

That problem with her fatigas.
Excuse me?
The dog's fatigas is better now.
That problem she had.
Was that a euphemism?
"Oh, boy, here we go with the Latin."
"You know, the fatigas."
It's like the female private parts.
"Boy, I tell you, I'm sweating up a storm here."
You're just a little nervous.
I'll come clean with you. I haven't had sex sober in about 20 years.
"You're not gonna scare me off, Andy."
"I know what you were like, and I know what you're like now."
And I think you're a good man.
"And in your own way, very charming."
So you want to hit the sack?
I'd like it if you kissed me.
I'm getting a new bed cover.
I've got it on order.
-Wanna fold that up or--?
-Sh.
"You realize that if I don't hold up my end, so to speak..."

Somehow it doesn't feel like it's gonna be a problem.

Here...you will have to do this part of the work.
I swear...if I had a physique like yours I would have bowled over all the girls in India.
"In such a big place, where could Kania have hidden the fake currency printing dyes?"
"If anyone gives you drugs, take them, but do not take them."
Do you understand?
"And I will look both ways before I cross the road, and I will floss after every meal, and I'll wear a sweater just in case it gets cold."
I'll be fine.
"Well, you better be or I'm going to kick your ass."
I'll meet you back here at midnight.
I have to run an errand.
Hey.
Aww...
Did Mike stand you up?
"Vicki, if you're here to grill me again, I just..."
"Listen, Coreen's going to go undercover tonight and I need someone who can blend to the Goth scene, keep an eye on her."
I can't.
Not tonight.
"Henry, there are two men dead and I think there's going to be more."
I need your help.
"And I'm working on something that could prove to be just as dangerous,"
- for both of us.
- I know.
"That's why we should be working together, right?"
- We're supposed to be partners.
- Yes!
Just not tonight.
Okay.
Sure.
"Can't blame a girl for trying, right?"
"You know if you feel like it, we'll be at the Underground later ...you know, if it's not too much trouble."
"Christina, what do you want from me?"
I'm in.
Over.
"Aw, come on, Coreen, it's a one-way radio."
"Hey, have you heard the good news?"
"Nah, I'm just kiddin'."
She just likes me for my body.
You look great.
You do something different with your side view mirrors?
"What do you want, Sally?"
"Come on, make this guy fix the road."
The town needs this.
No.
I know his type.
Racecar.
That's the last thing this town needs.
"OK, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc, but you leave me no choice."
"Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history."
Here she goes again.
"Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road!"
It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers?
What travelers?
Ignore him.
"But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers if there is no road for them to drive on?"
"- Luigi, what do you have at your store?"
- Tires.
And if no one can get to you?
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!
"- Flo, what do you have at your store?"
- I have gas.
- Lotsa gas!
"- OK boys, stay with me."
"And, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas?"
I'll go outta business and...
"We are gentleman adventurers on the road to great riches, eh?"
"Come, come, Kali."
My towel.
"Say, Jack."
- Buck's gone again.
"- Yes, I know."
- I heard his lady friend howling last night.
- Oh?
"Well, that's what happens to a fella when he gets in bad company."
Mmm!
Wait a minute.
"According to all you told us, and to all calculations... we should have located the mine two days ago."
"I'm afraid you're bringing out my worst side, Mr. Blake."
"- Yes, I-I know, but-"
- If you're trying to hoodwink us... we are certain to find it out sooner or later... and if such is the case... there is nothing left for us to do but mourn for you.
I swear I'm doing the best I can.
I followed the compass directions exactly.
The burnt tree.!
- The cabin!
That's it!
- My dear Mr. Blake... how can you ever forgive me for doubting your integrity?
You've placed me in a most embarrassing position.
I scarcely know what to say.
One for the master.
And one for the dame.
And one for the little boy who's filing the claim.
"Why, Jack, I never suspected."
The world doesn't understand me.
At heart I'm an artist.
"Oh, I want to write poetry."
I want to compose.
"I want to sing, paint."
This could be really good for our marriage.
"I mean, if there are things bothering us about each other, we should just get them out there, you know?"
It's healthy.
I guess.
"All right, so come on."
"Hit me, baby."
Uh...
I guess maybe sometimes...
You wear a little too much makeup.
What do you mean?
"Well, just, you know, all that goop over there."
Sometimes I think you could just...
Back her down a notch.
"Ok, this is stinging more than I thought it would."
So you really think I wear too much makeup?
No.
"I just-- like if we're going out for burgers, you know, and I throw on a pair of sweatpants and a baseball hat, you look like you're going to the opera..."
Or you're in the opera.
Ok.
Ok.
I will try to wear less makeup.
"Well, this is great."
All right.
"But we're gonna do this together, ok?"
And I'm gonna join a gym and start to diet.
I'm gonna whip this body into shape 'cause nobody's calling me fatty mcbutterpants anymore.
Somebody called you fatty mcbutterpants?
"On line at the bank yesterday, yeah."
And it took seeing the big and tall bag to push you over the edge?
Mmm-hmm.
Ok.
I dieted for the last 8 hours.
"Oh, wait."
No.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
No!
"You have got yourself a real prize there, young lady."
"I know, mom, he's a great guy."
He's more than a great guy.
He does whatever I ask him to do and eats whatever I toss up on the roof.
It's like having a big pet raccoon that can fix stuff.
Oh.
There's my hard-working man.
"Nice fit, huh?"
Two more pockets and I'm a pool table.
"Mike, why, why are you wearing my dad's clothes?"
"Oh, I gave him a bunch of daddy's stuff."
"You know, the last time he wore this suit, we were sharing a ""j"" at a Doobie brothers concert or sharing a doobie at an O'jays concert..."
I forget.
It was the Doobie brothers.
I found the ticket stubs and an ancient tootsie roll.
"Oh, daddy loved his tootsie rolls."
Can I see it?
"Well, the real memory is the ticket stubs, right?"
I'm kind of freaking out here.
"Mike, you don't have to wear that."
Why?
I think I look pretty good in it.
"You look like you should be standing in a field, selling green beans."
"Never mind her, you look great."
"Now, why don't you sit right down here at the head of the table?"
"We're having pot roast, mashed potatoes, and your favorite dessert..."
banana cream pie.
That's not his favorite.
"MIT's on cruise control for you, you've already gotten into Harvard Med."
"I mean, what do you have to worry about?"
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.
"Well, I'm also really involved in the science competition."
"You know, the 2.09 Competition?"
"Wait, no."
I'm building a car that drives by itself.
"Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing with my friends for over a year, so it's kind of important."
"Ben, let the car drive by itself."
"Listen, you not only have a gifted mind, but you're also composed."
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.
"Ben, you were born for this."
You'll have more fun than you've ever had in your entire life.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
But I'm really not the right guy.
So I'm sorry.
Ben.
I hope this little conversation we just had will remain private.
"- No, of..."
- No.
"You're one of my favorite new students, and I'd hate to lose you, if you know what I mean."
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.
It's boxy.
It's blue.
How is that not you?
"So, how much is this thing gonna run me?"
"Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95, minus 15%."
The jacket's $589.99.
Hit him again!
Give him an amp of epi!
Nothing!
He's has multiple-system failure.

"Come on, joe."
Foreman.
Foreman!

No.

"I was starting to think that your absence was from sulking, Robbie."
"And what, and miss such a performance?"
"A puppet is still a puppet, French prince or not."
"Oh, hush will you."
Kill him!
"A Jesuit missionary, found spreading subversive propaganda."
"Whatever the crime, grisly fate for any man."
"But then a man's fate lies in his own hands, does it not?"
Is this choice of being here too remind me where my loyalties lie?
A lesser man might be insulted.
"We're under no illusion, Master Gifford."
The ten years we've kept the Queen of Scots confined has made her a martyr to her Catholic supporters.
My Lord Burghley.
"The gentleman I spoke of, Master Gifford"
"We also know... another attempt to rescue her, has been devised."
It's details...we lack
The Catholic's League in Europe is behind this one.
"Once our freedom is secured,"
That's a lot of money.
But not for Danny boy.
Somebody else can marry that teddy bear.
"I'll just take the $50,000 and-- [whistles]-- blow away."
Just thought I'd mention it to see what you had in your mind.
Yeah?
"You, uh..."
"You wouldn't be thinking of running out on me, would you, lover?"
Do I have a choice?
No.
Not unless you want the police in Chicago to know where you are.
"All right, you made me set it up for you."
"Look, Aunt Olivia's going to be wearing the diamonds, not Merle, so with that little piece of information, will you please just get out of here and leave me alone?"
"- And leave Merle alone, too."
- Okay.
Okay.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
- Danny.
How are you going to do it?
The same old way?
"You know, you're too much."
Get out of here and leave me alone!
"Leave Merle alone, too!"
"Danny, how are you going to do it, the same old way?"
"What do you think I am, a sucker?"
But I might tell a partner.
"Oh, forget I asked."
You're blowing a great opportunity.
"With all the contacts you can make with that camera and my talent,"
- we could retire in a year.
- I'm going to retire right after this one.
Then make it a good one.
"- It was a reunion, and they were great."
- They're okay.
"A couple of years ago, Mom drove us in to shop."
"She couldn't find a good parking place, and all of the lots were total rip-offs."
So she kept making u-turns and cutting off taxis... and we were being screamed at in so many different languages... that we just turned around and drove home... and bought a Hummel at the curio shop in Stars Hollow.
Very adventurous.
I'm just saying I'm no stranger to the Big Apple.
You are if you're calling it the Big Apple.
"So I don't have the lingo down yet, but I have the attitude."
- You do?
- Yeah.
When I was getting a locker for my backpack... at the bus stop there was this guy just standing there staring at me.
"And instead of ignoring him, I fixed him with a really withering stare."
- That I've got to see.
- No.
Come on.
Let me see your withering stare.
It's dangerous.
I could hurt you.
- I've been hurt before.
- No.
I'm disappointed.
"- So, your arm's okay?"
- Yeah.
It looks worse than it is.
I like this Emily chick.
A friend of yours?
She's a friend to all of us dispossessed.
- So here's our lunch place.
- A hot-dog stand?
I eat here everyday.
"It's nothing fancy, but..."
"Whoa, slow down."
"Ok, maybe not that part, as long as we're a couple and I'm her father, I guess, because I love her... and you too, obviously."
"This is unfair, Michael."
"Your life is so hard right now,"
- and I swear I can help with that.
- I can handle things.
- I've been handling things.
"- I know, I know, I know, but I can help with Sophie or cooking or whatever."
I don't want you to have to take care of me anymore.
I wanna help take care of you.
"And if I don't,"
- you can kick me out.
"- Ok, stop it."
"I do not need a father for Sophie and I do not want to get married, oh my God!"
"Ok, that's a bad choice of words and I'm sorry."
"But... child care, yeah."
"And cooking, maybe."
And then...
Maybe we could see what happens.
One step at a time.
Thank you.
You start early.
I'm a professional.
"What I mean by that is I start work early, but I also go home at 5 pm."
I dreamt I fired you last night.
I have that dream quite often.
You'd know that if you transcribed my dictation.
"In these dreams, would I be a projection of some aspect of your personality?"
"Your professionalism, maybe?"
Is that what you were firing?
"I'm not a doctor, but..."
Sometimes dreams are just wish fulfillment.
Further than that.
Do not believe.
Is love a fancy or a feeling?
- Or a Ferrars?
- Go to bed.
"""I do not deny that I think very highly of him."""
"""That I... greatly esteem him."""
"""That I like him."""
We are so happy that you invited Edward to Norland.
We're all very fond of him.
We have great hopes for him.
Mother expects much of him.
And in marriage.
She's determined both he and Robert will marry well.
But I hope she desires them to marry for love.
The heart doesn't always lead us in the most suitable direction.
Edward is a compassionate person.
Penniless women prey on that type.
Having entered into an understanding he would never go back on his word.
But it would lead to his ruin.
I'm worried.
Mother will withdraw all financial support from him -
- Should he plant affection in less exalted ground than he deserves.
I understand you perfectly.
Devonshire?
"My cousin, Sir John Middleton, has offered us a small house."
He must be a man of property.
He's a widower from Barton Park.
It is Barton Cottage he has offered.
A cottage?
Charming.
A cottage is always very snug.
- No.
I would've gone down for murder.
It was close.
"Goodbye, Mrs. Price."
Good night.
"Hey, Nico."
"Even now, hours after the shooting took place, the entire area surrounding the station has been completely cordoned off."
We have word that the police are actively pursuing the alleged shooter.
"Until an arrest is made, neither his identity nor the identity..."
Did you get a look at the shooter?
Could you just hold me?
Please?
I'm sorry.
I've been crazy with this story.
But it's over now.
It's done.
Is it over for Nico Jackson?
I need you to trust me that nothing happened and that I'm done running around being certifiably insane.
If there's something you don't have... that you're searching for out there...
I want you to find it right here.
There's some music that you need to face.

- They all want interviews.

You can't hide.

You can run?
"What do you say we... change our names, blow this town, start a new adventure?"
"They both put 100 quid in every month, regularly, no withdrawals."
"Yet last Tuesday at 11:00am, one of the comes into the building society and cleans the whole lot out."
We checked her hours with her boss.
"Last Tuesday, Kelly was at work all day."
She didn't even take a lunch break.
Then it must have been Mr Hartson the loving fiance.
Why clean out the account before they even got married?
They had a row Thursday lunchtime.
You got any idea why Tom wanted to clear out their savings account?
Is that what he did?
Did they row a lot?
A bit.
Lately.
Just put it down to pre-wedding nerves.
You thought there was more to it?
"A week ago, Kelly got home to find the bedding had been changed."
"Sheet, duvet, the lot."
Tom reckoned he'd spilled something over it.
"So Kelly thought he'd had company, yeah?"
Tom had never changed the sheets in his life.
I suggested she bring the sheet in.
For a test?
Yeah.
"She did bring the sheet in the day after, but... as far as I know, she chickened out."
I don't think she wanted to know the truth.
Where is the sheet now?
Did she take it back?
No idea.
It was in her locker.
You got it?
Yeah.
They look like the perfect couple.
Would you stop?
!
Why did you come looking for me?
Sarah...
I was fine.
I came because I wanted to understand why this happened.
"This happened because you and mom, you won't let me live my life."
"You think you can make decisions for me for the rest of my life, forever."
"No, Sarah, that's not true."
I want you to decide.
Right.
Decide to go to art school?
Yes.
"Yeah, so even there, you're taking the thing that I love, and you're..."
"You know I'm an adult, right?"
"And so, that means, for the first time, finally, finally, I can make my own decisions."
You can't control me.
I can do what I want!
"And right now, what I want is to get the hell out of here!"
Tom.
"Just, uh..."
just give me a minute.
Thank you... for taking me back there.
I know it was hard.
"Yeah, you know, I always assumed that it was the problems between marjorie and I that were to blame for what happened with Sarah."
And now?
"Well, now I know it was more complicated than that."
We were scared.
"We thought she was just messing around, you know?"
We thought she just didn't wanna grow up.
"When, in fact, that's exactly what she was trying to do."
"She accused you of wanting to make decisions for her, forever."
"When I first had Geneva, it was like..."
"I recognized her, you know?"
"I mean, she had Dave's smile, and she had my eyes, and..."
What is it?
I can't say anything right with Dave these days.
I thought things were better.
We haven't slept in the same bed in months.
"And ever since the wedding, it's--"
"He's been acting even more distant, you know."
It's like...
I don't understand.
"Something just changed that day, and I can't tell if I'm pushing him away or he's pulling away, or I..."
I don't know.
It's just all...
"You still love him, right?"
"Well... if I didn't, would I be crying at this stupid chick song?"
"Look, your marriage is worth saving, so you gotta stop talking and start doing."
"- Doing what, though?"
- Being there for him.
Being involved in what he likes and what he's doing.
"If it's work that's absorbing his time, get into it."
"If it's something he cares about, you gotta care about it, too."
- I do.
I do.
- Don't tell me.
Show him.
"I really like you, Suzanne."
I want to work things out with Deena.
Nobody's stopping you.
I shouldn't even be here.
"You have a lot going on with your marriage, the launch..."
So why not just be in the moment?
"I believe it, you know."
"In fact, this brother I visited, Celestino, he was a real hijo de una puta."
I remember the day that I finally accepted it.
But I hated him for so much of my life.
"It was like a dam broke inside of me, releasing a torrent of hatred."
Was that the same dam that released the torrent of bullshit that's comin' out of your mouth right now?
"Do me a favor, tough guy, okay?"
Don't tell me this is about some epic clash between two brothers.
This is about you and your needs.
"Cut to the chase, Gecko, or this will become a feeding ground."
I used to think that she was just a dancing girl.
"But now, now I get it."
She's your queen.
That's why I'm gonna bring her back to you.
Your headliner.
I'm gonna bring you back Santanico Pandemonium.
"Kate, help me move this rack."
Come on!
"Come on, let's go!"
We gotta get out of here!
- [Carlos] Gonzalez!
- Ready?
"One, two, three."
[grunting]
I am trying to be civil here!
- [pounding]
"- You know, maybe..."
- Maybe he's not wrong.
- About what?
About the blood well not being such a bad idea.
It could keep the culebras from killing.
"You don't seriously believe anything he says, do you?"
"I don't like your manner, I don't like your style, I don't like your attitude."
But I do like your ideas.
"Stephens, I'm putting next year's entire campaign in your hands."
- You are?
- Yes.
We've been advertising the same way for 30 years.
It's not working anymore.
That's why I changed agencies decided we have to keep things up-to-date.
Get to work on that campaign right away.
"And remember one thing, gentlemen Waterhouse is my name and thumbtacks is my game."
He wants me.
"Darrin, you must have somebody watching over you."
"Larry, I just learned something."
"- When a man can't lose, he can't win."
- Where are you going?
"- To a bar, to drown my sorrows."
- Drown your sorrows?
You just landed a big account.
"Well, let's just say I'm a sore winner."
"Yeah, you came to the right guy for advice, Darrin."
I'm an expert.
I know everything about marriage.
That's why I'm still single.
I don't get it.
I'm married to a girl who can have anything in the whole world yet she chose me.
- Take my brother.
He's had four years of happy marriage.
"The trouble is, he's been married for 16."
She must love me.
Gave up everything for me.
But obviously she misses all those luxuries.
Who can blame her?
- Leon?
"- Leon, Maurice Leon."
- Leon?
But he made up the name.
I don't know what it was before.
Some people called him Moussa and that annoyed him.
You met him on the set?
"No, I met him at a little Algerian restaurant."
Maurice studied at the Sorbonne and at night he made couscous.
"Strange guy, anarchist, atheist, and an excellent cook."
We became friends and one day he told me his story.
I don't know how we suddenly found ourselves working on a script.
A sad love story.
"Like Romeo and Juliet, but in Algeria."
Why didn't you finish the movie?
It was a mistake to begin with.
It was my idea that he direct it.
"I financed it, I recruited all our friends from the Sorbonne."
You realize I was a little in love with him.
I was young and he had a poetic soul.
I thought if we made the film he'd love me as he loved your mother.
That's the story.
We barely managed to film two scenes-.
"Maurice became depressed, he didn't show up and everything stopped."
Want to see?
- See the film?
"- No, there's nothing left of it."
But I have a few photos.
Come.
This is all that remains.
"Pictures, moments."
If I'd known that 40 years later
"Look, you can't keep running away."
"Come on, Janet, be reasonable."
We have a duty to resolve this.
- It's for the good of the college.
- We both know it's nothing of the sort!
You'll get nothing from me.
Scott?
Coffee!
"Black, two sugars."
- Try rebooting the whole system.
(Another phone rings)
- Luke Skywalker mug.
"- OK, I'll call you back."
And a custard cream.
(Rock music)
"Scott, will you keep the noise down!"
(Music off)
- Get your own coffee.
I'm not your slave.
(Gentle chimes)
- Sherry?
- Thank you.
Dinner tonight at High Table and tomorrow we start the conference bright and early at ten.
The college has suffered something of a minor tragedy.
"Three weeks ago, Dr Mary Goodyear, head of our biology department, died while on a marine expedition in the South Pacific."
"Yes, I read about it."
"Dr Goodyear's research was of the very first order, you understand."
"But when I came to examine her papers after her death, it soon became clear that sections of the research were missing."
Goodness!
"What, you mean stolen?"
"No, no, no, no, nothing like that."
"It's this bloody librarian, Janet Cramer."
It's not too easy for me either.
"You're probably wondering, who's this funny guy in cowboy boots that's taking you on a vacation."
You're not sure what... is happening.
I want us to be friends.
I know your mother's divorced.
You're not sure what happened.
I'm very fond of your mother.
I want her to be happy.
I want you to be happy.
I'd like to be happy.
"See, I know your father's real smart and he's a professor and, uh, that's real good."
I'm not trying to replace your father.
"But, uh, you know, I'm pretty smart too."
I sell property around here.
I sell desert land to Arabs.
That's pretty hard.
I'm trying to make this all work out between us.
"If you give me a chance, maybe it will."
"Well, what do you say?"
"Yeah, well, you should think it over, okay?"
"Okay, now, let me warn you, he's going to try to get away with murder."
I've seen him reduce really experienced babysitters to mush in one night.
I've got a little brother like that.
[mother] you do?
How do you handle him?
Either I ignore him or I sock him.
"- [laughs] - [""'The Sunset Trail""' playing on TV]"
"Hey, look, he likes ice cream, so later on, if the two of you want some, here's some money."
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
"- Hey, are you decent?"
- [men singing on TV]
And why so?
"You see, Miss Sheetal, there are many reasons for this."
"It so happened that... ltjust crossed my mind that, I thought you'd understand what I understood."
But you couldn't understand it either.
And you thought I understood what you were tying to make me understand.
This misunderstanding has created a bit of confusion.
"And ifyou see through, we are stuck in a strange whirlwind."
Whirlwind!
What whirlwind?
I don't get what you say.
Exactly.
This is the confusion.
And to get out of it we must meet rightaway.
"And ifwe put our heads together, Miss Sheetal we can easily get out ofthis confusion... gradually."
ARer that evemhing will be all right.
And then...
it will be all bed of roses!
But this outcome won't come byjust sitting at home.
"We must meet, and keep meeting."
But I don't want to meet you.
Since when have you started lying?
"An_ay, dump these odd talks."
They are unyielding.
I am free tomorrow.
Why don't we make it tomorrow then?
That's final. I'll see you at Golden Chariot tomorrow.
I don't want to meet you.
-See you at 4 in the evening.
Keep waiting.
I won't come.
No way.
I had said I wasn't coming.
"Uh, sir?"
"Sir, I'm a part of this, too, now."
"I don't want to be, but I am."
If you don't come forward...
"I don't know, I might have to."
"Well, I guess we're each gonna do what we have to do."
"I can say anything to you, right, dad?"
"Well, this is the last thing you need to know,"
The thing you're never gonna get
To help me deal with.
"This thing that's been living inside me,"
"This cloud that I can't get out from under,"
"It's always been there, but it started to get worse"
During my senior year of high school.
Kim and I went to this party.
It was mostly college kids home for their christmas break.
There was a boy there.
His name was william.
"He was a little older, cute, funny."
"I liked him, so I pretended to be older."
He kept giving me drinks.
"I started to feel funny,"
So he asked me if I needed to lie down.
He helped me upstairs.
And the rest?
"Well, you're defending him now;"
you know what he does.
I was barely awake for any of it.
All I knew the next day
Was that something sick had happened to me.
"When I read about your case in the papers,"
"When I realized how many other girls he'd done it to,"
Stop the boat.
"The planes where intercepted at the clandestine airfield,"
I caught them like wasps in a nest!
you caught them...
"We caught them, Inspector."
"Eh...well, yeah, we caught them."
"Well then, no need to argue, I will treat you to a bottle of champagne at the bar, shall we?"
Lets.
The End

"NARRATOR""."
When last we saw the Caped Crusaders they were trapped in Black Widow's giant cobweb about to be bitten by two deadly Black Widow spiders.
Are the heroes headed for that great Batcave in the sky?
"In scant seconds, the answer will be yours."
"Batman, he's almost on me."
"He is a she, Robin."
Only the female of the species is venomous.
And mine is almost upon me also.
I've freed my right hand.
Now if I can just reach the mini charge in my utility belt.
I've got it.
"Brace yourself for a shock of 5000 volts, Robin."
We'll be stunned for a split second.
"But the cobweb will act as a conductor, and the spiders will be electrocuted."
"- Hurry, Batman."
She's ready to bite me.
-Now.
"Good going, Batman."
I thought we were dead ducks.
I'm sure Black Widow thinks we're dead bats about now.
What was that exit line of hers?
I've made a deal with Jacob.
You should be happy.
"If you're so bored, get another job or a hobby."
Instead of going around making my life hell.
"Fine, as long as I get peace."
Helene!
I must admit it got a little wet.
- I hope I didn't scare you.
- It takes more than that.
- How about a drink?
- It's a little early.
"I've changed the plans a little, so it will take a few more days."
Why?
I can't do that.
I need to be back in two days.
Listen.
Instead of an annual donation -
- I've talked to my advisors about establishing a fund.
It means something to all of us that you're Anna's biological father.
So I'm establishing the fund in Anna's and your name.
You two will decide how the money is spent.
So you've chosen my project?
- I just said that.
- And you want me to do it with Anna?
"Yes, why not?"
She has shown a great interest in aid work.
My advisors have gone through everything and agree   that a sum of 12 million dollars is realistic.
- 12 million dollars?
- I know the dollar is low.
All kidding aside.
"You can quickly see   that it will cover a whole year for 65,000 children."
"Including room, board, school and administration."
The telegram arrived in the morning from Gyula's obituary.
Gyuri got confused totally.
Because it occurred to him that a field postcard came to Tót's address in the today's post.
He remembered well.
Gyula wrote it.
Gyuri did not understand it.
He thought that who can write a postcard may not be dead.
"So, not the telegram valid, but the postcard."
Tót family!
Lajos uncle!
Good news!
A half year was not his so good day!
"Do not bellow, you."
The major lord sleeps yet.
Show me.
- The child.
- Let me see.
Dear my parents and Ágika!
I write this postcard on the railway station.
The train of the major lord before with 5 minutes went away.
"Imagine, the a half year was not so good I day."
"I took a bath and drank beer, the major lord was very kind."
"Please, be cordial to major lord, you make big good one with this for me."
Gyula.
"Ow, let there not be something wrong with him only."
From the cold beer caught cold always.
Do not be scared.
He can look after himself.
Drink.
Well onto..the your kind son's health.
"According to the hygiene that ideal one, if somebody is 8 hours sleeps daily."
"But for who he has to work day and night, in is needed let it have him with 5-10 stole minutes."
Gotta be freeway scavengers.
Headed south on the Golden State.
Attention all units.
The contaminated baby food dropped from the truck this morning was possibly picked up and carried off in a converted school bus.
The bus is described as pre-1960 still official yellow color.
The lettering has been painted over.
"When last seen, a canvas tarpaulin tied to its roof."
"Well, they could be anywhere."
It's late.
They gotta stop to camp for the night.
There aren't many places a vehicle like that can stop.
They usually can't afford the regular trailer camps.
"You know, they stop up in the Santa Monica canyons a lot."
Yeah.
They use the open areas alongside the road to camp.
"Okay, right."
You two take Topanga Canyon.
I'll send other units to help.
"Barkley, take Malibu Canyon, all right?"
Hold it.
There's an accident this side of the tunnel.
Took an hour to get a tow truck up.
Another one's hung up there.
It's a big mess.
Motor's the only way through.
"Okay, you go."
"And you two better go too, since you know what it looks like."
"- Make sure you hit the side roads, right?"
- Okay.
There's a rest area up ahead.
I'll take it.
I'll ask over here.
"Bos, did you pack the micro cam?"
I did.
"Well, sync me up."
Care to share?
Cruise director's going to greet the guests at the casino.
- Good to know.
- I'll send pics.
Good luck.
Thank you.
"- Bos, you getting this?"
- Prime time HD.
Check out his boutonniere.
Can you rate my rewards card?
- You guys get that handoff?
- Pretty smooth.
Running his face through the system now.
Check out contestant number two.
- We've I.D.'D Roman's bidders.
- Is there a pattern?
"Well, the thinner guy's Ivan Dunski."
He's got ties to the Russian mafia.
"And the barracuda is Erica Leone, attorney for the east coast's biggest racketeers."
"The other guy, Juan molina, is the leading Cuban drug trafficker."
Roman's dealing out his keycards to some faces.
- Faces?
- Legitimate names who front for big shots in organized crime.
"From Kate's passenger manifest search, she's identified four possible bidders."
- Three of them have already been to the casino.
- Who's the last bidder?
Ricardo Stancati.
Accountant with Detroit mob ties.
Keeps an ultra-low profile.
Monsieur...
I am uncomfortable with the thought of this...
Jewish ritual.
Are you sure it's necessary?
Let me ask you this:
"Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin, for your Führer?"
"Finding out, only then, if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside?"
"Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission, and obtained the one true Ark?"
Hello!
Jones.
Jones!
"I'm going to blow up the Ark, René."
Your persistence surprises even me.
You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
Dr. Jones... surely you don't think you can escape from this island.
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be.
All I want is the girl.
If we refuse?
Then your Führer has no prize.
"Okay, stand back."
"All of you, stand back."
Stand back.
"Okay, Jones."
You win!
Blow it up.
"Yes, blow it up!"
Blow it back to God.
All your life has been spent in pursuit of archeological relics.
Inside the Ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations.
You want to see it open as well as I.
Indiana... we are simply passing through history.
This...
"- What about, Colonel?"
- I don't wanna let the kitty out of the burlap.
- [Vickers] What's with you?
"- Rest assured, it'll be short and sour."
- [Hutchinson] Shut up.!
- [Chairs Bumping] - [Objects Crashing]
- Cut it out.
- What are you talking about?
- What did I say?
- What's all the hugger-mugger?
Don't ask me.
"I was tellin' him about army opportunities, and he jumps me."
"Don't give me that ""opportunities"" bull."
"I'm a registered nurse, just like all these women here."
"When they came into the army, they were made officers automatically."
"I should've been, too, but they made me a lousy private."
The army won't recognize me as a nurse because I'm a man... so I spend half my time pushing a stupid broom.
"- He's right, you know."
- This man's army is very discriminating.
You bet it is.
"You got a lot of nerve, buddy."
"Look, pal, I don't make the rules around here."
"If the service isn't your cup of joe, fine."
I'm not here to shanghai anybody.
Why bother?
There are plenty of other fish in the barrel.
There's a lot of get-ahead guys that think the army would make a darn-swell career.
"- Not for me, buddy."
Forget it.
- ##[Jukebox.
"Big Band, Ballad]"
"Hey, give me a chance."
He was not in his sense!
As if he was mad!
Because of his wifes death!
"Krishna, no one knows where Mr. Kumar is!"
But its really nice to see you back.
I am carrying a burden on my mind!
Now I am really relieved!
"But Mr. NagpaI, how did this happen to you?"
"Yourwife has died, your daughter became widow."
And I started suffering from cancer!
What?
This is how a sinner repays his sins!
The fire that started in your bosss factory was not accidental!
"Krishna, I have started that fire because.."
..Dhanraj paid me to do so!
I had started that fire!
Dhanraj!
"Airport, now we have to play a new role in our life."
We have to meet every one of sirs enemies!
With new avatar and a new identity!
"Yeah, we have to revenge sir and sister-in-Iaw!"
We have to revenge the injustice that happened to them!
And we swearthat unless and until we..
"..bosss destruction, we will not think about anything else."
Brother Ravi!
Brother Ravi!
"What is it, Vicky?"
Why are you shouting?
You wiIIjump forjoy once I will let you know the news!
"Brother, exporter has come with orders.."
..worth crores of rupees!
If we can get our hands on one order..
- Erode.
So she has been is caught in our radar!
Her name is neither Deepa nor Ashwini.
It is Vasundhara.
Her native is Trichy.
She worked in a jewellery shop there.
She duplicated the jewels that don't sell...
And stole the original.
She was caught red-handed one day.
"From the May of 2013 to the November of 2013, she was imprisoned at Trichy Jail."
Her father is no more.
Her mother passed away when she was in prison.
Any relatives?
"One maternal uncle, Ravi."
Do you want to see who that is?
Look.
So it's a well-planned and executed ordeal.
But the mastermind behind all of this is
Vasundhara.
"I am not able to, Vikram."
You know that my parents are no more.
My brother is all I have.
Why does he have all these problems!
You could have told me in advance.
Never-ending problems...
Hospital atmosphere...
Smell of medicines...
"Amidst all of this, the happiness that I have left is when I'm away from all these."
and spend some time with you.
Do you want to me to cry that time also?
What do doctors have to say?
"Before the tumor grows further, a liver transplant has to be done."
You should be starting at the bottom.
"BOYD OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS CENTER 155 LAFAYETTE STREET WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16"
I'm number 37.
I've been waiting for five years.
But the sicker ones keep moving up the list past me.
"You having any problems, Carmen?"
Not yet.
But I'd like to get off this thing and have a life.
"In Peru, you can get a kidney in 48 hours."
People line up around the block to sell them.
Surprised you're not on a plane right now.
I would be.
If I had 100 grand to pay for transplant.
"Here, I'll probably die waiting."
"I've been waiting seven years, and I'm sick of nurses and doctors and hospitals and praying."
Man of your means has other options.
Buy a kidney?
No.
I've had a good life.
No regrets.
I'd rather leave the money to my grandchildren.
But you'd know where to go if you changed your mind.
Everybody does.
We used to talk about it all the time in my dialysis group.
Can you give us a name?
"I could, but it would only be a rumor."
And I don't necessarily believe it's wrong.
Then why didn't you do it?
Because we spent 90 grand on our wedding.
There's nothing left.
Now she's gonna die because I can't even afford to save her life.
Staying positive is better for Kyle.
"Lose the judge-face, Zoe."
He took a very heavy course load this semester.
"Jenny Humphrey, drug dealer."
I can work with that.
We hear Blair Waldorf's headed for a comeback.
But if she wants to keep her fans happy...
Send.
She better keep serving up the hits.
Sleep well?
"Don't even, Serena."
"I can't believe you posted on ""Gossip Girl"""
That I'm a drug dealer.
I didn't post anything.
Fine.
"Maybe you didn't send the actual e-mail,"
But everyone knows you have Blair do your dirty work.
I can't help what Blair does.
And you are the one who played Pablo Escobar
To underage preppy pill poppers.
My dad and I were finally in a good place
"After a really, really bad patch."
"And if he finds this out, it'll destroy everything."
"Well, maybe Rufus should know"
That his daughter is dealing drugs.
"After all, you thought my father should know"
All my adventures at boarding school.
Fine.
"Maybe I shouldn't have said anything,"
But maybe you shouldn't be lying to your dad.
Are you really lecturing me about lying to a parent?
"My dad knows who I am,"
But you're building a relationship with yours
I spent a fucking fortune on mine.
Did you?
I mean...
Have you been married once?
Twice.
Was that on the first one?
"No, I spent nothing on the first one."
I'm so relieved.
And I actually hope she's watching.
It should have been Vegas.
It would be actually easier to kill them.
Than get a divorce?
I like you.
I'm just saying that.
I'm not advocating killing anyone.
Sure you're not!
"I'm not saying that, but when you've been on the phone to British Gas for six hours,"
"""Just take his name off the fucking gas bill!"""
You just go...
"""I fucking killed him."
"I fucking shot him."""
That's what you want to say.
Do you know what I mean?
Can you tell us about your Top 30 hit?
"About seven years ago, I decided I wanted to try and have a hit in Ireland, but you don't want to be..."
"You don't have a Top 10 hit, because people will remember, cos I do music as part of my comedy."
"It might be one of the things like the Chicken Song, where people shout it at you for years to come."
For the rest of your life.
Yeah.
So I decided number 27 would be the correct number to aim for and February is the month where no-one buys singles.
"It used to be the month, anyway."
This is pre-downloads.
"When I'm sad, they're here for me."
"Oh, my God!"
They're just genuine guys.
We love them because they sing our feelings.
They say what we want to hear...
"-...and no boys, no one, says to us."
-Yes.
They can't be real.
They make us believe that everything is possible if we believe in ourselves.
I know they love me.
Even they don't know me.
I know.
They have changed my Iife.
"It may sound cheesy, but they have."
"We love you, One Direction!"
I'm right in front row!
You sing!
"Here we go, O2!"
think our fans are dedication at its best.
hat they've done for us  in three years is just....
It's unheard of.
here was this group  of what called superfans.
And they were like promoters.
"Go on, spread the word!"
So start tweeting and I literally made it my Iife.
"I've sent like 1 6,000 tweets."
I was tweeting from Japan.
"hat was quite mad  watching our witter just gradually, Iike, keep totting up."
"hese girls are crazy about One Direction, and I've got no idea why."
I'm not a neuroscientist.
As soon as Directioners listen to music and find the music pleasurable what happens in the brain is that a neurochemical called dopamine is released and provides feelings of joy and happiness.
Shivers.
"So you're telling me that you want me to go flirt with Trent, rub up against his body... take my hands and stroke them down his five, six, seven, eight abs."
- No.
- I'm not finished yet!
And then I'm going to grope his perfect ass.
I'm going to make out with him.
him and steal his diamond back with my tongue.
"Look, I'll do it."
I won't like it... but I'm gonna love it!
"For real, I'm tired of pretending that we're not together."
"Listen, I know you said that we only went on one date together but we've been on a lot of dates together."
We spent the night at a bed and breakfast in Lake
"Michigan and no, I didn't tell any of our friends about it because you promised me not to but I guess they knew why anyway."
Know why that is?
Because you actually did tell them?
Yeah.
He took pictures of you sleeping.
"Completely shaved, huh?"
I liked it.
You know what?
I'm not apologizing for it.
I'm glad that us is a thing because honestly
I've been waiting for us to happen for like three years now.
And if you're embarrassed to be with me that's fine.
I could deal with that.
Uh...
wait.
Were you gonna kiss...
OK.
OK.
"Yeah, mm-hmm."
"So we're good, yeah?"
- I'm in.
They kidnapped Amanda because they wanted something from him.
"And when he didn't give it, they killed her."
And he never told anyone.
You think the senator's going to make the same mistake?
"No, I'm not going to let him."
But he's holding back and I want to know why.
I hear you're having a lousy day.
Now is not the time.
"Before you get the wrong idea, I liked McNeal."
He was the first politician I covered and the last one who came out clean.
That's good.
Maybe you should put it in his obit.
Maybe I will... if you tell me why you were with him when he killed himself.
That's a good question;
"you come up with an answer, why don't you give me a call."
"Speaking of calls, do you care to comment on this one?"
"Mom, it's Sara;"
I need to talk to you.
About Jeffrey.
"It's important, so call me as soon as you can."
Where'd you get that?
We both met with Sara's parents.
I guess they liked me better.
They'll get over it.
"The Senator and Sara-- the marriage wasn't as perfect as everybody thought, was it?"
Off the record.
On the record.
No one's is.
"Ice machine's ready, Cap."
How 'bout you?
"Last beers, boys."
You're dating nothing but swordfish for the next three weeks.
All you think of is that dress!
What does she need it for?
Just so she can appear in it?
So she looks pretty.
What's wrong with that?
"Pretty, and for whom?"
She definitely wants to impress someone!
They want to impress each other.
Do you think we only dress up to attract some boy...
During that dance I felt she's longing to dance like that with a boy in a pretty dress.
So what?
She's eighteen.
"is she ready for it psychologically, or only biologically?"
Why do you ask me what I think about it?
"Of course, I'm interested, aren't I?"
Why do you analyse it like that?
Buy her material for that dress!
What do you keep worrying about?
You keep changing the subject.
"When you're meant to buy a dress, you begin philosophising."
"- Excuse me, where does the architect live?"
"- Sorry, who?"
I'm looking for the architect.
- Which one?
There are several here.
- Mr Ravinger.
There are as many Ravingers here as there are Anabaptists
"We're five families living here, you know."
"They have a boy in the ninth form, Marcel."
Then that's mine.
What a coincidence.
Do you know something about Marcel?
"Hello, Damon."
Ever hear of knocking?
An invitation wasn't necessary.
I'm surprised that no living person resides here.
Is it just you and your brother?
"Yeah, how do you keep out unwelcome vampires?"
Kill them.
Damn.
"Have a seat, Damon."
I was hoping we could have a word.
Sure.
Freak.
We've taken up residence at a farmhouse outside of town.
It'll suffice for now.
- All 25 vampires?
"- Not all, some."
I imagine that a few have already left town.
"Others are probably still in the woods, or like us, acclimating."
- How'd they get out of the tomb?
- I think the witch screwed up that part of her hocus-pocus.
- Oh.
I understand that the founding families still have a secret council?
- And you're a part of it.
- Pft.
That's ridiculous.
I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet.
I'm up to speed.
And so am I.
"Now that you've infiltrated the council, I need to know everything starting with a list of the members and their families."
Everyone you've supplied with vervain.
"Yes, that will have to stop immediately."
What exactly are you trying to achieve?
But I felt like it was the right thing to do.
"Look, I know you and my father used to hate each other,"
But that was a long time ago.
You are the only one
Still having this fight.
He has moved on.
Is everything okay?
Rufus went to the board and blocked dad
From getting the apartment.
"Serena, that's absurd."
Rufus would never do something like that.
"I would, to protect my marriage."
"I don't trust William's intention,"
And I don't want him living under my roof.
"Rufus, you're being completely paranoid."
"At first he tried he tried to isolate you from your family,"
And now he's moving into the building
To get closer to you.
"I told you, he's moving in to be close to the children."
All I see here is jealousy run amok.
"Mom, come on."
We should go.
"Lil Rufus, it's probably best if you don't come tonight."
What are you two doing here?
This is an alumni event.
Columbia puts aside a bunch of tickets for students.
"We'd invite you to join, but they were very explicit-"
No fake students allowed.
"Hey, doctor."
"If you'll excuse me a moment,"
I should go say hello to a few old colleagues.
I'll be right back.
"No, I've been waiting here to apologise."
"Well, well."
"Not to you, not now, but, well, to the United States."
We accept your apology.
Look.
I came here with good intentions and at another time
"I might admit you had provocation the other night, but for a grown man to..."
"Well, it's positively disgraceful and I ruined my best pair of nylons."
"Have you any idea what nylons cost these days, if you can get them?"
"Whatever it was, it was worth it."
"So help me, next time I have a bottle I'll launch that guy."
Hold it!
"Keep trying, Plotski."
Poletski.
"What's the matter, Cookie?"
I got my walking papers.
They're sending me back to my old unit.
You'll be the best cook in the British Army.
Not me.
I've applied for a transfer to the Commandos.
"Hey, you've got something there."
"Not a hope, McKendrick."
I couldn't possibly agree to a transfer.
Look.
Do you realise what it costs to train just one parachutist?
"Over £5,000."
"If I transfer you, what have we got for our money?"
Absolutely nothing.
"There are two ways a man can get out of here, by refusing to jump or feet first."
"Is that final, Sir?"
"Of course, you could refuse to jump."
"All right, you can fall out."
Hmm.
I wasn't ready to do the kind of dancing she wanted to do.
Wow.
High school me would've hated high school you.
"If we're doing this, we should do it right."
Chaperones are prom secret service.
"It's like I keep trying to tell you, Boo-- stop talking to me."
"Look, tonight won't be so bad."
All we have to do is stand around.
I'm gonna act like I did at my own prom--
I'll be aloof and above it all and judge everyone.
"- You'll seem different, but not."
- Yeah.
"Guys, none of us are gonna take this that seriously--"
I now take that back.

How come I'm the only one who's in the prom spirit?
'Cause you're the only one insane enough to think that we're gonna jump aboard your crazy train.
"Ellie, I caught some of that, and I don't think I liked it."
You know what sucks?
The fact that I'm the only one that is weird enough and goofy enough to take this as a chance for us all to have a little fun ourselves.
That's what sucks.

"Hutchinson, what would you say to tantalum foil here?"
"- Good idea, sir."
- Oh.
"After all, you're the doctor."
"Hey, old-timer, I'm lookin' for Colonel Potter."
"Could you speak up, sonny?"
My bird and I are a little hard of hearin'.
"Sorry, sir."
"Uh, I thought, uh..."
"Eh, that's okay, Sarge."
I'm subbing' for my company clerk.
- What can I do you for?
"- Sergeant Joe Vickers, sir."
Area retention officer.
I've got the names of your enlistees who are due for discharge.
I wanted to talk to them about re-upping.
I trust you brought your portable torture kit.
"[Laughs] No high pressure from me, sir."
I just wanna point out the big picture.
"You remind me of a ""feller"" who once tried to sell me a dead mule."
Said it'd be no problem to feed and it didn't kick.
"[Laughing] That's a good one, sir."
Uh...
"Oh, I have this, uh, memo for you too, sir."
"As, uh, C.O., you're obliged to try to get your officers to, uh, extend their tours."
You'd better talk to the commander about that.
I'm just the company clerk.
"## [Humming] Oh, Charles."
Read any good books lately?
Professor Hutchinson just came in.
Why don't you go over and thank him for that lesson he taught you today?
"Bandy your japes, apes."
And he was a cripple.
Goebbels:
Look at Himmler.
Hitler:
"You're not exactly Clark Gable yourself, my little doctor."
Himmler looks like a weasel.
Goebbels:
Making our enemies look bad was often easier than making us--
Hitler:
The perfect Aryan Superman.
A weak stomach in the presence of violence.
Woo!
Heinrich Himmler.
Didn't anyone notice?
"He was ruthless, but not careless."
And Hitler-loyal.
Who better to run the SS?
Art must be plausible.
"If you wrote a script about Aryan superiority and cast Himmler, people would laugh, walk out of the theatre."
"On the political stage, you can do anything."
Let's put up another reel.
Images to blur facts.
Hitler:
"In World War I, I was a messenger."
I never killed anyone.
I am a vegetarian.
I never eat dead animals.
I loathe big game hunters-- a gruesome bloodbath.
I would not allow smoking in my presence.
We discouraged tobacco consumption.
I insisted on the humane treatment of pets and farm animals.
I even issued a decree regulating the cooking of lobsters to minimize their suffering.
"Yes, it would be a pleasure, mademoiselle."
You are in danger?
"It's against all my instincts, but the man persists."
"And with the hotel being so empty, there's a great danger of my getting stuck for the rest of the holiday."
[ Chuckles ]
"Ah, the galloping Major Barnes."
"Here for the fishing, he tells me."
Ah.
The behavior of the English abroad is something I have always found peculiar.
[ Both chuckle ]
"At least he's not a bottom-pincher, Mr. Poirot."
[ Conversing in Italian ]
[ Laughter ]
"Look at them -- troublemakers, always looking for a fight."
Perhaps.
"But for me, the English is more cold-blooded."
His violence is more calculated.
"We've spent all day at sea, and my wife's exhausted, so let's get to the hotel as fast as possible, with our luggage intact."
Make sure it's secure and stay close behind the other car.
"Excuse me, but aren't these the cars from the Palace Hotel?"
Yes.
Well?
"Well, we're staying there, too, you know."
"Well, you'll have to wait for them to come back."
"The hotel, please, driver."
And try not to hit anything.
"Come on, darling."
Thank you.
LYALL:
"Good heavens,"
I do believe that's Valentine Chantry.
POIROT:
We won't fit the description so easily.
No problem.
Ain't that some shit.
"You going to be able to make it a whole day without me, baby?"
I don't know.
DALE:
Looks to me like just her brother and her mom is there.
DUD:
What kind of people are they?
Good people.
Christian people.
I can't believe she got mixed up in shit like this.
"Hurricane, I'm still unclear how you know this Lila Walker."
"Well, sir, I arrested her for shoplifting once."
She was just a kid in high school.
All she took was some lipstick and...
You know that shit they put on their eyes.
Wasn't worth 10 bucks.
I could tell right off she wasn't bad.
Just sort of high-spirited.
So I decided to try to help her out.
"You know, talk to her."
Then one day she just up and disappeared.
"Somebody said she'd decided to take off for Hollywood, become a movie star."
"Anyway, that was about, oh, five years ago."
That's the last I heard of her till now.
She's come a long way from ripping off lipstick.
I don't believe she killed anybody.
"I mean, that kid in the closet, she opens the door, sees him, then closes the damn door."
That proves she's not a killer.
"Pardon me, Hurricane, but that don't prove shit."
DUD:
Not that much.
Most people did what you did.
They saved or they paid down debt.
We don't want people to save and reduce debt?
"We do, but when the next guy's president."
- You win.
- I always do.
"Yes, sir."
- I'll tell you what I find interesting.
- What's that?
"You. $35,000 a year, a sister to support and you gave $ 1435 to charity?"
I'm not sure that check isn't better off in your hands.
"Oh, I'm taking it."
Don't be ridiculous.
"When you get to your place, you're gonna find a DVD player and that wimp-ass Bond movie."
- Mr. President...
And I threw in Yeoman of the Guard on CD.
- That was an incredibly nice gesture.
- I'm really something.
Mr. President.
"- Hey, John."
"- Could we have a minute, sir?"
- Yeah.
"- Charlie, get that woman on the phone."
I'm feeling magical tonight.
They're in the tunnel.
The readings show nothing beyond the predictable level of radiation.
"The flatbed's back on its way, and the Carlsbad is behind gates."
- So we dodged a bullet.
- Yeah.
"We pack this stuff in two inches of stainless steel, four inches of lead."
We rammed it with trains and dropped it from helicopters and it still isn't gonna protect us from the thing we haven't thought of.
I think on some level he knew what he was doing when he charged those men.
You think he wanted to die?
I think he was suffering.
I think he wanted to be with his wife.
"You know, there's this Buddhist concept called Kalyana-mittata, or spiritual companionship."
And they say that it transcends death or rebirth.
"Well, maybe he got what he wanted."

Maybe he did.

I shall ride ahead and announce His Majesty's arrival.
"No, I shall announce my own arrival."
A little surprise will do them a world of good.
May I ask what this is about?
"Her Majesty did not confide in me, Madame."
You mean you know but you won't tell me.
The Marquise de Montespan.
"Her Majesty has summoned me here for a reason, I imagine."
"Yes, it relates to your debts."
And I was not aware that I had any.
By the way did you make some agreement with the car back there?
of course...
That's because they're my friends.
packed in concrete about now...
I don't know where you're from but it's way too early in the morning to be fighting.
Yu Ominae.
One of the special agents of the Arcam Foundation which protects dangerous ruins of extremely ancient civilizations.
He has rare physical abilities and reflexes... his true potential is number one in the organization.
His true potential really isn't that much.
Ominae's cheap tricks won't have any effect on me.
I heard your unit was cruelly betrayed by him before.
Where is he now?
we lost him after the attack.
No matter.
I know he'll be coming here after all.
Arcam is just a private foundation...
I'll make this mountain his grave.
Colonel Macdougal?
That's the mountain.
It's one of Arcam's.
Hey!
Damn!
Why are you so quick to start shooting?
How long are you going to walk me around like this?
keep your mouth shut.
But it's like I've been telling you...
No one from Arcam dresses like that.
I couldn't help it!
Doc..!
Doc Mayzel!
eh?
be quiet.
"Victim's hands were bound in a 3-inch chain, ship's chandlery type."

Where have you been?
- Had a busy night.
- I'm sure you did.
Read this morning's operations printout?
What about it?
I was with Vinnie Zapatti last night.
He's dead because of Tino Zapatti's probation report.
Now there's four deaths.
They're connected.
- That's all I know...
- That's all I want to know.
Just trying to circle the wagons.
Circle the wagons?
Who do you think you are?
Some gumshoe in a dime novel loose-cannoning around the city?

You're the mayor's right hand!
What are you fucking around for?
You see this desk?
"It belonged to Fiorello LaGuardia, ""the little flower."""
He was about five-foot tall.
Used to read the funny papers to children over the radio and was about the best mayor the city ever had.
Know what LaGuardia said?
"""Why is it every time you can do some good the nice people come in and mess you up?"""
Be nice.
Don't mess me up.
- Did I wake you up?
- You kidding?
"I've been trying to figure out how to raise $ 10,000."
Not really.
I'm sort of all right as I am.
"Please, Will."
"What does that mean? ""Please"" what?"
Look at yourself.
You're 38 and you've never had a job or a relationship that lasted longer than two months.
I wouldn't exactly say you were okay.
"I mean, I would say you were a disaster."
"I mean, what is the point of your life?"
Bloody hell.
You're right.
There's probably no point to my life but thank you for bringing it up.
The reason we wanted you to come here today was we wanted to ask you how would you like to be Imogene's godfather?
Seriously?
Seriously.
"Listen, I'm really, really touched."
But you must be joking.
I couldn't possibly think of a worse godfather for Imogene.
You know me.
I'll drop her at her christening.
"I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th, when I'll take her out and get her drunk and possibly, let's face it, you know, try and shag her."
"I mean, seriously, it's a very, very bad choice."
"We know, I just thought you had hidden depths."
No.
No.
You've always had that wrong.
I really am this shallow.
Here we are.
"You know you don't have to walk me to school anymore now, Mum."
I know the way now.
But what if I like walking you to school?
Right.
"I mean, just drink all your water you can get inside yourself."
"You know, just lots and lots of water."
"That way it'll fill up your stomach, and you won't get hungry."
And you won't get thirsty either.
"Oh, good."
That way I can slosh my way through my twilight years.
Bob?
I hope I went peacefully
"Sorry, Emily."
I didn't know you were awake.
Bob?
What are you doing?
"Oh, I... couldn't go to sleep, so I thought I'd weigh myself."
"Well, how much did you lose?"
I'm afraid I'm like the stock market.
I'm up an eighth.
"Emily, this diet isn't working."
"Well, Bob, you've gotta give it a chance."
You've only been on it five hours.
"Emily, I gained an eighth of a pound in five hours."
"Well, that's all the water you've been drinking."
I can't understand it.
"I never had a problem with weight... and then all of a sudden, I weigh 10 pounds more than I did on our wedding night."
You weighed yourself on our wedding night?
I had nothing else to do.
You were in the bathroom for 45 minutes.
"Well, I wanted to look pretty for you, Bob."
I was... trying on nightgowns and primping.
"I mean, after all, Bob, it was a special occasion."
"You do remember, don't you, sweetheart?"
I've got to stop my stomach from growling.
Maybe I'll have some celery.
"Last month, I had to lay him off, two weeks shy of retirement."
Lawrence did not take it well.
What the hell was that?
"Doc, I don't have all year to figure this out."
I told you I needed to study Wickes.
You just watched him for two hours.
Yes.
And then you blocked my view at the critical moment.
"First mention of AUTEC, all I saw was the back of your big fat head."
I can't even confirm now that he was involved in the blackmail.
Looks like Ridgeway might be.
"Oh, you think Wickes was rattled enough to give up a partner just like that?"
"Or he's just telling us what he knows, and he's innocent."
I didn't try to block your view.
I didn't try to ruin anything.
That's it?
Is that all you have to say?
No.
Lawrence Ridgeway.

Say hello to Lawrence Ridgeway.
"A spry 62, and loving it."
"Third-generation steelworker, hired at Wickes Steel when he was just a kid."
"Dedicated employee, sort of like yours truly."
"By the way,"
I want to thank you for allowing me to participate in the SECNAV op.
Thank the Doc.
She's the one who chose you.
"Yeah, I thought your game show host quality would be good for the stage."
Ziva?
ZIVA:
Ridgeway has had a rough year.
- What did Mr. Somers say to that?
"Told me to help myself, that they'd all be looking for a job next morning."
I told him that Axel would blow his top.
"I think that'll be all, sir."
Thank you.
Cross-examine.
Just where at the Somers factory did this conversation take place?
"Well, it was in the parking lot that I ran into him, actually."
You share a common parking lot with Somers' factory?
"No, no, of course not."
Then how did you know you'd be able to reach him there?
I called him at his office.
They said he'd be leaving.
- You called from where?
- From my home.
"- Really, I don't see--"
- You went home and then you decided?
"No, no, I'd gone home for an early bite because I knew I had to come back to the office that evening."
It was on my way.
"Really, Your Honor, I don't see--"
"May it please the court, I ask permission at this time to recall a witness."
"Yes, Axel told me to put in calls long distance-- one for you and one for Mr. Hadley."
"The call to Mr. Hadley, what time was that?"
Right after you hung up.
About 8?
8:30?
Was the call completed?
No.
"The phone rang and rang, but no answer."
All right.
So I drove up to the Valley.
It was there at the motel that I spoke to Somers.
-Like what?
Speaking in a language she's never known or studied.
What else?
I don't know.
I'd have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts.
You probably know as much about possession as most priests.
"Look, your daughter doesn't say she's a demon."
She says she's the devil himself.
If you've seen as many psychotics as I have you'd realize that's the same thing as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte.
You asked me what I think is best for your daughter.
Six months under observation in the best hospital you can find.
"You show me Regan's double same face, same voice, everything and I'd know it wasn't Regan."
I'd know in my gut.
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter.
I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind.
Tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good.
You tell me that!
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
-No.
-Did you know my mother died recently?
"-Yes, I did."
I'm very sorry.
-No.
Is Regan aware of it?
Not at all.
Why do you ask?
It's not important.
Good night.
Hello?
"- Here, take it and just don't...."
"Not for sale, not even for display."
This guy operates in a vacuum.
Which speaks to the intensely private nature of his obsession.
Mineral analysis just came in on the hourglass sand.
Also from upstate New York?
"No, it's local."
Most likely from the Platte River.
"What's the matter, Sergeant?"
It's what they found next to him in the sand.
Human bone and tooth enamel.
"Please, don't hurt me."
Please.
- Hello.
- Hi there.
"Uh, I was trying to call Hotch, but it kept going to voicemail."
He's still at the hospital with JJ.
What's going on?
"Ok, I did what man chocolate asked."
I got this list.
"There are certain things that should never exist, and one of those is this depressingly long list."
Does anything specific jump out at you?
"Aside from the horribleness of it all, no."
"You know, send me all the police, hospital, and child services transcripts associated with the cases."
Everything on all of them?
"Yeah, I'll print out hard copies here."
Ok.
"You're gonna need a forklift, and I hope you're using recyclable paper, but..."
On its way.
All right.
"Thank you so much, Garcia."
Why are you doing this?
I never did anything to you.
I started going to the ballet on my days off.
And to the Cinematheque.
I try to see all the silent movies.
"German, American, everything."
Then I tell her all I've seen.
These last four years have been the richest in my life.
"Looking after Alicia, doing the things she liked to do, except traveling, of course."
"For me, it's the opposite with Lydia."
How come?
I can't even touch her.
I don't recognize her body.
I can't even help the nurses to turn her over in the bed.
And I feel so despicable.
Talk to her.
Tell her that.
"I'd like to, but she can't hear me."
Why are you so sure about that?
Because her brain is turned off.
"A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so."
"You havetopayattention to women, talk to them, be thoughtful occasionally."
Caress them.
"Remember they exist, they're alive and they matter to us."
That's the only therapy.
I know from experience.
What experience have you had with women?
"Benigno, what experience have you had with women?"
What?
What experience have you had with women?
Me?
A lot.
I lived 20 years day and night with one and 4 years with this one.
I love the bullfighter's boyfriend.
"But there are better homes for those boys, elsewhere."
This is win-win.
"Good for the orphans, good for Charlestown."
"That Newman Home, it's as old as our city."
Old being the key word.
Your town is a rotten relic.
"Now, you can be seen as the man who finally helped save it, or be blamed for standing in the way of progress."
"Rest assured, there will be progress."
Why don't we have a meeting of the council before you leave town?
- Good idea.
- Super.
"- Good night, Your Majesty."
- Bye-bye.
Elbow to the head.
Elbow to the head!
"Show some bite, Hounds."
I'm warning you.
Do not make me come down there.
Do you know that golf is the world's number one vacation sport?
The average course provides hundreds of jobs.
And a pro-tour stop could mean millions of dollars in revenue for Charlestown's businesses.
A vote for Frazier Point is a vote for the future.
"And it's good for the poor little orphans, too."

Timmy.
Frazier Point is a hole-in-one for all of us.

I did not know you were interested in literature.
You could not.
I do not believe the subject has ever arisen between us... until now.
"Miss Marianne, may I venture a proposal?"
A proposal?
Allow me to select a book for you from Mr Palmer's extensive library.
"It may help pass the time while you remain here, and it would give me great pleasure."
Thank you.
"Yes, I would be delighted."
And perhaps we might discuss it when I visit you at Barton.
You are to visit us at Barton?
Oh...
You did not know?
Your mother has invited me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"- Thank you, Mrs Wallis."
"- Thank you, miss."
I wish you a good journey.
"And you, Mrs Jennings."
What can I say to you?
"I'll have no thanks, my dear."
I've enjoyed every moment the two of you spent with me.
I'm grateful for the pleasure of the company of such lovely people.
"Now then, I wish you no more sorrows and much future happiness."

"In terms of eugenics, absolutely."
The eyes of the snake.
The eyes that Suzukichi drew.
See that?
Those eyes are....
"Grandma is there, too."
What are they doing?
They are chanting Buddhist sutras.
"Now and then, old ladies get together and hold a religious service... for the souls of the departed."
That's why there's no Buddhist altar at home.
It's already August.
The day of the atomic bomb is coming.
August 9.
Grandpa's death day.
I see there are other people who have the same kind of idea as Grandma.
There are quite a few old people like that around here.
Suzukichi was one of them.
although the point where the atom bomb was dropped is quite far from here.
Snake eyes?
The eyes on Suzukichi's drawing... are not snake eyes.
They are the eyes of the flash.
That's right.
"Around here... on that day, when we heard the air raid siren..."
Suzukichi and me were looking... towards Nagasaki over that mountain.
Both of us standing right here.
"suddenly, the sky split in half and glared at us."
A big eye... peeped through the crack.
The big eye... glared fiercely... at both of us.
We just looked at the sky like we were frozen.
With a tremendously big sound... the ground started shaking.
Suzukichi was terrified.
He didn't move.
"Now, I think we..."
"and by ""we"", I mean the two of you..."
Might be able to find something on there that'll give us a lead to find his West Coast counterpart.
"Rick, we need to talk."
About what?
I'll give you two the room.
[Door closes]
You remember when we first met?
How could I forget?
You sucker-punched me in the face.
No.
"No, we'd met before that."
"A year and a half earlier, to be precise."
You mean this whole time you knew?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Hayley.
Didn't lie about that.
"Technically, I didn't lie about anything."
"I misrepresented, sure, but I-I didn't lie."
But why?
"Because a year and a half ago, you asked me to."
"In fact, you begged."
I don't understand.
"So ages ago, I did some freelance work for MI-6, and I met an American spy on an op."
"He was an older gentleman, very handsome, smart as a whip."
My father.
Jackson Hunt.
"Year and a half ago, he calls me, asks me to keep an eye out on you here in L.A."
Said you were sticking your nose where it didn't belong.
What did he say I was doing?
"[Sighs] I didn't ask, he didn't say."
"But I do know that after your two weeks in Thailand, your undercover mission for the CIA was over and you were supposed to go home."
He was gonna propose to her.
What's that got to do with anything?
It's got everything to do with it!
"Jared would do anything for Dana, and she knew it, too."
"That's why she wanted to straighten out her life, l-look for a way out."
Dana was part of the heist crew.
"Yeah, but..."
but she wanted to quit.
For Jared.
Except they wouldn't let her.
Who's they?
The rest of the team?
"No, no, no."
Not everyone was involved.
I wasn't either.
I didn't know about the robberies until Dana told me at the hospital.
I swear.
"So, what was Dana's job on the crew?"
"She was the getaway driver, but like I said, she wanted out, she threatened to come clean if they didn't let her go."
"So, what, they stabbed Jared to warn her?"
They found out that Dana was gonna tell him the truth about the heists.
"She convinced Jared not to go to the hospital, so he wouldn't get hurt worse."
"Dana couldn't tell Jared the truth, either."
She just asked him to... to trust her.
And the money in Jared's garage.
It was her cut.
She decided to tell...
Jared the truth this weekend and... somehow they found out.
Which is why they killed Jared.
"And they... and they threatened to kill her and, um... and me, too, if... if she tried anything else."
That's why I was afraid to tell you the truth.
They're vicious.
The pressure's off.
Do you know how much pressure I felt?
Do you?
"All last week, I felt like a giant man and his brother were sitting on my chest."
- A giant man?
- And his giant brother.
- Did they have names?
- Clem and Clem.
Same names.
Which did not reflect well on their mothers' imagination.
- Mother.
- Mothers.
There were two Clems.
- 'Cause they were brothers.
"- Yes, so they had mothers."
You're drawing me into your drunken world.
"It's not a bad place to be, my friend."
Tank's empty.
- What is this?
- What?
This life plan book thing.
A gift for the grads from the happy people at Hartford Community College.
"Hey, how many margaritas is too many margaritas?"
If you can't remember where the living room is.
I'm still good.
"Okay, here's an interesting question for you."
'Have you given any thought to how children will work into your future plans?
'
"They're not gonna stand in my way, that's for sure."
"I plan to have some, of course, but I'm just gonna knock them out... and have nanny catch them and care for them... make sure Mick Jagger doesn't come near them... and then return them to me when they're 21."
What about me?
You are my favorite eldest child.
- It was so cold.
She has a funny story about the dance.
I can't remember what it is.
"But, like, it was a dance that they used to do in 8th grade or high school or something."
No.
"You know, what she did was she went back to Tawny Kitaen's choreography in the Whitesnake video."
"- Oh, my God."
- And she copied some of the moves.
"Yeah, because in that video, basically it's Tawny Kitaen dancing on the hood of a Trans Am or something."
- I don't know what it was.
- She looks great.
I mean...
- She modified it for the Yugo.
- She did.
Look at that wind.
That wind doesn't even...
That jacket just goes the other direction.
And they had these huge heater-tunnels things that blew hot air on you.
"It's great because it's so sexy, but so hilarious at the same time."
- It's so cheesy.
- It's so Tris.
"- Cheesy dance, but she looks fantastic."
- It's so painfully cold right now.
Look how cute she is.
What were you thinking when you were watching this take after take?
"I think I was thinking I'd rather be somewhere warm and ""Does she really need me to be here for this?"""
"- Oh, my God."
- Look how cute she...
Look how just...
- She's so adorable.
"- Oh, Mike."
"It looks like there's a wind machine, it's so perfect."
Off your duff Hartley
"One, two."
"One, two."
"""I greatly appreciated the jar of nuts you sent,"" comma..."
"""but would you please show up for your next appointment?"""
"Just sign it, ""Sincerely yours,"" and, you can type it after lunch."
What's the matter?
"I went to Jerry's health club, and I tried to keep up with a 65-year-old woman."
Did you lose any weight?
I don't know.
I'm too sore to get up on the scale.
Ha-ha.
"Listen, Bob."
Do you want another pitcher of water before I go to lunch... or should I just run a hose in here?
"You know, Carol, being on a diet is bad enough without people making fun of it."
"I mean, you probably don't know that."
You've probably never been on a diet.
"In five minutes, I will have been on a diet for seven years."
"You looking forward to your birthday party, Bob?"
"It's not a party, Carol."
"It's, just a small dinner."
"In my case, a very small dinner."
"Oh, listen, Bob."
I wanna ask you something.
Do you think I can have an extra 15 minutes off for lunch?
I have to buy a birthday present for someone.
"Oh, sure."
Take as much time as you want and buy that somebody something real nice.
I certainly will.
"- Well, see you later."
- Right.
- You pressed the button?
"By killing Cuddappah Raja for these people, you've kept up your father's promise."
How are you going to save your father who is in Konda Reddy's custody?
I know where my father is.
I will come back with my father.
You leave this place with these people.
Welcome!
Are you Singamuthu's son?
You can't find your father.
Konda Reddy has entered your people's camp.
You don't know about him.
He can knock 3 heads in one swing.
I don't know how many would have died by now.
Your men are going to die there.
And you're going to die here.
Catch him.
Get everyone into the bus.
Leave no child.
Get every child into the bus.
"When we locked up Singamuthu, your boss, everyone worked in fear."
"Now that his son is back, have you lost your fear?"
Get every child into the bus.
"Sir, all are innocent children."
Give us any punishment.
Don't harm them.
"Look, your children will be taken to Bihar or Orissa."
"If anyone tries to escape, we will cut your children's limbs and make them beg on Bombay streets."
Leave my brother.
Tell them to leave my brother.
How will they leave your brother?
You should've thought before doing something.
I told you but you never listened to me.
Now Singamuthu's son beat their men.
Is the article ready?
I want to take off for 10 days.
Leave for 10 days?
You people are hopeless!
If you think of going to the police...
You are inviting trouble for yourself!
I'm hungry.
Please help me.
Sorry.
Don't run!
Catch him!
Stop there.
"Yesterday night, on the Kanyakumari- Nagercoil highway... a man was found dead after being hit by an unidentified vehicle."
His age is presumed to be about 50.
As we had asked Inspector Arivazhagan of Kanyakumari...
A man who was walking on the highway was hit by a vehicle and died on the spot.
The man had no identity card or phone on him.
So we were unable to get his details.
Investigation is going on now.
Those who know any detail about him can approach the Kanyakumari police station.
I'm going to Kanyakumari for an urgent work.
I'll call once I'm done with it.
Inform dad.
Stop!
Why are you going?
A man was found dead in the Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway.
"Either we run away from the city,"
Or the whole family...
Why are you so worried after coming to Kanyakumari?
Any problem?
You said wanted to visit police station as well?
Nothing.
He never mentioned trouble at work.
- You think there could be a connection?
- Could be.
"You hear ""A.T.F. investigation,"" it raises flags."
"Well, I wish I could be more helpful."
Sorry.
You should just focus on getting your son back.It's the best way to deal with it.
"Evelyn, I think you're stronger than you realize."
Then maybe I should have just stuck with it.
"You know, what would have happened if- if I had have pretended that everything was all right?"
"But I didn't want my family to be a lie- not forJasper, not for me."
You're doing the best thing.
Believe me.
I know a little something about this.
"I've stayed, and I've left, and sometimes leaving is what you have to do."
"Must be lonely, what you do."
- I couldn't live that way.
- In my line of work...
I can't allow myself to get too close.
What if you met someone?
There's a spark.
Would you ignore it?
Could you?
"I would, uh... concentrate on getting the job done."
I gotta head over to Doug's.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
Okay.
"What's taking so long, Sam?"
You losing your touch?
I didn't know Doug would have a nine-pin dimple lock.
"You know, the new kind- the kind I haven't practiced on."
"Okay, my fingers are bleeding now."
"My life is stupid, useless, and when you read this letter,"
I'll be dead by poison.
I write you to make it clear I'm the only one responsible for my death.
Nobody should be blamed for my death.
Nobody.
Farewell.
"Baroness de Vibray."""
Fantastic!
"You are a brother, Arsène."
Usher!
Procurator asks for me.
I gotta go.
You would get me a permit to enter in the jail?
What would I not do?
Judge Fuselier is committed to the case.
See you later.
You do not monitor the prisoners to prevent these things?
"Listen, after we took his fingerprints, everything was fine."
"At midnight, the guard made his round and found nothing unusual."
Only this morning he was found hanging.
When soup was being served.
Hanging?
And with what?
"I see what you're getting at, Mr Fandor."
But no.
"The guards removed his tie, his suspenders and his shoelaces."
All that was left him was a medallion
which he held dear.
"You know, the unfortunate man had to exert a terrible energy, because he tied strips of his shirt to the bars of his window and he hung himself leaning back in the rear."
"Tell me, death was probably very slow?"
Could I see him?
Why not photograph him?
-Mrs.
Mackenzie...
She committed suicide over the kind of life Lucas brought them to.
We're not concerned here over Mrs. Cross' suicide.
But I don't see why not.
There was something terribly wrong in the Cross family life.
-Mrs.
"Mackenzie, if you please..."
"-Something wrong when a woman... had to raise her daughter up almost alone and trying to help her, and..."
-Mrs.
MacKenzie...
-...not being able to help.
-Mrs.
MacKenzie...
-Not being able to give...
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I'm aware of your deep concern over the suicide... but that's not the point at issue."
Did your daughter ever tell you she had seen Lucas beating Selena?
No.
Don't you think that if she had seen such a shocking incident... she would've mentioned it to you?
-I don't know.
"-Well, wouldn't she?"
Well...
"Mrs. MacKenzie, didn't your daughter ever bring home her problems?"
How many times do I have to answer your questions?
Until we find out the truth.
The truth is... my daughter did bring her troubles home... and I wouldn't understand.
"Well, if she did bring her problems home, did she ever... I wouldn't understand!"
The court will adjourn for a short recess.
Come in.
-What have I done to Selena?
-You had no choice.
But I did have a choice.
That's right!
Wow!
My own giant robot.
I am now the luckiest kid in America!
This is unbelievable.
This is the greatest discovery since...
"I don't know, television or something!"
I gotta tell someone.
I should call some...
"No, they'll panic."
People always wig out and start shooting when they see something big like you.
- Hmm?
"- Oh, wig out."
It means crazy.
"You know, like, uh... (SPEAKING GIBBERISH)"
"No, no, no!"
Don't do that!
That's the kind of stuff that makes them shoot at you.
MANSLEY:
"Two nights ago, at approximately 1900 hours, sat com radar detected an unidentified object entering Earth's atmosphere."
Losing contact with it two-and-a-half miles off the coast of Rockwell.
Some assumed it was a large meteor or a downed satellite.
But my office in Washington received a call from someone who reported an actual encounter with the object.
"This is no meteor, gentlemen."
This is something much more serious.
So...
"So, we can't call Ripley's Believe It or Not because they wouldn't believe it."
- And...
- (WAKES UP WITH A START)
"Oh, it's getting dark."
And if I don't get home soon
Mom's gonna wonder where I am.
This is absurd.
This is the...
Can't do this anymore.
"Now, look here, Fitzgerald..."
No.
"Mr. Little, allow me, for I believe this is the moment in the meeting wherein I quit."
What?
And lose dentists.
Go with the singular.
"""At the end of a long day serving others,"
"""this dentist relaxes with a calming Chesterfield cigarette."
"""It's all the service he needs."""
Write that down.
- Write that down.
- Okay.
"I've spent today in the graveyard, all washed and covered with weepy, watery blue flowers."
"I'll just say, but all the broken columns and clasped hands and doves and angels mean romance to me."
"Out of a row of Confederate soldiers, two or three will make you think of dead lovers."
"They're exactly like the others, even to the yellowish moss."
"Oh, death is so beautiful."
So very beautiful.
We will die together.
I know.
Out of a row of Confederated soldiers...
"Oh, death is so beautiful."
So very beautiful.
"So you see, dearest Scott..."
I've spent today in the graveyard.
[words overlapping] ...is to be young always.
We will die together.
I know.
I only stopped by to say hey when Roger has to suddenly go out back and check his bait tanks.
- I just want that to be known.
- You did.
You did.
"Okay, this is sexy."
This was the original beginning of the movie.
Right.
This is how the movie was gonna start before we shot...
"Yeah, this was the opening scene."
- Look at Rafi go.
- People went bananas for Rafi.
That's really Rafi's voice too.
That's him singing.
"Although, we're not playing those instruments."
He is the only one who's really doing it.
I'm playing an instrument.
- The love instrument.
- Your body is your instrument as an actress.
"When we rehearsed this scene, before we started shooting it in Don Hill's and we were listening to that song, it was one of the most exciting moments of all..."
"People love this song and they would, like, sing it between shooting it."
This was the first few days of shooting in here.
- Why isn't this on the soundtrack?
- This was the first week of shooting.
- We were all strangers.
- It's not on the soundtrack?
It's on iTunes.
I'm gonna buy it.
"So, what are you talking about, Pete, with the stars in the sky or something?"
"Well, in the title design, they drew little squiggles and stuff in the sky."
"I was waiting for it to happen, it already happened."
"If you squint really hard and do like this, you can see."
- Okay.
- It's similar.
I'd be packing in no time.
No time at all.
That's very clearly stated.
"So, what do the rest of you think about what he just said?"
Should people take the law into their own hands like that?
"I mean, is that the answer?"
Does that solve anything?
Anyone?
Angela?
Angela?
And right before the gun went off...
I was thinking about how much I wanted that soda.
is that weird?
"Like, why did I leave it there in the first place?"
And what if I had gotten up to go get it right at that moment?
"Oh, my God. I think I better change my locker."
Like what happens when you don't sleep.
Like I haven't slept since it happened and keeps coming back to me...
just keeps coming back.
What was that?
I just keep going over and over in my mind.
Like all my friends and they go by the locker all the time...
"and it's just, not even me."
"If someone just had been going by there, and gotten shot."
"It's hard, isn't it?"
"You don't think I could get a few days off, do you?"
You are here again because I wanted to hear your story...
and Detective Martinson wanted to hear it too.
I really don't have anything else to tell.
M r.
"Krakow, can I tell you something?"
This is a good school.
- No.
I don't think so.
Did he know Diane?
"- He says no, but I think yes."
Are we gonna see him?
No.
How 'bout a piano player called Tickler?
"Well, I remember somebody at the club who played piano, but I don't recall his name."
"You know, Mr. Caine, it sounds like you didn't know anybody there, and nobody there knew you except Diane."
It was a long time ago.
I told you the club wasn't one of my hangouts.
I met Diane at the beach.
"Sure, I knew people, but I don't remember their names, even their faces."
"Look, there's only one person I am interested in meeting, and that's Diane."
"Now, if you haven't found her, where are you taking me?"
To jar your memory.
?
[ Radio:
Distant ]
[ Engine Shuts Off]
- Why'd you bring me here?
- Last place you saw Diane was here.
"No, no."
The last time I saw Diane was on the dock.
I told you that.
"You know, Magnum, you keep testing me, and I don't like it."
And you're not telling me everything you know.
"Come on, Mr. Caine."
It's tough enough finding a woman who disappeared 40 years ago without my own client sandbagging me.
"Magnum, there is nothing more I can tell you that'll help you find Diane."
Nothing.
You just have to believe me.
I didn't want to ruin our trip.
Seriously?
You know most chatter doesn't lead anywhere.
All it manages to do is scare people.
I also know that you would have never kept a secret if I was still at NSA.
"It's not a secret, Ellie, it's just a... you know, slightly calculated omission."
You know what that sounds like?
Like a reasonable justification.
"I think she was going for ""lie,"" but ""to-may-to, to-mah-to,"""
let's not argue semantics.
Let's talk national security.
"It's Thanksgiving, in an airport, and we have the usual menagerie."
Here comes Walking Boot Wendy.
"Clearly faking it, in hopes of a free upgrade."
"I see you, Wendy."
I see right through you.
"Ah, and the inevitable Pajama Man."
"Rolls out of bed, grabs his passport."
Sees the world as his futon.
"Brad Pitt wants his hat back, hipster."
"Seriously, what are people thinking?"
My parents actually used to dress up to fly.
Mine still does.
You'll meet him when he gets here.
Huh.
Like that guy over there.
Dapper Don.
That's what I'm talking about.
"Jetting off to exotic locales, like James Bond chasing after Pussy Galore."
No smelly tracksuit for that dude.
What's with my Car Salesman?
Thought you said you were wrong about him.
"It's not like that, Nate."
"Look, I know you and I haven't talked very much."
And I'm sorry about that.
But that's just fall out from your dad and me.
"I know you're going through some tough times so, if you need anything..."
"Well, let me ask you something."
"You played basketball in high school, right?"
- Only for a little while.
- You didn't enjoy it?
What are you kidding me?
I loved it!
But there was no pressure then.
And then I didn't love it so much anymore.
Your dad came up and just made everything a competition.
So then you just walked away?
Only looked back at the cheerleaders.
"It's just a game, Nate."
Not a life.
Hey spirit girl.
That cheerleading thing always throws me off.
What?
Just the more I get to know you the harder it is to wrap my head around it.
My mom used to cheer and Brooke and I have been cheering together forever so it's just kind of our thing.
- Oh cool.
- What's up?
"So, um, I need some advice."
About Nathan.
I don't know if its crossing a line.
"Okay, funny wasn't what I was going for but.."
I was the queen of boyfriend-dysfunction and now I guess
"I'm everybody's go-to on relationship advice its just kind of bizarre, right?"
If it's too weird then...
"When you worked f or Martinelli, did he take stuff home briefcase, papers or did he leave them locked up in his office?"
"I don't know, ex cept he kept my contract in his office."
Why?
"Last night, Louis the bar man had a letter f or me that Johnny gave him."
- What did it say?
- l don't know.
Martinelli got it.
- How do you know?
"- When your phone call woke me up Louis was in my room, lying on the other bed with a broken neck."
"- Oh, Rip."
- Yeah.
I'm a guy that likes to get his mail.
Martinelli would have destroyed it by now.
"No, he'd want to read it first."
Johnny would have written it in code.
"My guess is, he's still trying to figure it out. i'm going after it."
- Not back there?
- Yeah.
I just had my f riend Baretto on the phone.
He gave me the name of a safe expert.
He was so good the law took a little slice out of his life.
- He's retired.
Lives in this town.
- What good is--?
I don't think Johnny killed your husband.
- Why?
- l knew him like my own birthmark.
"Rip, there's something I didn't tell the coroner because Johnny wouldn't let me."
I was right there when it happened.
"Johnny was af raid they'd blame me, tie us both up."
Ex-nightclub singer and young college professor murder her husband.
- But that wasn't the way it was.
What happened?
Nothing.
-What happened?
-l just got scared.
Got the keys?
"What happened, Karen?"
"I just got scared, Henry. lt's okay."
Are you all right?
-Yeah.
If you're part of a crew nobody ever tells you they're going to kill you.
It doesn't happen that way.
There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies.
So your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.
The people who have cared for you all of your life.
And they always seem to come when you're weakest and most in need of their help.
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.
I got there 15 minutes early and Jimmy was already there.
He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up.
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.
He was jumpy.
He hadn't touched a thing.
"On the surface, everything was supposed to be fine."
We were supposed to be discussing my case.
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat him out to save my neck.
"I been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the fuckin' phone."
"Now you understand, huh?"
It's going to be okay.
I think you got a good chance of beating the case.
"Well, you know that kid from the city we were talking about?"
You know?
The kid turned out to be a rat.
"Would you just name it, for God's sakes?"
What is it?
-Do you have any religious beliefs?
- No.
What about your daughter?
No.
Why?
Have you ever heard of exorcism?
"Well, it's a stylized ritual in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so-called invading spirit."
"It's been pretty much discarded these days except by the Catholics, who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment."
"But it, uh, has worked, in fact although not for the reasons they think, of course."
It's purely force of suggestion.
"The, uh-"
- The victim's belief in possession is what helped cause it so in that same way the belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
You're telling me that I should take my daughter to a witch doctor.
Is that it?
Karl?
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She's going to be well?
"Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me."
"Now, did you?"
"No, not me."
I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?
"Of course, I didn't."
I didn't put it.
"Excuse me, madam."
-What?
-A man to see you.
- What man?
"Might your daughter remember, perhaps if Mr. Dennings was in her room that night?"
Latest printout of the class attendance
Something's wrong with the computer!
Who got the printout?
You or I...?

Stop chattering.

America is a great country.
People here are very hard-working
This is a land full of opportunities if you want to make it in life
All I miss are Ma's love and home-cooked food
Tell Ma that my taste buds are always tingling to memories of her dishes
"Jags, take a look, is Ma in tears?"
- I'm not a dog.
- Stay.
- What happened to you?
"- Oh, uh, I blame you."
I tore my ACL somewhere in the last few weeks.
All the fun we've been having together.
"Heh, well, once you're done bitching about your boo-boo,"
I'd love to know what's going on here.
"We got an escaped prisoner, three dead guards."
Department of Public Safety is trying to figure out what happened.
- Where's Chin and Kono?
- Inside getting background.
- That your sister in the car?
"- Yeah, I just came from the airport."
"If she were a dog, you could get a ticket for leaving her."
"- Can we just focus, please?"
- Yeah.
Why do you have aneurism-face?
- I don't have aneurism-face.
- She gave you aneurism-face?

You gotta seek first to understand then to be understood.
That's one of seven principles of successful people.
"I will literally pay you cash to stop talking, okay?"
"Excuse me, officer?"
"My pickup is around the corner, there's a woman in it."
"It's my sister, I'm putting her in your custody, okay?"
"Get her some food, take her back to my office."
"Don't take your eyes off her till I get there, you got it?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Thank you.
You happy?
Not that!
How can you think I'd tell him that?
"- Alan, I'm not accusing you."
"- Yes, you are."
"You're accusing me of this, and yet you refuse to accuse me of having an affair."
That hurts.
"Cory, I know you look up to your brother, but I want you to go to your father for advice on this subject."
Eric has some explaining to do about his own behavior with girls lately.
- I know.
- What do you know?
Pretty much everything.
I kind of walked in on them.
♪ Amazing grace... ♪
- On Eric and his friend in our room?
- How could this happen?
"Dad, Rebecca sat down on the bed and went like this..."
"Oh, so this is her fault."
And you bear no responsibility?
"- Clearly, I should have locked the door."
"- Eric, you're missing the point."
"No, I know the point, Dad."
"I should have controlled myself, but nothing happened."
"Eric, Eric, you are in so deep."
"Dad, I'm sorry."
"I mean, I'm really, really s..."
"You know, for thousands of years, fathers have said to their sons,"
"""Don't rush into sex,"" and the sons have always said, ""Yeah, sure."
"OK."""
"I didn't understand my father till this very moment, and you won't understand me till you're a father, which won't be for a very long time!"
- Dad?
- Learn her name!
"- Yes, sir."
I haven't been saying anything!
You don't think I have enough problems without people thinking
I'm going around stomping other people's teeth out?
Do I need that?

Then who's been saying it then?
"There's ""Got your back"" guys and ""I'll be back"" guys."
Greg!
"Greg was a ""I'm running like a bitch"" guy."
"You two, in my office now."
Dr. Raymond hated his job because he didn't get paid enough.

"15 years of marriage, and it's like no time's passed at all."
He's still playing around.
Poor thing.
"Officers, if you need any help, please don't hesitate."
Krystal Sneed.
I organized the event.
I know everybody here.
Any idea who might've given Patrick the love bite ?
Um... just between us ?
Patrick used to always make time with the undesirables.
He cheated on Jennie three times senior year.
Any of those ladies here today ?
Michelle Day.
Wouldn't exactly call her a lady.
"He'd found out about Johnny's letter, so he'd silenced Louis too."
And Louis' body was to block me out of the play with a murder rap.
"I had to get rid of Louis before the cops followed up Martinelli's next play, an anonymous tip to pay me a call."
Should I kick it in?
It may have been a phoney tip.
I don't know where it came f rom.
"- lt's you, the smart guy f rom Frisco."
- You're better than I thought.
- How'd you locate me?
- Mind if we take a look around?
Mind?
Why should I mind?
What's a little sleep?
You mind telling me what you're looking f or?
"Maybe that guy you was looking f or, Charlie Wilson."
- What do you know about that corpse?
"- Same as you, nothing."
You heard the report about that car smash.
That's why the rental job with a police call-band.
You knew that guy had been taken f or a ride.
You guys murder me.
- That's the only radio the shop had.
- l bet.
"If you'd stop playing smart, I might help."
"Where'd you get the head, the Sanctuary Club?"
You're a day early f or Easter bunnies.
You had a row with Louis Ord. What'd you threaten him about?
- Why don't you ask him?
- Don't think I won't.
"You don't object to my going back to bed, do you?"
"I got a habit of sleeping late, often right up to 6."
How long you known Coral Chandler?
You're not on the run.
Licence is in order.
Go ahead.
Go see Jess and the kids.
I'm not a control freak.
"This is where you really want me to live, is it?"
You wouldn't wanna live here.
Too many ghosts.
Door.
"This house belonged to Kevin Simmonds, a senior SOCO detective also head of Operation Merlin."
Him and his wife were murdered here a few weeks ago... while the kids were upstairs sleeping.
"Yeah, the kids found the bodies."
I saw something about that on the news.
"Yeah, I keep forgetting they let you lot watch TV in prison."
"Yeah, and we had toilet roll."
It's political correctness gone mad
"They dragged Alison Simmonds out of her bed, sat her down here, forced her to watch her husband's execution."
After that he wrapped this tape around her face.
Suffocated her.
Must have taken a while.
The man who organised it is called Jacob Gould.
A real high flyer.
But I think he had help from the inside.
From who?
Bent coppers.
They bring out the traditionalist in me.
I really don't like them.
"So you're part of this Operation Merlin thing as well, are you?"
No.
I'm the guy they come to when operations like Merlin go wrong.
"Who do you work for, then?"
"Oh, now, there's a question."
They stick his hand in this weird --
"I don't know, contraption and, while he's going through it, he's explaining to us that, like,"
"""oh!"
"It's taking a tissue sample."""
Ow!
And extrapolated it.
Some kind of accelerator?
Agh!
Are you all right?
I don't know.
"That's just -- and then, all of a sudden, this, like, gorgeous 16-year-old girl walks out of this unit and he's like"
"""Oh!"
"That's my daughter."""
Arm yourself.
Where did she come from?
From me.
From you?
How?
Who is she?
"Well, she's -- well..."
She's my daughter.
"Hello, Dad."
"They just create fully grown human beings out of tissue samples from other people, which is weird."
"Now he's a father, which is a great way to have a kid."
"All those years, he didn't have to not sleep because the kid was up, crying, or having to go to school because of chickenpox."
"Hello, Dad."
"In the same way that Jenny came out of nowhere, at the end of the episode, she kind of awesomely goes into nowhere."
It's very sad.
The Doctor gets a clone and so then there's another Time Lord and you think about the potential for adventures and everything that he could've taught her and shown her and then it's snatched away so quickly.
"Jenny, be strong, now."
You need to hold on.
Do you hear me?
We're talking here.
"Who's, uh, who's slow joel?"
"You know joel.He comes by the house a couple times a year.He's got the pushed-in nose, scars under the eyes."
Wears the pull-down wool cap.
Talks like marlee matlin.
"Oh.Oh, that guy is jolting' joel johansson?"
"Was joltin' joel, is slow joel."
"Hey, it's not my fault he kept dropping his goddamn hands like sugar ray leonard."
The guy was an ape trying to be a hot dog.
"But you're smarter than that, franco.You can move."
And lou made a lot of money with jolting' joel.
"I mean, the side action on these fights are over the moon."
Yeah.
And now he shits his pants twice a day.
"Tommy, why don't you go be a pain in the ass somewhere else?"
We're talking here.
Ok.Don't forget to mention the glass eye.
"Uh, the what?"
"It's totally unrelated.He got excited, hit himself in the face with a fork."
Joel loved a good meal.
What do you think?
"I don't know, guys."
"I've been in the ring before, you know, lou."
Think I'll just stick to hitting the heavy bag.
Bag don't hit back if you know what i mean.
"Ah, come on.I'm serious here, franco, you got real talent."
This could be huge with the right guidance.
"Yeah.Well, you know, I'm just not to keen on messing with the catnip, you know."
End up looking like mickey rourke.
He looked good in sin city.
He was animated.
"Look, franc, man was not meant to hit 80 pounds of sand hanging from a ceiling."
I wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to Cestus III.
Probably.
Rank hath its privileges.
"How well we both know that, huh?"
Scotty.
- Kirk here.
"- Travers, Jim."
We're waiting.
"Good, commodore."
We're on our way.
Be sure to bring along your tactical people.
I've got an interesting problem for them.
"We'll beam down immediately, commodore."
Kirk out.
"Captain, I wonder why he's so insistent that our tactical aides come down."
"This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of nowhere."
He probably wants additional advice.
"Perhaps, captain, but nevertheless, I..."
"Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for his hospitality?"
"I, for one, could use a good nonreconstituted meal."
"Doctor, you are a sensualist."
You bet your pointed ears I am.
"Ready whenever you are, captain."
Energize.
- Kirk to Enterprise.
Red alert.
"- What is it, captain?"
Cestus III has been destroyed.
"Space, the final frontier."
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.
Its five-year mission:
"To explore strange, new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."
And another foot.
- Couple bits.
- And there we are.
When is TSA finally gonna realize that we all know the shoe thing?
You know what I mean?
"You get to the airport, they tell you to take your shoes off."
"It's like, ""Who doesn't know by now?"""
"Is someone getting to the airport, like, ""What?"
"I have to take my shoes off?"""
"If that happens, arrest and kill that person."
"They're probably not terrorists, but they're holding up the line."
And what is terrorism on a local level?
"On a local level, what is terrorism?"
Holding up the line?
We don't need those people.
"""When did this start?"" ""Kill him!"""
"And I'm way too far back. ""Kill him!"
In front of everybody!
Everybody watches!
Everyone.
"No, sweetie, everyone watches."
Everyone.
Everyone watches.
Everyone watches.
"Never become that."""
It's a fuckin' high-pressure situation the moment you start dealing with security.
"No one gets dressed and undressed while moving sideways at home, but goddamn it if you're not an Olympian when you get there."
Hurry up!
"People in tears, like, ""I just want to see my family again!"
Am I allowed to leave my pullover on?
"Oh, my God!"
I forgot to put my wallet in a bin!
Uh-huh.
"That money was for the poor, John."
"Look, I'm not saying I took the money, but maybe the kid that did..."
And I'm just spitballing here...
Maybe that kid needed a new mitt.
"And maybe his mom didn't have the cash to get him one, so, you know, if you think about it, that kid was kind of poor too."
"That box is for the people who don't have food to eat, John."
"Listen, I heard about your dad, and we've been praying for him."
I appreciate it.
Thanks.
"You know, those candles don't work unless you put $3 in them."
"Oh, yeah?"
Oh.
You have change for a 5?
I do not.
But I'll take the fiver.
We'll consider it down payment on the 40.
"Of course I took the money, Brian, but that mitt was sweet."
"Rawlings, heart of the hide."
- The gold glove model?
- Top of the line.
I spent the entire off-season working that thing in.
"Rubbing oil on it, tied a baseball up in it."
"My first game back, I made this sweet diving catch on a liner right up the middle, oh!"
"But then you left it on the bus or lost it somewhere 'cause you were subconsciously trying to punish yourself, right?"
"Hell, no."
I used that mitt all the way up to college.
Still have it.
"23 years, it's the longest relationship I've ever been in."
- Hmm.
- I love that mitt.
We should go out and throw sometime.
"I use to told you that this Laxmi Narayan, will make her mother's dream come true."
I proud of you.
How many bullets you have shoot on throat.
None.
You much have cut him.
Kill by pushing the throat?
How cheap your mentality is Bhai... just like egg of lizard.
"Do not take life, give life to become Bhai(brother)"
You should learn some.
I am not cheep Bhai like you.
Who do business in diamonds and take others life.
I thought you have reputation.
But now i know that you have no reputation.
Did you kill her or not?
No.
Because i want to become Godfather.
"Godfather, even Chota Khujli can become father too."
But one can become God when he give life.
And today i saved her life here's your diamonds.
From today we have separate ways.
"Because i wont work for cheep Bhai like you, who sopil the name of underworld, for a underwear."
Check you diamonds and Chota Khujli marry your daughter with some Aslam Bhoda etc.
Now i don't have any interest in her.
What is this?
Diamond.
Is this diamond?
"Yeah see its written here too, pure diamond."
See this.
Where would i wear this diamond?
"Its you own choice, why you are asking me?"
"Check it carefully, Laxmi Narayan don't left any work undone."
What!
And they collectively almost so restful.
"After some days Tót family it was learned, that it is possible to doze off at the chandler while he measures the soda out."
During watering in Cipriáni family's shady-cool garden.
While the boiling soup does not get cold.
While the coffee does not boil over.
Or during review in the fire engine house
If the engineer of the aggregator does not wake up the man.
- Lajos.
Lajos.
Lajos!
- What is it?
Is there fire?
- No.
- What do you want?
"Arrange it Lajos, how I shall be allowed to speak the with major lord."
"You know, from my younger brother's thing."
Who because of anti-state rummaging in front of a military court claim?
They accused it of it.
Respectable major lord.
- Where did he serve?
-At car artillerymen.
- 629/12 please.
- His rating?
Corporal.
"You know him, Tót?"
I know him.
Good Hungarian man?
Good Hungarian man.
Why he bring out and why fluttered at the time of a command annunciation the red flag?
Because...he was have a cold.
I report...he was have a cold.
"He wanted to take out his handkerchief, they accused it of it subsequently."
What else do you want from me?
Five minutes.
So you've been what?
Stalking me?
I just wanted to see you.
"If I wanted the best vanilla shakes, I would have gone down the street, right?"
I'm sorry...
"Look, you should know that I didn't want to put you through that test."
Ok?
"It's my family's lawyers, they insisted on it."
"I don't want your money, ok?"
I want your signature on a piece of paper.
"As soon I saw you, I knew there was no need for a DNA test."
You're my daughter.
"I know this is really, really confusing."
Ok?
"Believe me, I get it."
"But you need to understand that before I was served those papers,"
- I had no idea you even existed.
- No.
"My dad, Donald, he told me that you left after you found out Mom was pregnant."
No.
"I never should have left your mom, that's the worst thing I've ever done in my life."
But I swear I did not know she was pregnant.
I loved your mom a lot.
I brought you this.
Just read it when you have the time.
Are you going to sign the papers?
As soon as my attorneys say it's ok.
I gotta get back to work.
"Hey, just wanted to let you know we found a body near that halfway house."
"No ID yet, but it could be the woman you're looking for."
Let's go!
Come on.!
"He's lookin'great, huh?"
I don't know.
Did he seem a trifle tense to you?
"Higgins, let's go.!"
"Well, just take all day, Higgy baby."
"Maybe beauty knows no pain, but I knew I did."
I figured the only way I could get through the day was to put my body on automatic pilot... and concentrate on something else.
The trouble was all I could think about was Roger.
"If Gold Teeth was right, he wasn't in a hell of a lot of trouble... not with the feds anyway."
"He'd stolen money, but he'd stolen it from a thief."
"If Roger turned it in before the statute of limitations on the crime ran out next week, he'd probably get a reward."
Hurry up.
They're due here any minute.
"All right, all right."
Which brought me to Barbara.
Why didn't he meet her at the airport?
"Did he have cold feet about marrying her, or... couldn't he show up because he knew someone was following her?"
"But if he knew, why didn't he just take the money and run?"
Call her in a couple of weeks from Tahiti or wherever?
Now remember the drill.
"T.C., you towel him dry, Right."
Get him into the running shorts.
Running shorts.
"Okay, Rick, shoes and socks."
Shoes and socks.
And don't forget the foot powder.
Foot powder.
I myself have exactly...
four ounces of glucose.
I'll get it.

"- Who do you work for, then?"
"- Oh, now there's a question."
"Officially, nobody, of course."
I'm on sick leave from the police.
Post-traumatic stress.
- Yeah.
Unofficially?
- I don't think that's any of your concern.
- My job's to disorganise crime.
- Illegally.
"- I prefer to use the world ""irregular""."
"- Yeah, yeah, I bet you do."
"Six cod and chips, six haddock and chips, threepenn'orth of spare chips and a dozen pickled onions."

"Here's the change, Mr Twelvetrees."
"Thank you, Henry."
Did you get any crispy bits?
"Yeah, I got those for nothing cos it was such a big order."
"Cor, what a lovely smell."
Did you put salt and vinegar on?
"No, I didn't think it would be to his lordship's taste."
"You put them in the warming oven, James, I can't stand the smell."
"Am I to understand it's fancy dress tonight, sir?"
No.
We want to put the workers at their ease.
"I see, sir."
"Pour me one, George."
What on earth have you done to yourself?
Perhaps the cap is too much.
You look absurd.
What do you mean?
"There was a man digging up the road, he was dressed exactly like this."
"So I made a list, gave it to my tailor, and he sent them round."
"For God's sake, take that awful red hankie off."
Put it back on again.
- What are you doing in that get-up?
"- It was you father's idea,"
- so as not to embarrass the guests.
"- You are a silly arse,"
I simply said we won't dress for dinner.
We just looked out the window and saw three men looking at their watches.
"I don't want to worry you, but they were all wearing dinner jackets."

"- Oh, my God!"

"Look, I'm in love with Adrian."
All right?
"She doesn't want to think about getting married right now, but I want to marry her."
"She met my mother last Sunday, after church."
What?
"All right, then, we should disperse."
Get going.
(CLEARING THROAT)
I can't believe this.
Amy is married and
Adrian is semi-engaged or something and I'm not even allowed to date.
This is ridiculous.
Ridiculous times call for ridiculous measures.
Like?
Like staying home and studying and focusing on getting into college.
Getting an education prepares you for life.
Getting an education helps you think.
Thinking is a skill in itself.
"Look, say what you want about school, but life is all about does the boy get the girl?"
Does the girl get the boy?
Or does the boy get the boy?
Or does the girl get the girl?
"Or any of that, all of that!"
"I understand what you're saying, but let me put it another way."
Every relationship is a school.
Every person you meet is a teacher.
"If you don't like learning things in school, you're probably going to have a few problems learning from people."
"Now, that's ridiculous."

Potted plant would be less trouble.
The way she's been carrying on.
"Since the separation, not even divorced, mind you."
Running around with lounge lizards like that Mr. de Mario.
"He was the one that took her out last night, before she was killed."
Listen... do you think that de Mario did it?
Who knows?
Gives me the creeps.
"He's the slippery type, you know."
"Well, why not him?"
"Listen, he brings her home, see."
They've been drinking maybe.
Then she asks him to drive you home to get rid of him.
"But he fools her, he comes back."
"Did act kind of peculiar in the car, coming home."
"Never opened his mouth once, except to say good night."
"That was kind of funny, wasn't it?"
Yeah.
"Well, as I say, anybody could've done it."
They say when they found her strangled--
I don't even wanna think about that.
She was never any good.
"Even right from the beginning, when I first started sitting for the Nashes."
Long before they were separated.
(Lottie) I remember one night.
They were supposed to go to his boss's house for dinner.
So I got there at 7.:00 like I was supposed to.
Mrs. Nash was picking on Mr. Nash something awful.
It wasn't as if I was snooping or anything.
"She must've known I was standing there, but that didn't stop her."
Not for one minute.
Even if you shed tears over her.
Because I... am already yours.
Could that have triggered it?
No...
It couldn't be.
I always looked up to you.
You had everything that I did not.
So I hated you.
"Still, do not worry, sister."
"From now on, I will be truly be your substitute and I will be Slaine's support!"
Why...?
What's up with that?
Does that mean she got ditched here?
"""The captain left me in charge because she trusts me."""
"That's what she said, but Cdr."
Mizusaki has got to be devastated.
Why did she pick Lt. Marito of all people as her traveling companion?
Companion?
"Escort, more like."
What's this about Lt. Marito?
"No, um..."
"It's just that he accompanied the captain to the conference, so I thought it might be serious."
Ah.
"With that Martian proclamation and all, the situation is definitely changing."
I can't believe that the princess is getting married...
That's what you're interested in?
"No, but look..."
Isn't it possible that her change of heart was because someone around her felt that way?
"Like, she was seduced by him or something?"
Sorry.
"But we're still not 100% sure that the Princess Asseylum who said that was the princess who spent time with us, right?"
I honestly can't say.
"I'd be worried about that, George."
"Dr. Ogden looked at it, she says it's healing nicely."
It does hurt like the Devil though.
- Maybe you caught something.
- Something?
!
- Rabies?
"- Henry, she's a girl, not a dog!"
What if she bit a dog before she bit you?
"George, you're not thinking clearly."
"- That's a symptom, you know?"
- Where is he?
!
Huh?
You've no right to keep her!
"She's my property, and I've a lineup of customers waiting."
"Well, then they'll just have to wait."
But thanks for popping in because we've got some questions we'd like to ask you.
- What were you doing in the woods last night?
- Looking for the girl.
Why else?
You were not looking for her; you were hiding her!
"Now, why would I do that, huh?"
Stop playing the innocent.
"You let her out, tied her up, no doubt waiting for the perfect opportunity to go back, get her, and leave town."
Meanwhile the Constabulary and half the neighbourhood are on a wild goose chase looking for her.
"Enough with the lies, Mr. Travis."
What is going on?
You're right.
I was leaving.
I wanted to get her as far away from this town before you bloodthirsty lot strung her up for something she had nothing to do with.
We have evidence that she attacked the victim.
"- I am innocent of what I am accused of tonight, but there is something else to which I must confess."
"From a young age, this man was not only my trusted physician, but the object of my lust."
He was a friend of my father's and forbidden to me.
"But in my innermost desires,"
I burned for him.
He is here tonight.
"In fact, he is the very man who brought me here to Rosewood."
Torrington... come.
Let us finally admit what has remained silent for so long.
Please... let us be married in sin together.
Come play our little game tonight.
You will be rewarded later.
- This is not the trial!
- Now it is time for you to play your part.
I can't wait to do this to you when we're alone tonight.
I've dreamed of this evening since you were a young girl.
- Isabel.
"- Tonight, the judges shall be judged."
"Dr. Cairn, this blade looks quite real."
"Calm yourself, Doctor."
It's all part of the performance.
"- Tonight, you will all be on trial."
"Aconites, you call yourselves."
"Playing with people's lives while you pretend to drink monkshood, wolf's bane."
"Well, tonight you drank the real thing."
- Dr. Cairn?
Doctor...
Dr. Cairn?
Get me out of here.
"Dr. Cairn, get me out of here."
- Run.
You run far away from this place.

For all of us as well.
I'm leaving.
You needn't worry.
And yet I do.
So you won't be leaving us just yet.
I have some news to share.
Turns out the english queen isn't dead after all.
The english queen is alive?
But I would keep the news to yourself.
You did this.
To see me married.
The messenger's news was flawed.
No one could blame that on me.
Or you.
Everyone needs a little push on occasion.
Even queens.
Even France.
All happiness comes with a price.
And you paid yours with another's broken heart.

It's time for the consummation.
Prison?
"Oh, God, don't even say that word."
"Honey, it's okay."
"I know it's going to be okay, really."
How does everything change in a day?
"It's probably just business stuff, you know?"
Cutting corners and inspectors.
Remember Daddy used to bribe inspectors.
He did not.
He left an envelope of $20 bills in the kitchen so they could take it.
He did?
But his kitchen was unbelievably clean.
You have to pay in order to stay in business.
You think that's what Rick did?
How do I know?
"But it's a pretty big project, so who knows how many people might want a piece?"
Don't worry. I hear those white-collar prisons are okay.
They play golf with millionaires.
Municipal waiting rooms can be so dreary.
- l thought you'd left town.
- Why would I do that?
Why haven't you returned my calls?
- To protect the innocent.
- And who does that include?
Whomever you want it to.
"All right, look, do you understand how much I have riding here?"
"My career, my whole life?"
"This is scary. lt's really scary for me, Miles, and I need to ask you, do I have anything to worry about?"
Did you do anything wrong?
"All right, look, the second permit for the high-rise, it was supposed..."
"Shh, shh."
[ classical music playing] lt was supposed to take six weeks.
- What'd she say?
- Garcia says this looks like a list of additives needed to weaponize anthrax.
Could they get enough anthrax?
"The letter sent to senator Tom Daschle's office in 2002 only contained two grams of purified spores, enough to kill 25 million people if effectively distributed."
Are you willing to have a chat with me?
Go ahead.
Gideon.
Let's chat.
He's from Egypt.
Cairo.
- You sure?
"- No, he could be yemeni, but odds are he's egyptian."
What type of name is Gideon?
American.
"I often forget that in your culture, you put your country first and your god last."
"Sir, he was born and raised in egypt."
"They pronounce ""J"" sounds as a ""G""."
You don't consider yourself egyptian as well as muslim?
Egyptian.
"In two minutes, you know more about me than those thugs found out in two months."
"They and I have... very, very different motives and methodologies."
And yet your country relies on them to protect you from us.
Sometimes they're their own worst enemy.
Yeah.
"Who is your worst enemy, agent Gideon?"
It's not a who.
It's a what.
Ignorance.
You're a very honest man.
And you?
"Must have become a hafez by what,"
- age 10?
"-This is the spot, you say?"
-That's right!
This is your spot.
So what's the standard for finding the rock?
Standards?
The standards are a little...confusing.
"For example, if the standards for finding the rock is the size, then in that case, since Choong Sik is the biggest in this family, this would be Choong Sik."
Then your wife would be next...
Gil Da Ran...
And you.
Then...if the beauty is the standard for finding the rock...
Then...since this is the prettiest...
your wife.
"Then next would be Choong Sik, Gil Da Ran..."
And you.
See?
The standards for finding one is confusing.
Father-in-law...
So...
"With me being the ugliest and the smallest in the family, you have a problem with me being the biggest, and the prettiest rock."
"No, no, no, no!"
It's just that I was curious about what kind of a rock would represent me as a person.
The standards for finding your rock...
Is about harmony.
Fitting in harmoniously with the other rocks that are sitting up here.
Harmony!
We just need to find that.
Whether you want to find one or not...
You do whatever you want.
"Whenever adults don't want to bother explaining something, they always make things confusing and just fumble over it."
Harmony?
What's that?
The therapist.
What about her?
She's written her name in Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.
Look.
Right here.
She did.
And this name...
Emile Sayles.
Same Handwriting.
"Looks like she signed him in, too."
Funny... she didn't mention that earlier.
"So, first, she treats the kid who committed suicide."
"Then a month later, she's at Kevin's funeral."
We got to find out what happened in those therapy sessions.
We got to go look at those files.
You want to get into the psychologist's confidential patient files off of a signature in a condolence book?
No.
"First, you look deeper into her and this Emile Sayles."
"Then we go to the judge, get a warrant, and then we go get her."
You understand?
Mm-hmm.
- Say you understand.
"- Don't... don't pull that ""say you understand"" thing with me."
That's... that's my thing.
"Well, don't you have a tank to get into or something?"
"""First you dig deeper, then you get a warrant."""
"Yeah, right."
The killer's sitting poolside in Acapulco drinking dollar beers and knockoff pain killers.
Liz Kenyon... a piano prodigy from the time she was 6 years old.
"What she was 12, this man..."
"Emile Sayles, enters her life and takes control not just of her piano but nearly everything she does."
He pushed her until she broke.
"That must have been a few million won, at least."
Where did you get the money?
You know that I'm working for Yong Moon Plan now.
You just started.
- Did you rob them?
- I didn't!
"Bro, you're hiding something from me, aren't you?"
Take off your uniform too.
It's a piece of evidence.
How is this evidence?
I got blood on me from trying to save him!
Son of a...
"Hello, sir."
I just got a call from the head of the Sung Jang Police Station.
"Do you remember Lawyer Jo Eun Jung, who was reported missing?"
"Yes, he's the last person to have seen Seo Jun Suk before his death."
"He has been discovered, as a corpse."
Is that so?
"But, the thing is..."
in his pants pocket... was Im Tae Ho's business card.
"For the time being, you won't be leaving this building."
Listen carefully!
If it becomes news that an active officer has been on a serial killing spree the entire country will be upside down.
Mr. President.
What are you talking about?
"What do you mean, a serial killing spree?"
Take extra precaution to make sure nothing leaks to reporters!
- Understand?
- Without even investigating...
How can you accuse me like this?
That's why...
I will... interrogate you myself.
And you always wear the most beautiful vintage dresses that remind me of my abuelita.
"And I have a girlfriend, but if I didn't, I would want to sleep with you."
Thank you.
"How you doing, Pop?"
Doing all right in there?
I don't know.
"Obviously not doing too good, I guess."
"Oh, I brought the racing form."
I thought you might like to know the results from Arlington.
"Um, so tit-for-tat won in the sixth."
I'm skipping the early races 'cause you said that those were all for the amateurs.
"Nothing but nags running, right, Dad?"
Painted lady took the seventh.
"Won 24 bucks, that's sweet."
I got to think that you would've put some money on her 'cause you always liked the ladies.
Hungry heart only paid out 4 bucks in the eighth.
Probably 'cause it's a favorite.
"Who bets on a favorite, huh?"
What fun is that?
"Uh, that's all I got."
I'll bring more results tomorrow.
There's a big stakes race.
I figure you'd have blown a shitload of money on that.
I don't know what else to say.
Kinda weird talking to someone if you don't even know if they can even hear you.
You know?
"I'm just gonna sit here for a bit, and I don't think I'm probably gonna say anything at all, cool?"
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I didn't mean to intrude.
I'll come back in a bit.
Thanks.
"Decaf, right?"
Saira...
You stay here.
No!
Why did you target my prey?
Because Saiba was confronting a tiger with a dagger.
"The tiger didn't even have a dagger, Kaabir."
It's my duty to protect Saiba.
Paathar belongs to me.
You have to either drown or fly to reach here.
I don't want anyone's help.
It's beautiful.
I fear someone might cast an evil eye.
Kaabir... there's news that Muraaki Jilaan has set his eyes on our Paathar.
Jilaan?
"Muwaqqit, we wish to conquer the world..."
Why this sudden move towards measly Paathar?
"A world unseen, unheard and unapproachable..."
Muraakis are the ones who conquer them all.
Muraakis have dared to set their eyes on our Paathar.
Whether he rips the sky apart or makes his way through water...
Jilaan is destined to die in Paathar's waters.
If he was born on a no moon night... then we are that dark night.
"The one who dares to confront us, is headed to his destruction."
"Water should stay blue, not turn red."
Jilaan has sent just one Muraaki to fight us?
Just one.
Muraaki!
Muraaki!
Either surrender before the full moon night or die.
Jilaan.
Saiba wishes to fight the war the warriors of Paathar couldn't?
"You don't just fight wars, you also strategize them."
"That it made me realize that, uh,"
"I need to be honest, too."
"I made many personal sacrifices to be a doctor,"
But I never quite realized until now that...
The greatest sacrifice of all
Was my family.
So the most important thing that I can say here tonight
"Is not to all of you,"
"But, uh, to them."
"I made the biggest mistake of my life walking out on you,"
And I promise to do everything in my power
"To make it up to you, to make it right again,"
Because I love you.
"My, oh, my."
Did Dr. Van Der Woodsen
Just make a public pass at Rufus' wife?
Looks like this doctor without borders needs a few boundaries.
"Well, I guess you were right about William,"
"But it doesn't matter how he feels about me,"
Because I don't love him.
"I love you, Rufus."
"I know you're comfortable with him, Lil, but I'm not."
I need you to find another doctor.
"Look, I understand why you don't trust him,"
"But surely, you trust me."
"Look, I don't want to fight with you, Rufus."
"Okay, we'll put it aside till tomorrow."
Let's get you home. you know what?
"Right now, more than anything,"
"I just need a quiet night, alone."
Lily.
"Please, just for tonight,"
Are you two going to be able to work together?
"No, I don't take that shit personally."
But I can't say the same for sleeping beauty.
God knows he could tell anybody anything.
It was his drive to find his wife that led us to McCarthy.
Perhaps he can still be of some use.
And if he's not?
Well... we pull the plug.
Latest SAT intel has Karp running planes from a dirt strip in Northern Mexico.
"No, we know where Karp is, and his entire family for that matter."
That's never been the issue.
"We just confirmed, Karp's working with the Hunters."
Karp also has ongoing dealings with the CIA.
- He's protected.
- I don't want Karp.
I want the bitch he answers to.
- Your mother.
- She knows more than my dad ever could.
That's whose fingernails you should be pulling out with pliers.
You did well with your father.
You gained more in ten minutes than we have in years.
You hurt him again and I will tear your throat out.
"Careful, Agent Regan."
Threatening a superior officer is cause for immediate dismissal.
You won't.
You need me and you know it.
Let me go to Mexico.
I go through Karp to get my mom and I bring her back.
"In exchange, you release my dad."
I don't feel anything.
"The scute protein's solution's tricky, but I think I'm making progress."
You think?
Then he'd be out a career and a girlfriend.
He might have panicked.
"OFFICE OF MAESTRO REINHARDT OLD HUDSON OPERA HOUSE MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20"
You must excuse me.
I'm very busy.
"I must finish my notes on Verdi's ""Forza del Destino""."
It's my new production for the spring.
"Actually, Mr. Reinhardt, we were hoping to finally speak to an adult."
"Yeah, no offense, but this crew and these musicians... getting high, having sex..."
it's like a frat house on viagra.
Finally.
People who understand what I have to go through every day.
How can I help?
Let's start with the night of the murder.
Did you see Laura during intermission?
"No, I did not."
Can we ask where you were?
We've asked everybody else.
I was right here.
Resting.
"- Okay, well, were you alone?"
"- Yes, I was."
If I'd known I'd be grilled by some Visigoth... / A what?
It's a barbarian tribe that invaded Rome.
I remember that from the one history class I didn't cut.
I'm sure you were a very charming street urchin.
Any other questions?
"Well, did Laura have any enemies in the house?"
"We heard she was very, very ambitious, and you were gonna make her first violin."
She told people that?
I suppose she felt entitled on account of... my friendship with her mother.
Or because she was a prodigy.
"What was that, uh, legal stuff that Audrey wanted to talk to you about this morning?"
Nothing.
Just estate planning.
[laughing]
"Hey, listen, uh, there's no reason we should both be here waiting for the check."
Why don't you go get the kids?
And I'll see you back at the place.
Sure.
[ting]
Cheers.
"Hey, guys."
So what are we celebrating?
You guys being perfect strangers this morning and now fast friends?
How are you planning on robbing Audrey?
"- No, no..."
"- No, no, no, no, Lance."
You got it all wrong.
There's a perfectly reasonable explanation.
"Okay, then, Cousin Pete, explain."
Let's hear a perfectly reasonable explanation for how you came to be sitting here celebrating with the man who just bought your grandmother's farm for a price that would be insultingly low if the place were currently on fire.
- Get you anything?
- I'm good.
Okay.
"Come on, fellas."
You're caught.
"You can waste time trying to deny it, or we start to talk about what it's going to take to get me not to turn you in."
Gentlemen.
Two years ago...
"I was going through security at Sea-Tac, and, uh, all of a sudden..."
this is long story sounding...
TSA goes ape shit.
"The, uh, airport cops are hauling ass towards us."
- What are you looking for?
"- Her apartment is $2,500 a month."
"I lose $1,000 a night, every night that she does not work for me."
"I'm not paying you 1,000 a night."
Get real.
But something.
I need something.
I have expenses.
I'm not losing money.
Call me tomorrow.
I'll see what I have in the budget.
Watch yourself.
You're walking a very thin line.
"You, too."
I know what you get from my girls.
"Maybe this DEA guy, or whoever he is, is connected to these Americans."
You seriously think there's a conspiracy to take Jim out... so the American can take the drug trade over?
It's a $6 billion a year business.
"It's right in their backyard, which they can take a big piece of, by one simple move, getting rid of Jim."
I think you're smoking too much of what we're selling.
You always think everything is connected to everything else.
"'Cause that's how it really is, Ron."
Everything is connected.
It's coincidence.
"Random incidents, they come together, they line up so suddenly it looks like a pattern or a conspiracy."
- But it's just random.
- Just hear me out.
"Jim is the glue, he holds all these little pieces together."
"He leaves, there a big hole in the trade here."
What's that?
It's random.
It's a perfect storm and we're in the eye of it.
"First, my wife."
Then her accomplice.
No.
No.
"No, Stan."
Forgive me.
"Lynn, wait."
Lynn!
"Lynn, wait."
"Lynn, don't run."
Come back.
Lynn!
Gordon.
Gordon.
Gordon.
I'm going to kill you.
Gordon.
Gordon.
Get me the police.
"Good morning, Mr. Phelps."
"We recently learned that, in order to carry out the underworld's policy of enforcement, this man, Burt Gordon, has set up an organisation similar to the old Murder, Incorporated."
"Gordon will arrange for the disposal of anyone, anywhere, for a price."
The victims always disappear with no evidence of foul play and the body is never recovered.
"Although we are sure Gordon is the man behind this murder ring, he has kept himself so far removed from the actual killings, we are unable to pin anything on him."
"Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to prove Gordon is, in fact, a killer, and put him away for good."
"As always, should you or any of your IM Force be caught or killed, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions."
Please destroy this recording in the usual manner.
"Good luck, Jim."
"- Good, very good, Rollin."
"- Just a small sample, Jim."
"Well, I think that will appeal greatly to Mr. Gordon's nature."
"Did that not occur to you?"""
"She said, ""I didn't-- I didn't realize that."""
I swear that's how she talks.
"""I didn't realize that."""
"I was like, ""That's 'cause you mixed."
"""Okay, you're Black and white."
"""You don't have survival skills, you don't."
"Mm-mm."" She don't."
'Cause I'm gonna tell you something.
"Had it been like a Black chick from the hood,"
"Brooklyn, something--hey!"
"She would've been in the water with a pistol, just swimming around, you know what I'm talking about?"
Now she would have been doggy-paddling.
But she would have been swimming around.
"She would have been in the drink just like this,"
"""I will fuck a shark up."
"""Don't you touch my baby."
"""Somebody gotta pay for the hotel room."
"I ain't doing the shit."""
"And she would've had her head up like this the whole time, so her hair didn't get wet."
She's my baby.
Back to Kanye West though.
"Called me up, he was like,"
"""And, you know, I didn't call you up"
"""to, you know, knock your craft or, you know, anything,"
"""because it would be weird for me to call up"
"Richard Pryor or Jamie Foxx or one of the greats."""
"I'm like, ""Richard Pryor's dead."
He's dead.
"You can't--you can't call him."""
This is what I'm thinking in my head the whole time.
"Okay, I'm listening to this man talk about himself for 11 minutes straight."
No.
They're not funny at all!
"Oh, hello Dick."
- Hello Ben.
I'm waiting for Mary.
I'm sleeping with Mary.
Oh.
Okay.
"So from what I've heard, you're quite the professor funnypants."
"Well, I.."
- It's seems that you have Mary wrapped around your little funny bone.
"But I can assure you, I am a far tougher... bone wrapperer"
I think I'll wait outside.
Make me laugh funny man.
"Well, I'm not a comedian."
"It's just that funny things, just seem to happen to me."
"Oh really, like what?"
"Well, like last week, I was at a bus stop, and it suddenly started raining, pouring."
"And I look over and I see this gorgeous grad student, and she's looking at me, like a kid with braces, looking at a candy apple."
"Mmm, no, not funny."
"Well, I'm about to say hello, when I suddenly realize, that my hair has flipped forward."
"Here I am standing in the rain, with my very own awning."
"Well, finally the bus arrived, and the door opened, the compressor kicked in, and this, this, European weave of mine got sucked right into the bus!"
"Well, there I was, in front of this beautiful girl, and chasing that bus, and chasing my hair.."
"up and down, chasing!"
And I couldn't..
I just.. oh!
Oh!
Oh!
This is not good.
"Yes, Yes, it is!"
The bus stole your hair!
You want to go on pretending to be the brother he's never heard of?
We were getting somewhere.
Then get somewhere honestly.
As his father.
Honesty?
Is that what this is?
"You just want me to make good with my FBI agent son so he doesn't go tell them about it and they come close this little science project, and then bam!"
There goes your cure.
I know you didn't throw yourself off that bridge.
Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard would never walk off that bridge.
Damn straight he wouldn't.
But Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard ended up all by himself in a crappy apartment paying for hookers.
Watch it.
And getting visits from his son only when the neighbors complained about the noise and cigarette smoke.
He knows who you are.
Show him who you can be.
I've seen that person.
"I think Duval should see him, too."
You done?
Yes.
You ever think about coaching sports?
That was a humdinger of an underdog speech.
There's only one way back into Duval's life.
He asked me for help once.
Only time he ever asked for my help with a case.
"And when he asked for your help, what did you do?"
Gracie:
"Those are my granddad's old boxes, and my dad's case files are over here."
[Chuckles]
Does my dad know you're here?
"No, he doesn't."
"You know, I'm not a kid."
To the brick Kremlin.
She'll never forgive me.
"Come on, Animal."
What are you serving today?
Nitric acid?
I only work here.
Talk to the management.
All right.
Mr. Management what are you trying to do?
Embalm us while we're still alive?
"What did you expect, eight-year-old bottled-in-bond?"
All the house guarantees is you don't go blind.
Blind?
Harry!
Harry!
"Harry, I'm blind, Harry."
"Harry, where are you?"
I can't see you.
"I'm blind, Harry."
Harry.
"Harry, I'm blind."
Blind?
"How stupid can you get, Animal?"
"The killer-differ, of course, the real bonanza was when Sefton put up the observatory."
He scrounged himself some high-powered Kraut lenses and a magnifying mirror and got Ronnie Bigelow from Barracks 2 to put the whole shebang together for a pound of coffee.
"On a clear day, you could have seen the Swiss Alps."
Only who wanted to see the Swiss Alps?
"It was about a mile away, that Russian delousing shack but we were right on top of it."
It cost you a cigarette or a half-a-bar of chocolate a peek.
"You couldn't catch much through that steam but believe you me, after two years in that camp just the idea of what was behind that window sure spruced up your voltage."
Let's go.
Twenty seconds to a customer.
"So, if I say to you:"
"- ""What are they doing here?"""
- Treasure hunting!
We might have problems.
"No, we won't."
The road and the film
One thing I often try to do in my films is to keep in mind my first impressions of a new region.
My first meetings with the people of the region.
I try to remember what happened on the day I arrived
in a new village.
How did people react?
How did I see them?
"Familiarity is not a good thing, when you get to know a region, you get used to it."
"I worked there for six months,"
"I knew it like my own back yard, but I had to recapture my first impressions."
The way I saw the people and the way they saw me.
I'll ask.
Ask that one.
Ask her.
"Good morning, Madam."
"Good morning, I am honoured."
How do we get to Siah Dareh?
"Turn left at the fork, it's 200 meters further on."
Thank you.
Goodbye.
The mourning rituals with the traditional self-mutilation of the face only exist in two regions of Iran.
In Lorestan and Kurdistan.
I went to Kurdistan first.
I found this remote village and I started to work.
"I would say, in a film, finding the location is one of the"
most important parts of the Director's job.
The location is as important as the characters in a film.
Like what?
I don't know.
One of my favorite ones is the one about you getting murdered on Indian Ridge.
"Well, they have the decency to bury me, at least?"
Can't say.
Don't really keep track of the rumors I didn't start.
Got any rumors about me being made sheriff?
Sheriff Kilbaught ain't gonna like you coming back.
"Well, he's gonna find he ain't got much room to argue."
Maybe I don't like you coming back.
"You know I always told you, you deserve better than this."
Marla.
"Welcome home, Wallace."
"Hey, how come that thing always stayed broken?"
Don't got a phone connection at my ma's old house anymore.
"Marla was good about looking after it, but..."
Use that one.
You ever hear anything about me getting murdered?
"Yes, sir, I believe I have."
- They shot you in the throat.
- Throat?
- Yeah.
- No kidding?
"Heard you was mouthing off like you used to, and... somebody just shot you right there how you stood."
"Well, Jerry, ain't you gonna welcome me back from the dead?"
Asshole.
Armor-piercing.
"- They call them ""cop killers."""
- Why is that?
On account of them killing cops.
"Do you need it for, like, DNA?"
Forensics lab is two weeks and 150 miles away from giving half a shit about this town.
"You mean, tricycles don't really fall out of her arms?"
"Uh, no."
Oh my god!
Of course they don't!
"I mean, just think how flabby her arms would have to be for a tricycle to be up in there, and for so many years."
"And she didn't even notice it, not even when she took a shower."
That's hysterical.
I get it.
I get the joke!
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
This should be fun.
"Um, I'd like to welcome you all here tonight."
"Before we go any further,"
"I think that we should all acknowledge the sensational job, that my esteemed colleague, Dr. Mary Albright has done in organizing this truly worthwhile event."
Dr. Albright.
Don't you love Dr. Albright?
I know I do.
"Now, I know many of you are wondering, what's with her long sleeves?"
"Well, I'll tell you."
It's to cover up her flabby arms.
"She shook them the other day, and the dead sea scrolls fell out."
"She's, uh.. she's quite old also, you see."
"But you know, as sweet and wonderful, as Dr. Albright is, she can also be somewhat domineering, power-hungry and hostile, and I think I finally figured out why."
"Dr. Albright, while you may not have a man's genitalia, at least you have his razor stubble."
"Oh, oh, oh!"
Oh!
And there's Nina.
Nina is Dr. Albright's assistant.
"Nina, stand up, stand up."
"Come on, stand up."
"Show everybody how you put the ""Ass"""
From this moment on you're a lieutenant in the 95th
Major Hogan
- meet Mr Sharpe.
- Congratulations.
"Capital choice, sir."
The minute I saw him I looked.
"Hogan says ""Aye that fellow don't seem much but he's a natural-born officer """
"Of course, you know, Sir Arthur, he'll need a mentor."
"Hogan, you keep your hands off him."
Hogan is an officer on...
- Ahem!
- On my staff.
Your colonel will be informed.
I'll request light duties till his wound be healed
Good day to you both.
"Light duties, sir."
Light duties it is.
Absolutely.
"See here, Sharpe."
Light duties means staying at headquarters and being snubbed by snobs.
How would you like me to find you something else?
"As long as it's safe, sir."
That's my boy.
So the bankers won't budge?
"Afraid not, Sir Arthur."
We need to find Rothschild.
I'd like to suggest we add that fellow Sharpe to Dunnett's search party.
I make a man an officer today and you want me to send him into the mountains tomorrow.
"- Have you no heart, Hogan?"
"- No, sir."
"We need somebody to command Dunnett's sharpshooters, and Sharpe will be much happier up in the mountains than up in the mess."
"You know the problem, Sir Arthur."
That's really something!
-Let's sleep with this door open tonight.
-Why?
"I don't know why, but I'm scared."
"When I shut my eyes, the picture of those eyes gIares at me."
Cut it out!
Now you're going to make me have a nightmare!
Coward!
"Grandma's story, I wonder if it's true?"
"I can't believe that Suzukichi, who was a little weak in the head... came here to swim at night."
That just proves he was weak in the head.
Isn't it rather cold here?
Grandma says there's a water imp living in the basin of the waterfall.
Stop it!
Don't start a story like that.
"Come on, Iet's eat our lunch."
"By the way, what will you do if you go to Hawaii?"
"First of all, eat a pineapple."
You've sure got a limited imagination.
"Maybe it's only natural, since you're the reincarnation of Suzukichi."
"You are his double, including being weak in the head."
He was only joking.
"Tateo, what do you want to do?"
What else is there?
He'II devote himself to flirting with clark's daughter.
will you propose to her?
Don't be stupid!
emily is one of our relatives.
She's related by blood to Grandma.
Marrying her is out of the question.
You don't even know a thing like that?
"According to MendeI's laws, there's a high probability... for the offspring of a consanguineous marriage to be recessive."
"Oh, God."
So inappropriate.
Can you quit staring at me like I'm a hot fudge sundae?
"- Got a boyfriend, little sis?"
- You got a girlfriend?
"I did, but we broke up."
Tell me about it.
"Well, maybe I can help you get back with her."
"Boss, I'm at Makani's address."
"When I badged him, he tried to rabbit."
"Okay, come over here."
Didn't get real far.
What did he tell you about Dawkins?
Makani runs a fake ID mill out of the back of his shop.
Dawkins was in here about an hour ago.
He picked up a driver's license and a passport under the name of Carl Isner.
Update H.P.D. on the new alias.
Make sure Homeland Security adds it to their no-fly list.
Do you always have to walk so fast?
That's Dawkins' girlfriend.
"Uh, you know, um, your sister, she, uh, wasn't what I expected."
"I mean, aside from her hereditary aversion to neckwear, she seemed to be cool."
Are you saying I'm not cool?
"Well, in certain situations, like when you got a gun pointing in your face, or trying to decide whether to cut the blue wire or the red wire, you're good."
"But human interaction, mammal to mammal, room for improvement."
- That's all I'm saying.
"- Thank you, Dr. Phil."
- Can I get you guys something?
"- Yeah, Walton Dawkins."
Excuse me?
"Well, yeah."
"First, Walton Dawkins, but then I would love some blueberry pancakes."
You got to listen to that shit all day?
You get used to it.
"Yeah, we're gonna go ahead and put you in this air cast."
It's gonna keep everything stabilized until the doctor can examine it.
"Zach, I wasn't trying to hurt you, dude."
"I thought I heard you yell ""all clear."""
"Oh, and this has nothing to do with the fact that I've king to Ashley?"
"I'm sick of your passive aggressive bullshit, Nate."
I'm sorry she likes me more.
We have common interests.
Deal with it.
"Hey, hey, take it easy, buddy."
Don't tell me to take it easy.
I'm seeing clearly for the first time in ages.
My ex-best friend just broke my leg.
I think I might break my own leg if I had to listen to this song all day.
- Right?
"- Take me away now, please."
I've got some thinking to do.
"Yes, sir."
I can't get that goddamn carousel song out of my head.
Torture.
"Yep, that's the one."
"Okay, okay."
♪ I am riding on a little pony ♪
♪ Both my friends are sitting right beside me ♪
"♪ One's on a zebra, one's on a lion ♪"
"♪ Boy, this carousel sure is flying ♪"
"T, I would just die if somebody that I cared about was maybe dying and I didn't really have a chance to tell them how much I loved them."
Yeah.
"You know what we got to do, T."
"Starting right now, we got to tell people right in the moment how much they mean to us."
-We need money
"-Off course, Im sorry."
We leave on friday
-Friday?
What about the consert?
"-No, it...."
We were supposed to go together.
"Im going to check if we can pospone it, so that Lise get to go on the consert."
That would be nice.
"Sorry, im just beeing stupid."
Thanks.
It was a bit early!
Did you check about the friday?
Do you know anyone that make it be postponed?
"Have it done till tomorrow, Then we pospone until sunday"
-Sorry
-Tronstad?
-Have you got a minut?
"-Yes, what is it about?"
How sure are we?
How far are they with the bomb?
Any new information i have not got?
We're never sure.
We know that Werner Heisenberg gave Niels Bohr an schetch-
"-That we thought showed a bomb, This was likely an reactor"
"But if you have an reactor you can make plutonium, if you have plutonium you can make a bomb."
"We do not know if heisenberg did it as a warning, help - 69 00:09:57.200 -- 00:09:59.600 - or just to impress"
"Therefor we have to sink the shipment, Cause we just dont know"
"Heisenberg sees heavy water as essential for his research, that we know..."
"The case is, we are afraid."
Somethings wrong with the critical mass
We calculated an ton of uran.
Get away from the door.
Jessie is a friend
"Yeah, I know he's been A good friend of mine"
But lately something's changed That ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl And I want to make her mine
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's loving him with that body I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late Late at night
"You know,.."
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Private staff quarters are strictly off limits to hotel guests!
I'm so sorry that we are disturbing your fortress of solitude here.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave The Ponderosa immediately.
"Well, that's a shame, because the place is so inviting."
When does Hoss and Little Joe show up?
Dave.
You gentlemen have broken into The Ponderosa and have broken the rules of this island.
"And, unfortunately, I don't think you're gonna like the consequences."
I'm gonna call monsieur Marcel.
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
"Sctanley, there's been a big misunderstanding."
Some of us don't necessarily want to be here.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Smith, but you've broken the rules and there are consequences."
"Yes, could you get Marcel for me, please?"
"Yes, I know he's asleep, but wake him."
This is important.
I'll hold.
What a shocker that this went bad.
Thank you.
Came here for answers and now I'm not gonna get them!
Great.
"Keep an eye on Dinamo, I do not want him complicating things."
"He knows something, inform me of all his movements, understood?"
Yes sir.
Go ahead.
"Well, very well."
"I see you have learned quickly, Adriana."
"Thank you, Madame."
"Remember no to think of what has happened, it was horrible, but it has passed."
"We cannot do anything for her now, let this be a lesson."
"Surely,it was one of those, crimes of passion."
"Go change, we must see the next designs."
"Good morning, Madame Rapee."
"Look, I admit no one to interrupt my work."
"So, if you are here to see your friend, it is best for you to leave, and dont come here again."
Allez!
"I am sorry, I do not know what friend you are talking about?"
She is talking about me.
"Ah, I see you got a job, I am glad."
"Yes, but not for long, If you do not leave immediatedly!"
"Ok, Madame, In reality, the only thing I wanted, was to interview the models."
"Are you une, police?"
Not exactly...
"They have undergone all kinds of questioning,"
"And I do not want the girls to be nervous with what happened, so leave!"
"In that case, please forgive me, I will bother you no more, Excuse me."
"Ok girls, lets go."
Diana?
who is it?
Dinamo.
I want to ask you some questions.
"Come in, the door is open."
"grab a drink, relax, I will be out soon."
Damn.
Gangs only take over because you let them.
"If you would've challenged them, they'd think twice."
"You know they got us living like animals... with bars on every window, alarms on every car."
"All I'm saying is, if we would just patrol our streets... like right here at Drake's Place... where all the drugs are... and with everybody wearing one of these hats."
"Show them those hats, Maxine."
If everybody wore one of these caps... they'd know that we meant business.
- Ma.
- Don't you have a show to do?
He needs money again.
Your brother Kenny never asks for anything.
Dad!
How much?
I just need ten dollars for gas.
"You know, you should be coming to some of these meetings."
"This is your community, too."
You listen to what Mrs. Walker's talking about.
That's right.
This whistle will be a signal to everybody who hears it... to call the police.
You crazy if you think...
I'm going to walk up some dark alley... with a loud orange hat on my head and a whistle.
I can see the headlines now...
"""Golden Lords kill old man in loud orange hat..."
"""and stuff a whistle up his butt."""
Ernest is right.
This patrol is a dumb idea.
"Oh, Elvira!"
No.
It's time we stuck together.
"Mom, Dad, I got to go to the show... but she's right."
We can't win.
Don't upset your father.
It happens fairly often.
"Well, the good news is, we didn't have to go to the emergency room."
"Yeah, I suppose you're right."
Although part of me was looking forward to all of the excitement.
"And now my personal favorite, Mr. Bunny Rabbit."
(crowd groans)
"Hey, where have you been?"
"Awash in social pressure, but I'm back, and I've got something I'm going to say."
"Well, don't tell the story about the two priests on the golf course, 'cause Dreama already did that."
It got a laugh.
I just want to say that I've learned an important lesson tonight.
I realized that what a person looks like on the outside doesn't matter half as much as what she's like on the inside.
I think this belongs to Sabrina.
Or Allan Carr.
Don't get me wrong.
"I'm all for hygiene and grooming, but thanks to you,"
I'll be keeping it all in perspective.
QUICK:
This is a moment she'll never want to forget.
Say cheese.
"Mrs. Quick, no!"
So there we were receiving our crowns when suddenly Sabrina ballooned out.
She was huge.
"At this time, we think a rogue bee may have been the culprit."
Wow.
I hope she wasn't planning to wear it to the prom.
"Well, I'm sure Sabrina will be fine."
Thanks for bringing her home.
(crickets chirping)
SABRINA:
Is the coast clear?
"Oh, I've learned my lesson."
And you were the only person who didn't even seem to care.
"People I barely knew were coming up to me all concerned... and you, you acted like you barely even knew me."
"I know, I know I acted like that."
I just didn't know what else to do.
I knew I was the last person on earth you wanted to deal with.
You were the only person I wanted to deal with.
"I wanted to talk to you, too, it just seemed like... you wanted help from everyone but me!"
- l was really scared.
"- l was, too."
I know we have different friends now...
- but sometimes I miss you so much!
"- Me, too."
It really hurts.
Squeeze my hand as hard as it hurts.
You're in my light.
So Sharon's dad is going to be okay.
I heard.
Your friend Rickie told me.
"I was just over there, at Sharon's, I ended staying a pretty long time."
is there some reason you think I should care about this?
I don't know.
You two are friends.
"I guess. I mean we're not, like, really friends."
"But you've been hanging out with her, right?"
Look.
"It was just... she needed me, I mean, not me, but somebody, anybody."
"And I just happened to be there, and we just, so, we just hung out... or whatever, I mean, it could have been anyone."
"No, that's not true, it doesn't work with just anyone... I mean, some people... I think she needed you."
Why?
Because of certain ways that you are.
"What, did you give this thought or something?"
Brian!
"You're right, that didn't help me at all."
"All right, well, I can tell you this:"
"Gay or straight, you're not gonna get anywhere by being inactive."
She likes you.
Maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something.
"Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin, will you?"
- Thanks.
- Here you go.
TRENT:
"If a girl's into you, she's sleeping with you."
"If after a month, or two months at the very outside she's not sleeping with you?"
She doesn't like you.
The trick is to spot this girl early.
Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.
So I've come up with some signs about how to spot this girl.
"A girl will never sleep with you if she calls you ""cuddly"" or ""dependable."""
"If she pops a zit in front of you if her name is Amber or Christine if she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers on dates one, two, or three."
"I know it's not scientific but I'm just saying, you were warned."
"Wait, stop."
What?
BEN:
Shit.
What?
I am so into you.
"Seriously, I've never felt like this before."
I have to actively stop my brain from thinking about you.
"Like, all the time."
Why stop?
Because I don't do stuff like this.
Stuff like what?
Like sleep with women that aren't my wife.
"First of all, I am not ""women,"" I'm just one."
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please let me go.
I don't want to die here.
Please.
Please let me go.

JERRY:
Toast just did a sweep of Addison's laptop.
Found something the crime lab missed.
Spyware.
And she had it bad.
"I'm not talking about the kind that slows your computer down, and gives you pop-up ads for boner pills."
I'm talking about Cherry Bomb.
"What's ""Cherry Bomb?"""
It's like Microsoft Office for black hat hackers.
"It's a suite of malware that includes key loggers, root kits, and fingerprint evasions"
Real scary stuff.
"The thing is, we found the executable file that infected Addison's system."
It was installed over five months ago.
"So the spyware landed on her computer before she was catfished by Mintz, which means that it had to be her kidnapper who infected her."
"We find out who's behind the hack, we found our guy."
"Okay, guys,"
"I don't know who attacked Addison's computer, but I might know someone who does."
(hip-hop music playing loudly through car speakers)
"Dude, what are you doing?"
Just keeping it real.
I don't want the old crew thinking I sold out.
Why do you think we parked two blocks away?
DANNY:
I can't believe this.
Grace is against it.
"They've had a very bad PR campaign in this country, badgers."
Me and Brian agree on this.
You very rarely hear a good news story about badgers.
"You never hear how you're hit by a truck in the middle of nowhere and next of all, five badgers took me to AE."
With their little paws.
You know Clint Eastwood in Honkytonk Man?
You know the film Honkytonk Man?
I feel a non sequitur coming on.
Did he ever at any point in that movie bump into a badger?
What happens in that one?
He's made up a film that doesn't exist.
"Honkytonk Man is a genuine film about a singer who gets TB and at no point in that movie is there a black and white flash in the background and then, ""I feel a cough coming on."""
You know about culture and stuff.
Is that a real thing?
No.
Honkytonk Man's a genuine film!
Was my sole purpose here...?
Is this an intervention?
Yeah.
Honkytonk Man's a really...
"When he makes something up, pin him down on it!"
Don't just laugh and let him go.
Please keep this in.
Has anybody heard of it?
It was a dream!
It was a dream!
Has anyone heard of Honkytonk Man?
"Why would Clint do tuberculosis, for goodness sake?"
You know what?
"Jesus Christ, this is how the Nazis started - just an idea round the table."
It's a really good film!

"I must say, they make a perfectly exquisite display pair, but I suppose you want them back now."
Where are we?
Welcome to an island of peace on my stormy little planet of Gothos.
What happened?
Fill me in.
You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu.
We've been looking for you for four hours.
"You must excuse my whimsical way of fetching you here, but when I saw you passing by,"
I simply could not resist.
I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise.
"Ah, so you're the captain of these brave lads."
"My greetings and felicitations, Captain."
"So good ofyou and your officers to, uh... drop in."
Absolutely smashing.
Who are you?
Where do you come from?
"General Trelane, retired."
"At your service, sirs."
My home is your home.
"We've lost contact with the ship, Captain."
We're trapped here.
I can't tell you how delighted I am to have visitors from the very planet that I've made my hobby.
"Yes, but according to my observations,"
I didn't think you capable of such voyages.
"Notice the period, Captain."
900 light-years from Earth.
It's what might be seen through a viewing scope if it were powerful enough.
"Ah, yes."
The medical officer and Alicia's father say I'm a psychopath.
"Yeah, a psychopath."
"They say it's good for the trial, but I don't give a shit about that."
I need to see Alicia and find out how it all ended.
"If this goes on, I'm capable of doing anything."
They say I'm a psychopath?
"Well, I'll behave like one."
"Don't say that, please!"
And get me another lawyer.
The one I've got practically throws up on me when he looks at me.
OK.
I'll tell the concierge to give you my keys.
Rent it out and that'll pay the lawyer.
"I'll rent it, because mine has been rented out too."
Great.
I like that you're my tenant.
"I've been thinking a lot about you, especially at night."
Why at night?
Because I read at night.
I've read all your travel guides.
"It was like traveling for months with you at my side, telling me things no one tells you on journeys."
My favorite is the one on Havana.
I really identified with those people who've got nothing and invent everything.
"When you describe that Cuban woman leaning out a window by the ""Malecon"""
"waiting uselessly, seeing how time passes and nothing happens..."
I thought that woman was me.
"Good morning, ma'am."
I'm Benigno's friend.
"Are you Marco, the Argentinean?"
Yes.
I'm the concierge.
Benigno rang to tell me you'd be renting the apartment.
There were nights
I remember them
I will carry them till the end of my days
On the way
Between Deganiya and Kinneret
Stood the loaded cart of my life
He came up to me and said:
"Listen to me, little one"
I built a house for you
In the evening you'll embroider a shirt for me
By day I will drive your cart
What's wrong?
I had a dream about Zeltzer.
Who's Zeltzer?
"Zeltzer, the lighting guy."
He worked for years in the theater.
I wonder if he still works there.
I dreamt that Zeltzer turned the spotlight on my pants.
And I insist that I want it only on my shoes.
And he insists that the audience won't be able to see it.
"And I repeat: ""Only the shoes, not the pants."""
He gets mad and says that no one will see the shoes.
"So I pull him off the ladder and go up there myself, turn the light only on his shoes, but he walks away, leaving me alone."
Suddenly I see Mommy walking on the chairs.
Floating.
Then she comes up to me and lifts me in the air.
"""Direct me, direct me."""
I tell her that first I want to turn the spotlight on her shoes.
"She stands under the ladder,"
I turn the spotlight and she says:
"""Will you direct me?"
"""Will you direct me?"""
"Oh, you're never like me, dear Elinor."
Look how calmly you take the news.
He opened his heart to me yesterday as we travelled.
"It came out quite unawares, quite without design."
I could talk of nothing but my child.
"He gave way to his feelings and he told me of his earnest, tender, constant affection for Marianne."
Everybody knows Colonel Brandon to be an excellent man.
Excellent?
"Oh, my dear, he remained constant throughout that business with Willoughby and he brought me here."
- Any man might do as much for love.
"- Oh, Elinor, do you now belittle him?"
On the contrary!
I am saying that what makes him so fine a gentleman is his constant goodness to everybody.
I have offered heartfelt thanks for all he has done.
"Oh, thanks are not enough."
One must help good causes along.
I have told him that Marianne will be well enough to see him tomorrow.
Whose idea was this?
"Mother's, I suppose."
You must thank him.
I mean to.
He is a worthy man.
"But worthy men are so uninteresting, especially men of his age."
And letting him see me in this state...
- You look lovely.
- My skin looks terrible.
"You are romantically pale, like the heroine of one of Mrs Radcliffe's novels."
"- Hmm, yes."
I see what you mean.
- (LAUGHS)
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Good morning, Colonel."
What?
Her body was found the day before your dad died.
We were told Kevin Grey dated her before she left him for your dad.
"Detective Clayton, I like to think you knew my father very well."
He had a girl in every bar in town.
It was hard for me to keep track.
ls there any reason why you would want to protect Kevin Grey?
- Not that I can think of.
- Miss Lau has answered your questions.
- I'd like to draw this to a close.
"- You're right, Miss Lau."
I did know your father and you know what I smelt on him the last time I saw him?
Fear.
- Fear?
"- He knew, didn't he?"
He knew he was going to be killed.
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.
Freddie wasn't the son of man that scares easily but someone had him on the run.
"- If you say so, Harry."
- Yet you...
You seem completely unaffected through all of this.
Cool as a cucumber.
Why is that?
I don't like the direction you're taking.
Almost as if you knew you were going to be left untouched.
- If you're not charging my client...
"- What did they promise you, Lily-Anne?"
"You're playing a very dangerous game here, Harry."
"The truth is, you're in no position to be questioning me about any of this."
And why is that?
(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)
Cor!
"(LAUGHS) You scared me, man."
Make me a drink.
Make me a drink.
It was the drug people.
It had to be.
It was the drug people.
It had to be.
"That's not what you said to the press, though, Barbara."
"That's not what you said to the press, though, Barbara."

"If they come after me, what happens to my family?"
"If they come after me, what happens to my family?"
"Don spoke out against them every chance he got,"
"Don spoke out against them every chance he got, and that's the way to make enemies around here."
and that's the way to make enemies around here.
Is it possible he walked out on you and he made it look like a murder?
Is it possible he walked out on you and he made it look like a murder?
No.
No.
But is it impossible that he was involved with another woman?
But is it impossible that he was involved with another woman?
I knew my husband.
I knew my husband.
He was the most decent man I've ever met.
He was the most decent man I've ever met.
"PHIL DE LA SALLE: ""If you make accusations against my family,"
"PHIL DE LA SALLE: ""If you make accusations against my family,"
"""I will effing kill you."""
"""I will effing kill you."""
Did you say that to him?
I am sure that all this is very risky for our organization.
"Well then, we have to get ready for the meeting, we do not have much time."
Follow them!
"Agent S.O.S four to unit one, respond unit one."
"Agent S.O.S four to unit one,attention unit one,"
"Unit one, go ahead."
"You are being tailed by a car,You are being tailed by a car!"
Understood.
"Quickly, accelerate, we must loose them!"
"Ok then, go take a break, I will let you know if we have another test."
"Miss Diana, one moment, I must speak with you."
"Yes, Madame"
"Attention, attention, this is Lucrecia reporting, we have Adriana, you may pick her up."
"Yes, Madame?"
"Do not be frightened, Miss, you are only going to serve as company, to your friend Dinamo."
We do not want any risks.
"It is best for you to not resist, dear."
"Freeze or I shoot, darling."
Take her.
"I will take care of her later, personally."
Kill him!
I will.
Watch out!
"Are you ok, Dinamo?"
"I am, Inspector, this is bigger than you can imagine."
We are facing an S.O.S. cell.
S.O.S.?
Secret Organisational Service.
What are they looking for here?
"I do not know, Inspector, but we must not waste time."
"Have your men sorround the hotel and wait there, to await my signal."
May I use one of your motors?
So your 43 boob dollars are gonna get us to Texas?
Don't rule out my roll of butt quarters.
Sweaty but ready.
"All right, can y'all folks lock up?"
I got to make a riverboat before it takes off to New Orleans.
My cousin Tim put a voodoo curse on me.
I got to talk to him about removing it.
"Caroline,"
New Orleans is close to Texas.
"The Hamburglar says so on my McDonald's placemat, and he would never lie unless it's about stealing delicious hamburgers."
I'm confused.
Do you want hamburgers or do you wanna take that riverboat?
"Obviously, the dream scenario is both."
"Ah, thank you very much."
"Max, people have tickets."
You have to pay to get on this... what I'm positive will be my sixth near-death experience.
So bend over and unclench.
We need those butt quarters.
Who are you?
My mother at a church carnival?
"Have your tickets ready, please."
All we have to do is act like we belong.
Do I at least get to have an adorable Southern accent?
No accent.
"Well, I do declare that is mighty disappointing."
Just follow my lead.
It's time to touch strangers.
"Hey, you got a permit for those guns?"
"Well, I say, you got a permit for that light-up yo-yo?"
I have a girlfriend.
"Keep walking, buster."
"Max, the riverboat doesn't get to New Orleans for two days and we have nowhere to sleep."
We're sending Scooby and Shaggy in to work this lead.

"So, which one of these lovable rogues is our Han Solo?"
10 o'clock.
In the bean bag chair.
He goes by Null Legend.
He authored Cherry Bomb.
"(laughs) Well, look at this."
Captain Bird Turd is slumming it with the code jockeys again.
"What, did you blow through your millions already?"
Nope.
I was hoping you could help my boy here.
"See, someone's been using Cherry Bomb to creep on his sister."
"Sorry to hear, but I just give people the tools to hack, it's up to them to do so responsibly."
"Besides, my customers pay top dollar to stay anon."
Except they're not so anonymous to you.
"We both know that you keep records of all your buyers, so that way, if the heat does come down, you've got someone to roll on."
"Let me be clear, okay?"
"It's not that I can't help you, it's that I don't want to."
And I think you know why.
This is going great.
About as well as I expected.
"Okay, all right."
"Okay, it's obvious you two have some history, but can we just take a step back and focus on my problem?"
"You mean, what did I do with it, you obsessed woman."
Black Widow.
"First of all, Robin and I will wanna return all the stolen moneys to banks A through H."
What a perfect idea.
- And secondly-- Batman.
"Oh, it's really you."
"In cape and cowl, commissioner."
Why?
"- I'll explain later, but thank heaven."
- And this is Black Widow.
So you're the she-devil who's been robbing us out of house and home.
"Oh, you must be Chief O'Hara."
What a delightful surprise.
"Why don't you ask her if she'd like to go along to jail with you, Chief O'Hara?"
"Oh, don't ask."
"My heart says no but my brain says yes, love."
I feel it's my responsibility to tell you that you have the constitutional right to consult with your attorney before answering any questions.
-Ah!
But I want to answer his questions.
"Sweetheart, I cannot tell you how much you remind me of my dear departed Max."
"- You'd better come with me, Black Widow."
-Thank you.
"Goldberg, you take care of the rest of them."
"I can't wait to see how it turns out, angel."
"If it really looks good, I'd love to have you come over every day and give me a wash and set."
Why don't we have a look?
Ah!
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.
And only Batman knows for sure.
Batman there's a question I got to be asking you and the Boy Wonder.
"Yes, chief?"
It's Fan-Big-cup Fan!
"Now we know your name, if you're killed we can set up a spirit tablet for you!"
"I'm leaving, then"

Whose bill are you collecting?
You almost cost me my livelihood
How could I not settle accounts with you?
What do you mean by that!
?
You picked 28 strings of my grapes tonight!
"Each string contains 1 1 3 grapes making a total of 3,164 grapes in all"
"That means you owe 253, 700 coppers I won't take anymore or any less"
Pay and go or I'll take your eyes... to ferment into my Night-sweet Premium Wine
Trying to run away!
"Move another inch, and instead of hat... I'll have your eyeballs in my hand"
Want to run!
?
Help!
Help!
Don't shout-l've been hanging here all day
"What a ridiculous way to fail, Brother"
We're hung on the tip of a straw!
What damned rotten luck!
Hey!
You two were stealing my grapes together!
I have a mother 80 years old and 20-some dependents waiting to eat
Please find forgiveness in your heart!
Then from now on work to pay your debts
If other people can make you happy then they can also make you unhappy.
"What, you think those people out there are going to make you happy?"
Hang on.
Wait.
"Marcus, don't."
Marcus!
Bollocks.
"Come on, Britney!"
"Yeah, give us a song, then."
This is for my mum.
## I heard he sang a good song #
# I heard he had a style #
# And so I came to see him # # to listen for a while #
# And there he was this young boy # # a stranger to my eyes #
"You're rubbish, mate!"
# Strumming my pain with his fingers #
# Singing my life with his words #
# Killing me softly with his song #
# Killing me softly #
Who the hell is that?
# Telling my whole life with his words #
# Killing me softly with his song #
# I felt all flushed with fever # # embarrassed by the crowd #
# I felt he found my letters # # and read each one out loud #
# I prayed that he would finish # # but he just kept right on #
# Strumming my pain with his fingers #
# Singing my life with his words #
# Killing me softly #
Give it a rest.
# Killing me softly with his song #
# Telling my whole life with his words # # Killing me softly #
# With his song #
But I did find out from NYPD... that Dorothy tried twice in the past six months to have him arrested.
Assault and battery.
So maybe Morty wanted to have a little S8M party... and Dorothy wasn't up for it.
And then Cannata and Doss order a hit... 'cause she snuffed out their old friend.
"Yeah, maybe a vendetta."
Uh-uh.
It doesn't add up.
Yeah.
Why would they wanna risk blowing a multi-million dollar shot... at a casino racket on a vendetta against a cocktail waitress?
"Cannata and Doss, we'll begin with them."
"Switek, Zito, I want video surveillance at Shelborne."
"Gina and Trudy, I want you guys to try to get jobs at the hotel."
"Crockett and Tubbs, Dorothy Bain."
She's the key.
Yup.
You were supposed to get the papers... not start World War Ill.
What?
I don't wanna hear it.
No.
It's not their fault the heat showed up.
It's your fault we're in this mess to begin with.
"You had to place bets with that jackass friend of yours, Price."
"Hey, have a little respect."
The guy's dead.
Yeah.
So is our chances of turning this joint into a legit casino... if we don't beat the cops to them tally sheets.
So they find them.
Big deal.
It's only names and numbers.
Circumstantial evidence.
"They take to the DA... and the next thing we're having lunch with the grand jury, what?"
Okay.
Which is to our good fortune.
Still havin' you here with us.
"So happy to keep you happy, Daddy."
Livy and Ellie are waitin' on me.
We're goin' to the suffragette rally this afternoon.
"Do you want to come, Tootsie?"
I promised Abigail I'd baby sit little Camden.
"What about Annie Laurie's tea dance, Zelda?"
Isn't that today?
Those affairs are insufferable.
"More so than the ""insufferablegette"" rally?"
I find it gratifying that
Zelda has so many activities to choose from.
"Well, I'm off to march, wave signs and shout slogans that would curl your hair."
Nothing to love about women voting.
Sorry I'm late.
Your family takes forever to eat lunch.
- Livy.
"- Well, she's right, Ellie, they do."
I thought you changed your mind.
I wouldn't miss this.
"It's historic, and happening right here in little old Montgomery."
Not to mention it's something to write about in your next letter to Mr. Scott Fitzgerald.
"Dearest Scott, the rally was ever so amazing."
"Why do you keep writing him, anyway?"
"Well, just because I told him I wasn't gonna marry him doesn't mean I can't correspond, does it?"
"- Come on, Zelda."
- Whatever is the matter now?
"I'm comin', I'm comin'."
Woman:
Votes for women.
Violets for votes.

"But, uh, it turns out an antiques dealer"
Had it in Tokyo in the 1920s.
Now it's here in Washington.
"Artie, it's at the secret service."
What the hell's it doing there?
"Well, the Japanese government presented it"
In the 1920s to Woodrow Wilson as a symbol of peace.
Guess that didn't work out so well.
And the curator at the Wilson museum of peace
Made the connection a couple days ago
And offered it to be united with the sword
At the gift ceremony.
"But freaky explosions tend to put the kibosh on ceremonies,"
So it's going back to the museum in the morning.
The sword and the tsuba in D.C. at the same time.
"No, no, no."
That's--that's too much coinc--
Too much coincidence.
"Well, Artie, we're sitting on the secret service building."
"But, look, if this thief is--is coming to get the tsuba,"
We have to warn Dickinson.
"No, no. absolutely not."
"Well, Artie, you saw what this guy's willing to do."
"Yeah, and--and so did you."
And imagine what he's capable of with the sword.
"No, no, no. this thief is ruthless and smart."
"So if you warn the secret service,"
And they do anything out of the ordinary--
Anything at all-- then he will be tipped off.
So you want to use him as bait.
"- No, Artie."
No.
He played everything.
"Classical, bluegrass, electric rock."
"Anyway, when we ran out of money, we stopped here and I got a job dealing blackjack at Caesars."
"The next thing I know, this mysterious man, the one you look so much like, Garthe, he wouldn't leave me alone."
"Flowers every day, gifts."
One of the gifts was a job for Ron.
The plot thickens.
I suppose so.
I sure didn't see it at the time.
Ron did odd jobs for him.
It all began so innocently.
And we went out twice.
A limo to pick me up.
Carte blanche at the best shops in town.
So many flowers sent to the apartment that Ron's old allergies came back.
"Well, it sounds all right to me."
All except for the allergies.
What happened?
"I've always believed in love and romance, pretty much in that order."
Garthe made it clear that he didn't.
He prefers to buy what he wants.
"Okay, I think I get the picture."
Ron gets suspicious of Garthe.
"Whatever he found out or overheard went into a tape recorder, and the tapes he hid in a locker right before he disappeared."
"I know it's not much to go on, but it's all I've got."
"Michael, something's happened to him and Garthe's behind it, I know it."
"All right, I'll see what I can do."
The key...
Pardon?
You said you'd found the key to the locker.
"Do you know what ""antithesis"" means?"
"""Antithesis""?"
And we are not a group that you want picketing in your lobby.
I'm really sorry Miss Stewart but the difference.
Between you and your friend isn't academic or fluid related.
"Miss Truscott held part-time jobs, she was a cheerleader."
She was on the volleyball team The skateboard club the surf club.
And you.
Were a tricycle-riding pirate mascot for half a basketball game.
And in 12th grade you climbed a rope.
That sucker went all the way to the ceiling.
Yes I think you mentioned that in your essay.
"""To the Ceiling and Back:"
"A Girl, a Rope and a Dream."""
Which was exactly the required 500 words.
And Lilly's was 502.
"Just saying, rule follower, rule breaker."
Miley you are an excellent student.
But you don't have any extra-curricular activities.
And here at Stanford we're looking for students with a skosh more.
But come on you have to let me in.
This is the only college I applied to.
This is the only school you applied to?
You know on one hand that could sound incredibly dumb.
But on the other hand it could be a display of admirable school spirit.
Doesn't show up on a test but honey at the pep rally.
I will skosh you up one side and down the other.
Go Stanford!
Whoo-hoo!
Huh-uh!
Whoo-hoo!
Hey!
"Okay, please."
I appreciate your enthusiasm.
She'll go sailing proudly down the years in the epic of dunkirk.
"And our great grandchildren, when they learn how we began this war-- by snatching glory out of defeat and then swept on to victory, may also learn how the little holiday steamers made an excursion to hell and came back glorious."

"And I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold..."
I've got a son the same age.
"Aelwyn, the roman soldiers..."
They're coming?
Up the plain.
Hundreds.
Then today will be a good day to die.
What about the astronomicons?
We must remove them to the sanctuary.
Gather our brothers.
Go.

Oh.
"I guess all I have to do is turn around, right?"
"They think I'll play that cute factor, you know?"
Let's put it this way.
Everybody is looking for you.
So leave or I'm calling the cops.
Leave.
"Hello, gentlemen."
How are you?
- Don't get too close or I'll vomit.
- You never used to say that.

You really are the height of elegance.

"You aren't wrong, Sis."
I'm sorry about before.
It was no problem.
"To tell you the truth, I don't know why you got angry."
Did I say something wrong?
"Hibara-san, you are the only one that I can really talk to."
Please!
Let's be friends.
I am always surprised by your interest and knowledge about the other side.
It sometimes even makes me a litlle embarrassed.
"But, I don't think that people actually seeing that stuff can really be that positive."
"And, I really want to talk to you about different things, Saho-san."
"When you talk about ghosts and other things like that, Saho-san, it is like..."
Like...?
Enenra!
Eh?
No...
Um...
"It is like the more that you try to look to the other side, the more you get caught by a net of smoke, Saho-san."
"You can't see what is really around you, right?"
"But, if you can't see what is going on here, you will never be able to see what is happening on the other side."
Please pay attention to what is happening around you from now on.
I will help you along!
It's gone!
That's funny!
Eh?
I'm so jealous of your way of looking at things!
"You are so funny, Hibara-san!"
I am so happy I got to know you!
Y-Yeah!
I wonder if she is really praising me.
"But, it has been a long time since I have had a conversation like that."
Tonight on The Curse of Oak Island...
Have you ever seen anything like this?
No.
That's very odd.
There's an opening in the ground.
Is this the back door?
That's not natural.
We want to take a look at the well.
Down to the water!
Might there be clues down there?
What the hell's that?
Do you see that?
- Wow.
- Down slow.
This well may be associated with the Templars.
- Whoa!
"- What do you got, Tony?"
"Right here on these rocks, I've got a triangle."
This thing's amazing.
There is an island in the North Atlantic where people have been looking for an incredible treasure for more than 200 years.
"So far, they have found bits of gold chain, a stone slab with strange symbols carved into it, even a 17th century Spanish coin."
"To date, six men have died trying to solve the mystery."
"And, according to legend, one more will have to die before the treasure can be found."
"Jack, why don't you hack that tree out of the way."
- Wow.
- That's my big discovery.
"Well, honestly, David, that is quite odd."
"A few days ago, during a meeting in the war room,"
"Rick, Marty and members of the Oak Island team were introduced to New York based writer and researcher Zena Halpern by area historian Doug Crowell."
- Hello?
"- Hi, Zena, it's Doug."
So I don't have to send him down the mines quite yet?
"Um, I'm sorry, I think that might be my next appointment."
"No, that is your previous one."
That's Fuzz's dad who's just successfully missed every other parent-teacher interview.
"Cleaver, this is Fiona McCready, Fuzz's English teacher."
Hi.
Sorry.
Caught up in a very complex trial.
"Oh, was the complex trial run over five or eight furlongs?"
Finnegan mentioned you were a barrister.
I think he wants to follow in your footsteps.
"According to all the other teachers, he is."
"What is an education, anyway?"
I spent most of 1982 learning 52.8% of Malaysia's GDP came from rubber.
I don't even know if they produce the stuff anymore.
"He's a bright boy, he's falling behind."
Why?
"Because he doesn't sit up straight in class and say,"
"'Miss, Miss, ask me!"
'
You know what happens to kids who do that.
"Yes, they're in an office somewhere with their hand up still."
"Anyway, that last teacher seemed quite impressed."
"Yes, she did."
Yeah.
Never had a teacher who looked like that.
I did once see Miss Treadwell in her bathers.
Her varicose veins looked like an aerial shot of the Nile Delta.
(Laughs)
Is there a word that means even shallower than superficial?
Are you still screwing Scarlet?
I knew it was a mistake telling you.
"On his earlier weekend visit, musician Mr. Carrington touched a chord with Miss Hopkins."
"When Mr. Carrington came for the weekend, it was like a breath of fresh air walking into this house."
"Something just kind of clicked inside me, and, um... and, uh..."
"The hostess's companion, Miss Martin, is helping Miss Hopkins make a love token to greet Mr. Carrington."
This looks wicked great.
"Chaperone Mrs. Hammond is so thrilled at the prospect of having an attractive musician back at the house, she's hired a grand piano."
This is just what we needed.
Perfect.
Music has ever been a conduit for amour.
But a Regency musician only had the social advantages of a senior servant... hardly a suitable candidate for Miss Hopkins.
I've just spilt yellow paint everywhere.
Does it hide it?
"Ah, that's really, really nice."
Nice.
"Ladies, gentlemen."
Oh!
"Well, that's a proper piano."
"Oh, that's so good."
"Anyway, come on, come and have a drink and then sort of settle in."
Thank you so much.
That's so amazing.
I can't believe it.
"""Here's a little something from me to you"
"""to welcome you back to Kentchurch Court."
"""It's good to have you back, mate."
"Fondest regards, Miss Hopkins."""
Look at this tambourine she's done.
That is so amazing.
"""Follow the beat of your heart."""
"God, I'm really getting blown away today."
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
That's why we came after you.
That's lucky for me.
He had no intention of leaving me alive.
- You get a good look at him?
- Yeah.
"Asian, mid-40s, he had a tattoo on the side of his head."
Sounds like the picture of the guy out of New York.
What picture?
Akira Kimura.
Who is he?
Yeah.
That's the same guy.
Akira Kimura.
He was somehow connected to my case on Roth and Flynn.
The guys who came for the coins.
Yeah.
God knows those coins aren't healthy to be around.
"And we did a little more digging, found out Kimura is tied to a secret organization called the dragon's tongue."
"It was founded in 1901, connected to the Japanese imperial army."
It went underground after the Japanese defeat in world war ii.
But it appears the organization has resurfaced with ties to the Yakuza.
"We got a report that Kimura was identified by state police in hamburg, Germany, three months a, now he's here."
I want you to tear this town apart and find this son of a bitch.
We think he hired a private investigator out of New York.
We found photos of you.
"And me, Hank, the captain, everybody on this investigator's camera."
The same investigator we found dead today.
We think Kimura killed him.
Why would he kill the guy he hired?
Remember those coins I was telling you about?
"Oh, yeah."
Everybody died?
- All right.
All right.
"Now, who can explain Newton's method and how you use it?"
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.
That's impressive.
That's really good.
"I mean, I'm very impressed by that, especially since my class is called Nonlinear Equations."
"All right, now somebody tell me something I don't already know."
Anyone?
Bueller.
Anyone?
Bueller.
Newton stole it.
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.
Joseph Raphson published this same method 50 years earlier.
"And if the start value is too far removed from true zero, then it fails."
"- I'm sorry, what's your name?"
- Ben.
Ben Campbell.
Ben.
So Ben Campbell suggests that Joseph Raphson was the original author of this method.
"Well, if that's the case, then why didn't he get any credit?"
"Well, for one thing, Newton had a better publicist."
"And for another, after 1700, we know very little about Raphson other than the fact that he discovered the Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna."
"All right, now, let's give Ben a chance for some extra credit, shall we?"
"We're gonna call this the game show host problem, all right?"
"Ben, suppose you're on a game show."
"And you are given a chance to choose from three different doors, all right?"
"Now, behind one of the doors is a new car."
"Behind the other two, goats."
"Which door would you choose, Ben?"
Are you in love with someone?
If you do silly talking
I will demand fare more than the meter reading
I am loving a guy
"Hey bell, if someone gets you biriyani, you will go with him"
-Are you in love?
"-Start, it's getting late"
These days it's hard to distinguish good and bad
Can't find who drinks alcohol and uses drugs
Can't find who is a terrorist
"Don't get trapped, tell me who he is?"
I will find out whether he is good or bad
-He is from which area?
-Ukkadam
-Where in Ukkadam?
-Sannathi street
-That's our street!
Is it that corner house Pandi or neighbor Kannan?
Or is it that fat ugly fellow with french beard?
"-No, it's the opposite house"
-Opposite house?
-That's our house!
Oh that must be Thankam
Has he trapped you by showing silver anklet?
It's neither gold nor brass
Who will love that black man?
"Then, I am there in the opposite house"
-ls that me?
-Yes
I love you I won't come behind if buy me a biriyani
Make me an ornamental belt I will come after you
You have fallen in love!
"And when was this, sir?"
12 years ago.
And you believe that woman is Sara Collins?
"Yeah, I do."
"Your name, sir?"
Peter Manning.
M-A-N-N-I-N-G.
27 hours.
I got two calls from the director's office.
He's got half of Capitol Hill breathing down his neck.
Yeah?
"Well, if they want to do something constructive for a change, give them a badge and let them help."
I'll put that in the suggestion box.
We got the DNA back on these hairs we found in Jessica Nevins' hotel room.
They're Sara's.
Pulled out by the root.
Is there enough to issue a warrant for Miss Nevins?
No.
"But we're monitoring her credit card accounts, all her known acquaintances."
"She sticks her head out of the rabbit hole, we got her."
And Amanda McNeal:
Where are we at with the prelim?
Body's still frozen.
M.E. can't autopsy until it thaws out.
"Guys, Dockery's got something."
Surveillance footage from the Biltmore garage four minutes after Sara disappeared.
There's our Taurus.
And there's Valera.
"Sara's probably tied up in the backseat, maybe the trunk."
"All right, I want subpoenas for every exterior surveillance camera in downtown Atlanta-- security cams, traffic cams, weather cams,"
"Convenience stores, ATMs."
"And you can wake up every judge in town, if you have to."
You saying Flack hit him?
"Mac, I'll know more when I open him up, complete my examination."
"I did a preliminary tox screen for heroin, cocaine, PCP, methamphetamine, marijuana and alcohol."
All were negative.
Don Flack did not kill this boy.
Find out what did.
"Now when you and Detective Flack first approached Todd Fleming, he was at wrestling practice, correct?"
That's correct.
And what was his demeanor?
He was fine.
"So the kid's calm, perfectly healthy."
He agrees to take a ride with you down to the station house.
"He's calm when you walk him through the precinct, he's calm when you bring him in the interrogation room."
"And then in less than five minutes, he suddenly becomes agitated, has to be subdued, and now he's dead."
That's exactly whatappened.
"And if I knew why, I wouldn't be sitting here with you."
Did you notice any injuries when you picked Fleming up?
- Bruises?
- No.
Was Detective Flack ever alone with him?
"In the car, maybe?"
I drove.
Detective Flack sat in the back with Mr. Fleming.
We were together the entire time.
What about at the school?
Fleming was in his street clothes at the time of his death.
I'm assuming he changed somewhere?
In the locker room.
Who accompanied him there?
Detective Flack.
Detective Flack.
Doesn't look good.
!
-Quick carry her inside!
-Yes.
"Are you alright, Priestess Yeo Mi-Eul?"
We thought we were going to lose you.
I'm okay.
You've exhausted yourself.
How's things in the palace?
"About the reinforcements,"
His Majesty hasn't come to a decision yet.
The ministers have differing opinions among themselves too.
It looks like His Majesty is having a hard time.
"It's just a yes or a no, must it take so long?"
As long as you agree to it.
BuYeo will receive the Emperor's benevolence.
I simply cannot understand all this dragging and procrastination.
"Prince Dae-So, please try again."
"If I try again, it'll only make it worse."
I cannot wait any longer!
"If you cannot decide soon, then it leaves me no choice."
What's that supposed to mean?
Haven't I made myself clear enough?
It's because of Prince Dae-So's hardwork that our nations... have the peace that they enjoy now.
"This has nothing to do with the reinforcements,"
It was solely between you and me.
Don't try to put them together.
I'm very touched that you brought me Hae Mo-Su's head.
"Concerning BuYeo and the Han Dynasty's diplomacy,"
I'm very interested in helping you out.
"But,"
"If you're holding back because you fear your father,"
Then it's a pity our friendship has to end here.
Before dawn we want a similar one
I can understand your plight
But all the members have gone out of station
"Arul has come, let us ask him to make it"
"Greetings doctor, why at this hour?"
-Come here
-What mom?
Why all of you are worried?
You must immediately make a wedding chain
Mom you know everything...
I can't
Don't be adamant make the wedding chain
"-Mom, I can't, you know I won't do it"
"- Don't shout, they are here"
"- It's very urgent, Will you do it or not?"
- I can't
Will you not obey your mom?
-They have come out of trust in us
"-Leave my hands, I am going"
"Wedding is scheduled for tomorrow, do it"
-I can't
- Do it for your mother's sake
- I can't and that is final
"- If you can't, don't meet me hereafter"
- Mom
- Don't give me reasons
- Why do you ask me....?
"- You don't do it, right?"
- OK
- We will collect it in the early morning
- OK
- Thanks a lot
- Treat me as you would a stranger.
"As for you, Mr. Buff um, it might be wiser if you didn't speak at all."
I never met a Kentuckian so plainly from Massachusetts.

Do you have your pistols?
Keep them hidden.

Nothing.
[Pittenger] Andrews gave us 3 days for our journey through the Cumberlands.
"Traveling by twos and threes, we were strung out miles apart in a desolate country."
"We'd been supplied with Confederate money, but food and lodging were scarce, and transportation out of the question."
"My companion was the Giant, Bill Campbell."
"As I came to know him, I felt a growing concern over his quick, violent temper."
One such powder keg could blow our whole expedition sky-high.
"We reached the Tennessee River on time, only to find it impassable."
"Pardon me, ma'am."
Do you know the whereabouts of the ferryman?
"Home, like enough."
But he won't chance it across before morning.
River's swole up mighty angry.
- Could you put us up for the night?
- Where you from?
"[Pittenger] Flemingsburg, Kentucky."
Inn's pretty full.
We can pay double.
[thunder]
"They're from Flemingsburg, too."
There's a score of us in all.
We couldn't abide the Yankees anymore so we pulled up stakes.
Gonna throw in our lot with the Southern army.
You seem so different.
- We're not.
- l think you are.
"I mean, come on, Malakai's scary."
Very scary.
What you mean by scary ?
"Kai's tough, he has to be."
But he's still got a good heart. I know.
Maybe you only think you know.
"Look, Malakai may not be the boy next door, but he's still my boy."
"He does some shit that I'm not down with sometimes, but I ain't never going to cross him offand be like everybody else."
"So, you're not down with the stuff he does, but you are down with him ?"
- That makes sense. I understand.
"- He's my friend, Sara."
You don't have to understand.
You don't have to understand.
"Listen, me and him got into some shit awhile back-- some bad shit."
Broke into a liquor store and cracked open the cash register.
"Somebody peeped us and called five-0, and we barely made it out of the store."
The cops were on our asses.
We split up and ran in different directions.
"Now, I must have been going in the wrong direction, because the cops were closing in on me."
"So, Malakai, he smashed in some car windows, set off the alarms... and turned the heat from me to him."
"I kept running, and he got caught."
The DA offered him everything but a Rolls Royce to turn my name in.
"But he didn't, and he never will."
"I stole a hat once, when I was 12."
But my Mom found it and made me give it back.
Gangsta Sara stole a hat.
Call the F.B.l.
Are you gonna turn me in ?
I think I'll wait for you to surrender.

"The police investigation into the murder of 4 year old brisbane boy Thomas murnane has been reignited, with the detention of the boy's mother for questioning."
The 32 year old woman was taken from her home by homicide detectives and is assisting them with their inquiries.
"This comes after the recent release of Benjamin gundelach, who had been a figure of intense speculation after finding the boy's body in mid December."
"Lawyers for the woman insist she was not involved in her son's death, and will fight any charges."

"Wonderful things, sir?"
Yes.
But nothing written.
No papyrus.

"Not much, I think."

I gather Hauser and Hall have resigned and are leaving?
"Yes, I believe so."
"With Gardiner, that makes a third of our team who've walked out."
So?
Gardiner's a personal friend of mine.
He's one of the finest brains in England.
He came here at his own expense as a personal favour to me.
"Hauser and Hall, as you well know, are here courtesy of the Metropolitan."
I had a call this morning from New York.
You had to wash them all by hand when you got back from the tour?
"Like, really big bugs."
We're talking 30 pounds worth.
That's how much more the costumes weighed when you came back.
See?
Here on the bills of lading.
"Uh, we bought a couple of costumes."
"Mimi, don't you think we would have checked that out before we brought you in?"
"What you did, Mimi, was you bought a few bricks of coke in South America."
"And you dissolved them in water, and then you dipped the costumes in them."
"And then when you got back, you soaked the costumes, and then you let the water evaporate, and, bingo!"
Cocaine.
"Oh, god, oh, god."
"Oh, god, oh, god, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry.
"Okay, me and George, we've been trying to get a down payment on a place, so George had a friend who knows some people in Iman..."
"All right, yeah."
Did Laura know what you were doing?
"Oh, my god."
"No, no, no, no, no."
Nobody knew.
"Mimi, she had coke all over her hands when we found her."
She must have grabbed onto one of the costumes
- when she was hiding in the racks.
- Hiding?
"Yeah, she was hiding back there with Maestro Reinhardt, ""Fearsome Phil""."
"They were, they were having some kind of a fight about something."
What were they talking about?
"He was yelling it was his decision, he decides."
"And then he just yelled at us, and then he left."
And what about Laura?
"She came out right after that, and she looked really upset."
- Why?
Because it's the first thing I move aside.
Well... fuck you.
Next month I am going to buy the same ones but in red.
Come with me tomorrow to the cemetery.
You know I can't.
"I have to be with my family and besides, your wife never liked me."
Do you know how hard it is for me?
"I am leaving, see you next week."
Why so fast?

- What do you have?
- Red and green.
- How much?
Only ten pesos.
Give me two red and two green.
Here.
Do you want a sweet one?
"I don't have more money, but if you can give me credit until next time..."
Thank you.
"A ten month old baby died of an infection caused by rat bites in Colombia,"
The baby was malnourished and the authorities are questioning the mother she says that the baby's father left her alone with four kids.
The funeral of the ten year old girl murdered by a neighbor who wanted to eat her body in Oklahoma.
The victim's family and friends were at the ceremony.
The murderer was found guilty in the first degree...
Two criminals who decapitated two policemen in Mexico have not been caught yet.
"The heads were found... outside a govemment building with a note saying ""learn to respect""."
- Hey beautiful!
"- Hurry up, I'm getting cold!"
"I can't, I ate too much."
"Michael, you might want to double-check your head count."
"Hey, Sam."
Everything all right?
"You know, Mike, uh..."
"The last time I kissed my lady, she was crying."
I left her to be interrogated by the CIA so we could escape.
I'm sorry.
We're getting the passports.
We need to know if you're coming.
"Yeah, well, I got to think about that, Mike."
I'll let you know.
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
I can't believe you're going to build a mosque.
I know.
It's surreal.
"So, what's your first step going to be?"
"You know, I got so caught up in the excitement,"
I didn't actually think how we're going to do it.
"OK, well, you're going to need a location and permit,"
- So why don't you talk to Ann?
"- Oh, that's a good idea."
"I will explain to her how the idea came about, hmm..."
"Through an unlikely friendship with a chicken,"
I was given a sign that told me I should build a mosque.
Maybe leave out the part about the chicken 'cause it's a little weird.
"You know, I'm going to go see Ann now and see if she's got a few minutes to spare."
So you're probably wondering why I'm here.
I'm wondering what's taking you so long to get to the point of why you're here.
- I want to build a mosque in Mercy.
- Uh-huh.
"Technically, I know we have a mosque in the church already, but you know that was supposed to be temporary anyway."
"What about if she comes after my mom, my brother..."
Doug's son Jasper?
- So we sit here and wait?
"- For once, she's right, Mike."
We gotta do somethin'.
"We're gonna hand him over to the U.S. Attorney,get him into Witness Protection."
- Won't she still come after you?
- We'll deal with that later.
"Sam, I need you to call the U.S. Attorney."
Tell them we're bringing Doug in tomorrow morning.
- I'm on it.
"- And, uh... somebody needs to go to my mom... see that she's safe, make her house secure."
- Think she's cooked dinner yet?
"- I'm sure she'll heat somethin' up for you, Sam."
"Well, then I'm on that too."
Fi...
I need you to prep an armed escort.
Doug.
I need you... to stay away from the windows.
You say this is just a precaution?
"Oh, yeah."
It's nothin' to worry about.
"Um, say, um, this is a little embarrassing, but, uh... me and my lady friend, uh, had a falling out, and... well, Mike thought maybe it would be okay if I, uh, crashed here for the night."
"Sam, I'm not an idiot."
You want to tell me what's goin' on?
"Well, see, there was this lady, and she was making some threats."
- Against me?
- Not specifically.
"Well, I mean, your name came up, but it was more like a hypothetical type thing... so it's nothing to worry about, but Mike wanted me to stay here and give you some... you know, self-defense pointers in case I had to leave."
You gonna leave this here with me when you go?
Okay.
"Be careful, okay?"
This place is tiny!
And I'm sick of seeing your man-panties hangin' all over the bathroom.
"They're called boxers, Carla."
"They're satin, J.D.?"
With a breathable cotton crotch panel!
King me!
"Ugh, I need to find someone to split the rent at my place."
I thought you were getting good money at your new fellowship?
"So first, my fellowship gets canceled because some jackass cures the disease, and now the only job I can get is working at this crappy free clinic for eight bucks an hour."
No one's life could be worse than mine!
Uh...the...fellowship's great!
Heh!
"Oh God, Carla, please don't tell them"
I'm working at a free clinic!
I sense she doesn't want me to tell them.
Women have an unspoken connection men can't even fathom!
"Dude, I know you can't look because Carla's here, but you're missing a crazy Victoria's Secrets commercial."
I'm watching Giselle in my spoon right now!
You know... you--you two could solve both of your problems if you just moved in together.
- Whooooooa.
Hold your horses!
- Whoa!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, and whoa-ho!"
We have a very complicated past.
"Yeah, I hurt her, and I'm not proud."
I'm a little proud.
"We've managed to restore our friendship, though, by staying away from dangerous topics."
"Yeah, relationships, and things of that nature."
J.D. and I keep it superficial.
Love the superficial.
Dynamite teeth today!
"Oh, thanks, buddy!"
"It's hardly the style for you, dear."
I asked the chauffeur to bring the car around.
I do have a cab waiting.
Howard can take care of that.
I would prefer it if Corbett drove you.
As you like.
"- Merle, we'll be late if--"
"- Goodbye, Aunt Olivia,"
- Uncle Howard--
- Enjoy yourselves.
"But be back by 5:00, remember?"
"You need your rest, Merle."
We'll remember.
"Come on, Merle, let's go."
Bye-bye.
"She's quite beautiful, isn't she, Howard?"
Miss Gilbert?
"Yes, I suppose she is."
"Still, on the whole, I think you'd prefer Margo Stevens-- [chuckle]-- if you had your pick, that is."
Must we go through this every time--
"Oh, don't flatter yourself that I'm jealous, Howard, of Margo or any of the other silly young creatures that you mentally pursue."
It's the effect of your behavior on Merle that I'm thinking of.
"Oh, good heavens."
Merle will be 21 next week.
"And as her trusted trustee, can you honestly say that Merle is mature enough to even pick out her own movies, let alone watch her uncle make a fool of himself?"
"Oh, Olivia, for heaven's--"
"Howard, I think you'd better pay off that cab driver, hadn't you?"
I wish Aunt Olivia would let me buy dresses like that.
I wish I could afford dresses like that.
"Good afternoon, ladies."
"If I'm in time for lunch, I think I'll have a watercress sandwich and a little bowl of fruit."
"Oh, aren't we funny."
"-Yes, I do know."
"-First, you talk about a beating... and then we find out all you're discussing is a single blow."
Would you say that the arguments in the Lucas Cross house... were more or less violent than any other family arguments?
-Objection!
-What's the purpose of that question?
The witness must define her terms if the jury and this court... are to clearly understand what she means.
"A beating becomes one blow, a blow becomes a slap?"
Perhaps the slap will become something else.
Objection overruled.
-I have no further questions.
"-No questions, your Honor."
You may step down.
The prosecution would like to call Mrs. Constance MacKenzie.
Raise your right hand.
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-I do.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Constance MacKenzie.
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I understand you've known the defendant a long time."
"Yes, since she was a baby."
Did Selena ever complained that her stepfather had beaten her... at any time?
-What?
-Did Selena ever complained...
"Oh, no."
No.
"Did you ever see any marks on her, injuries?"
No.
"You knew the defendant 's mother well, did you not?"
Nellie worked for me as a house maid.
Did she ever mentioned Lucas' brutality or... described any beating he had ministered?
"No, she said he was drunk and and lazy, and he deserted her..."
Now that might be another way to go.
She knows the maestro's innocent because she knows who killed Laura.
Doesn't explain the bite mark.
I still think the teeth looked a little big.
Know what I mean?
The teeth marks could look larger because of the swelling of the wound.
I didn't say it was the only explanation.
"Well, what's option B?"
"According to Laura's dentist, she started a teeth whitening program four months ago."
He took a mold of her teeth... to make her a dental tray for the bleach.
"Listen, Rodgers... what if someone made a mold using Laura's dental tray?"
It would be an exact match of her bite.
Except the teeth would come out a little bigger.
"Thank you, Rodgers."
"DRESSING ROOM OF GILLIAN BOOTH OLD HUDSON OPERA HOUSE TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28"
What is it with showbiz people and freebies?
She's got a subway map for every day of the year.
"Well, some people can never be too prepared."
"Detectives, in here."
"No dental tray or mold, but..."
dental resin.
That's what makeup people use to make fake teeth.
"25 years onstage, Gillian's got a few tricks up her sleeve, huh?"
She wore prosthetic teeth to leave a bite on Philip to match Laura.
She set him up.
That's how she's getting him to the altar.
"And by the power vested in me by the state of New York,"

"Mr. Reinhardt, you may kiss your bride."
"You'll never regret this, Philip."

"You know, that Mr. Sandover whose dumpy little wife used to be Mr. Devro's boss lady."

"All right, all right."

"Sandover, why the devil don't you answer?"
"Shh, Mr. Sellers, we're busy counting paperclips."
And let me warn you-- if a single one is missing when my desk buddy returns--
"All right, never mind."
"Here, Sandy, you won't need this."
I'm having a briefcase loaded with all the estimates.
"Yes, I expected that, sir."
"I'm taking along some work of my own, that's all."
Oh.
"Well, if you're a little overweight on the plane..."
"I plan to travel by rail, sir."
You're neither and I don't think I like it.
Another drink?
"You pride yourself on it, don't you?"
It's important to you.
Very important.
What?
Being brave all the time.
Loads of physical courage.
"What is this, truth or consequences?"
"You're quite right, let it pass."
I didn't know you were interested.
"It's purely academic, I assure you."
You don't look academic to me.
"Mr McKendrick, it may interest you to know that a great many women are not partial to the superman type."
They prefer a little human weakness.
A little humility.
Look everybody's scared of something.
That coming from you could be quite an admission.
I gather you two gentlemen know each other.
"Pinky, this is Mr McKendrick."
Pleased to meet you.
"Sit down, McKendrick."
Here is the news.
It was announced from Washington today that President Roosevelt has transferred 50 American destroyers to His Majesty's government as part of a Lend Lease grant.
Lend Lease.
"In exchange, leases have been to the United States for the construction of airfields and naval bases in British Commonwealth Territory as part of America's Defence Programme."
Defence.
What are the Yanks defending?
Who's shooting at them?
That's right.
50 stinking tin cans.
Lousy old tubs that ain't been at sea since WW1.
Could I have been swarmed?
In my underwear too.
I could've been swarmed in my underwear.
Hey.
You don't get to put them pictures in my head.
- That's an assault on my imagination.
- What a horrible way to die.
Thousands of stingers stinging you.
Like secrets that don't sting once they keep stinging you until you're bloated and full of pus.
- Who wanted à la mode?
- Ah.
"Well, Kentucky was bloated and full of pus because she was sabotaging Betty's Bees."
"Kentucky had it in for Betty, but who had it in for Kentucky?"
The terrifying bee man.
What if he was made of bees?
That's why she couldn't see his face.
He didn't have one.
What if there's a whole bee-folk society who walk like people?
- You're thinking about how you can train bees to walk in people shapes?
- Yeah.
Ain't no bees walking around in no people shapes.
Kentucky was wiggity-wiggity-whacked.
- With a swarm of bees.
- Smells like an inside job.
Kentucky was talking to someone when Dusty was dropping eaves.
Someone who knew what she was doing and would wanna kill her for it.
"If it is an inside job, we gonna need an inside bee girl."
- No.
- We gotta tap this honey at the source.
Uh-huh.

"First, the Chinese character for Suzu has the symbol for metal."
"Even if she could remember, Grandma won't go to Hawaii."
I'm sure of it.
Why's that?
"Grandma doesn't like America, and it's only natural."
"After all, Grandpa was killed by the atomic bomb."
I think he's right.
"You see, none of us and none of our parents know about war."
As for the atomic bomb...
"Sure, we've all heard about it."
But it meant nothing more than a sort of little scary fairy tale.
We never really understood the feelings of the people... who had the atom bomb dropped over their heads.
We never stopped to think.
Look at my mother.
"Just by being told that there's a rich relative in Hawaii, she got excited."
Isn't it disgusting?
My father's no different.
He didn't even spend time with Grandma.
He took off for Hawaii in a hurry.
Big Sis!
"Here, eat these."
I'm really pleased... that you are so concerned about me.
I'm very grateful.
"But then, it was a long time ago when I felt bitter about America."
It's been more than 45 years since Grandpa died.
"Now, I don't particularly like... or dislike America."
It's all because of war.
War is to blame.
During the war many Japanese died... and many Americans also died.
Listen... because of a man called Suzujiro or whatever...
I don't think it's right for you to talk badly about your parents.
"Now I know you're looking at me like that's a punk move, but I ain't a punk, I'm a survivor."

I'm switching sides.
I'm just letting you know.
"He gonna be like, ""Everybody, get on the ground."""
"I'm gonna be like, ""Yeah, everybody get on the ground."""
"This is a stickup, bitch."""
'Cause I ain't no punk.
"I'm a survivor, you feel me?"
Even in my woman selection.
That's why I can never mess with somebody like Serena Williams.
Mm-mm.
"That's a big woman, ain't it?"
"She look like the type, as soon as you put your thing in her, she will clinch up every muscle in her body and just detach your penis, right?"
"Somehow suck it up all the way through her body and then spit it out in her hand like,"
"""Pfft, take your little dick back, nigga."""
And would have to sit there and then pick it up and walk off with it.
'Cause you ain't gonna fight her.
Look at her.
She's bigger than an Avatar.
She's humungous.
Mutombo wouldn't sleep with her.
He'd be like...
"""No, no, no, no."
"That bitch, not in my house, no, no, no, no."""
"Speaking of big stuff, I'm sorry, y'all."
I gotta get this out of my pocket.

I don't believe in God.
"It's just that he had this surprise for you, and I was going to take him out to tea, possibly the Kardomah, because he's been a help to me."
I've got this leg.
Lack of.
What surprise?
It's a photograph of Baker.
I took a little snap of him.
I borrowed a Box Brownie from a chap in my digs.
He didn't want you to think you had to buy the...
The big one because that's going to be sizeable.
"So I thought, after the recording, with it being your day off, we could get the photo, and then maybe go somewhere, as I say, like the Kardomah."
Have egg on toast or beans on toast or toast.
Make a day of it.
He's a good little lad.
You know he's saving up to buy you the record.
I don't suppose you want a cup of tea with a nonbeliever.
"Well, you believe in tea, and, to me, that's only just outside the Holy Trinity."
"Our Lord, Holy Spirit, Jesus, Tea."
Go left and cut through.
It saves you five minutes.
Much appreciated.
So we'll see him tomorrow on his correct tram at the correct time.
You will.
I'll see him off before work.

"Because--that's weird, I talked to Eddie, and he didn't mention anything about--about the other night."
"Wow, you're a terrible actor."
[clears throat] It was that bad?
"Yeah, I'm tempted to re-enter and let you try that again."
[laughs]
"What's with the book, man?"
"Cassie, I'm tired of living in a closet."
- [scoffs]
"- Not getting laid, not getting paid."
"I mean, I've been blind, and this book has given me sight, because if you can believe it, you can achieve it."
It's all in there.
- Wow.
"- Good heavens, a Thug pickaxe."
"It's incredible, but that's what happened to Markham."
"I'm afraid they've done away with poor Burgess, too."
There's been none of this for 50 years.
Thuggee.
"That's what it is, Mitchell."
"What's Thuggee, sir?"
A murder cult Col. Sleeman crushed 50 years ago.
The Thugs were the most fiendish band of killers that ever existed.
"There were at least 10,000 in India, and they murdered 30,000 people a year."
Thuggee was practiced from the Himalayas to Ceylon.
"The order was religious and worshipped Kali, the goddess of blood."
"The Thugs were stranglers, weren't they, sir?"
Stranglers.
They dug the graves of their victims in advance.
"Mitchell, we must stamp this out immediately."
The Lancers will scour the country west of Tantrapur...
- you will search the regions to the east.
- Right.
"- What do we do, sir?"
"- You're dismissed, Ballantine."
"MacChesney, you and Cutter will leave tomorrow with a stronger..."
"Ballantine, you're dismissed."
"You and Cutter will take a stronger detachment tomorrow... into Tantrapur, to finish your work."
Maj. Mitchell and I will be in close touch with you at all times on either flank.
Keep your eyes open for Thugs.
"Ballantine would be a great help, sir."
If I may remind you... the three of us have always brought off things very well together.
"Yes, sir."
He's indispensable.
Ballantine's leaving the service in six days.
He's getting married.
Huh?
- Roderick.
- Mr. Porter.
It is all part of the treatment.
"- Roderick, it's all right, it's all right."
Can I speak to my brother in private for a moment?
- I'll be right here if you need me.
"- Okay, thank you."
"Brother, do not worry."
Everything is fine.
"Wonderful, in fact."
Dr. Cairn made me understand that the root cause of my ailment is decadence.
"But I just feel so much more relaxed, and lighter even, just being around all these women who've truly embraced their healing."
"- Isabel, please!"
I can't follow a word you're saying.
"In fact, I think it'd be best if you came home."
- No.
I have to stay until I'm healed.
- Of what?
!
What sort of nonsense are they feeding you?
"- I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that you're afraid of what you don't understand, but I will not be leaving with you."
"Good day, brother."
- Isa...
- I'm afraid it's gonna be a while before Isabel's ready to receive another visit.
- That is not for you to decide.
"- Mr. Porter, visits are made at the discretion of our patients."
So we will let you know the next time your presence is requested here at Rosewood.
"Good day, Mr. Porter."
"""Detective Thomas..."
"""I implore you to consider an investigation into Rosewood."""
- I'm going to put you in restraints.
- No.
- Near Cherry Point.
It's like a military base.
"I went there 'cause I wanted to save my money to get a Hobie Cat, a boat."
Do you ever go sailing or anything like that?
- No.
- Do you know anything about--
"Well, you're sensitive."
"I bet you want to stay out of the sun, right?"
"You probably frizzle, you burn, you know?"
"Ha, look at that, you're smiling!"
Look at that smile.
"See, you use every muscle in your face when you smile."
You're all sad sack.
You know?
Can I get you a drink?
Maybe that'll cheer you up.
Then I can prove to you how good Iâm gonna be at this job.
"- Listen, Mora, can I have your phone number?"
Maybe I'll call you when--
- Oh!
My phone number?
"- I mean, just so I can call you when we figure out what we're doing, 'cause Iâm not sure what we're doing."
"- Okay, Iâm gonna give you a phone number."
"I don't really have a phone, but I know this guy--"
It's a long story.
"It's this guy I dated for a long time, he was actually an alcoholic and gay and he came to my house and he drank all the sangria and then I had this watermelon and he picked it up and he threw it on the floor"
and then he wet my bed.
"I dated him for two years, it took me five to get over him, but I'm gonna give you his number."
He'll call you.
"Ugh, he was a Sagittarius."
"You know, they say if you look at something green for ten minutes every day, it's supposed to cheer you up."
"I told you, guys."
He's been watchin High School Musical over and over again.
"Actually, this is High School Musical 2."
It has a dance-along part.
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
"Yeah, look at yourself, man!"
"Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not."
"You know what, at least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect!"
At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave in to peer pressure and start doing musicals!
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes!
Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
"That's enough, you guys, it's not cool."
"Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be--"
"You shouldn't rip on kids with diabetes, that's not cool."
I'm Scott Malkinson.
"Look, guys, the world is changing."
"We can't fight it, we have to change with it."
"I've been watching these movies and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school."
"And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and be individuals, then think about this-- right now, everyone thinks Butters... is way cooler than any of you."
"That's a low blow, Stan."
"Third team foul on West Jeff Bobcats, m'kay."
Ball goes back over to the Cows.
"All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon?"
!
"I'm ready, coach."
Give em' hell!
Just a minute to go in the first quarter.

Clumsy me.
"But I didn't send anyone after the boy,"
Tendu.
Neither did the people I work for.
They don't even know his name.
GREGSON:
"You had motive, and we have reason to believe that Tendu uncovered the names of all your bosses."
He threatened to expose all of you.
"He did, but he also offered me a deal, which I took."
He's a nice boy.
And I was happy for Libena.
She found her Richard Gere.
"Girls from poor cities, broken homes, they get into the trade because they want to escape, make some money, and someday live the dream."
"Meet a wonderful man, fall in love, live happily ever after, like Julia Roberts from the movie."
"For most of us, there is no Richard Gere."
It's a fantasy.
"Libena and the boy seemed to be in love, and he offered to pay off her debt, so I gave them their chance at the fairy tale."
And then what?
"You figured if Tendu was able to identify you and the agency's owners, other people could, too?"
You burned down your office to cover your tracks?
"$100,000 is more than enough to replace some old computers and open a new office."
GREGSON:
Tendu said he was gonna pay you a hundred thou?
He didn't say he would do it.
He did it.
Paid me on the spot.
In cash?
Brand new hundred dollar bills.
Joey Ng told us he hadn't given Tendu any money.
Did he say where he got it?
"Mm, sorry."
"When someone hands me money, I don't ask where it came from."
The place is clean:
Did you check the reactors for any unusual devices?
"Yes, sir:"
Swept them with the magnetometer:
Everything's normal:
Looks like your hunch was wrong:
"Yeah, yeah:"
"Well, thank you, Parsons:"
You better stay here and keep an eye on things:
"Yes, sir:"
Let's go:
Where to now?
I don't know:
Looks like we struck a dead end:
Colonel Deering:
Captain Rogers:!
I just searched the supply room:
It was Reardon:
He changed himself to look like Parsons:
It's locked:
Stand back:
"Reardon, we know you're in here:"
You might as well show yourself and surrender:
"Hawk, you see anything?"
"Nothing, Buck:"
It appears as though Reardon has left the reactor room:
- But how?
- Perhaps through another door:
"What do you mean, another door?"
You know as well as I do there's only one way out of this reactor room:
Buck?
Where's that detonator?
That Louie Farrakhan.
"No, not Louie Farrakhan."
Louie Kahn.
Louie Kahn.
"Yeah, you're the son of Kahn?"
Nice to meet you.
"Your father, is he alive?"
"No, he's been dead for 25 years."
We are very pleased to welcome you.
"The parliament building and capital complex took 23 years to build, the same as the Taj Mahal."
"It was all done by hand, thousands of workers carrying baskets of concrete on their heads, climbing up and down bamboo scaffolding."
"During Bangladesh's war for independence from Pakistan in 1971, the enemy pilots didn't bother bombing it, because they thought it was an ancient ruin."
"The complex was finally finished in 1983, nine years after Lou died in Penn Station."
"He never saw it finished, Bob."
- He didn't?
- No.
He never saw this.
Just taking pictures?
"Yeah, we've been here now for about five days, and... it's..."
- Five days?
- Yeah.
"That's a lot of pictures, then."
"But do you think they'll really capture the quality of this building in terms of space, light, the volumes, and the layering of his spaces, those ambiguities?"
"Well, I don't know, Mr. Wares."
"When you think about this film,"
I probably have at the most ten minutes.
"Oh, God, this is... this is... don't tell me that."
- Ten minutes for this building?
- Probably.
I see;
I think it's...
"I think it's... the whole thing is very... very useless, because you cannot treat this building like this."
It is like they are breathing
Is not it?
They are enlivening your yard my Paşa
So Bali Bey
Is Matrakçı keeping you good company?
"Thanks, he is very good"
But he is not like the Matrakçı I heard about
I'm asking but he doesn't answer
Obviously a woman hurted him badly
History bothers everyone
Time is the medicine of any kind of wound
I don't mean to bother you my Paşa.
But you should know that the poets speak ill of you
What do they say?
They say you set icons up
Then let's visit the poets together some time
Let's have a chat
Let's see what they'll say
Be careful!
I'll kill even if it is damaged slightly
Sultan Süleyman Khan his Highness sent you this table as a gift
How nice
What are these?
"They are called "" çini "" They are all painted and roasted"
It requires a big effor and mastership to get these colors
It is the most beautiful blue I've ever seen
Were his eyes that blue too?
What are you saying?
Pardon me my princess
But he is not a rude man as you think
He had a table made specially for you
Are you ready?
"- I'm pregnant, David."
"Jesus Christ, Alice."
I want to have this baby.
Alice ...
"Of course we will, Alice."
What about work and money?
I do not know.
"We can move the country, so I can grow carrots."
- You are not afraid?
- I'm scared to death.
"But you'll be a mom, Alice."
"Look at us, Daddy."
- Wettie Betty.
- Bad Dog.

JEANNE:
Peace.
"Long ago, before The Founders established this great city of ours, that word was all but meaningless."
An ideal as elusive as a dream.
"Now, 200 years later, we are, all of us, living proof that peace is indeed attainable."
"The reason for this is, of course, our Faction System."
"Erudite, Dauntless, Amity, Candor, Abnegation."
"In dividing people according to personality and aptitude, we've created a society in which each faction plays a critical role in maintaining the social order."
But this harmony we've achieved is now under attack from a small but extremely dangerous group
-of individuals.
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
We call them Divergents.
"They are, in essence, the worst of what humanity used to be."
"Rebellious, defiant and uncontrollable."
"Five days ago, a rogue group of Divergents, posing as Dauntless brutally invaded Abnegation."
-=The events depicted in this drama are fictitious.
"Any similarity to any person, institutions or events is merely coincidental.=-"
This is the story of your real father.
He shielded me from a bullet.
"The only reason why I have lived till now, is just to take revenge on them."
Let me take revenge.
I want to change.
This is my destiny.
"Finally, you have succeeded."
MIT has invited you over.
- MIT has invited you over.
-=MIT:
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.= =MIT:

"Starting from today, you are a Texas-born American citizen."
"Lee Yun Seong is your identity, and your English name is John Lee."
This is your passport and your identity card.
It looks just like the real thing.
It is real.
Think like that.
Always remember these three points.
"From now on, you must forget your old identity."
Live as your new identity.
Don't trust anyone.
And don't fall in love with anyone.
"If your true identity is revealed, the people that you know will be covered in blood."
"-=7 years later, Republic of South Korea=-"
Don't trust anyone.
And don't fall in love.
"If your identity is revealed, the people that you know will be covered in blood."
"His condition is getting worse, with pulmonary infection."
Then again you might not.
(Phone ringing)
Charlie?
I thought they'd have told you not to speak to me.
Superintendent Bailey's not going to be amused.
"Yes, well it's not the first time"
"I've disobeyed an order to get to the truth and that's what you're going to tell me, the bloody truth."
The King case is down to two conflicting sightings.
"One from his mate, a thief."
The second from a thief who wasn't his mate.
There's a bigger smell.
I know what Michael King was.
Can you remember a single thing that said
King did not kill Harriet Barr?
I mean have you got James Barr confessing to it?
"They've had a word with George Ayre, at Strangeways."
The same George Ayre you couldn't place
last time I mentioned him.
It was his evidence that sent Michael King down and he's sticking to his story.
Why shouldn't he?
Charlie that Ms. Bailey is a clever detective.
"She's had a word with George's missus, of course she thinks very highly of you."
"She told her you often slip her fifty quid you know, just to help out."
You run a pension fund for all your old grasses?
George did me some favors.
Oh yeah.
"Charlie, do you know something?"
You were the one man who persuaded me that this job was worth doing.
"And when crap piles up,"
I remember what it's like to work with a real copper.
I respected you too much then so smell a fit up.
But I certainly smell one now.
"So it has to be perfect, you see."
It has to be perfect.
It can't be impatient.
It's timeless.
I wanted to ask you.
Do you think-- did anybody know that Lou had three families all at once?
"No, I didn't."
"As a matter of fact, for years, I didn't know Lou was married."
Really?
Yeah.
That was part of his mystery.
[soft piano music]
(Kahn) My mother and I lived on the outskirts of Philadelphia at the end of a secluded road.
"Lou would visit every once in a while, mostly at night."
We never knew quite when it would be.
He'd call at the last minu te and say he was on his way.
My mother would frantically whip up a five-course meal and have a martini in a frozen glass waiting for him.
"I got to stay up late, and Lou would tell me wonderful stories about India and elephants and tigers."
[thunder crackling softly]
"In the middle of the night, we'd all bundle into the car and drive him back downtown."
I'd lie in the backseat.
We were all silent.
"When I asked my ldn't all live together, she explained that his wife wouldn't give him a divorce."
Why didn't he just run away?
We'd stop at the end of Clinton Street and let him out.
"He'd walk down the block and disappear into the dark house, his wife"
Her name was Esther.
"They had a daughter named Sue, who was 20 years older than me."
"When I was in first grade,"
"I found out I had another half sister, Alex."
Her mother was a lady named Anne.
Then there was my mother and me.
"Beth, last night I came over here because you were upset about receiving a letter and a couple of phone calls."
You thought it was a man on the phone.
The letter was typed and it was unsigned.
"But in plain nasty language, they all said the same thing:"
"""Stop trying to bleed me or else."""
I-
- I shouldn't have called you.
I was scared.
- But it wasn't that important.
- Yes it was.
Obviously someone thinks you're a blackmailer.
"Now you did remember that the man used the word ""office."""
"And until last year, your whole life has been tied up in your job with Devro  Banks."
Since then Lita Krail has had that job.
"Well, this morning I sent Paul Drake out to talk with Lita before she went to work."
"But now, you see, Lita's dead and so everything's different."
- [Beth] Thank you.
- [lighter flicks]
Why did you leave your job?
Was it because Jess Devro died?
Yes.
I mean no.
"You see, Sandy'd been after me ever since we were married two years ago."
He couldn't stand it that I had a more important position in the firm than he did.
Did he ask you to give up all your old friends?
"You know, your marriage kind of came as a surprise."
I know that Jess was surprised.
"He always thought-- well, frankly, he thought that you cared for someone else."
"Perry, stop it."
"If I'm unhappy, or even if you think I've made mistakes, it's still my business, isn't it?"
"I'm responsible, so please just leave me alone."
"Beth, a murder has been committed."
Look.
Lowen are a kind of lion.
Look at the picture here.
"Juliette, I mean, I'm not making this up."
I mean these lowen were running an illegal fight ring that dates back to the time of the gladiators.
They were fighting with these.
Ancient weapons.
This is a morning star.
There's a rifle in here that shoots special bullets to kill Siegbarstes.
"But first, you have to dip them in this stuff here."
This stuff right here.
Siegbarste gift.
Gift means poison in German.
The point is I can see these Wesen in what you would see as a perfectly normal person.
"When they go through something called the woge, which is kind of like this emotional surge, that's when I can see them."
"I know how this must sound, but I swear to God, it's all true."
"Look, you want to see who Adalind really is?"
"This is what Adalind really is, a hexenbiest."
"Juliette, you got to read some of this stuff."
"I mean, the stuff's that's in English because most of it's in German."
"And there's actually some of it in French,"
"Spanish, and even Latin."
"Oh, there's some of it in Japanese."
"They all look like stories you'd read in a book, but they're not."
They're real.
There are things in this trailer that you can't believe.
Ah...
Cameras.
And film of Hitler and the Verrat shooting people in 1936.
"The Verrat worked with the seven royal families, which I'm just beginning to learn about."
"Juliette, I can't tell you how it all fits together."
Even my parents were killed because of this.
You know what you have to do.
Let's have a final check.
Which of you are buying tickets to Allatoona?
Kingston?
Calhoun?
Resaca?
And Chattanooga?
Good.
That way it won't appear we're traveling together.
"Knight, Brown and Alf Wilson, sit close to me."
One last thing:
"When the train stops at Big Shanty for breakfast, keep your seats till I give you the signal."
"Good luck, gentlemen."
- Mr. Andrews?
- Mr. Ross?
"After you outlined the plan last night, Bill Campbell and I got to talking it over."
"Tearing up the track behind us and burning the bridges all makes sense, but why steal the train at Big Shanty?"
It's a breakfast stop for the crew as well as the passengers.
"There's no telegraph there, either."
"There's a Confederate camp with 4,000 men."
Must we steal an engine in full view of the Southern army?
Know any place they won't suspect it?
Yes.
Any deserted part of the track north of this town.
- [Andrews] That'd mean a fight.
- What's the matter with a fight?
- You never know how it'll come out.
- I know how I'm coming out.
I've had a bellyful of this bowing' and scrapin' and sweet-talking every loudmouth Sesech in the state of Georgia.
"If you want to capture this train in a fair fight, you can count on me."
"If you don't, I ain't going."
"Mr. Campbell, your company commander said you'd be worth ten in a fight."
See where you can run to
who are you?
I am one who hates being aroused from sleep
Old lady Jin Hwa
So you are the old witch who killed 68 men in Lin Jiang restaurant in one night
You want to die?
You again
I wanted to kill those who woke me up but ended up saving you fool
"Thanks, I'll repay you someday wait"
"Chu Er, you must be bored being alone here"
I'll let him stay to serve you
"I have to go, you stay and practise with her"
I want you to catch 1 0 poisonous spiders for her daily
Hear that?
"Sorry, but I have to go"
I have to see my grand teacher because I only have two more years to live if I don't return I won't see him again
I don't care you have to stay here
"Chu Er, practise hard when I get the sword I'll return to you"
Okay
Granny
"Miss, I have some business"
I can't accompany you
"when I say you can't go, you can't what's your name?"
Let go
You call Ah Niu?
"Let me go, alright?"
what?
You were a cow herd
why do you bite me?
Get lost
It's painful
Do you have any pain killer?
I know.
"They should stop that, by the way."
How long had you been in a relationship with the man?
I did know him.
"""I did know him"" - that's awesome!"
Had you gone to Vegas with him?
Yeah.
"If you want a divorce, do you have to do it through the States or can you come back and stand in a court in England and go,"
"""I was dressed as Elvis and he was dressed as..."""
The first thing I did when I filed for divorce was I made my lawyers check that I was married.
That really fucked him off.
Because I didn't believe that you could get married so quickly.
It took about three minutes.
"Oh, yeah - it's Vegas, baby!"
I perform in Vegas only once a year and I got to know the lady that owns the Little White Wedding Chapel and she's owned it for 50 years and she is a nut.
I love her and it's crazy.
It's 24 hours a day they're open.
They never close.
They always have at least two Elvises on duty ready to marry you.
Right?
Classic Vegas bit.
Did you get married by an Elvis?
"No, I was married by a man called the Reverend Wayne Splendid."
Of course you were!
Reverend Splendid.
You knew it was true love right there.
It sounds really bad when you say it.
Have you met Father Extraordinary?
I actually don't think it matters whether you got married in three minutes or whether you got married in...
"You did the whole thing where you got engaged and announced it and then you go through, like, two years of pissing everyone off with your John Lewis list."
I don't think it matters.
You would say that.
You couldn't be more wrong if you do.
"On that very battle, defied his command despite the fact that he is my direct superior."
"It was to follow High Commander Won, of course."
"For it, I was made to suffer intolerable humiliation before my own men."
But I have no bitterness or resentment for my superior.
"In fact, I am still ashamed of what I have done."
"If we had fought High Commander Won's way, the Chosun Navy would've suffered a major loss."
High Commander of Left Cholla Navy is not a very clever man.
He is not selfish enough to harm another person for his own honor.
But there is one thing that he does desire.
"And for that one thing, he will not stop fighting until his bones turn to ashes."
Do you know what that is?
It is the safety of this country.
He cannot let go of his extreme loyalty to repay the kingdom.
Do not doubt him.
Extend your hand to him.
It is not his burden alone to repay the kingdom with loyalty.
Captain...
"""Extreme loyalty to repay the kingdom..."""
"Constable Kwon, what are you doing here?"
Sir...
Captain Chung brought me a sword.
What have you brought me?
Sir...?
High Commander.
Commander of Bang-dap Yi Soon-shin requests to see you.
Do you think High Commander Yi sent them?
"Sir, I believe they were sent by those much more powerful than High"
Commander Yi...
"or the King, for that matter."
The people of Chosun.
"Help them, High Commander."
You mean eating is your only concern?
But you can't get away that easy.
"Tomorrow, we go shopping in Nagasaki."
"- And you're coming, too, Shinjiro."
- Count me out.
I have the big project to convince Grandma to take us all to Hawaii with her.
Yeah!
That's the grand theme for this summer vacation!
We shall all go to Hawaii!
Absolutely!
Let's all hold out!
Fate is knocking at the door.
Under this beautiful town of Nagasaki... there is another Nagasaki that vanished with one atomic bomb.
Didn't Grandpa die in the Nagasaki atom bombing?
- Yes.
- How come Grandma was safe?
"She was at the house, behind the mountain, 10 kilometers away from the blast center."
But she told me that her hair was a result of the atom bomb.
"That's because Grandma came to Nagasaki on that day, looking for Grandpa."
The school where Grandpa was teaching was close to the blast center.
And did she find Grandpa?
"The school building was crushed flat and burned, and full of charred bodies."
It was impossible to identify which one of them was Grandpa.
Do you want to go to the school?
"You know, Grandma was also a teacher at this school."
She quit when she married Grandpa.
"She sure was lucky, wasn't she?"
I don't know about that.
"When Grandpa died, our father was still a baby... and Grandma was carrying Minako's mother in her belly."
Being left alone...
I bet it must have been very hard on Grandma.
"Still... even though no one ever found Grandpa... he's here, I'm sure."
"I miss them, too."
"Ms. Ross, Ms. Ross, what can you tell us about the recent rash of home invasion murders?"
"Well, our community has healing to do."
It's gonna take hard work and time to fix.
"It won't be easy, you stupid bitch!"
But together...
Healing?
"I know, right?"
She doesn't have what it takes.
"We are under siege here, and what is she gonna do?"
!
"What have you got, Garcia?"
"Sir, I found the connection between the Mills family and Clark Preston."
"10 years ago, the Mills were the victims of a home invasion."
"Robert Mills, the father, and 10-year-old Julie were killed."
"Pamela was raped, and now she has a lot of brain damage that has left her in a near vegetative state."
What about Trevor?
Mom!
"He hid in the closet, and when it was over, he called 911."
That's why he stuffed that boy in the closet.
He was reliving his own victimization.
He didn't do that to th other children he murdered because he didn't relate to them.
"Garcia, was anybody convicted of the crime?"
Yes.
A Ronnie Green and Carlos Jackson.
"They're both African American, both serving life in Folsom."
"And then after the murders,"
"Preston, he financially supported the family almost entirely."
So they're close.

But... you said yourself that we have come to the end of the road.
I don't care about the road.
What if I just came for you?
No.
I mean... it doesn't work like that.
"Well, it may not."
But the thought of not seeing you every day is not something I'm ready to accept just now.
"So, what if I keep coming here... because we love each other?"

"You know, we came here-- all of us-- came here with this sense of putting a stamp to the story."
"Then, I think, you and I specifically, we came here with the quest."

I'm toying with the notion of either going to the Edgar Allan Poe Shadow Puppet Theater or the reenactment of the 19th century Phantasmagoria.
- I don't want to know.

"Before Arthur can graduate, he must pass summer school."
"And for the first time in three years, Shannon isn't there with him."
"The other country, of course, we said- he thought he could sell drugs and don't get caught,you know."
But he found out the hard way.
"And I told him, while he was doing all that -"
I wasn't hanging with Shannon then.
"I was like, man, ""Shannon, you should stop, man."
"Stop doing that stuff. """
We always said we weren't gonna never do no stufflike that.
We werejust gonna go on and graduate and go on to college.
"But,you know, he had to be the one."
"One week before his graduation, Arthur is robbed at gunpoint."
At first I thought he was gonna shoot me because I didn't have no money.
"'Cause he kept asking me, ""You got - You got some money."
"Where your wallet at?"""
"Be like, ""What you driving a car like this for?"""
"I was, like, ""I ain't got no wallet. """
"And then,you know, he grabbed me and stuff,and I was- and I was about to panic and stuff, and I just calmed down."
I sit down and had a long talk with him and his sister.
Someone pulled a pistol on her right down the street from the house.
"I said, ""Do you all understand what is going on out here in these streets today?"
"'"""
"Even with me, when I was out there - you know, out there strung out - you know, I looked for somebody that seemed like they had something."

Why is she here?

Here is the parcel
Said she is a vegetarian and is now buying biriyani?
Go away It is nothing
What is she carrying in the bag?
Could be vegetable
"Why does the dog sniff, if it is vegetable?"
It must be meat
They are pure vegetarians
I have bought the milk cakes
Come upstairs with the water bottle
OK Sister
Did you hear?
It is milk cake
"Idiot, is milk cake available at the biriyani shop?"
I got the leg
One leg for you and one for me
Don't shout
In case mom watches us we may have to enact a weeping
Eat silently
See they are smashing chicken thighs
"I told you, did you believe me?"
"It's our house, how could you come upstairs?"
I will shout
Let your mom come over here
Let her know about the chicken biriyani secrets
Will you eat only the leg piece?
Thought it was impossible for mere children to move Grandma.
Grandma said she'd go right after holding a memorial service for Grandpa.
Did you write that in the telegram?
"Yes, he did."
August 9 is the day Grandpa died because of the atom bomb.
She'II go after the memorial service on that day.
That's not advisable.
"If clark reads that telegram, it's going to be pretty awkward, isn't it?"
Why do you say that?
Why?
Because clark is an American.
"And after he finds out that Grandpa was killed by the atom bomb... of course, it will make him feel pretty awkward."
We've got trouble.
"Father, you mean that you went there... and didn't tell Suzujiro and clark and his family about Grandpa?"
Of course not.
It is something that is not necessary to mention.
It's Father!
Sam and Mother!
Thanks... for all your trouble.
"I'II bet it was some trip for you, too."
Machino told me that you were coming straight here.
"Since I haven't seen Grandma for some time, I decided to come and pay a visit."
Me too.
I've been having Grandma look after my kids all this time.
So I must see her and thank her.
"By the way, how was it in Hawaii?"
"I made a little inquiry and found out... that the pineapple farm is considerably large... and the canning factory that goes with it, too."
"And tell me, Suzujiro's house, I hear it's just like a castle."
Is it?
Mother... you have come here to see Grandma.
Why don't you ask about her?
"Tonight's dinner was quite a spread, but it wasn't enjoyable, was it?"
"""...tomorrow-That means, today here our good fortune is coming."""
"""But how?"
"-He said, there is a old banyan tree near a pond..."""
"""...in this forest."
"At that place, after 5 hours of the day are..."""
"""...over, some miracle is going to happen for both of us."""
"""Brother, you have believed that sage."""
"""l had to."
"Now I believe more, as he said that my brother will..."""
...not believe in me and laugh at me.
But truth is very strong
"""See, one miracle has happened."
"Now you go here, I will go..."""
...and see the miracle of the tree.
What beautiful flowers are there?
What a beauty and what fragrance?
"""Friend, we can see the beauty and can't feel the fragrance"""

I don't want to argue with you Devi Anshumali.
"""Not Anshumali, Anshumati"

"-And you're coming, too, Shinjiro."

Yeah!
That's the grand theme for this summer vacation!
We shall all go to Hawaii!

Let's all hold out!
Fate is knocking at the door.
Under this beautiful town of Nagasaki... there is another Nagasaki that vanished with one atomic bomb.
Didn't Grandpa die in the Nagasaki atom bombing?
-Yes.
-How come Grandma was safe?
"She was at the house, behind the mountain, 10 kilometers away from the blast center."
But she told me that her hair was a result of the atom bomb.
"That's because Grandma came to Nagasaki on that day, looking for Grandpa."
The school where Grandpa was teaching was close to the blast center.
And did she find Grandpa?
"The school building was crushed flat and burned, and full of charred bodies."
It was impossible to identify which one of them was Grandpa.
Do you want to go to the school?
"You know, Grandma was also a teacher at this school."
She quit when she married Grandpa.
"She sure was lucky, wasn't she?"
I don't know about that.
"When Grandpa died, our father was still a baby... and Grandma was carrying Minako's mother in her belly."
Being left alone...
I bet it must have been very hard on Grandma.
"still... even though no one ever found Grandpa... he's here, I'm sure."
"That day, we went around the town of Nagasaki... because we wanted to know a Iot more about the atomic bomb."
"Even though the atomic bomb was dropped, this survived?"
"No, it was rebuilt."
But perhaps the most startling element of this bizarre case is that the most tragic victim may be the killer herself.
"That's right, the killer is a woman -"
Annabella Wilgis.
"She's joined here tonight by her attorney, Darren Russem."
Mr Russem?
The murders result from the illness from which Miss Wilgis suffers -
"Multiple Personality Disorder, which in turn was caused by abuse and abandonment exacted on her in her early childhood."
"By having her confess and tell her side of the story first, he's defining the issues before we get to court."
"This isn't about murder anymore, it's about abuse, about psychology."
Why don't we appoint Ricki Lake and Phil Donahue to the supreme court?
He forced me.
He made me do things...
"horrible things, and if I didn't do them, he hit me with his belt all over."

We might as well tattoo 'helpless victim' to her forehead.
I would look at a crucifix the whole time that he was hurting me.
Miss Wilgis is here asking for help and understanding.
I'm truly sorry for what I did.
Did you murder Katherine Goodrich?
Yes.
- And Jennifer Lundy?
- Yes.
- And Marilyn Callisto?
- Yes.
- And Mary Ann Newcomb?
- Yes.
"She has presence, you gotta admit it."
She knows exactly what she did.
"From day one, she knew what she was doing."
So what's that - premeditated craziness?
She is great looking.

The fact they come from the 25th century doesn't particularly shock the old man.

The search of the mysterious Beisovice fishing lake reveals nothing new either.

Pistol belong to Mr Malhotra.
Bullet and guns matches
We got gun powder traces.
Location of gun power is bullet is correct
Unless Mr Malhotra knew it his life is in danger
Thats why he called us here in Samos and his 4 guests whom he blamed
is he a murderer?
If its true than his career will be finished
His name must be on all the wanted list of the world
After knowing that truth does he really hates him that he killed him
He will get all the property lt was it Mr Malhotra's will
But we found his will burned in dust bin
Where is that proof of which Mr Malhotra discussed?
Why Mr Malhotra commit suicide?

He actually was the cat in the studio that was making that stuff sound like that.

Write the songs and then make people love 'em and go buy 'em.
And he was a master at it.
"Okay, ladies."
I don't think you ought to make that in the middle of that.
I think you should wait till the verse comes up.
"There's certain things you could tell that's an ""Allen thing."""
One of my favorite songs is a song called
"""Street Parade"" by Earl King, with the Meters playing, Earl King is singing."
Allen wrote the horn parts.
I don't think they repeat themselves the whole time.
These horn parts never repeat.
"Why would you do that, you know?"
It's the only song like that I've ever heard.

"He lives in the States, he doesn't really play in Britain very often."
"And then like a week before we were supposed to go, he cancelled."
"He fired his support act and said, ""I'm not doing the show."""
"But we still had, you know, flights and everything, and a hotel, so we decided to fly anyway and have a four-day holiday."
"And then his other support act put a message out on YouTube, saying,"
"""Hey, everyone."
I know Morrissey can't do it
"""and I'm really sad that that's the case,"
"""but I'm going to put on a concert anyway for free."
"""Anyone who's got a ticket can come and see me do a little concert"
"""at the Gramercy Theatre in Manhattan."""
And his support act was Cliff Richard.
So I was left with a dilemma as to...
Is this a dream you had?
No!
LAUGHTER
"Basically, for my wife's 30th, we flew thousands of miles to see someone we actively dislike doing a show."
"And I don't know, have any of you seen Cliff work?"
But it's the cheesiest show.
He has his manager come out and it's like panto.
It really is like bizarre panto.
"He says, ""OK, everybody, in a second I'm going to say,"
"""'Welcome to the stage, Cliff Richard,' and you're going to cheer."
"""And we're going to do it three times before he comes out."
"""So, welcome to the stage, Cliff Richard..."
Tch.
"""Well, that was quite good, but we can do a little better..."
"""Welcome to the stage, Cliff Richard..."
Tch.
"""Well, that was quite good, but we can do a little better..."
"""Welcome to the stage..."" Then Cliff pushes him out the way and goes,"
"# ""We're all going on a summer..."" # It's mental!"
"Well, Merle was annoyed because Olivia objected to the elopement, if that's what you mean."
"Wasn't she more than annoyed, Mr. Kirk?"
Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that she was fighting mad?
She was angry.
Perhaps the degree of her irritation could be estimated if you would tell us what the defendant shouted at her aunt.
She said--
"Yes, Mr. Kirk?"
"Well, she said, ""If you try to stop me, I'll kill you."""
Your witness.
"Mr. Kirk, when the bulk of your grandmother's estate was left to your cousin Miss Telford, were you annoyed, irritated, perhaps even angry?"
"Furious, I think, would be the best description."
But I recovered nicely in time.
You were on good terms with your cousin?
As much as Olivia would permit.
"One night, Merle walked in her sleep and came directly toward my house."
"Subconsciously, she preferred me to Olivia--"
"Objection, Your Honor."
The witness has previously testified to having had no training in psychiatry.
Sustained.
Let us turn now to the night of the party.
Where were you at the approximate time the murder occurred?
"Well, in the living room, for one thing, looking out into the garden."
Is there anyone who can verify that?
Yes.
Mr. Paul Drake.
"He asked if I knew where he could find Danny Pierce, and I asked him if he'd seen Margo Stevens."
I'm sure he'd recall the conversation.
"Mr. Kirk, since you were looking out into the garden, perhaps you saw Howard Langley out there."
"Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I did."
That's why I asked Drake about Margo Stevens.
They were necking in the bushes.
That's a lie!
I'm thinking that's what made the bruise on Vince Nelson's throat.
"So the father was snooping on the son's computer, saw an e-mail from Coach Nelson..."
- Assumed Nelson sent it.
- And confronted him.
"The problem is, in order for Johnny Holt's blood to get on Sheridan' baton, they would have to have contact at some point."
"Right, and that blood is more than three months old, and Holt was still in prison."
Let's check it.
Prison transfer log from Sing Sing.
"Here we go, three months ago Holt was taken from Sing Sing to Manhattan Superior Court."
For one day to testify as a witness in a trial.
There must've been some sort of altercation in that courthouse.
That would explain how Holt's blood got on Sheridan's baton.
"All right, let's go."
"Move it, scumbag."
Time to get a warrant to search Alex Sheridan's house.
Kyle's whole life was wrestling.
He was 14 when he made the team.
That was the happiest day of his life.
"Gave him confidence, discipline, a sense of belonging..."
I wanted to pin a medal on Coach Nelson.
"But when I saw that e-mail, those disgusting photos..."
That knocked the breath right out of me.
I picked up the phone and told him I was going to notify the school the very next morning.
So Nelson came to your house to try to settle things in person.
"Yeah, except all he did was deny it; said he'd never seen the photos, had no idea where they came from."
"See, no one is guilty these days."
Everyone's an innocent victim.
I was not about to let my son become a victim.
I fought back.
So what was I going to do?
Get 25 to life for killing that son of a bitch?
I see these perverts every day.
"Hello, Mr Hatem... these tenants are unbelievable"
Someone went up in the lift and left the door open
Who's this?
"Zaki Pasha, irresponsibility is normal these days"
I know... who's this?
- He's with me
"- Oh, he's with you but he's strong..."
he's with you
Why don't you go up and bring the lift down?
- When Mr Hatem tells me to
"- Oh, when he tells you to"
Tell him to go bring the lift down
"Don't worry, nothing will happen to him"
"Enough, Pasha"
"- Go up, Abd Rabbu"
"- Go up, Abd Rabbu"
Wow!
Did you see him?
"He went up so fast, He ran up"
He's like a tiger
He's very strong
You're a decent guy and you deserve good things
"You'll have a nice night, Mr Hatem"
"That's how nights are, they are nice to some people... and crappy to others"
Come in
Are you shy?
Is that man a real Pasha or a fake one?
"No, his father was a real Pasha and became minister a couple of times in the past"
- What does he do?
- Nothing
"He lives off of some properties he inherited, always been a loser"
"A relic, like you just saw"

A mother tried to kill her two daughters with prescription drugs.
Mrs Cárdehas reports from Mexico this is the second case in less than a month.
"Hey, Beto!"
"- Hello, beautiful!"
...some good Samaritans had to help her to get out of the vehicle because she was hurt...
"Some gangsters were about to die at the hands of an enraged crowd in Guatemala, the criminals, as you can see, were whipped and walked almost naked on the streets as punishment."
They were found guilty of extortion and robberies policemen and soldiers rescued them before they were killed.
A substitute teacher gave a hard punishment to a twelve-year-old boy...

There is a new police operation against prostitutes and drug addicts in Peru many of those arrested are teenagers who inhale glue...
"Ready, Madam."
"Thank you, Guille, see you next week."
- Where are we going?
- To see Beto.
"- Good morning, Beto."
"- Good morning, Madam."
- Open the curtains.
"- Yes, Madam."
Remember on Friday some people are coming to see the house.
"Yes, Madam, I will be here."
"Here, Beto, these are from last month."
"Thanks, I didn't have anything to read."
Trick or treat?
I didn't realize it was Halloween.
I don't have any candy but do you want to see a real monster?
Violence in Bangladesh left 50 people injured...
Demonstrators demanding electoral reform were evacuated with tear gas and beaten by the police.
"When I was a kid, the French Quarter was kind of off-limits to people like me."
"This was 1961, so this was the segregated South, you know?"
Mr. Jaffe integrated things long before anybody else thought about it.
This was one of the few places where black and white people would come together to listen to music.
It was the only place.
It was the place.
And my parents risked a lot by being open about it...
Their policies...
And outspoken about it.
Yeah.
It was very difficult to hear New Orleans jazz in New Orleans a few years ago.
So we rented an old art gallery and began Preservation Hall.
Both of your parents took the responsibility?
"Yeah, well, my mom was like the bouncer."
"She sat at the gate all night collecting money and like, deciding on who would get in and who wouldn't, because people would be rowdy."
And my dad was the guy who was going around town locating musicians and putting the bands together and kind of keeping the place physically in shape.
"People are sitting on wooden benches, sitting on the floor."
There's no drinks.
"Pretty hot in here, too, in the summer."
People come to hear the music.
People hear it.
That music was dying.
"You know, trad jazz like that was dying."
Ben's dad bought that place and started putting on those...
They were performing for tourists.
"People that came to New Orleans expecting to hear jazz and they couldn't find it anywhere, they could find it at Pres."
Hall.
Preservation Hall...
Now that's where you'll find all the greats.
"And when I was a teenager, the ones that's still alive?"
That's where they're playing now.
"And that's where all the people all over the world the minute they hit New Orleans, the first place they want to know..."
That was two years ago!
"The thing that I think is great about ""Doctor Who"" is that, over the years, the women have always been really smart, you know?"
"They've never been horrible depictions of femininity, they've always been really strong."
"In this 2-part episode,"
"""Human Nature"" and ""The Family of Blood,"""
"the Doctor has to take on human form and not realize that he's the Doctor and, of course, he falls in love with this incredible woman called Joan Redfern."
"Joan, lovely Joan."
What I like about her -- she's just a very normal lady and someone who's quite sensitive.
"""Joan."" Joan?"
That's my name.
"Well, obviously."
Everything has to be done in the right way.
She doesn't want to be seen to be being unseemly.
"I thinks he's so sympathetic and she's so beautiful, like, there's so much humanity to that portrayal."
"Joan is a perfect woman for him, if he's not a Time Lord."
"Unfortunately, he is."
"Truth be told, when it's just you and me,"
"I'd much rather you called me ""Nurse Redfern."""
"""Matron"" sounds rather, well, matronly."
"Ah -- ah, ""Nurse Redfern"" it is, then."
"Though, we've known each other all of two months, you could even say ""Joan."""
Joan?
That's my name.
"Well, obviously."
"The cool thing about when the Doctor was with Joan is that he was just completely human and we finally get to see what the Doctor would be like, if he wasn't a charming, all-knowing, all-adventure-all- the-time kind of guy."
"And, it turns out, he's just a bumbling nerd."
"Well,"
"I should imagine that you'd be, um --"
"I mean, I never thought you'd be one for --"
"I mean, there's no reason why you shouldn't."
If you do -- you may not --
I -- I probably won't.
Got a nickel?
Get him on the phone.
"There were guys, that's all they did all day long, was take care of Paulie's phone calls."
For a guy who moved all day long Paulie didn't talk to six people.
"If there was a union problem or, say a beef in the numbers only the top guys could meet with Paulie to discuss the problem."
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.
He didn't want anybody hearing what he said and he didn't want anybody listening to what he was being told.
"Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie, and he got a piece of everything they made."
"It was tribute, just like in the old country, except they were doing it here in America."
All they got from Paulie was protection from other guys looking to rip them off.
And that's what it's all about.
That's what the FBI could never understand.
That what Paulie and the Organization does is offer protection for people who can't go to the cops.
That's it.
That's all it is.
They're like the police department for wiseguys.
"People looked at me differently, and they knew I was with somebody."
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday mornings anymore for fresh bread.
"The owner knew who I was with, and he'd come from around the counter no matter how many people were waiting I was taken care of first."
"Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore, even though we didnt have a car."
At 13 I was making more money than most of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.
I mean I had more money than I could spend.
I had it all.
One day....
"One day, some of the kids from the neighborhood carried my mother's groceries all the way home."
You know why?
It was out of respect.
"Hi Mom, what do you think?"
Look at my shoes.
Aren't they great?
My God...
Can't stop me now
"I, I'll get by"
"I, I'll survive"
When the world's crashing down When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around Don't you try to stop me
"I, I won't cry"
I found myself in Wonderland
"Get back on my feet, the ground"
Is this real?
Is it pretend?
I'll take a stand until the end
"I, I'll get by"
"I, I'll survive"
When the world's crashing down When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around Don't you try to stop me
"I, I won't cry"

"Oh, Alice, dear, where have you been?"
"So near, so far, so in between"
What have you heard?
What have you seen?
"Alice, Alice, please, Alice"
"Oh, tell us, are you big or small?"
To try this one or try them all
"It's such a long, long way to fall"
"Alice, Alice, oh, Alice"
"How can you know this way, not that?"
You choose the door You choose the path
Perhaps you should be coming back

I'm assuming that not all the guests have to actually stay in the basement.
"Nice to be here, pretending it's five people having a gentle chat with an audience."
Sharing a dressing room!
Evening.
APPLAUSE
Hello.
I'm Alan Davies and this is As Yet Untitled.
"This is the show where me and four funny people sit down and have a conversation and during the course of the conversation, we will come up with the title for the show."
"We have limited ambition, but so far, we've always achieved our goals."
Please will you welcome my guests.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Hello.
"OK, I'm going to introduce them all, one at a time."
Please will you welcome Grace Dent.
Grace Dent hasn't been to Yoga in 18 months.
Grace Dent.
David O'Doherty is here.
David O'Doherty is an almost professional athlete and has had a top 30 hit.
Johnny Vegas.
"Welcome, Johnny."
Johnny became an inadvertent subscriber to the Catholic newsletter.
Johnny Vegas.
And Sean Kelly.
Sean Kelly shouldn't go camping with co-workers and will never again live in a van.
That's right.
Only once.
I shall explain.
"Now, in what field were you almost a professional athlete?"
"Well, you could say in numerous fields, in that I wanted to be."
"It's looking increasingly unlikely that it's going to happen by the year...now, but the closest I ever got was, in the year 2000, I'd just started doing stand-up comedy and I was house-sitting for Ardal O'Hanlon, a very funny comedian,"
"and he played golf and he had been booked to play in the Pro-Am of the Irish Open, which is the day before the pro tournament starts."
"The players, to get used to the course, play with probably businessmen and then also some people like Ardal."
"But today we can join with old friends, we can make new friends and we help celebrate a young man's first Communion."
And also to thank that boy's family for a magnificent contribution to the State.
I have here in my hand a check made out to the university and it is a magnificent endowment in the name of
Anthony Vito Corleone.
The check is signed by that young man's parents whom I think we should recognize.
"Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please."
Let the folks see you!
"Folks, I want you to join me in giving a real Nevada thank you to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!"
"We also have, as a special added attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir who have chosen a certain special song and a special arrangement to honor their host, Mr. Michael Corleone."
Boys.
The plaque.
"Okay, fellows, did you get that one?"
"Okay, that's good."
"Now, Senator, just you and Mrs. Corleone."
My lawyer Tom Hagen.
Senator Geary.
He arranged everything through your man Turnbull.
"-Yes, yes."
-Sit down.
I thought that you and I would talk alone.
"I trust these men with my life, Senator."
To ask them to leave would be an insult.
"Well, it's perfectly all right with me but I am a blunt man and I intend to speak very frankly to you."
Maybe more frankly than anyone in my position has ever talked to you before.
The Corleone family has done well in Nevada.
"You own, or control, two major hotels in Vegas and one in Reno."
The licenses were grandfathered in so there was no problem with the Gaming Commission.
Now my sources tell me that you plan to make a move against the Tropigala.
"They tell me that within a week, you're going to move Klingman out."
Quite an expansion.
"However, it will leave you with a little technical problem."
The license will still be in Klingman's name.
Oops.
Yeah.
So that's -- 14 years!
14 years since fish custard.
"Amy Pond, the girl who waited, you've waited long enough."
"When I was a kid, you said there was a swimming pool."
"She's been waiting all her life for him and so, when, finally, the opportunity comes up, she jumps at it."
And then waits another two years and jumps at it again.
"There's something weird about her, that she wants to stick with that guy."
"The previous companions for the Doctor have been a lover, they've been a friend, they've been an admirer, and Amy Pond is a groupie, she's a fan."
She's been a fan of the Doctor since she was a kid.
"And people thought she was crazy for her whole adult life because she keeps talking about this guy who's clearly a made-up, imaginary, friend."
"That's the most interesting setup for a companion that they've ever had, I think, having her have an imaginary friend all her life who then comes to life, essentially."
That's the magic of that show.
"Amy's one of those great, great characters whereby she doesn't need to be rescued by the Doctor all the time."
"Amy Pond is nothing, if not strong-willed and willing to make her own choices, regardless of what anyone else says."
She just states what she wants and goes for it.
"So when she wants to be with the Doctor, she hits on him."
She tries to get the Doctor.
"And not even in, like, an ""I love you, Doctor, let's get married,"" just in a ""come on,"
"I got one night left, let's do it."""
About who...
I want.
"Oh, right, yeah."
"No, still not getting it."
"Doctor, in a word, in one, very simple word even you can understand --"
No!
You're getting married in the morning!
"Well, the morning's a long time away."
What are we going to do about that?
"Amy, listen to me -- i am 907 years old."
Do you understand what that means?
I have a very good subject a new trainee wrote it he's written a great article about homosexuality in Egypt
What's this nonsense?
What homosexuality?

"It was a big robbery, it was on the news and there was like, people talked about it for a few days."
"Have you been in a robbery, Rob?"
"I haven't, but my mom was in a robbery."
I was about ten years old and it was a sawn-off shotgun situation.
"It was like in a woman's handbag store in rural Massachusetts,"
"I don't know why they chose to rob this place, but anyway, the police came with, you know, pictures of criminals that they wanted to show my mom and I'm ten years old and I'm thinking,"
"""You know what?"
They say they're the cops but probably
"""they're the robbers who've come to finish the job and kill my mom""."
"So, I put..."
"At ten years old,"
I just stood sentinel throughout the whole time while they showed...
"And I had weapons all over my body, like, that a ten-year-old would find, like a pair of scissors, like a little hammer from my own little boy's tool kit and I was like, ""If those guys who say they're cops try anything,"
"""I will cut their hair."""
Is it true that you've been happy-slapped?
Yes.
I was in Tesco...
You've made me look bad now and I'm actually a really cool guy.
Do you have happy slapping in America?
Don't know what it is.
"Well, when people started getting camera phones, with little... you know, you could record video, kids would go up to strangers and knock 'em - I don't know why I'm looking at you"
because I feel you might have done it to someone.
I am not a happy slapper.
And they would...

Why was that wrong(?

It took a while for the penny to drop for me on that one.

"That was the best part, you know?"
"We got to hoist him up there, and of course he didn't want us to put him up."
"It's like ""yeah, coach, we're getting you up here."""
"For Smith and Carolina, the satisfaction of beating Duke in '89 didn't last long."
"The blue devils went on to win consecutive ncaa championships in 1991 and 1992, and for the first time in the history of the heated rivalry, the balance of power shifted."
Everybody was talking about Christian laettner and Bobby Hurley and Grant hill and Bobby Hurley and Grant hill and Duke hanging two banners was just enough motivation for us.
"We'd come into our locker room, and in everyone's locker, taped into the mirror, was the image of the Louisiana superdome, and it had"

"I never had the guts to ask him about it, but it had coach Smith written all over it."
"Carolina responded to Smith's ploy, winning 34 games and eventually reaching the ncaa championship final the ncaa championship final against the fab five of Michigan."
There's that passing lob.
"Trailing late in the second half of the game, his team once led by 10 points."
Smith stuck to his coaching principles and trusted his players.
"Coach Smith gets four ""tired"" signals."
"All of a sudden, he starts sending in people."
He's got four substitutes in there and Billy packer's ripping him on television.

I'm glad I met you Bebi
I've learned a lot about life listening to your sorry stories
Doesn't that mean you're passing down wisdom to the next generation?
Maybe it's a sense of self-sacrifice
Maybe Bebi will become a role model for future Japanese
You think so?
Maybe that hunting was sort of a prophecy

You proudly wear disgusting fashion
There is no doubt that you are a gross Otaku
Lin and I are still somewhat concerned with our fashion

"But Bebi, you aren't like that"
You aren't concerned with social norms
You don't even mind your body odor
Actually you should mind that

Fox30 Erica Bennett is asking Our leaders tough Questions about How we can Evacuate -- if the Main routes are Being worked on.
Being worked on.
"Cowboys with six-shooters... covered wagons crossing the the plains, and Native Americans wearing war paint and feathers."
These are the images most people associate with America's Old West.
The Wild West as we know it tends to come from Hollywood movies.
"And that's a very cleaned up, sanitized version of what the West was really like."
But might there be more to the story?
"Much, much more?"
"When we think of the Old West, the last thing we think about would be Billy the Kid chasing a flying saucer across the desert."
"From cowboys, to lawyers, to doctors, to housewives washing the clothes and taking care of the sheep-- people were seeing things in the sky they couldn't explain."
This is a replica of one of the bars that was in one of the light ships.
And they're guarded by the Star People.
"Ancient aliens have been around for tens of thousands, if not millions of years."

And did the cowboys and natives of America's Wild West actually come in contact with alien beings from another-- much more distant frontier?

"Salem, Massachusetts, a community in meltdown."
"65 year old Martha Corey, devout Christian and church-goer, on trial for her life."
Sheridan:
"The Puritans of that time were, you know, lived on the lip of the wilderness."
"They were terrified of the wilderness and wildness, of wild men and the Indians, so that kind of fear allows for a witch trial to kinda take hold and a hysteria to take over."
Narrator:
"Mercy Lewis and nine women and girls claim Corey is a witch, haunting their dreams, hurting them without touching them."
[screams]
Mercy testifies:
"I believe in my heart that Martha Corey is a most dreadful witch, biting, pinching, and choking me."
Narrator;
All considered evidence of witchcraft.
The people of Salem are Puritans.
"They live by the Bible, in fear of the devil, blaming him for famine, disease and conflict."
Shea:
The fascinating thing about the Salem Witch Trials is they occur at a crucial tipping point in the history of America.
Supernatural explanations are first and foremost in their mind.
Van Alst:
"They see the Devil alive with the Indians, so if you could imagine sitting in your little living room, with your tiny tallow candle, and your Indian windows cracked a little bit for the breeze, every snap of branch you hear, every rustle of a leaf you hear is either the Devil or the Indians."
This is their nightly experience.
Narrator:
"For 300 hundred years, the West has been gripped by a witch hunting frenzy."
"[scream] 45,000 put to death, 80% women."
The Puritans take their belief in witchcraft to the New World.
Five people in Salem have already been accused.
Now it's Martha Corey's word against her teenage accusers.
WILLIAM HENRY:
Benjamin Franklin was deeply interested in the star legends of the native americans
"He was deeply connected with the legends of the Iroquois, confederacy"
"DONALD A GRINDE, Jr.:"
Franklin's indian treaties were pamphlets that he published from the 1730s to the 1760s they frequently recorded explanations of native culture
NARRATOR:
One of Franklin's best-selling pamphlets chronicled the Iroquois creation story of the Sky Woman.
GRINDE:
"Before Earth really became what it is today, there were beings that were similar to us living in the sky."
"One day, a young woman-"
"- Sky Woman, as she is to become-- became pregnant."
She is to go down to the world below.
"So this extraterrestrial that lived in the sky, she comes down, and then the human race begins."
NARRATOR:
Did America's Founding Fathers really believe in the possibility of life on other planets?
"And if so, was their belief based not only on scientific and philosophical principles, but on firsthand experiences with extraterrestrials?"
"Ancient astronaut theorists believe that such a notion is not only possible, but that the evidence exists in a firsthand account from one of George Washington's closest aides, and his recollection of a strange, close encounter on"
a cold winter night at Valley Forge.
"Valley Forge, Pennsylvania."
"Winter, 1777."
NARRATOR:
It is the height of the American Revolutionary War.
"After several bloody battles against superior British forces,"
George Washington's army is in tatters.
BULLOCK:
Valley Forge is the winter encampment of the Continental Army the army which is set by the nation to fight the revolution
"The British had taken Philadelphia, washing on the sides he is gonna headquarter some 12,000 troops were outside of Philadelphia."
GRINDE:
This is the darkest time of the American Revolution when people thought that the United States was really not going to win
BULLOCK:
"Washington is trying to figure out what he's going to do, and trying to keep the army together."
There's very little money.
"Edward agreed, with an ill grace."
"The treaty negotiations were to take place at Bamburgh, in Northumberland, in the March of 1 32 1 ."
"So, in March, the envoys began to gather."
The papacy and the French King sent agents too.
"It was a farce, a drain blocked with all the old arguments."
The English wheeled out the ancient story of immemorial English ownership of the Scottish crown.
"The Scots replied with creaky chunks of Bisset and a generous helping of the Declaration, adding for good measure that the entire Norman and Plantagenet dynasty was itself illegitimate, stemming as it did from the foreign usurpation of 1 066,"
an invasion led by someone the Scots chose to refer to as William the Bastard.
"The true and legitimate claim on the English crown, said the Scots, lay with the house of Wessex, whose sole living representative was one Robert I of Scotland."
The Bamburgh negotiations came to nothing.
A letter confirming Robert's excommunication arrived a month later.
Stalemate.
"And after that, for six years, it was groundhog day for Robert the Bruce."
"Every time the Scots secured concessions at the papal court,"
Edward successfully got them undone.
"The only day that delivered any variety was the 5th March 1 324, when Queen Elizabeth was delivered of a healthy baby boy, someone to give Scotland to, someone of his blood."
A miraculous male heir.
David.
The Queen was 35.
The King was 50.
"For those days, it was near enough to miraculous."
But did it matter?
"Every morning, the Bruce awoke to find the English King unchanged."
"The Bruce's groundhog day lasted until 20th January 1 327, when Edward II was deposed."
"Edward was removed from the throne by his wife, Isabel of France, and her lover, Roger Mortimer, with the tacit approval of an English nobility that was heartily sick of Edward's incompetence, favouritism, rumoured homosexuality, and corruption."
"His son, the Prince of Wales, just 1 4 years old, was crowned King Edward III a little less than two weeks later."
This was good news.
This was an opportunity.
"But King Robert, once again, was ill."
"He remained active, but sometimes he was active almost in effigy, carried around from place to place, paralysed, like a statue of himself."
"The illness came and went, but it came more and went less as time passed."
"An eyewitness in July said the King was so ill, he could scarce move anything but his tongue."

"I object, Your Honour."
Mr. Kanji is calling service to God a business.
Of course it's business.
Take a visit to any religious place.
First you've to pay for parking.
"Then, pay for standing in the smaller queue."
"Then pay for the flowers, blanket, candle."
And the donation box is kept right before the idol.
"As soon as you bow down, you've to put something in it."
And they even charge for the offerings of God.
Just like we're charged for seeing wax statues in the museum.
"Similarly, they charge us for seeing the stone idols in temples."
And the priests have salaries as well.
"His is less, and his is more."
And you even have income tax benefits.
Right?
"So, where's the service?"
"And, Your Honour, there's never recession in this business."
No.
"ln fact, they do better business during recession. "" Oh, God!"
"Oh my, God! """
Relax.
Consider that it is a business.
"Still, why are you asking them for compensation?"
You pay premiums for your insurance.. ..so you can ask them for a compensation.
But why will the temple pay you?
Because...l've paid premiums in their temples as well.
- What?
What nonsense?
I knew you won't believe me.. ..so I have brought all the proofs along.
Look.
These are the receipts of the premium.. ..l've been paying for the last 18 years.
No.
"Sir, but why?"
Forget this case.
But it's such an interesting case.
"Interesting yes, but it's also a police case."
But...
"Sunita, you want me to call your parents?"
"Fine, I won't take it up."
"But as medical students, we want to know."
Okay...
That is Sanjay Singhania.
Hit on the head with an iron rod.
"After the incident, he lost his memory."
He is unable to remember anything now.
We call it short term memory loss.
He remembers events for only about 15 minutes.
Afterwards... he forgets everything.
"For example, he'd ask your name... and in 15 minutes he will have forgotten it."
He recalls only fragments of the incident.
But we can't say how much of it he remembers.
"Regular tasks like eating, drinking, driving, also his feelings..."
lie embedded in his sub-conscious mind.
How does he go about his everyday routine?
How does a child perform instructed tasks?
"By committing to memory, learning by rote."
"Or, by jotting things down in writing."
"Likewise, he remembers tasks by writing."
What was that incident?
Who assaulted him?
"This, no one knows."
"Unfortunately, he doesn't even recall a face."
How can someone live on like this...
And um.
"It sounds like the level of reference is working well for you, right now."
Yeah.
"You don't have on your website like, if you're an advanced person, or a beginner."
You don't have those kind of groupings?
We don't.
"We're working on it. , I don't know if you've seen some of those websites where they actually have kind of portals to deal with beginners and things like that."
Speakers:
Yeah.
"But you don't have it, like tailored for those kind of."
Things on the site.
Would that be helpful for you as a user?
"Yeah, I think that would be helpful for me.'Cause I am, I've been using a lot of these programs that I would not."
"I mean, some of those are really very basic beginning stuff."
"I mean, I mean, stuff, stuff will cross over, of course."
"Like, , when you have a new."
"I need product and stuff, they probably want an analysis, start to get in what those things are, and upgrade."
"But on the other things, too."
"I also like, too, that, you know, when you have those ones that show pictures of artists."
"Creative, um..."
"Oh, creative inspiration?"
Yeah.
I do like watching some of those and the artists.
"Those are very, very nice."
"It's, it's weird the way that you guys have them listed, though."
"Ah, it."
It's always hard for me to remember how to find it.
Mm-hm.
"Let's call it documentary, but this ."
Yeah.
"Navigation wise subject, like I wasn't to know that when I sort of, of , something. these guys beginning. ."
"Where, the, the, the stories."
"They drink the water they know is dirty, they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice and they die."
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.
They try and build it.
They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.
And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.
So what do you do?
Do you let them die?
"Well, somebody had a great idea."
And it was a simple idea.
It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field.
Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment.
"And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this, that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over, can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through."
"So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?"
Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?
Because there is no profit in it.
Because nobody can get a kickback.
But it still needs to get to people.
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.
[Video]
Woman:
Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.
Man:
You know how expensive those are.
"I have a solution that requires neither machine, nor wood, nor cooking gas."
Woman:
What solution?
Man:
"Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have."
Boy:
"Grand-dad, tell me the solution please."
Man:
I will tell all of you.
They're the... our genre's most important things.
You need to make them feel alive.
You need to make them breathe.
You need to make them just realistic.
"So, let's talk about ways to do that."
First thing that we'll start to talk about is the concept of a sympathetic character.
Sympathetic Characters.
This is kind of the word that a lot of us use.
"Because, sympathetic is better than saying protagonist and antagonist, or heroes and villains."
"Because you want, generally, almost all of your characters to be sympathetic for one reason or another, ok?"
"Even your villains, the villains that you love, are sympathetic for a couple of... for some odd reason, and we'll talk about that."
"Let me throw it at your guys first who haven't taken the class before, since the rest of you know the answers to this, hopefully."
If you don't...
What makes a character sympathetic to you?
What makes you like a character when you're reading a book?
Student:
Some similarity between you and the character.
Brandon:
Ok.
You hit one of the big three right off the bat.
Student:
They have problems.
Brandon:
Ok.
Problems are good.
"Another way to put this is the ""underdog syndrome."""
"We like the underdogs, don't we?"
It's just human nature.
"Ok, what else?"
Student:
Consistency.
"I mean, they can evolve, but not be doing just random things."
Let's do this last problem right here.
"The world's largest trench digger, Bagger 288, moves at 3/8 miles per hour."
"So its speed, or its velocity, or its rate is equal to 3/8 miles per hour."
We could write it like this.
How long will it take to dig a trench 2/3 miles long?
So we want to go a distance that's equal to 2/3 miles.
So we just remember that distance is always going to be equal to rate times time.
So our distance is 2/3 miles.
"That's going to be equal to our rate, 3/8 miles per hour, times our time."
"Or we could divide both sides by 3/8 miles per hour, so if we divide both sides by 3/8 miles per hour, we'll get our time."
So divide by 3/8 miles per hour.
Divide by 3/8 miles per hour.
This cancels out.
"So time, we're going to get time is equal to this."
So we have 2/3 miles.
Let me write it this way.
2/3 miles divided by 3/8 miles per hour.
"Or another way to think of it, that's the same thing as times the inverse, times 8/3 hours per mile."
I just took the inverse of this.
We divided by this.
That's the same thing as multiplying by its inverse.
And we inverted the units as well.
And so we'll see that the units cancel out.
"Mile in the numerator, mile in the denominator."
We're left with hours.
"And so this is equal to 2 times 8 is 16 over 3 times 3, 9, 16/9 hours."
"So like an hour and 7/9, or 1 and 7/9 hours to dig the 2/3 of a mile."
Welcome back.
"Now that we've hopefully, learned a little bit about"
"Newton's law, let's apply them to solve some problems."
"Let's say I have a-- I don't know-- some kind of vehicle, a car, a motorcycle or something."

There is a new one over here.
[man speaking native language] man speaking native language:
"Oh, gosh."
You have to pull on this one.
Can you manage it? woman speaking native language:
Nope. man:
You have to pull using your dorsal muscles. woman speaking native language:
It won't budge.
[man speaking native language] woman speaking native language:
IT WON'T BUDGE. man:
"John, it is necessary to address one or two shortcomings in, uh, the physical side of marriage."
"Surely no one would argue that there are certain physical demands a wife can request of a husband, and Ann asks you that you address these issues right now."
[laughter]
Do you agree to wash the windows inside and out?
[laughter]
man speaking native language:
It's like at the gym.
"You grab here, you grip there, and you position yourself with parallel feet so you can use your dorsal muscles."
Then you pull.
[woman laughs]
woman speaking native language:
"Oh, really? man:"
"Ann, John asks if you will agree to let him do that thing you once told him you would let him do on his 40th birthday, but still not have yet done."
[laughter]
"So, Ann, in anticipation of your previous answer,"
"John says, ""I suppose an occasional blow job is..."""
[laughter]
woman:
Are you trying every possible way?
I told you it won't move.
And without the consent of the possessed... ...the exorcism ritual can't be performed.
Did you encourage her to eat?
"Yes, every time I saw her... ...but the few times she tried, it seemed like..."
"Seemed like she couldn't swallow, or she couldn't keep it down."
What about medical care?
I wanted her to continue.
I never said she should quit seeing her doctors.
That would be wrong.
Medical care is not my field.
But you did suggest she stop taking the drug Gambutrol.
Yes.
"After the exorcism, she asked for my counsel."
She told me that the drugs had never helped her.
"After all, she was on Gambutrol during the exorcism... ...when her so-called symptoms were at their peak."
"Ultimately, we both felt that she was beyond medical care... ...and that she had to see this through to the end... ...by faith alone."
The dual voices we just heard on this tape... ...you're certain that they were both coming from Emily at the same time?
Yes.
"Yes, I heard them."
Have you tampered with this tape in any way?
No.
"No, I have not."
No further questions at this time.
Mr. Thomas.
"Father Moore, you consider this tape to be proof of the supernatural?"
I think it's a record of certain indications... ...that Emily was possessed.
"Signs of possession, you may call them."
"By ""signs of possession,"" would you mean her speaking in languages... ...we might assume she couldn't possibly know?"
And the vocalization of two distinct voices simultaneously?
Yes.
Among other signs that I observed and described to the court... ...while the tape was playing.
Things I saw.
Things you can't hear on the tape.
"We'll just have to take your word, won't we?"
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Thomas.
I apologize.
"Father, as Emily's parish priest... ...are you aware that she underwent advanced catechism training?"
Yes.
Yes.
Her family is very devout.
"And in that training, did she study Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Latin?"
"Yes, I think that's right."
"Might have even studied Aramaic, Christ and his disciples' language... ...which, according to the transcripts, we also heard on the tape, correct?"
She spoke Aramaic on the tape.
It wasn't part of her training.
But it was offered as an elective at her catechism school.
I have the school's curriculum here if you'd like to see it.
No.
I'll accept that she might have been exposed to that language.
"And according to her high school records... ...German was the foreign language she studied there, yes?"
I don't know.
If you say so.
"So that covers the strange languages we heard on the tape, correct?"
Did I miss any?
- No.
- Good.
We've already established you're no medical expert.
You said it's not your field.
But are you aware of the dual sets of vocal cords every human possesses?
- No.
"- Have you heard of... ...the superior vocal cords, which are higher than the ones we use to speak?"
No.
"So you didn't know that Tibetan monks, for example... ...as part of their religious training, teach themselves... ...to activate both sets of vocal cords at once?"
"No, I didn't know that."
What happened about scouting that kid I mentioned earlier?
It's me.
Did you think about what I said last time?
I want to know first why you put forth those conditions?
I thought you told me to tell you what I wanted.
"If you interfere in my private life, I can't work with you."
Are you calculating which of the two will be more profitable?
I have to leave as I have an appointment.
I will call you back.
"Fine, do that."
But I can't wait long.
"As you know, there are many places that want me."
Call me soon.
President.
What is it?
Doctor Cho called several times.
It's Kang Hwi's examination results.
He asked me to give them to you directly.
"Alright, you may leave."
What do you mean blind?
His eye...
Are you saying that he is going to become blind?
Yes.
"Depending on the degree of damage to his optical nerves, he may be able to maintain a very slight vision."
"However, even that is hard to guarantee."
What about the treatment method?
"If the optical nerves become damaged, it is impossible to recover."
There is no special treatment as of now.
"In the case of Kang Hwi, the rate of progress is very fast."
Probably it is because of the characteristics of the work.
"Fatigue and stress are problems,  but strong lights are also fatal. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; President, only you will suffer like this. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I can't wait long. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It is an important time now! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Make sure not to harm the company's image and make thorough preparations. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; There is no treatment."
"Look for a plane ticket, the quickest one."
Okay.
So what have we got on this
left-hand side?
A linear combination.
"It's a linear combination now of three vectors,"
and they happen to be -- each one is a three dimensional
"vector, so we want to know what combination"
of those three vectors produces that one.
Shall I try to draw the column
"picture, then?"
"So, since these vectors have three"
components -- so it's some multiple -- let me draw in the first
column as before -- x is two and y is minus one.
Maybe there is the first column. y -- the second column has maybe a
"minus one and a two and the y is a minus three, somewhere,"
"there possibly, column two."
And the third column has --
"no zero minus one four, so how shall I draw that?"
So this was the first component.
The second component was a minus
one.
Maybe up here.
"That's column three,"
that's the column zero minus one and four.
This guy.
"So, again, what's my problem?"
What this equation is asking me to do is to combine these three vectors
with a right combination to produce this one.
"Well,"
"you can see what the right combination is, because in"
"this special problem, specially chosen by the lecturer,"
that right-hand side that I'm trying to get is actually one of these
And I saw something lying on the sidewalk.
*It was a gold locket... *
*... with the initials E. C.B.* *engraved on it. *
My middle name is Christine.
Erin Christine Bruner.
"And of all the people walking by that day, I found that locket."
What are the chances of that?
"I don't know, maybe it was a sign."
Or maybe it was just some incredible coincidence.
"But it made me feel... ...like no matter what mistakes I've made in the past... ...at that moment, I was exactly where I was meant to be."
Like I was on the right path.
You sound more like a mystic than an agnostic.
Are you wearing the locket now?
No.
You should.
The archdiocese doesn't want you to testify.
They're just afraid that I'll embarrass them.
Testify to some medieval-sounding supernatural nonsense.
They're expecting me to talk you out of it.
I've just decided I'm not even gonna try.
Why not?
If the archdiocese wants to avoid embarrassment... ...they need you to walk out of here a free man.
I believe a jury will find you sincere and credible... ...and when Dr. Cartwright corroborates your testimony... ...and refutes the prosecution's medical arguments... ...we'll get an acquittal.
And everyone will thank me for it.
Emily!
God help me.
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God?"
I do.
"Father Moore, before you could perform the exorcism... ...you had to get the sanction of the Church, correct?"
"Yes, on October the 27th of last year... ...I presented my assessment and recommendation to the archbishop... ...and he authorized the exorcism that day before I left the office."
Tell us what happened that night.
I drove home.
"If you have ever put your head on a washing machine, that's how it felt."
That's how I heard the airplane.
It's a dream come true for me.
I wanted to be instrument rated for a long time and now I can fly blind and deaf!
(laughter)
I'm up in the clouds and it is freedom.
That's what it is.
It's all about freedom.
Announcer:
"With his high energy, warm hearted style; Stephen Hopson, a gifted story teller, unpacks the steps to overcoming adversity, which he calls the ""HEAR PRlNClPLE."""
Have a passion.
Entertain the possibilities.
Act on your intuition.
Remember the people who helped you.
Stephen:
"Without passion, you can't go anywhere."
You are stuck where you are.
"But with passion, you will be amazed at how doors of opportunity will open up for you."
Announcer:
"Along the way to becoming a pilot, Stephen's passion opened up another door of opportunity, which led him to become a successful broker on Wall Street with Merril Lynch."
But there were obstacles along that path as well.
Stephen:
"In order to overcome adversity, you need to be able to trust your instincts."
I saw an advertisement in the paper for stock brokers and I thought what a good career change that might be.
So I called up the guy for the interview.
I had an interview with the vice-president.
"I walked into his office, I was really nervous."
I was intimidated.
The office reeked of wealth.
I met with him for twenty minutes.
"He said, ""OK, you are meeting with twelve people on my floor."""
"""Each and every one of them said you're not going to make it."
"Now, let's emulate some waveform debugging."
The question here is in which of these cycles is the protocol being violated?
"Remember, the packet starts when the valid signal goes high."
It gets interrupted by the suspend signal.
"And then, the packet ends, when the valid goes low and the parity byte gets transmitted."
We are only
looking at the control signal here.
Please go ahead and check off the cycles from one to seven.
Which one of these is a protocol violation?
Do you remember what you were thinking about when you were doing your performance?
It's nerve-wrecking.

"So, we're back here."
First show we did here.
XXX
Somebody had suggested that maybe we wouldn't be a real band unless we played live.
We must do it now.
This was a moment to actually see if we could put off any kind of existence.
BE ACTUAL INSTEAD OF VlRTUAL.
"I was over there and I had this big, fat white speaker and you could see my showbusiness in a nice, big white speakerhead."
And I had the laptop.
I had to put it on my feet for it not to be seen.
We're not really playing with a laptop.
"It kind of felt like a weird kind of karaoke gig, didn't it?"
"- A little bit, yeah."
- Risky karaoke.
We had our friends and stuff in the audience.
It was definitely full to the back cause it was a small venue.
Those were the day when performing was the scary experience where I kind of escape from my body. to get me through the gig and then would come out the other side:
"""Oh!"
Did we do it?
The testing shows that Nathan excels at visual and spatial perceptions.
Fantastic.
What I would like you to do next is write the alphabet for me from A to Z and join all the letters together as if the whole alphabet was one long word.
And
"I'm going to time you to see how long it takes you, OK?"
"Ready, go."
Along with his tally sheet of strengths there are significant weaknesses.
M-- I forgot how to do one letter.
Were you forgetting how to make the letter or were you forgetting which letter came next?
Forgetting how to write it.
"Yeah, how to write it."
So you knew what letter you wanted to write?
And could you picture it in your mind?
I could picture it in my mind but I just couldn't--
Couldn't remember the procedure for making that letter?
So let me give you some others now and see how you do.
Dr. Levine now knows something vital.
Nathan knows what the letter K looks like.
But it's simply too much work to write it down.
Kids like this have what is known as an output problem.
These are kids for whom work is too much work.
Effort is too much effort.
And they sit down to do something and you'd think they'd have to climb the
Matterhorn.
And these same kids tantalize everyone because their intake is so good.
They're so good at understanding things.
They're so good at analyzing.
"Often, they're very creative."
A lot of times they're a wellspring of phenomenal ideas.
"But to be productive, to get some output, to be efficient in your output, is sort of out of the question."
"Nathan, do you see only designs here?"
It's as if within the mind of the child with a learning problem there are three clocks.
"But once you have the variance, it's very easy to figure out the standard deviation."
You just take the square root of it.
The square root of 7.76-- 2.78.
Let's say 2.79 is the standard deviation.
"So this gives us some measure of, on average, how far the numbers are away from the mean which was 4.2."
And it gives it in kind of the units of the original measurement.
"Anyway, I'm all out of time."
I'll see you in the next video.
"Or actually, let's figure out-- we said if this was a sample, if those numbers were sample and not the population, that we figured out that the sample variance was 9.7."
And so then the sample standard deviation is just going to be the square root of that.
The square root of 9.7 seven which would be 3.1.
3.11.
"Anyway, hopefully that makes it a little bit more concrete."
We've been dealing with these sigma notation variables and all that so far.
So when you actually do it with numbers you see it's hopefully not that difficult.
"Anyway, see you in the next video."
Fucking Christ.
What the fuck?
"One minute I'm minding my own business - shoot'n pool, downing shots of who-the-fuck-knows-what and suddenly.."
POOOOOOF
I mean fairy-fucking-godmother?!?
How the hell is this her jurisdiction?
Man. my head.
What the hell was in those shots?
I mean seriously.
All i did was rent a few dogs.
Oh.. and sewed a few sticks to their heads.
Alright. and glued a red light to that little ones nose but fucking christ give me a break...
I did a dime of shrooms earlier.
I needed some light. and (chuckling) i thought he looked cute.
Is that a fucking crime?!?
"How was I to know that abandoned sled in front of city hall belonged to some ""princess""?!?"
I want you to try it.
"If you haven't tried this, go to Publix, Whole Foods, and get all this food at Publix and Whole Foods."
It is really amazing.
"If you try it out on your family, you tell them it's meat,"
I'd love to see the response they give.
It really is good stuff.
"And remember, all meat, dairy and egg products go through a process."
It doesn't just magically form.
"In this case, the process involves killing, cooking, pasteurization, refrigeration, freezing, and we can not forget the all important seasoning."
"I remember going to McDonald's as a child, and I didn't just get a slab of meat."
"A slab of meat had herbs and spices put into it, was put on the grill, cooked, and then it came to me with a bun,"
"lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard and onions."
And a pickle.
What all those things are made of?
Plants
"We put condiments, spice and herbs on the meat to make it taste better, in fact, what would meat be without plants?"
It would just be a dead animal.
Would be a carcass on your plate.
It would be no different from road kill.
"So the word of the day is ""Vegan""."
"A vegan is somebody who chooses not to eat any meat, dairy, eggs or fish."
"And again, how is this extreme?"
How is it extreme not to be drinking the milk of any other species?
How is it extreme not to be eating hen periods?
How is it extreme not to be participating in a system that unnecessarily kills animals?
"A lot of kids say, even after all this,they are still like"
"""What do I eat as vegan""?"
"Now, all these products are vegan."
"There is no meat, no dairy, no eggs."
But this is all crap.
This is unhealthy.
This is the junk food vegan.
- Who are they to be judge and jury?
- No comment.
- No comment.
I'm afraid for myself.
I'm afraid for my kids.
I'm afraid to walk down the street.
"- I can't believe your saying that, that's crazy!"
- When did you turn into such a sissy?
- I think they just get off on killing people.
"- Well, I have no comment."
"I have nothing to say, thanks."
All this hubla with the media.
"You guys are making it worse, right now."
Your giving them power.
By sticking that microphone in my face your giving The Saints more power.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I really don't wanna talk about that.
You walk into some kids bedroom and they're gonna be there.
"You've got Batman, Superman and these Saints."
"Are you loosing any sleep honey, 'cause you know what, I'm certainly not."

"For the owner of a call option with a $50 strike price, then the payoff at expiration ... we're talking about the value of that position."
"If the stock is below $50 we wouldn't exercise it, because we can buy it for cheaper than the option that the call option is giving us."
If the stock goes above $50 we would exercise our option to buy at $50.
"Say the stock is at $60 the underline stock is at $60 on that date at the expiration date, then we would exercise our option to buy at $50 and sell at $60 and make $10."
We would essentially get this upside above $50 on the stock.
"If we think about ... this is the actual value of the position, if we want to factor in how much we paid for the option, we would shift this down by $10."
As the holder we would pay $10 for that.
It would look this this.
We would essentially ... if we don't exercise the option we loose the amount of money that was a loss that we have to pay for the option.
"Then above that we break even at $60 dollars, and then we make money above that."
"So, what have I given you?"
I have given you everything you need.
"I have given you PMT, RC, which is 10,000."
I've given you number of years
"left for you to retire, 40, and I've given you an interest rate that you're likely to earn on your portfolio, which means, where you put your money."
"A bank, whatever."
We'll talk about that in a second.
"But let's just focus on this, and try to do this problem."
"I hope you've been listening to me, and I hope you've been paying attention."
"Because if you pay attention to a problem, it gets to be a little intense."
And I'll do the problems with you.
"And I have promised myself, today, I'll spend a"
lot of time just doing problems with you because that's how you learn.
"And I, another piece of advise."
"I've given you textbooks to read, that you can go, get and read."
They can be second hand.
"They can be, whatever."
The fundamental principles of Finance have been known since we were in the cave.
"So, it's a, it's a, just remember that what you're trying to do is focus on the fundamentals."
"So, read whatever you want if the video doesn't satisfy your curiosity."
But the video is trying to be self-sufficient.
"So, let's do this, let's now start doing the problem."
"And what I'm going to do is I'm going to do two problems for future value, two problems for present value."
But I'll take breaks with you.
"So, I'll let you know that maybe it's time to take some time off."
"Get some coffee, go jog around the apartment building where you live, or talk to your friend, or watch a video on"
"YouTube, you know, why not?"
Okay.
So let's get started.
I'm going to draw a timeline right here.
"You can use the box I gave you or you can use, I prefer this."
And how many years?
Ok.
[Audience member]
How do you select text using the keyboard?
[Panelist]
"Um, I was alluding to that a little bit earlier."
"You select text by holding down, ah, the, I think Command A, will select all the text."
"Ah, command...."
[Other panelist]
I think it's Shift.
[Panelist answering question]
Shift.
I'm sorry.
"Yeah, if you hold down the Shift key."
"And then use, ah, either the Arrow keys, or the Option left and right arrows, you can select by character or word."
But you use the Shift key in the same way that you would in Windows.
"Um, You're holding down the Shift key and left and right arrow is going to select a character at a time."
And then Shift Command left and right arrow for example would allow you to select a word at a time.
"And then you would use of course your Command X, Command C, Command V, commands to either cut, copy, and then paste that selected text."
"Obviously, I'm not going to get into that demonstrated at the moment."
I can't even fix a misspelled word here.
"So, I don't want to, I don't want to press my luck here."
"Again, but you know that shows how I use it."
I do a lot of typing in meetings.
"And I just send raw text with loaded with mistakes right to um, there's a way to do that in email."
It goes to my email box as a text file--right in the email message.
"And then I can save it down, and then bring it into Notepad or Edsharp which I use a lot, or even Word if you want."
And then I just do most of my editing right on the PC itself.
"So, I don't do a lot of selecting of text on the i device, but you certainly can do it, and it does work."
[Other panelist]
"I've done it, and it does work very well."
[First panelist]
I should let you do that part.
How efficient has the planet become at capturing photons?
"Does it capture 50%, 10%, 1%, 1/10^(th) of a percent?"
A guess?
How many for 50% Hands up.
How many for 10%?
Hands up.
A couple.
How many for 1%?
Hands up.
How many for 1/10^(th) of a percent?
Hands up.
See the grad students think it's a 1/10^(th) of a percent.
It's a small amount.
"I don't know the precise number, but it's down between 1/10 and 1% I think."
"So even after 3.5 billion years of evolutionary history, the planet has not become terribly efficient at capturing sunlight."
Freeman Dyson has got this definition of different kinds of civilizations.
One of the stages of civilization would be when you can put a sphere around an entire solar system and capture all of the photons coming off of the sun and harness it for running a civilization.
That would capture the entire solar output.
"Well, you know, we are a tiny little dot on the face of the sun, and we're taking 1/10^(th) to 1% of its photons."
So this isn't a very big number when you look at the solar output.
"What happens is that basically algae, primarily algae, but also trees and all other larger plants, are capturing this."
Then the herbivores are eating the plants.
The primary carnivores are eating the herbivores.
The secondary carnivores are eating the primary carnivores.
"What do you think is in the red arrows, going off to the detritivores?"
"In simple Anglo-Saxon, four letter words, what do you think is in the red arrow?"
Shit and corpses.
Okay?
That's the red arrow.
It's pretty big.
Any idea what Africa would look like if you got rid of the dung beetles?
You would need hip-waders; especially in the Serengeti or any of the big national parks.
We have a lot of crowding issues.
"That's kind of the major issue, right?"
"Because you can see that our titin, which is in green, is really not allowing any space."
"Or there is no space, really."
"And so, these ends, remember these are our z-discs right here."
This is Z and this is Z over here.
Our z-discs are right up against our myosin.
"In fact, there's almost no space in here."
This is all crowded on both sides.
There's no space for the myosins to actually pull the z-disc any closer.
"So because there's no space for them to work, they really can't work."
"And really, if you give them ATP and say, go to work."
"They're going to turn around and say, well, we've got no work to do, because the z-disc is already here."
"So in terms of force of contraction for this scenario one, I would say, you're going to get almost no contraction."
"So when the length is very low, so let's say this is low."
Maybe low is not a good word for length.
"Let's say this is, I'll use the word short."
The sarcomere is short.
And here the sarcomere is long.
"So when it's short, meaning this distance is actually very short, then we would say the amount of tension is going to be actually zero."
Because you really can't get any tension started unless you have a little bit of space between the z-disc and the myosin.
"So now in scenario two, let's say this is scenario two."
And this is my one circle over here.
"In scenario two, what happens?"
"Well, here you have a little bit more space, right?"
So let's draw that.
Let's draw a little bit more space.
Let's say you've got something like that.
"And I'm going to draw the other actin on this side, kind of equally long, of course."
I didn't draw that correctly.
"Because if it's sliding out, you're going to have an extra bit of actin, right?"
Something like that.
The slugs are then trimmed to exactly match the width of the engravings.
The forms of engravings and slugs are then set as pages.
The page form is filled with bits of leading.
Here's my setup for making engravings.
A jig for engraving small blocks.
Some slugs needed underlay for the I's and L's to print properly.
"This is the final packing layer for a run, showing the make ready."
I spent an additional year writing the pancreas section.
"""Here we are at Quercus Press, on 6/6/06."
"Printing the last, well the first of the last of the runs of the Pictorial Webster's."""
I used the labels from the book to create a marbleized text pattern.
"First the yellow run is printed, then the reds, and finally the green and blue."
"""Is this really the last one?"
"Here it is."""
"""Last one!"""
"""And this is the speed I printed the book, basically; that real slow speed."""
"""Alright that's it."
"Hooray!"""
Next began the binding process.
"For hundreds of years, binders have cut and folded sections this way."
"The Pictorial Webster's had over 5,000 sections to fold."
The sections have holes punched for sewing.
"Using a sewing frame, the books are sewn on double flexible rolled linen tapes with supported kettles."
"Because the sewing is so time consuming, I invited 11 bookbinders to Strong Arm Bindery in Maine where we managed to sew 50 books in a weekend."
"After a book is sewn the spines are pasted up, the edges are trimmed,"
the book is rounded and backed.
The edges are prepared for decoration and edge decoration is applied using rubber stamps.
The endbands are sewn.
The spine is lined with airplane linen and paper and a hollow is formed on the book.
Boards are attached.
"The leather is pared,"
"it gets wetted out, then pasted up."

Gadejuristen - The Danish Street Lawyers
My name is Nanna Gotfredsen and I am a street lawyer in Copenhagen.
We are at the open drug scene right now.
It's just behind the main station in Copenhagen and we have had an open drug scene here for 30 years- 25 or 30 years.
"What we are doing here with our bike is that we are sending out a legal team providing users, homeless people, and outdoor sex workers with legal advice and legal assistance."
It's the package:
"Pump, filter, water, injection needle."
We have several kinds of needles that we can offer.
"If you don't use these, then we have some bigger ones and we also have a pump that is bigger."
But this is what you have in the ordinary set here and also alcohol cleaner.
And this is a J-Key card.
Information for safer injection.
This is a question and then you have the answer on the other side.
There is not doubt that law enforcement cannot prevent people from using drugs.
Using drugs has other reasons than whether it is criminalised or not.
When the police is targeting the open drug scenes you can only make it worse for drug users.
They are fighting so hard to stay alive and we can see that from the constantly high death rate in Denmark
This is our office - The street lawyer.
"Drug users, homeless people and all of them are here with us."
"We can be like 30 or 40 people up here, and so we would like some more space."
Homeless people are having their clothes and things and papers and things like that in the office.
"The Engie is set up, all right?"
Don't worry about the Engie.
Machine learning for wed developers or
"Machine learning and You or something along those lines so I note everyone is here, ready to go."
"So yeah, I kind of made this talk as more of an introductory kind of thing."
I suspect if you understood everything in the last talk.
This might bore you.
Mostly because we are not going into numpy and scipy. that kind of stuff.
For the demo we are going to do I want to make sure you don't have to have your FORTRAN compiler set and everything.
We are doing just an overview. meant for web developers who have heard about this kind of stuff and read hacker news regularly and don't see how they can apply it to web applications and that kind of stuff.
"You should know python and data structures, that kind of stuff."
If you are in applied math and a PHD you might find this kind of boring.
"Hopefully we can get into some cool applications of machine learnng and we will be building somthing together, kind of fun."
"If you are following along on you laptop, for the material today all you need is"
"I wrote some set up scripts that will create a virtual environment, get you all the packages and stuff."
Let me break out of this real quick and get you started.
"So if you are on a mac and you can do HomeBrew, do brew install. you can do C compile and C sees it ."
The Natural Language ToolKit is in today and it requires that.
"If you are on Ubuntu, you need the development headers."
Clone the repository at mygethub. cd setup.
There are some shell scripts there.
"If you are on windows, I didn't write anything for you, sorry."
NLTK is a little weird with intstallations.
So let me know if there is a problem with that. so boot strap. download some stuff and you should get some fun stuff.
"Oh yes, Absolutely."
You want ... the font.
"Okay, Sorry I am a little mis set."
Where am I going?
Okay.
Can everyone see yet?
Bigger ? yeah.
Yeah the pail chart what did it fail on?
"The problem is your body, all of us; we care about what happens today, not down the road."
"One of the take home points that astonished me when I start to think about it, is that nature, evolution selects out for who has good kids, and that's what evolution is about: it's about having children; about progeny."
It's not about what happens when we're 80yrs-old or 90yrs-old.
"And so, inflammation is fantastic at dealing with today's ramifications."
"The problem is if you get the flu today, your risk of cancer and heart disease a decade or a two decades from now are up."
S:
If I get the flu just once?
Dr:
If you get the flu once.
"So those five, six days where you feel horrible, your inflammation is through the roof."
That's having ramifications down the road.
S:
"This is already getting a little scary for me, because I've had the flu...so I already feel a little worried about my cancer risk."
Dr:
I can tell by looking at you!
S:
"The symptoms we get when we have the flu or cold, it's not the virus that's causing it."
"The virus is causing the inflammation, which is causing the symptoms."
Dr:
Yes.
That's what's wild.
"When you get a virus, your immune system attacks it, and then you get a fever."
I still don't know why we get fevers.
"It's one of those things where cytokines, which are proteins the immune cells make to send out and get more reinforcements and tell the body what to do, it causes a fever."
"Is a fever good, is a fever bad?"
I don't know!
"We take Tylenol to lower a fever, but is that a good thing?"
Nobody has really looked at the long-term ramifications.
"We've looked at the short-term, but how does that effects will there be a decade from now?"
We just don't know.
S:
"What you're saying is the reason we have inflammation is, something is happening to my body,"
They had a lot of sailors from the island.
"My uncle was telling me one time, I forget how many cousins he had that were captains on boats."
But that was when there were 70 ore boats.
You'd go up in the evening time and watch them going up Sand Bay.
"They all did the same speed, they all burned coal in the 50s."
"There was nothing to see, a dozen, right after the other lined up at the same speed, just heading for"
Grey's Reef there.
They did the same thing -
"In the day you'd see the smoke, but at night you'd see the lights go by."
"And when you went across on the mail boat, you always passed in front of one or behind one."
Heading down to Charlevoix or coming back up.
There was an awful lot of guys.
"When we put up ice here, our whole crew pretty much would be - we'd have 8, 10 guys down there."
They all were sailors that were just home for the winter.
They laid the boats up the first of December and go back in March.
"Unless a guy had lucked out to get the job for the winter staying on the boat, just to keep an eye on things."
"Like I said, [?]'s husband."
He'd always run what we called The Jack.
We had a movable thing to - when you put the ice up in the ice house the ramp and everything.
You walked alongside and it was just a little plank.
I don't know if I could -
"So, you'd pull the ice up."
These cakes up to the foot of the thing.
And then the other team - some guy driving the team.
"One of the sailors, he'd have the team."
Then they used the team to pull four of these blocks up.
Ray would be the guy behind us at what we called the
Jack.
He took a 12 by 12 plank with a bunch of spikes through it and then a big handle - to guide the - you hook on behind him and they'd keep on skidding it up.
And there'd be two or three guys up inside the ice house itself.
"They have these big ice tongs, skid it around, and they'd jam them and they'd tape it together."
So it was like one solid block of ice.
[laughter].
A bit of a scam because I wasn't afraid.
Maybe it was because at University I was part of the Psychic Research Society and one of the things we found out was that never ever once in a hundred years of ghost hunting in UK has a ghost ever harmed anybody.
So armed with that information I had my research - so why be afraid?
They can't harm me at all.
And that way I wasn't conditioned through fear.
"But the Thai people, and there's a few"
"Thai people here, [laughter], they have grown up with ghost movies."
"Ever since they were small they saw these ghosts, huge, like heads with entrails following behind, and they would do terrible things to people."
"And because of that, just even the mention of a ghost.."
I remember this story - this poor little novice staying in our monastery in Thailand.
"Because it was a cremation monastery that day was the moon day when we would meditate all night...that poor little novice, we did a funeral that day, and were supposed to meditate all night... in the hall."
"Now usually, little novices, they are only about 11-12 years of age, there is no way they would stay up all night, they would sneak off in the middle of their night back to their house."
"We knew they did this, it was breaking the rules, but they were only small little monks, so we didn't mind."
And we've go to be kind..
Not this day.
"This night, that little novice, he would not leave the hall."
[Laughter].
Because he was just so afraid of the ghost.
See even the [Laughter].
Those dogs must have been reborn in Thailand.
Last night.
[Laughter].
Great special effects.
"Now these, here they go again."
[Laughter].
"Shut up, dogs!"
[Laughter].
"There, they're going now."
"Now these ghosts, or rather this little novice, the poor little novice, stuck in that hall, you know 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, too scared to go out."
When it got to about 2 o'clock in the morning he just couldn't hold his urine any longer.
He had to go to the toilet.
Always getting the short end of the stick.
Herding is a really good and interesting alternative to foraging and agriculture.
"You domesticate some animals, and then you take them on the road with you."
The advantages of herding are obvious.
First: you get to be a cowboy.
"Also, animals provide meat and milk, but they also help out with shelter, because they can provide with wool and leather."
"The downside is that you have to move around a lot, because your herd always needs new grass, which makes it harder to build cities."
Unless you are the Mongols.
"By the way, for the next 14 weeks, you will frequently hear generalization followed by"
"""Unless you are the Mongols"""
"But anyway, one of the main reasons herding only caught on certain parts of the world is that there aren't that many animals that lend themselves to domestication."
"Like, you have sheep, goats, caddle, pigs, horses, camels, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, all of which have something in common: they aren't native to the Americas."
The only half-way useful herding animal native to the Americas is the llama.
"No, not that llama."
Two Ls.
"Yes, that llama."
Most animals just don't work for domestication.
"Like, hippos are large, which means they provide lots of meat."
But unfortunately they like to eat people.
Zebras are too ornery; grizzlies have wild hearts that can't be broken.
"Elephants are awesome, but they take way too long to breed."
"Which reminds me, it's time for the open letter."
Elegant.
But first let's see what the secret compartment has for me today.
"Oh, it's another double cheeseburger."
Thanks secret compartment.
"Just kidding, I don't thank you for this."
An open letter to elephants.
"Hey, elephants."
"You are so cute, and smart, and awesome."
Why you gotta be pregnant for 22 months?
That's crazy.
This was 5 times 1 minus 1.
"Yeah, 5 times 0 minus x1, which is 1."
"Now, this case, it's 5 times-- oh, I have to be careful."
This is 5 times x2. x2 is 1.
"So 5 times 1 minus 0, so it's 5."
"And then I have 4 times 0 plus x2, plus 1."
"And I just showed you if I replace each of these standard basis vectors with the transformation of them, what do I get?"
I get this vector right here.
So I already figured out what they are.
"If I take this guy and evaluate it, it's the vector 1, minus 1, 4."
"And then this guy is the vector 3, 5, and 1."
So what we just did and this is-- I don't know.
"For some reason, I find this to be pretty amazing."
We can now rewrite this transformation here as the product of any vector.
"So if we define this to be equal to a, or we could write it this way."
We can now write our transformation.
"Our transformation of x1, x2 can now be rewritten as the product of this vector."
I'll write it in green.
"The vector 1, 3, minus 1, 5, 4, 1 times our input vector, x1, x2, which is super cool because now we just have to do a matrix multiplication."
"Instead of this, and if we have some processor that does this super fast, we can then use that."
"I don't know, I think this is especially elegant, because what happens here is we applied the transformations to each of the columns of a 2-by-2 matrix, and we got a 3-by-2 matrix."
And we know what happens when you multiply a 3-by-2 matrix times a vector that's in R2.
Or you can almost view this as a 2-by-1 matrix.
You're going to get a vector that is in R3.
Because you're going to have these guys times that guy's going to be the first term.
These guys times these guys are going to be the second term.
These guys times those guys are going to be the third term.
"So by kind of creating this 3-by-2 matrix, we have actually created a mapping from R2 to R3."
"Anyway, for some reason I find this to be especially neat."
"Hopefully, at least you find this somewhat instructive."
hello dear sports fans
I'm with you again DmitriyXfit
"While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution, and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders, we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage, or whether it's domestic violence, whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere."
"So, why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?"
"What are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we indulge in, that we can stop, and that there are other ways of actually taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people."
"Well, here is one such way."
(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.
Your parents were peaceful people.
Your grandparents were peaceful people.
So much peace in one place?
How could it be otherwise?
(Music)
"But, what if ..."
Yes.
What if ...
One little gene in you has been trying to get through?
"From your beginnings in Africa, through each generation, may be passed on to you, in your creation."
"It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you."
"And if it's in you, then it's in me too."
"Oh, dear."
"It's what made you smack your baby brother, stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother."
"It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside, when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide."
"Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work, and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk."
"Oh, dear."
"And as for outsiders, white, black or brown, tar and feather them, and whip them out of town."
It's that little gene.
It's small and it's mean.
"Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection."
"Adrenaline, kill."
It'll give you the will.
"Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it."
You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.
"Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me."
"Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln."
"The expert's strategy, a full immersion language treatment."
"She needs a lot of practice talking in complete sentences, talking on a more"
"literate level of things, really talking about issues."
What was Clinton's position in the article that you took your notes on?
"We want to build these muscles, these expressive language muscles because one of the best ways to learn to talk, right, is to have plenty of practice."
It's almost like working out for a sport.
And she has to do that.
She needs a verbal work out.
You need to be a risk taker.
You need to try a new word.
You need to make that
leap.
But you have to be comfortable.
You have to be confident.
You have to know you're in a safe place to do it.
And someone's got to be there to help give you the ammunition to take that risk.
"But once you start taking it and once you start succeeding, the ripple effect is wonderful."
"There, it's very positive."
"So the prescription for Sarah Lee is a kind of immersion therapy, almost like"
learning a foreign language.
"There will be flash card drills, practice conversations, lots of reading, and new vocabulary words over and over and over."
"If she keeps it up, the experts believe she can overcome her expressive language deficiency."
What should you do if you find someone's wallet or purse in a store?
You should-- if the person it not too far-- you should run and give it to them or you can--
"One year later, the assessment of Sarah Lee's progress is indeed hopeful. --and let them know that you have their wallet."
I hope if I loose my wallet you're the one who finds it.
This past year has been a year of real growth for her.
She's contributing more to classes now and she's doing more reading.
And she's found ways to help herself.
And that alone is like shooting baskets to prepare for a basketball game.
"The more she does, the better she gets at it."
Sara Lee has improved dramatically.
"Well, what I do is I take the transformation of this guy."
"My domain right here is R2, and I produce a vector that's going to be in Rn."
"So what I do is, let's see."
So I'm concerned with multiplying things times vectors in R2.
"So what we're going to do is we're going to start with the identity matrix, identity 2 because that's my domain and it just looks like this:"
"1, 0, 0, 1."
I'm just going to start with that.
"And all I do is I apply my transformation to each of the columns, each of my standard bases."
These are the standard bases for R2.
"I showed you that they're bases, how do I know that they're standard?"
Why are they called the standard bases?
"And I haven't covered this in a lot of detail right yet, but you could take the dot product of any of these guys with any of the other guys, and you'll see that they're all orthogonal to each other."
"The dot product of any one of these columns with the other is always zero, so that's a nice clue."
"And they all have length of 1, so that's a nice reason why they're called the standard bases."
"But anyway, back to our attempt to represent this transformation as a matrix vector product."
"So we say look, our domain is in R2, so let's start with I2, or we could call it our 2-by-2 identity matrix."
And let's apply the transformation to each of its column vectors where each of its column vectors are a vector in the standard basis for R2.
So I'm going to write it like this.
"The first column is T of this column, and then the second column is going to be T of 0, 1."
And I know I'm getting messier with my handwriting.
"What is T of the vector 1, 0?"
"Well, we just go here."
We construct another vector.
So we get 1 plus 3 times 0 is 1.
"Then we get 5 times 0 minus 1, so that's minus 1. x2 is zero in this case."
"And then we get 4 times 1 plus 0, so that's just 4."
"So that's T of 1, 0."
"And then what is T of 0, 1?"
"T of 0, 1 is equal to-- so we have 0 plus 3 times 1 is 3."
Then we have 0 minus 1 is minus 1.
Let me make sure I did this one right.
What was this?
Win Phippen:
"On a more sophisticated scale, the corn and soybean production has been around for a while."
And there are several plant breeders in the country that have actually been working on this.
But they are simply trying to improve production practices.
"And so they could be, simply, improving the hybrids for insect resistance, or disease resistance."
Every year new diseases come along.
Soybean Asian Rust is one that came back a few years ago.
All of our current varities didn't have Soybean Asian Rust resistance in it.
"And so now they are looking back to the old wild populations to see if they can find that resistance and find some old lines, and cross it into today's hybrid line."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
And why it is that Western is well positioned to be doing this sort or research?
Win Phippen:
We're in the perfect location.
"We're ideally suited, in the middle of the Midwest."
"We're right in the center of a lot of graduate-level programs, where students can go on and get master's degrees, and PhDs in plant breeding."
"And, most of the seed-breeding companies are located right here in the Midwest."
And so our students come in with a good agricultural background.
And now they can get...
"This grant adds a new minor here in the department, in the School of Ag."
Beth Seaton:
So you have a new minor in plant breeding?
Win Phippen:
A new minor in plant breeding.
So that offers two new courses.
One is in traditional plant breeding...
And this is where we simply cross plants with each other.
And it offers the new bio-technology plant breeding.
"And this is, you've probably heard about genetically engineering plants."
This is here we can introduce DNA from other sources into plants to give it some unique traits.
And this is where we can have plants resistant to herbicides and insects and things like that.
Beth Seaton:
In order to keep all of this running smoothly it's important to establish the clear roles and responsibilities for maintenance of the shared drives.
That brings me to the end of the presentation.
I just want to say thank you.
Paulette Murray:
It looks like you answered any questions people might have had.
Did you want to say anything else before we close out?
Beth Cron:
"No, just thank you for attending today and I'd like to hear any comments or questions that you have."
Paulette Murray:
Okay.
Thank you so much Beth.
You did a wonderful job.
I think a lot of people appreciate it.
Looks like you have some applause coming from the crowd.
Actually we do have a question from Walter before we do that.
"""How many files / bytes did the NARA project take on?"" Good question Walter."
Beth Cron:
Yes that is a good question.
"Off the top, I know there are several shared drives at NARA."
"A couple terabytes, I think, each."
I don't have the exact numbers.
But they were getting quite large.
Hence the need for a cleanup project.
I can answer any questions about the shared drive bulletin.
"But if you do have specific questions, it's best to talk with your NARA appraisal archivist, who is more familiar with your agency and can better answer any specific questions you might have."
Paulette Murray:
"Alright, once again thank you Beth for a great presentation."
Thank you to everyone who had questions or participated in the discussion.
"We'll be hosting other upcoming online briefings, so please keep your ears out for the fliers that we send out so that you can register for those."
And please look for updates about other online things we're offering here at NARA.
"We have the new fiscal year 13 online course schedule online, I believe."
I will put that link into the chat box after I'm done.
That's classic thylacine habitat.
And the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around.
So could we put it back?
Yes.
Is that all we would do?
And this is an interesting question.
"Sometimes you might be able to put it back, but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again?"
And I don't think so.
"I think gradually, as we see species all around the world, it's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild."
"We'd love to think it is, but we know it isn't."
We need other parallel strategies coming online.
And this one interests me.
"Some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos, sanctuaries, even at the museums, had collar marks on the neck."
"They were being kept as pets, and we know a lot of bush tales and memories of people who had them as pets, and they say they were wonderful, friendly."
This particular one came in out of the forest to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep.
A wild animal.
And I'd like to ask the question.
We need to think about this.
"If it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then, would the thylacine be extinct now?"
And I'm positive it wouldn't.
We need to think about this in today's world.
"Could it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them, maybe they won't go extinct?"
"And this is such a critical issue for us because if we don't do that, we're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice."
"As far as I'm concerned, this is why we're trying to do these kinds of de-extinction projects."
We are trying to restore that balance of nature that we have upset.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In memory of

Nicolaas G. Pierson Foundation presents an Alalena production
Marianne Thieme in
Meat the Truth
"Convicted, that's correct."
JG:
"You write in the preface,"
"""It had been and is my view that it was the racism in Middlesex County, fueled by biased, inflammatory publicity in the local press before and throughout the trial, fanned by the documented government lawlessness, that made it possible for the white jury to convict Assata on the uncorroborated, contradictory, and generally incredible testimony of trooper Harper, the only other witness to the events on the turnpike."""
"There was one other state trooper, Harper, who survived the confrontation and who was the main witness against Assata."
LH:
"Yeah, but Harper ran away during the shootout, came back, and his story was conflicted and contradictory."
And—
"Yeah, it all comes down to tapping buttons."
Which brings us to our next accessory.
Probably the stupidest thing ever invented: the Speedboard.
What is it?
It's a piece of fucking plastic!
You attach your controller.
You get it?
In case you don't want to hold the controller with your hands?
"In case you enjoy playing on the floor, or behind a table?"
Then this is for you.
It's embarrassing.
What's the point?
To put the speed at your fingers?
Why in the ass would I need that?
"If I'm playing a game that involves having to tap the buttons like crazy,"
"I'm probably gonna get a turbo controller,"
like the NES Max or NES Advantage.
How could they even sell such a thing?
"Even though it's made by a third-party company, it was actually licensed by Nintendo."
It's like covering a turd in ice cream sprinkles.
"Next up, oh boy, the Konami LaserScope."
Now I just wanna go on record by saying I fuckin' love Konami.
But this thing reeks of ass!
"It's essentially yet another form of the Zapper, but it's voice-controlled."
"""If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things."""
May we ever continue to do so.
I thank you for your faith and devotion to the gospel.
I thank you for the love and care you show one to another.
I thank you for the service you provide in your wards and branches and in your stakes and districts.
It is such service that enables the Lord to accomplish many of His purposes here upon the earth.
I express my thanks to you for your kindnesses to me wherever I go.
I thank you for your prayers in my behalf.
I have felt those prayers and am most grateful for them.
"Now, my brothers and sisters, we have come to be instructed and inspired."
Many messages will be shared during the next two days.
I can assure you that those men and women who will address you have sought heaven's help and direction as they have prepared their messages.
They have been inspired concerning that which they will share with us.
Our Heavenly Father is mindful of each of us and our needs.
May we be filled with His Spirit as we partake of the proceedings of this conference.
"This is my sincere prayer in the sacred name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen."
"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen."
"My name is Art Benjamin, and I am a ""mathemagician."""
"What that means is, I combine my loves of math and magic to do something I call ""mathemagics."""
"But before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience."
"By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator?"
"Seriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand."
Raise your hand.
Did your hand go up?
"Now bring it out, bring it out."
Anybody else?
"I see, I see one way in the back."
"You sir, that's three."
And anybody on this side here?
"OK, over there on the aisle."
"Would the four of you please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage."
Let's give them a nice round of applause.
- I would say definitely and the most important is to throw.
"Beyond that your personal religious beliefs on throwing checked or not or changing or not, are less important, but not swallowing it the really important thing."
"- OK, at least we can agree on that much."
The rest of it is just a quite good practice.
Use formatters.
A lot of people seem to be afraid of these.
I ended up using them all the time.
They're easy to write.
"If you look at the whole API for, was is Java text format, there's a whole lot of stuff there."
"But, with Web Objects, you usually don't care."
"You're formatting one value of an input, and you're...you're parsing one value of an input or you're formatting it into a string."
"You don't need to get too carried with writing fancy, fancy formatters."
It's good because it keeps the views separate from the model and the controller.
"Rather than using a formatter, you can often just do it in a WO component."
The thing is that this is a little bit smaller than a WO component.
It's easier to reuse across a bunch of WO components.
It promotes reuse because of that.
The code's not tied to one specific page.
Yes?
- This is going to get ugly
A lot of the formatters aren't thread‑safe.
I think all the ones I rate are thread‑safe.
"But, I know some of the Java timestamp formatters, and some of the other ones aren't thread safe."
"The best practice is probably to cache them in a session if you're not going to get multiple requests, unless of course, you're using a long response page in which case then you've got a different problem."
"The best practice is, it depends but think about thread safety."
- Yes.
None of the Java formats are as thread‑safe.
- Sorry.
It's actually not that costly to pick a formatter.
Just don't try to share a formatter between threads.
You're asking for trouble.
"There's no doubt, I put the date and time into the session as seen from the slides to hold the time zone in them?"
"We just got an announcement, for those on the phone, about a film Jurassic Park is being played, I guess somewhere in this building, I don't know."
"But , um, the nice thing is, if the developer has written the application properly, and it works well with voice over, any edit box you get to, you can turn Quick Navigation off and you have this whole facility of being able to move by line, character, word, cut, copy and paste."
If you hold down Option and hit left and right arrow you'll move by word.
"You can do Command X to cut text, Command C to copy, Command V to paste--just like Control X, C, and V will do it in Windows."
It's really wonderful.
"So, yeah, any edit box is going to work."
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn on QuickNav again?
[coordinator]
"Um, sorry, question from the phone, would you repeat the question?"
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn on QuickNav?
[panelist]
I didn't hear the question.
[coordinator]
We can't hear the question.
It's something to do with quick nav.
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn it off and on?
[coordinator]
How do you turn QuickNav off and on?
[panelist]
Great question.
"On the keyboard, you hold the left and right... ok, you hit the left and right arrow keys together. ..."
"It just said ""quick nav on."""
"And I'm going to hit them together again, [software speaks]"
"""Quick nav off."""
It's a toggle.
"And the great thing about that is you can turn Quick Nav on, quickly move to the edit box, then turn Quick Nav off and, just, start, you know, typing away."
"Or If the edit box isn't selected, and you want to edit, you can actually, if you move to with Quick Nav ... if you press the up and down arrow keys at the same time to go into the edit box, it will automatically turn Quick Nav off for you."
Good point.
[Other panelist]
That's all going to be possible in just a few months.
"Now, we have the Sony Bravia over to my right just to simulate the Google TV living room experience."
"And for the sake of all of your eyes, we'll be projecting Google TV back on the screen behind me."
Let's see if we can get it started.
There we go.
"So, everyone clear on everything?"
We're going to get started with the demo.
You notice here I'm watching TV as if I normally would in my living room.
I can change channels;
I can do all the same things I usually would.
"With one button, I can press the search button and bring down this box."
"And for up here, I can type in any URL."
So let's go straight to YouTube.
"In just a few seconds, YouTube.com is going to be loading."
"Now, you notice this transition between TV and web was completely seamless."
"I didn't need to change my input channel, I didn't need to use a different remote; the web just became an extension of my TV."
So I'm here on YouTube and I can do any of the same things I could do in my computer.
So let's search for something to watch.
The Salt's video trailer came out just a couple of months ago; let's see if we can find that here.
"Again, just like on my computer, now"
I can see it and I can go click on the link and watch the video.
"Now, one of the great things about YouTube is that as camera technology has improved, more and more people are uploading high resolution video."
This means that it makes a great experience when you navigate into full screen.
So let's try that now.
"So, the video is rendering and we're actually"
"going to be using hardware acceleration in the Google TV devices to make this rendering happen very, very fast."
Let's see if this actually is rendering.
All right.
"Well, let"
"me show you another example of YouTube, oh, this is what happened; the play button was not started."
Minor details when you're watching a video.
There we go.
Martin:
The sun would shine
"Can we act in a group, can we pull together?"
Ole:
"Yes, if we don't lift as a mass but as a Community"
"How do you see these ""occupied movement""?"
Is that community or is that mass?
Ole:
"Uhhhmmm .... they have a characteristic of the mass .. spontaneity, right? they are not organized .. but at the same time they are... directed at a goal and driven by an idealism and it moves them out of the mass concept"
Martin:
"And as you see it, the ideal and the goal is what?"
Ole:
"To prevent that resources are wasted and that human selfishness will shape government policies and in any way, the whole human living conditions"
"The mass never act normative, if it does, it is directed"
Martin:
It will be overruled?
Ole:
"Yes, as Hitler led the masses.."
Old:
But if the mass really follow standards that are freely chosen by the individual it's no longer a mass.. but something different.. movement
Martin:
But don't you see it as a movement?
Ole:
"Yes I do, also because they recruit to many different groups in society, right and to many age groups which is also extremely interesting"
Martin:
"Yes, but now as a global Prime Minister, you can do what you want, but"
You're also allowed to put some of these philosophical considerations on the line
Anything we could do in there?
I had another guest who suggested that we should teach philosophy right from the early grades
Ole:
"Well, I would say that it is well worthwhile to ask the question .. ""who am I""?"
Martin:
"But I think, for obvious reasons, we can just skip that particular punchline and instead, silently ponder why"
Megan made the poor decisions that she made.
"Joking aside, it should now be burnt indelibly into your brains that I am the best man."
"But I hear some of you asking, ""Why would Bayley, somebody so obviously filled with bitter jealousy and feelings of inadequesy, pick somebody as awesome as David to be his best man?"" The truth is, I am as stumped as you."
"Don't get me wrong, I am Bayley's best friend in the whole wide world - closer to a brother, really."
"But Bayley, he is just my ..."
"I don't know... what is closer than a stranger, but still shy of pal...?"
"""Casual work acquaintance""?"
"No, I would need a job for that to be the case... ah well, we'll come back to that."
After all...
I can't ignore his lovely bride!
Heh heh heh...
"Megan, I actually want to use this time to appologize for the way we have treated you."
"To be mocked about your height for so many years by me, my brothers, friends, family, strangers on the street, well, it simply isn't fair to you."
"And to know that you've actually looked up to me all this time, metaphorically speaking, of course..."
"Well, I'm sorry for all of it."
I will try and be more respectful from here on out.
"That's a lovely dress, by the way."
Does it come in an adult size?
"Darn it, I didn't even make it a full 10 seconds into my resolution."
"Here, to make it up to you, I will now improvise a touching poem, just for the two of you."
"Now if you notice that I am still scrolling down my speech, understand that I am simply doing that for continuity."
"Ugh, starting is always the hard part."
"I dunno, uhh... roses."
Roses are... red!
Violets are... violet?
"No, I know there is something better."
"Come on David, you can do this."
"Roses are red, Violets are blue,"
"Today we learn what they already knew, This beautiful couple makes their official debut, Put themselves up for their familiar review,"
"Verdict comes in, it was worth the pursue,"
"Pastor asks, ""Do you and do you?"""
But there are 100's and 1000's of you taking this class currently.
"Your talking to each other is going to be more powerful, a learning tool."
"So say, for example, I make an error, and actually I have made errors in the videos, but I don't try to fix them and, you know, cut out that clip, simply because we all make mistakes."
"I correct them in real time with you, and usually they're small."
And I guarantee you they will be small.
"But is you find something don't say, Oh, you know, Suwarth Gottum made a mistake."
"Well, you make mistakes, I make mistakes."
Your attitude should be sorting out what that mistake is.
Finally.
This class is about ambiguity and learning.
And I would encourage you to take that attitude towards it.
Okay?
"One last thing, which I feel compelled to talk about because I have prepared most of the class, and I want it to share with you."
Why did I say yes to it?
Why did I choose to do something online?
The first reason is I believe education should be accessible to all.
Why do I believe that?
Because I believe education almost is like a right.
It's almost like a right to breathe.
"I do have strong views about it, but I genuinely believe that education makes you become empowered."
The most valuable investment you could ever make is education.
What do I mean by that?
"Remember, if you want electricity, which is good, you're willing to burn coal."
"However burning coal leads to some problems, some costs on society, and on you too."
Education is an investment that
largely gives your benefits.
Why wouldn't you want to do that?
Why wouldn't you to make an investment in yourself.
"My goal, in this investment, is to empower you not to be dependent on a coach like me or any other person."
"But to take this class and say, I can do it too, and that's the beauty of education."
I'll make couple more points and then we'll see each other in about a week.
This has been a real challenge for me as a teacher.
Taking apart my syringe.
"I'm going to add this in here, and then I want to turn my stopcock to open it up to the patient."
I can shut off this side port so it doesn't leak out.
And then the patient's head should be elevated a little bit.
You don't want them flat.
"So let's make sure, either raise the head of the bed or the patient can be raised up with some pillows."
Make sure they're not flat.
Okay.
So now I'm ready and I can take my feeding and pour it in here.
Okay?
And then you just want this slightly higher than the patient so that it'll go in but not too fast.
Okay?
"All right, and then I would give whatever my feeding amount was slowly and then after that, I would turn my stopcock again to shut it off so it's off here so it won't leak and then I can come back and do it again."
"Now, once I've been feeding the patient and I'm doing it, if this was my first time, after I check for placement, that's all I had to do."
"If I'm coming back four hours later, to give another bolus feed, I would need to check for residual first, tube placement, check for placement, check residual and then give the feeding."
"I may need to follow it with water per my order, to make sure the line is flushed and also to give the patient free water."
"If the patient's on continuous drip, meaning that they get a continuous feeding over 24 hours, we're going to use a special pump that is designed to be used with the feeding tubes."
And there's a special bag and seth (phonetic) that fits in this special type of pump.
All right?
So we're going to use a special feeding bag.
All right.
And then I'm going to pour my required amount of feeding into the bag.
Close the top.
Okay.
Now this is similar to an IV.
"It has a drip chamber, kind of like an IV does, but to get this IV to run, we have to do something special, to get this tubing to flush."
This part here is stretchy tubing.
And I need to stretch it flat and that allows the drip chamber to fill.
All right?
Okay.
"And then I put, prime my line, just like an IV line, until I get a drop to come out."
There we go.
"One day I was recommended a book written by an American (then was not none), named ""the shack"" (the refuge)."
I do not regret not having it published.
"Has been very successful, lots of publicity, and ..."
Q: don't you regret?
A: absolutely not.
"Q: does not earn much money, you don't have an actual team, you're not popular, sell little, why continue?"
"A: because my definition of success is different, our success is guaranteed because in Christ are blessed."
"Many colleagues have started at the same time our and have already given up, because they have earned as they wanted."
"Of course, I want to give the best to my family, but what about the great success, I believe that we have already."
"Because when we see God's hand at work, I am the first to be blessed and happy, I and my whole team."
Q:
So you believe that God will rejoice at what you are doing?
A:
Yes.
"Many times when I lose myself moods,"
"I know that God is happy to me, and therefore makes me feel its presence in continuation."
"Q: isn't always of great comfort, however your economic life, with your wife, but God there is always arguing."
Q:
"If one day you Strait lacked necessary, what would you do?"
"What would you think about the project ""harvest time"""
Rimangeresti you all?
A:
"No, absolutely not."
"Would not ever, because it is always a great joy to know that God is with me."
"We try to remain simpler as possible, we do not use branded clothing and other luxury items, since it would be so far from our reality."
"We don't need these things to have joy, we have the Lord and we are already super pleased."
"Look, I'm not preaching a false moralism, we are truly thankful for what God has given us!"
"And in the little things, like an outing at mcdonald 's, we're more than happy."
"Q: what message do you want to leave it to those who want to sell Christian books with only the intent to earn a lot of money, success and fame?"
A: do you want to earn money?
Go to sell chewing gum!
"Who or what do you aggrapperesti then in moments of crisis, eh?"
You gotta miss me though
Let's turn his room into a gym

"Okay, US health care cost."
"In 2010 which is the last year for which we have reliable data, we're two years behind on these data."
"We spent, the United States spent 2.6 trillion dollars on health care."
"Now, I have gone through lots and lots and"
lots and lots of places and talked about this spending and one of the things I have noticed is no matter where.
I go.
People have a very poor grasp of the word trillion.
And how big this number is.
So we have a few mechanisms to put this in context for you.
It's great for cocktail parties or frat parties or any place else you need to talk to someone and raise irrelevant topics and just show how smart you are so here is the first question for your audience response thing.
"If you convert health care spending, that 2.6 trillion dollars, how many years ago is 2.6 trillion seconds."
"40 percent said 80,000."
"Twenty, 100,000, 28%, you guys got it right."
"It's 80,000 years ago, 2.6 trillion."
Do you know how long ago that is?
"When was the first human that left the African continent, modern human that left the African continent to explore the rest of the world?"
"They didn't go out to explore, they went out looking for food that was 60,000 years ago."
This is before human being migrated out of the African continent and we're measuring this in seconds.
"So, how big is a trillion."
"Well, a million seconds [inaudible] actually it's about twelve days ago."
"One billion seconds is the year I graduated college, you guys can figure that out for yourself, okay? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it, there you go. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [laugh]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I got to fix that slide."
"A trillion in seconds is 30,000 PC, 2.6 is around 80,000, alright?"
Just a huge number.
"Now, I know seconds is not what you think about and 80,000 years ago is a little too much at some ways."
"So, we're going to the moon."
"Single dollar bills, nice, crisp bills gotten right after the federal reserve and printed them, stacked up."
"You can see a 100 million crisp bills is pretty [inaudible], 6.8 miles. $One bills, right?"
There's an old wood bridge.
"If the guild is truly active again, they'll get their orders there."
My lady.
Did you find out?
The Queen sent her away?
"Yes, and without the King knowing."
Yet something's not right.
"If she's feeling poorly, why have no medicines been sent to her pavilion?"
So she leaves on medical grounds but doesn't tell the King?
"Yungsun, get the whole story."
"Lady Jo, send word to the Viceroy that I want to see him today."
Your Grace.
"Well, Dong Yi, why did you REALLY leave?"
"I'm playing Minion Rush, I've bought all the costumes... it's a very awesome game"
So you'll not buy the new Asphalt?
Ah?
Asphalt 8.

I'm sick of waiting
It was released last August 22th!
In this video I'd like to talk about the power of creating and comparing alternatives.
And to do that I'm going to share some research that Steven Dow did as a postdoctoral scholar with me at Stanford University.
"When you're designing, does it make more sense to go for quality and try to come up with the best possible design?"
Or does it make more sense to go for quantity first as a path to try and learn and understand?
"There's a story that Bayles and Orland tell about an art teacher who divides the class in half, and he tells one half of the class,"
"""You're going to be graded exclusively on the quality of the very best thing that you make."""
"He tells the other half of the class,"
"""You're going to be graded on the quantity of things that you make."
"Doesn't matter how good it is; all that matters is how much that you make."""
"And what this teacher found was that while the quantity group was busily churning our piles of work — and learning from their mistakes — the quality group sat around theorizing, and at the end of the day they had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and piles of dead clay."
So this gives us some intuition that rapidly producing many alternatives has a lot of value.
"And to explore this further, Steven and I had people create egg drop devices."
"Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi."
"Goodbye, Martin Luther King."
"Hello, gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood."
Hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can't even afford to give them food.
Hello civilization.
"Hello, 21st century."
Look what we've ...
look what they've done.
(Applause)
"Mainstream art, cinema, has been used across the world to talk about social issues."
"A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti, which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change."
"In Venezuela, one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called Crystal."
"And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer, 75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done."
"And of course, ""The Vagina Monologues"" we know about."
"And there are stand-up comics who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues."
"So, why is it, that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world, we need a more just world, why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?"
"What I need to say to the planners of the world, the governments, the strategists is, ""You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake."
"It needs to be the yeast."""
"Because, any future planning, if 2048 is when we want to get there, unless the arts are put with the scientists, with the economists, with all those who prepare for the future, badly, we're not going to get there."
"And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen."
"So, what is it that we require?"
What is it that we need?
"We need to break down our vision of what planners are, of what the correct way of a path is."
"And to say all these years of trying to make a better world, and we have failed."
There are more people being raped.
There are more wars.
There are more people dying of simple things.
"So, something has got to give."
And that is what I want.
Can I have my last audio track please?
Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully.
(Whistling)
13 gallons.
How many people worldwide have no access to any water within a 15 minute
radius of their homes?
One billion people.
And how many gallons of raw or partially treated
sewage flows into U.S. waterways per year?
"Oh, exactly."
Okay.
And final quiz and then
"we'll get on to some more content. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [INDlSTlNCT] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's everything, yeah."
"That's the whole management system across the country, yeah."
Final quiz.
"Who said, ""Whisky is for drinking and water is for fighting over, fighting for?"
Any guesses?
Mark Twain said that.
Okay.
Back to you Laura.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
"So to start talking about Greywater, there was a really excellent report that came out last year looking at the--can Greywater can really meet our needs and it's a non-potable source of water."
"So if we look at how it can meet our irrigations needs, we can find that it actually matches up really well."
So there's two charts.
If you just look at shower and
"laundry water, these are--have average per capita use in California."
"And then you look at the outdoor use for landscaping, there's a really good match."
"So we can just take all that water instead off sending it to the sewer plant which often, you know, doesn't treat it properly, often it does, but not always."
"We can use that to irrigate outside, things that don't need potable water."
"And another thing to of note is, you know, how much water is this?"
"Like, you know, each household Greywater system like does it really--will it really impact California water?"
And if we look at--this is millions of gallons per day of savings.
"If people take that water and irrigate outside, you can look at just from washing machines, how many millions of gallons you'd save, showers and washers and then all Greywater."
And I wanted to point you to one number that 10% column.
"If just 10% of people--and this is just Southern California--re-use their Greywater to irrigate plants outside, that would off-set the need for a medium sized desalinization plant."
"It turns out that what we want for, what we'll call the common denominator, it turns out to be the least common multiple of two and three."
Well what's the least common multiple of two and three?
Well that's the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three.
Well the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three is six.
So let's convert both of these fractions to something over six.
So one half is equal to what over six.
You should know this from the equivalent fractions module.
"Well if I eat one half of a pizza with six pieces, I would have eaten three pieces, right?"
That make sense.
"One is one half of two, three is one half of six."
"Similarly, if I eat one third of a pizza with six pieces, it's the same thing as two over six."
So one half plus one third is the same thing as three over six plus two over six.
Notice I didn't do anything crazy.
All I did is I re-write both of these fractions with different denominators.
"I essentially changed the number of pieces in the pie, if that helps at all."
Now that we're at this point then the problem becomes very easy.
"We just add the numerators, three plus two is five, and we keep the denominators the same."
Three over six plus two over six equals five over six.
And subtraction is the same thing.
"One half minus one third, well that's the same thing as three over six minus two over six."
Well that equals one over six.
Let's do a bunch more problems and hopefully you'll start to get it.
"And always remember you can re-watch the presentation, or you can pause it and try to do the problems yourself, because I think sometimes I talk fast."
Let me throw you a curve ball.
What's one tenth minus one?
"Well, one doesn't even look like a fraction."
But you can write it as a fraction.
Well that's the same thing as one tenth minus-- how could we write one so it has the denominator of ten?
Right.
"It's the same thing as ten over ten, right? ten over ten is one."
"So one tenth minus ten over ten is the same thing as one minus ten-- remember, we only subtract the numerators, and we keep the denominator ten, and that equals negative nine over ten. one tenth minus one is equal to negative nine over ten."
Let's do another one.
"After all, the poison that doesn't kill you makes you stronger."
I have a friend.
He had another friend.
They become business associates together.
And they decided to expand their business into European expansion.
My friend was responsible for it.
"While my friend was busy with the European expansion, he was hit by the news that his friend has committed a massive financial fraud, and ran away."
"And, we are talking massive, we are talking mega dollars, because the business was dealing with those kinds of sums."
"My friend was investigated, suspected, but anyway, at the end of the story, although the investigations proved that my friend was innocent, and in fact, he was a victim, it destroyed his life in the country where he lived, and he had to leave."
"In the other country, where he went maybe about 2-3 months later,  he was hit by another crisis that hit him in a very personal way."
Something that only his wife and I know.
"Nobody else knows, not even his family."
"You'd say, by that time, he should be finished."
He's done.
Two major crisis in your life almost instantly.
But he managed to stand up again.
He managed to rise again.
"Right now, he is facing another crisis, another major disappointment."
"But I look at his face, and I see a defined man."
I see a man who refuses to give up.
I see a man who's still trying to build up his life.
He reminds me of a story.
And this is where I want to end this.
My time is almost done.
"Of a man who enters into a fight, one of those ancient fights, there were no rings at the time, they used to fight in the open."
And he gets beaten up in his face and he falls flat on the ground.
He rises up again and is hit again.
"Every time he rises up, he is hit again, third, fourth time, he's down on the ground. trying to rise up, he thinks in his head,"
"""If I'm able to stand up again, it's because I refuse to stay down."
"And if I do stand up, and I'm hit again and I'm never able to rise up at least it will happen while I was fighting."
"At least it will happen while I was on my feet."""
"The Chinese have a saying, and I want to say this to myself to you guys, and to Yemen."
"Twenty-two, (dancing like),"
"Twenty-two, (yeah, yeah)!"
"Twenty-two, (yeah, yeah, yeah)!"
It feels like one of those nights!
"(Twenty-two), we ditch the whole scene."
It feels like one of those nights!
"(Twenty-two), we won't be sleeping."
It feels like one of those nights!
"(Twenty-two), you look like bad news,"
"I gotta have you, I gotta have you!"
"We all have brushes called ""being ourselves"""
"Look, with just a little bravery you can change it into any color"
Let's draw our hopes
How far does this sky continue?
The world we know is so narrow
"When we hear somebody's voice asking for help, we decide to pretend we didn't hear it"
By fighting we reaffirm the worth of our existence and then find doubt in our hearts
"Finding differences to not be ""individualities"" but ""enemies"", we become stubborn and push others away"
Our relationships with people became dominating and not something that ties together
Hold my hands and listen to my voice
"The world becomes colorful, you don't have to hate since you can bond beautifully"
"There are no useless lives, let's accept each other"
The infinitely extending canvas becomes dyed in hope
"We all have brushes called ""being ourselves"""
"Look, with just a little bravery you can change it into any color"
Let's draw our hopes
[music begins]
"Empty spaces, what are we living for"
"Abandoned places, I guess we know the score"
"On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for"
"Another hero, another mindless crime"
"Behind the curtain, in the pantomime"
"Exactly, so there's just nothing there."
"These guys are grass finishing, they go literally from here..."
In fact 12 of these are going to go to slaughter tomorrow.
"So they go directly from here, right to the abattoir."
What do you do in the winter?
Cause obviously the pasture isn't available in the winter.
At least in most of the continental US.
"Yeah, what happens is, with this grazing management, we're able to stockpile grass, just by not allowing them to graze late in the season, into the winter."
"The average farm in our area feeds hay 120 days a winter, we feed hay only 40 days a winter."
"We've greatly reduce the amount of hay we have to feed, which is less hay we have to make,"
less hay we have to feed.
How do you do that?
"By controlling the grazing with moving the animals everyday to a new paddock, and allowing rest periods to deny access to certain pastures late in the season so that it just stands on the stalk going into the winter."
It's OK to eat that fresh.
"Absolutely, even when it frosts, and it turns brown it's still better than hay."
So that's what we do going into the winter.
"You are able to cut it down to two thirds, the amount of hay that they require?"
"Yes, yes."
And this is something that most typical beef producers could do if they chose to.
Everyone of them.
Relatively easily.
From Florida to...
"What's interesting is, it doesn't have anything to do with latitude, because the average farmer in Florida feeds hay for 120 days a year."
"In illinois, 120 days a year."
"In Saskatchewan, 120 days a year."
It's part of the job description.
Cattle farmer: feed hay 120 days a year.
"If you can manage the grazing so that you can get that hay out, it greatly affects your bottom line because that's all mechanically harvested, stored..."
"When they're in the hay feeding season, whatever the time that is, is it necessary to supplement with grains or anything like that?"
That's what many beef raisers will tell you.
"And vigorously so, and deny that there's any other way that is possible or practical."
I wonder if you could address that?
"Since they couldn't pay me, I had no money to move,"
"I had to always go on foot, sometimes covering large distances."
Then I had two options:
Or I ate ...
Or paying service.
More often than not I ate!
"Therefore, the Ministry is not a choice, but it is something that is interlaced with your destiny and discover gradually that you grow up with God."
You can not escape.
"Then, I dedicated myself, and many more."
"I sweated, I cried, I gave blood for this Ministry."
"I asked for help, several times I've been betrayed, because well ... they are seen as a small anonymous preacher."
And then ...who wants to stand on the side of a poor failed?
"But in the end, you realize that from the evidence there is so much more and you don't stop, I can say that Gap was my life in these 12 years."
"It was what God used to form my character, and if I were to go back, confront all that I faced ...be called a beggar, a dreamer,"
"I'd never done anything, that I was a poor dumb because I was moving away from those ministries that would give me a lot."
I would do it all again.
Without thinking twice.
"Because I was granted the honour and grace to see lives reclamation, preparing Ministers fans who are not afraid of nothing, not even death."
"Then, Gap has been a passionate dedication of my heart."
Q:
Gap doesn't give you any financial support?
A:
No.
Q: are you working now?
"A: look, seeing the need that have the Gap, I always preferred full-time work.For this I've tried so far work .... but Gap does not remunerarmi, and I will soon find a job according to my education."
"The fact is that we always need a hand, this resource is our needs: we need more people possible, capable and with a real call. to help us."
"There are many cases of suicide in universities: people who have a desperate need, and what I need is not being able to do more."
It's always a drama to fail to muster enough people to do more.
"Q: you're invited to preach in other countries, travel a lot?"
A:
I've never traveled in my life.
"I preached a lot in Fortaleza, and I helped in the formation of leaders in these 10 years as a mentor."
"Finite State Machines, adding a lexer that follows them automatically,"
"Context Free grammars, parsing, having a parser thet flow through automatically."
And I can only say that I really agree:
I have written a number of little languages in my time to scratch various hitchies.
I think it's a very important tool to have under ones' belt.
Academic research can be deceptively difficult.
"Sure, there's a lot to be found on the internet, but how do you know which sources to trust?"
How do you find the specific information you need?
"And once you have your information, how do you go about starting your project?"
The Sheridan Library can help eliminate some of the guesswork.
The library has more resources than you may realize to help you with your research.
"We have books to inform and inspire, or, put you at center stage."
"We have periodicals to keep you on top of what's happening now,"
and databases to put you on the leading edge;
"Videos to help bring information to life,"
"or, to help you breathe life into what you imagine;"

Sorry about that guys
Hi!
So this week we are discussing women and comedy.
"And you'd probably be forgiven for thinking that there aren't that many women in the comedy scene,"
Man:
"But that's just because women are biologically more funny than women, everyone knows that..."
That's just people trying to increase available calories.
But one revolution leads to another.
"And pretty soon you have this, as far as the eye can see."
"Many historian also argue that without agriculture we wouldn't have the bad things that come with complex civilization, like patriarchy, inequality, war, and, unfortunately, famine."
"And as far as the planet is concerned, agriculture has been a big loser."
"Without it, humans would never have changed the environment so much, building dams, and clearing forests, and more recently drilling for oil that we can turn into fertilizer."
"Many people made the choice for agriculture independently, but does that mean that that was the right choice?"
"Maybe so, and maybe not."
"But regardless, we can't unmake that choice."
And that's one of the reasons why I think it is so important to study history.
"History reminds us that revolutions are not event, so much as they are processes."
"That for tens of thousands of years, people have been making decisions that irrevocably shaped the world that we live in today."
"Just as today we are making subtle, irrevocable decisions that people in the future will remember as revolutions."
"Next week, we are gonna journey to the Indus River...very fragile our globe."
"We're going to travel to the Indus River Valley, I will see you then."
june twenty second twenty twelve
Where the dogs arew howling all day long
Where the stands are the something something
Where the windows are breathing in the light
Where the rooms are a collection of our lives
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place
That I call my home.
"8's Head, here we go.."
"Okay, number off from bow when you're ready, nice and loud"
Number off
Easy.
"Can I have 2, just 4, 6 and stroke tapping on"
That'll do.
Easy
"Where are we at, guys?"
"Rich, you ready?"
What happens when we have different denominators?
"Well, hopefully it won't be too difficult."
Let's say I have one fourth plus one half.
Let's go back to that original pie example.
Let me draw that pie.
"So this first one fourth right here, let's just color it in, that's this one fourth of the pie."
And now I'm going to eat another one half of the pie.
So I'm going to eat one half of the pie.
So this one half.
I'll eat this whole one half of the pie.
So what does that equal?
"Well, there's a couple of ways we could think about it."
"First we could just re-write one half. one half of the pie, that's actually the same thing as two fourths, right?"
There's one fourth here and then another one fourth here.
"So one half is the same thing as two over four, and we know that from the equivalent fractions module."
"So we know that one fourth plus one half, this is the same thing as saying one fourth plus two fourths, right?"
"And all I did here is I changed the one half to a two fourths, by essentially multiplying the numerator and the denominator of this fraction by two."
And you can do that to any fraction.
"As long as you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number, you can multiply by anything."
That makes sense because one half times one is equal to one half.
You know that.
"Well another way of writing one is one half times two over two. two over two is the same thing as one, and that equals two over four."
The reason why I picked two is because I wanted to get the same denominator here.
I hope I'm not completely confusing you.
"Well, let's just finish up this problem."
"So we have one fourth plus two fourths, so we know that we just add the numerators, three, and the denominators are the same, three fourths."
"And if we look at the picture, true enough, we have eaten three fourths of this pie."
Let's do another one.
Let's do one half plus one third.
"Well once again, we want to get both denominators to be the same, but you can't just multiply one of them to get -- there's nothing I can multiply three by to get two, or there's no, at least, integer I can multiply three by to get two."
And there's nothing I can multiply two by to get three.
So I have to multiply both of them so they equal each other.
"And Mozilla has been blessed with all three: immense effort, tremendous skill and this luck that things appear."
"So, Mitch appeared and he essentially arm wrestled AOL for that seed money."
We look at the 2 million dollars and we thought that we could support maybe 10 people for two years.
"Because we had set down as mozilla.org and thought that to be effective as a project, the minimum number of people we needed was 10."
Running the machines was one person.
"You know, we keep the project alive but we couldn't be successful."
And Mitch had pitched a little bit of other money and IBM and Sun were our first commercial partners and they pitched in some money and started maybe with 12 or 13 employees.
What that meant was:
"Johnny Stenback and D Baron, that was the platform team."
"One person on Firefox for the front-end team, one person on Thunderbird, one release engineer,"
"Chofmann as an engineering manager,"
"Mick did the ultimate sacrifice and ran our systems for us, for a year or two before we were able to get him back into a role that really fit him better, we had one person helping us on sustainability,"
"Brendan as Brendan, and me trying to be successful."
And that was it.
And that seemed like a lot to us.
[Question]
"That's right, I forgot Asa"
How can I forget Asa?
[Question]
And project management.
And still.
"From that day till now, phenomenal."
"Whenever I have a problem with my browser, Asa is always able to figure out what it is."
So that's it.
No one else can ever do that.
[Question]
"All of a sudden, we had our own independence."
"It was pretty scary, 10 people is not really enough, there was no ongoing financial sustainability that we knew of, it was a gamble, but we had our own independence and we could make a product."
We made phenomenal changes in that period.
It was our second set of phenomenal changes.
"When we were founded we made up an organisation that was revolutionary, as Chofmann described."
How do you work with a company?
"And near the ha nd, the garage is going to be low ends contracted."
"So, the garage is going to be even narrower than it really is."
"So, in the ladder frame we obtain the following picture and the two seem to be in conflict."
"In the picture on the left, the"
ladder is in the garage.
"In the picture on the right, there is no way the ladder could be in the garage cuz the garage is even shorter than its rest length which is as it is shorter than a ladder as we see at the top."
"You can make the puzzle sharper by saying, imagine that at the instant over here on the frame on the left where the ladder is inside the garage, I closed both doors."
What happens then?
Now
I have a ladder in the garage.
"Well, now it's not ambiguous."
The doors are closed.
"So, let's resolve this issue. there is, as always no real paradox."
There's only confusion.
"And the confusion, as I said, is always to do with simultaneity."
"And,"
I'll solve this problem twice.
"The first time, algebraically, using Lorentz"
Transformation.
"And then, I'll demonstrate, graphically how this solution works and along the way, play with space time diagrams, and what we can or cannot read off of them."
But I want to convince you that Lorentz Transformations are useful.
"So, to use Lorentz Transformations, what we do is, we have to be very careful that we're not talking about wishy-washy things, we want to be very specific about what are the things we're talking about."
"And the things we talk about are events, things that happened."
"And they happened a particular place, at a particular time."
"So what are the things we know? in order to use coordinates, I'm going to set up my usual space time diagram if you want, or my coordinates."
I'm going to have the black coordinates presenting the garage because
I'm thinking of the garage as at rest.
And the latter is moving to the right and its coordinates as seen by the garage are t prime and x prime.
I have to pick an origin for each of these.
"So I will pick the left end of the garage, remember the"
ladder is moving to the right.
So the left end of the garage is going to be the origin for coordinates on the garage.
So you've essentially gone from hundreds of channels in your TV line-up to millions of channels just with the implementation of a browser.
How do you search all of this content?
"Well, we thought of that, too."
"So I'm going to bring down the search box again, and from here I can type in the name of a channel and"
I could see that right now this is a show that's playing.
"With one click, I tune there and I'm done."
People don't have as much time as they used to.
We want to get them there quicker.
"But the search box is interesting not just for channel searches, but we can search for anything."
Let me search for Star Trek.
You'll see here that we're integrating
TV search as well as pages from the web.
I can even search TV and video content and this takes me to a page where I can access all the content about Star Trek that I ever want to watch.
I can browse movies.
"I can go to specific shows, specific episodes, and even clips from the web."
"Now, it doesn't matter what's on right now."
What matters is what do I want to watch?
Google TV lets me watch it.
And this is--some of this is free and some of this is paid.
We're doing integrations with different video on demand providers to allow users to pay for things instantly and watch them immediately on their TV.
"So now you have all your TV, you have all of the web, and you have a way to search it all."
It gets even better.
I'm going to go to my home screen really quickly and navigate to one of my recordings for Top Gear.
"Now, this specific episode of Top Gear is all about the Ferrari."
And let's just say for a minute that I was so captivated by this show that
I wanted to buy a Ferrari.
Check this out.
"With one button, I can collapse the screen into a smaller screen size and I do a search for a ""buy a Ferrari""."
"Granted, this is just a demo, I'm not really going to buy one today."
"Now, I can go online and do that just now."
"Now, you can imagine all of the use cases where this can be very compelling."
I'm watching a breaking news story and I want to go see what people are saying on Twitter or Facebook or I'm watching a game show like Jeopardy and I want to go cheat and get the answer before the people on TV do.
So I guess the books get stacked that way.
"And they labeled this right here, this dimension is x."
"And they're saying, will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia fit upright in the book rack shown above?"
So essentially I'm going to put the first 10 in there.
"So the first statement they say, is that x is equal to 50 centimeters."
"Well, that doesn't help me because I don't know how big the first 10 volumes of the encyclopedia are."
"If each of them are, at least the first 10 are,"
"less than 5 centimeters each or on average less than 5 centimeters, then maybe I could fit them."
But one by itself doesn't help me.
Two:
12 of the volumes have an average thickness of 5 centimeters.
"Well, that doesn't help me either because remember, they're saying will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia?"
"Maybe the 12 that have an average thickness of 5 centimeters, maybe those are the volumes 8 through 20 and maybe volumes 1 through 7 have an average thickness of 50 centimeters each or 5 million centimeters each."
So even both of these conditions combined don't help me know if I can definitely fit the first 10 volumes of the 20 volume encyclopedia.
So that is E.
Both statements together are still not sufficient.
Problem 39.
A circular tub--
"OK, so they've drawn this circular-looking tub."
So the top looks like that.
And then there's two sides.
Let's me see how well I can construct what they've drawn.
And the bottom looks something like that.
"And then they shade in a little area, a strip of this, like that."
And they say a circular tub has a painted band has a band painted around its circumference as show above.
So this is the painted band around its circumference.
What is the surface area of the painted band?
And they tell us that the height of the painted band is x.
"So in order to essentially know the surface area, you'd have to know the height, which is x, times the circumference of the circle,"
Right? which would be the length.
"So if you knew the height times circumference of the circle, you'd be able to know the surface area."
"So they tell us, the first statement, x is equal to 0.5, whatever, meters."
"let's say it's this one fourth of the pie, right?"
And we're going to add it to another one fourth of the pie.
Let's make it this one-- let me change the color-- pink.
"This one fourth, this pink one fourth is this one fourth of the pie."
"So if I were to eat both one fourths, or one fourth and then I eat another one fourth, how much have I eaten?"
"Well, you could look from just the picture,"
I have now eaten two out of the four pieces of the pie.
"So if I eat one fourth of a piece of pie or one fourth of a pie, and then I eat another one fourth of a pie,"
I will have eaten two fourths of the pie.
"And we know from the equivalent fractions module that this is the same thing as that I've eaten one half of the pie, which makes sense."
"If I eat two out of four pieces of a pie, then I've eaten one half of it."
"And if we look at it mathematically, what happened here?"
"Well the denominators or the bottom numbers, the bottom numbers in the fraction stayed the same."
Because that's just the total number of pieces that I have in this example.
"Well, I added the numerators, which makes sense."
"I had one out of the four pieces of pie, then I ate another one out of the four pieces of pie, so I ate two out of the four pieces of pie, which is one half."
Let me do a couple more examples.
What is two fifths plus one fifth?
Well we do the same thing here.
We first check to make sure the denominators are the same.
We'll learn in a second what we do when the denominators are different.
"If the denominators are the same, the denominator of the answer will be the same."
"And we just add the numerators. two fifths plus one fifth is just two plus one over five, which is equal to three over five."
And it works the same way with subtraction.
"If I had three over seven minus two over seven, that just equals one over seven."
"I just subtracted the three, I subtracted the two from the three to get one and I kept the denominator the same."
Which makes sense.
"If I have three out of the seven pieces of a pie, and I were to give away two out of the seven pieces of a pie,"
I'd be left with one of the seven pieces of a pie.
So now let's tackle-- I think it should be pretty straightforward when we have the same denominator.
"Remember, the denominator is just the bottom number in a fraction."
Numerator is the top number.
They targeted Harry Belafonte.
They targeted Eartha Kitt.
"They targeted anyone who supported the struggle for civil rights, that they considered to be dangerous."
It is in that context we need to look at what happened on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973.
"What they call Joanne Chesimard, what we know as Assata Shakur, she was targeted by the FBl, stopped."
And the allegation that she was a cold-blooded killer is not supported by any of the forensic evidence.
"If we look at the trial, we'll find that she was victimized, she was shot."
She was shot in the back.
The bullet exited and broke the clavicle in her shoulder.
She could not raise a gun.
She could not raise her hand to shoot.
And she was shot while her hands were in the air.
"Now, that is the forensic evidence."
There is not one scintilla of evidence placing a gun in her hand.
No arsenic residue was found on her clothing or on her hands.
"So, the allegation by the state police that she took an officer's gun and shot him, executed him in cold blood, is not only false,  but it is designed to inflame."
JUAN GONZÁLEZ:
"But, Mr. Hinds, before we get into more of the details of the case, this whole issue of 40 years later—"
LENNOX HlNDS:
Yeah.
"UAN GONZÁLEZ: —suddenly branding her a terrorist and also insisting that she is a threat to the United States government at this time, could you talk about the significance of that declaration?"
LH:
"Well, I believe that we have to look at it in the context of what has just happened in Boston."
"I think that with the massacre that occurred there, the FBI and the state police are attempting to inflame the public opinion to characterize her as a terrorist, because the acts that she was convicted of has nothing to do with terrorism."
"The acts that she was convicted of, if you look at the evidence, she was convicted of aiding and abetting, and therefore was present during the shootout."
The FBI and the state police's theory was that Sundiata Acoli shot Officer Foerster.
That was their theory during his trial.
JG:
"One of the people in the car with her, that—"
LH:
"One of the people in the car, yeah."
AG:
"I used to spend a lot of time on commercial fishing boats, and I remember fishermen saying they can tell when a basking shark has been caught in a net, because it leaves a black slime behind."
So that must have come from the shark.
"Now, we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable."
We would use conventional methods;
"I have a crossbow -- you see it in my hand there, which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well."
"So I tried that, I tried many techniques."
"All it was doing was breaking my arrows, because the shark's skin is just so strong."
There was no way we were going to get a sample from that.
That wasn't going to work.
"So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat,"
"I thought, ""If you take what you're given in this world ..."""
So I scraped it off.
I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists.
"So I scraped the slime off and sent it to Aberdeen, and said, ""You might try that."""
And they sat on it for months.
It was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man.
"But I kept emailing Les, saying,"
"""Have you had a chance to look at my slime?"""
"And he was like, ""Yeah, yeah."
"Later."""
He thought he'd better do it because I never met him before; he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him.
And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime.
"They amplified it and they tested it, and they found, yes, this was actually basking shark DNA, which was got from the slime."
So he was very excited.
"It became known as ""Simon's shark slime."""
"And I thought, ""Hey, you know, I can build on this."""
"So we thought, OK, we're going to try to get out and get some slime."
So having spent three-and-a-half thousand on satellite tags ...
"I then thought I'd invest 7.95 -- the price is still on it -- in my local hardware store in Kilrush for a mop handle, and even less money on some oven cleaners."
And I wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle and ... (Laughter)
I was desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks.
"And this was into August now, and normally sharks peak in June, July, and you rarely see them, or rarely can be in the right place to find sharks into August."

Professor Charles Bailyn:
"Okay, here's the plan for today."
I want to do one last foray into relativity theory.
"And this is going to be a tricky one, so I hope you're all feeling mentally strong this morning."
"If not, we--gosh, we should have ordered coffee for everyone."
"And, in so doing, I want to introduce one key concept, and also answer at least three of the questions that you guys have asked before in a more--in more depth, and also relate the whole thing back to black holes."
"And then, having done that, we'll have some more questions."
"And then, having done that, I want to get back to astronomy; that is to say, to things in the sky that actually manifest these relativistic effects."
"So, that's where we're going today."
"And along the way, as I said, we'll deal with some of the questions you've been asking in a deeper kind of way."
"In particular--so, questions."
Watch out for the answers to these questions.
No rumours were published.
"I know that sounds obvious, but it's not as easy as it sounds [laughter]."
"It's not that easy, and no rumours were published."
"The only rumour that was heard one day was whether something had happened to a kid in Barcelona, but they immediately rectified... that is if they actually ever published it."
"They said over and over that nothing had happened, and asked people not to spread rumours."
"And in the end, everything works through soft leadership, where anyone can do what they want as long as it's inspired in the collective, very interesting projects appear."
"Take the Square, the 15-O (october) from the beginning, Stop Evictions as a warning and alert platform when there are evictions..."
"Things start to happen that transcend the traditional strategy of communication in social movements, and they transcend the strategy of political communication of any self-respecting political organization, they would love to have the richness of communication that the 15M had."
ST:
"Not related to what you've been talking about just now, although maybe it does form part of it, I'd like you to tell me what has the 15M done wrong?"
JL:
(thinking)
I don't know what to say... because to personify it's hard.
What has the 15M done right?
"15M, since I'm convinced it doesn't move..."
ST:
I define the 15M as a state of mind.
JL:
Exactly.
You could say that the 15M is a state of mind.
But I understand what you're saying.
"The black spots, right?"
ST:
Yes.
Things that weren't pretty?
"There have been obvious mistakes, others less obvious, some of them that you have experienced..."
JL:
I understand the problem with the media.
"I understand perfectly the grudge, or if you prefer another word"
less contemptuous: the indignation against the media.
That indignation can't disappear in three days.
There is damage that the media has done in the poverty of everything.
"I really want to communicate a message with everybody, I'd just tell everybody."
I certainly wouldn't pick languages that die off and things that are temporary.
-Thomas Payne made a very good argument that god would never use anything written to communicate a message.
-I happen to agree.
Maybe god knows something that I don't.
Maybe there really is some benefit to vaguely inspiring inviduals to write down those important messages on manuscripts that get lost and destroyed in languages that change and die.
But somehow I've missed the obvious benefit of all that.
-Right.
"If god really wanted to do that, he could have."
"But apparently he was unaware of this technology when he wrote with his finger, according to the bible, on stone tablets, the 10 commandments."
This is in Exodus.
"Instead, he used magic lightweight invisible crumble-stone."
Where do we get that?
"Well, it's magic because he made it."
"It's lightweight because Moses carried, a 90-year-old guy, was carrying them up and down the mountains."
"-But back then, 90 was like 20."
-I guess so.
"And invisible because we don't have any trace of them today and crumble-stone because they all broke, supposedly."
And god seems to have some issues with metal.
He hates these molten calves that they make of images of little calves that people were worshipping.
And he just thinks that's really awful.
And this is one of your favorites.
"In Judges 1:19,"
"'And the lord was with Judah, and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron.'"
Spooky.
Spooky.
"So, mostly likely the mythology surrounding the stone tablets was a coveting of some other stone tablets somewhere else, the Code of Hammurabi, dating to 1772 BCE, that currently exist, for real, unlike the stone tablets of Jewish"
law.
These are housed in the Louvre museum in Paris.
I've seen them.
"-Although to be fair, the 2nd set of stone tablets supposedly still exist, hidden away in the ark which supposedly still exists in a location that only the devout are aware of."
"Nice open format there, god."
But you still can have a circle of 35.
The circle comes from indigenous people's.
It is a long tradition and this is the most healing way that we can actually be together.
"I am a strong believer  in the circle but also using other variety in things like tribes which is a way to do small groups, and there are kinds of support  mechanisms for that."
Those are just a few little things that I would say.
"-(Man) That last one you said, a tribe?"
"- (J. Miller) Tribes, yes."
Jeanne Gibbs has written a book called 'Tribes'.
Many of our teachers in Ontario  and Toronto are using it.
It is a powerful technique for dealing with large groups and breaking things down.
It gives a guideline to how small groups can work.
Because you can't just put students in small groups and then give them a framework.
(J. Bell) I would like to offer another idea.
Sometimes I've seen teachers  scratch their heads.
What should we do about this issue  when the answers are among students?
"I think if we change our model from thinking we have to control and set it up to saying, ""We are building  a community together."""
"This takes a lot of time up front, setting the rules together, making contracts, agreements for each other, how do we want to treat each other, to talk with each other."
Establish all those things.
"What if somebody doesn't talk like that,  what should happen?"
"We should bring that up, how should  we handle 'the discipline' issues."
"If you create a collective experience, they are getting that sense of ownership, of democratic decision making, a being mindful of how their behavior is part of the mix."
It is much more and you have much less behavior problems if you have 35 students helping  to create the classroom culture.
There are lots of other things.
The use of constant appreciations and shout-outs.
What I noticed Tommy doing well the other day.
"Jose, how did he do well as a leader."
Keep building it a constant thing so they are inoculated with a sense of loving speech and respect and cooperation in the classroom.
It doesn't eliminate every problem  but it goes a long ways.

(Man in the audience) I am trying to still sort my thoughts as what exactly my question is.
Thank you first of all for the panel.
"I don't know, I feel like my mindfulness practice brings me closer to this conversation."
"I have to teach, right."
The curriculum is not outside of this.
"There are ways that we can definitely skillfully use curriculum, the choices that we make, so that they nourish the young people."
"We don't just cover them with stuff,  this is the thing, we just deliver the lesson with this type  of languages that we have in the school."
I am just sharing here.
I think there is this moment where touching and  really looking clearly at what is there.
"And then, that also begins to tells us  what is not there."
That begins to inform our practice in terms of other ways of being that we can occupy and  what we can offer into the classroom in the midst of the essay and  the pre-writing and the brainstorming and all the things that we are doing.
"I work in an English reading  and writing classroom, so I have been looking at how mindfulness is an expression of literacy of reading."
"What do you see,  what do I see as a teacher."
Do I see just a student?
Or do I see somebody that I don't like?
"Do I see my own perceptions,  and live through those perceptions?"
What am I listening to?
What can I hear?
Do I even have the space to hear?
Maybe I feel really overwhelmed.
So I just hear the noise and I get aggravated and I lash out.
"I think, I am using my professional practice and the language around teaching or the educationist things and trying to disrupt that a little bit,  to try to wrestle it back."
Just like we are doing here.
"We are trying to reclaim walking  so that it is nourishing for us. and not just this thing that ends up  wasting our energy, aggravating it."
"So, in your classrooms, all the things that you do in your classrooms, so many tests right, just to even started in the day."
"When you get into your classroom, what are some things you can do to re-purpose, re-energize, re-use, re-strategize,  deal, adapt that moment for yourself."
"So for instance,  we just got new computers, so I have to check them everyday."
So I can make that really aggravating for myself.
"Or I can sit, get my chair and sit there and breathe and take my time, right?"
"I sweep in my classroom, this is one thing I have to do."
"But you know,do I get angry, ""The kids, they don't know the trash can"", etc."
(Laughter)
"Or I take my time, I don't have to think, right?"
Even better.
"At this time though, the end results are dark in the viewport."
"Unlike Mental Mill, 3ds Max does not have a ""Brightness"" shader."
"Instead, you use the Gamma/Gain shader from the mental ray maps rollout."
You need to insert that node by dragging &amp;amp; dropping it on the connection  between the Phong illumination Node and the Map to Conversion node.
You can then adjust the Gamma/Gain parameters to suit your liking.
"If you wish, create a similar shader tree for the eyes,  using the supplied bitmaps."
"As you can see, building metaSL shader trees in 3ds Max  is a simple process."
It is not as elaborate as Mental Mill but does provide you  with the basic tools to build simple shader trees.
"If you are interested in Mental Mill, you can view the How-To movie  entitled:"
How to Use Mental Mill.
I do want to test this question we're all interested in:
Does extinction have to be forever?
I'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about.
One is the Thylacine Project.
"The other one is the Lazarus Project, and that's focused on the gastric-brooding frog."
"And it would be a fair question to ask, why have we focused on these two animals?"
"Well, point number one, each of them represents a unique family of its own."
We've lost a whole family.
That's a big chunk of the global genome gone.
I'd like it back.
The second reason is that we killed these things.
"In the case of the thylacine, regrettably, we shot every one that we saw."
We slaughtered them.
"In the case of the gastric-brooding frog, we may have ""fungicided"" it to death."
"There's a dreadful fungus that's moving through the world that's called the chytrid fungus, and it's nailing frogs all over the world."
"We think that's probably what got this frog, and humans are spreading this fungus."
"And this introduces a very important ethical point, and I think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up."
"What I think is important is that, if it's clear that we exterminated these species, then I think we not only have a moral obligation to see what we can do about it, but I think we've got a moral imperative to try to do something, if we can."
OK.
Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project.
It's a frog.
"And you think, frog."
See you!
Jana:
Byeeee!

Omg!
"This voice, guys!"

"Great, Dan Garcia couldn't make it today, so I'm here to replace him."
I am
"[INAUDlBLE] here at Berkeley I go by Rabbit and I'm one of the TA's, and today's lecture is about concurrency. today's news of the day is friendship paradox."
"Two weeks ago, a research project came to us, that they surveyed Facebook users."
It's pretty cool.
"And they found one, along other things."
"One of the things they found is that on average, your friends are more popular than you."
"This is weird, but on average, the average Facebook user has 250 Facebook friends, while their friends on average have 350."
Pretty interesting.
"What happens is this is actually a paradox that happens in real life everywhere and they are like gatekeepers that are, know a lot of people, and a lot of people know them, and they are very common, and chances are that you're friends with them and that would bring up the average rather than knowing the other people that know random people. other than that, personally, I'd like to tell you to double-check your Facebook privacy settings."
Your Facebook privacy settings have been changed and they changed about once a month and they changed it for you.
"So, double-check it."
Awesome.
"So, this is going to be hard."
Okay.
"So, today, we're talking with parallelism and there are two main types of parallelism, intra-computer and inter-computer."
"Intra is inside one computer and this is the idea of having multiple course, multiple CU, CPUs inside one computer, and then, they work together to solve one common problem. this happens in most computers nowadays, anything you buy has [INAUDlBLE] of course. inter-computer is bigger."
"It's the warehouse scale computers where you have thousands, hundreds of thousands of computers working together to solve a common problem."
"This is called distributed computing and there are two main types, grid and cluster computing."
"Grid computer, grid computing is the idea that you just took lots of computing, of computers and put them together."
"And, now you use them as one big computer and very strong one."
"This is useful, but it's not as uniform."
"Off-topic but, if that quote rings a bell, it might be because Oliver Stone blatantly plagiarized"
"Genghis Khan in the movie, ""Conan The Barbarian."""
2.
Is an extension of 1.
The Mongols were seriously brutal conquerors.
"I mean, not uniquely brutal, but still ..."
"The Mongols often destroyed entire cities, and most historians estimate the number they killed to be in the millions."
3.
Their empire didn't last.
"Within 80 years they'd left China and been replaced by a new dynasty, the Ming."
"And, in Persia, they blended in so completely that, by the 15th century, they were totally unrecognizable."
"I mean, they'd even taken up agriculture!"
Agriculture!
The last refuge of scoundrels who want to devote their lives to working instead of [skoodillypooping]!
4.
They also weren't particularly interested in artistic patronage or architecture.
"I mean, your palace may last forever, but my yurt can go anywhere."
5.
The Mongols were probably responsible for the Black Death.
"By opening up trade, they also opened up vectors for disease to travel; in the case of the Plague, via fleas infected with Yersinia pestis."
"And, at least, according to one story, the Mongols intentionally spread the plague by catapulting their plague-ridden cadavers over the walls of Caffa in the Crimea."
"While this primitive act of biological warfare might have happened, it's unlikely to be what actually spread the plague."
More likely it was the fleas on the rats in the holds of Black Sea ships that were trading with Europe.
"But, that trade only existed because of the Mongols."
"All right, Stan, one last time - cue the Mongol-tage."
(wild galloping music)
"So the Mongols promoted trade, diversity, and tolerance, and they also promoted slaughter and senseless destruction."
"And, what you think about the Mongols ends up saying a lot about you."
Do you value artistic output over religious diversity?
Is imperialism that doesn't last better or worse than imperialism that does?
"And, are certain kinds of warfare inherently wrong?"
"If you think those are easy questions to answer, then I haven't been doing my job."
"What happened was not just people passed them on and surprising numbers viewed them, the tone of response we got back astonished us."
"People laughed, people cried, people were inspired, people tell their friends."
"This word again, passion."
"We saw the passion and that was a clue, that was something bigger here."
"So, we made a decision in 2007 that TED really officially was no longer a conference."
TED was going to be this.
[Slide reads:]
We engineered the web site to be built around spreading free talks to the world.
"And to our astonishment and delight, TED community far from being upset that we were giving away the crown jewels, shared this on, it was a thrilling to see."
"So, where is this going?"
"In 2009, we've seen the continuation of this process."
"Just letting TED go free to the world, we had this Open Translation Project, which has been thrilling seeing literally hundreds of translators take TED, bring those talks to their own communities."
"And, now, this TEDx program, spreading the live events to the world."
Where is it heading?
"Well, the truth is I don't know."
"I think it's an incredible fact, an incredible discovery really that millions of people around the world are wanting knowledge."
"You know, they want this re-discovery of wonder."
They want the sense of possibility.
And they actually want to be part of shaping the future.
That's a surprise and that's thrilling in its own right.
"But, even more thrilling is this."
"TED is part of much bigger revolution in, I'd say, global education that's made possible by the web."
"It's an amazing fact that people like this can become a new type of global icon, that the role of teacher in our world is about to become sexy, wonderful, you know, I mean,  and it should have always been, right?"
But that hasn't been for the last few years.
Teachers can reach people across the world.
That is amazing.
"And I... if you ask what my dream was, I think the way I would answer it, would be to look at this picture here."
These are kids photographed in the village in Pakistan not far from where I was born.
Their parents would have been born about the same time as me.
"Unlike me, I had an education and got to live an amazing life, they didn't have that chance."
They lived a life griding out a living in tough conditions.
"They're beautiful children,  may have a different chance."
I'm sure there is something else she's into
"No, there is nothing else"
"Ohh, there's toothpaste on this shirt."
"Someone needs to invent invisible toothpaste, please."
I see your little tongue.
Why don't you show everyone?
Look at that little tongue.
Yes.
Today's video's gonna be a little bit angry.
Little bit.
It's gonna be sort of a rant.
"So if you don't have time for that, then there's plenty of other things on the Internet for you to consume yourself with, so just go ahead and click off."
"So I don't think I've ever done this on my channel before, where I address, like, one thing that someone's said or written,"
"But I'm gonna do that today, because it's relevant and also because I think I can help people."
"What I want to talk about has to do with this fucking, absolute dickhead who wrote maybe one of the dumbest things I've ever read."
And his name is [fumbling pronunciation]
"Yuksel Aytug — I don't know how to fucking say that — wrote an article about how the Olympic Games are, quote, ""killing womanhood."""
Let me just read to you some of this article.
And I'm gonna link it below so you can go look at it.
"He's Turkish, I think the original article is written in Turkish, so this is a translation, but you'll get the gist of it."
"Basically what he's saying is that their bodies don't look like women, and to ""take a look at female swimmers."""
"""Broad-shouldered, flat-chested women with small hips."""
"They're ""totally indistinguishable from men."""
"""Their breasts — the symbol of womanhood, motherhood — flattened into stubs as they were seen as mere hindrances to speed."""
"He said the Olympics force women to ""look more like men,"" and ""the manlier you look the more successful you are."""
"Then he said that you should get bonus points according to how ""feminine"" you looked."
"""Otherwise we will destroy the grace and naïveté of women through the Olympics."""
"First of all, since we're objectifying people as tits and ass,"
"I'm gonna show you a picture of Ayteg [mispronounced], fucking whatever his name is."
"We're gonna call you ""Ponytail"" from now on."
"Now, I don't think that most people would agree with Ponytail."
"And, in fact, a lot of the Internet was angry, so I'm not going to try and slam him, for obvious reasons."
I know the labor HHS subcommittee's due the 26th.
I think most have planned it on that day.
Brad:
"Let's talk for just a minute about what that involves, because we've just been engaging with our community, many of whom are on the webinar today."
What's the strategy for the member request?
Are you seeking to be going out with Senator Collins on a broad-based letter?
Hopefully we can get 34 Senators or more.
Elyse:
Yes.
That's the hope and plan.
We are currently working with Senator Collins on finalizing a letter which we hope to get done in the next couple of days so that we can start circulating.
"The process is compressed this year because we only just finished up the FY ""13 process a few weeks ago and passing that continuing resolution for the rest of the year."
So now we're in this turn around.
We thought we would have a bit more time on these letters.
Chairwoman Mikulski really wants to get the process started.
The House is moving on a much faster clip with their member request deadline.
We're in this period where we're going to try to get this letter out in the next couple of days and share it with you so you can share it with your membership.
"And hopefully we will have the same kind of broad-based push for this letter as we did for the FY ""13 letter."
"Those kinds of efforts among the state directors and the people on the field to go out and call members of Congress, in this case the Senate, to say, ""This is an important issue, and I really would like you to sign this letter""."
That helps us get the signatures.
"The more signatures we have, the more signatures we can show, the better off we are in terms of trying to get a better number on the Senate Appropriations bill."
Last year the number was higher and we want to see the same this year.
Brad:
Absolutely.
Thanks to Senator Reed's efforts and Senator Collins for working together to get that number up to $145 million last year.
"But, very well said on the importance of the stake holder direct communication with the members."
Arley and I are on the Hill virtually every day.
"They see us, they know us, but when they hear from their own states and districts it makes such a huge, huge difference."
Elyse:
It's that human's touch.
That on the ground level knowing a constituent is calling.
You need both.
"But, I were working on a portrait, someone's face, then I'd probably would lower the Detail slider and increase the Masking slider because I don't want every little detail in a subject's skin to be exaggerated by sharpening."
Now I wanna mention that these sharpening controls affect the entire image but if you wanna apply more or less sharpening to a specific area you can do that using one of the two local tools which I'll cover in the next chapter; the adjustment brush and the graduated filter.
And I'll also mention that sometimes you can apply a sharpening preset and that will do all the work for you.
Lightroom does shift with the number of presets.
Those are located over here in the left column in the Presets Panel which I'll open by clicking this triangle.
The presets in Lightroom 4 are inside of
Subject Matter folders.
These are User Presets and in the User Presets there is a folder of Lightroom General Presets.
"And here, I have two Sharpening presets that come with the program."
A Sharpening preset for faces and another for scenes like this one and you can certainly try those out at least as the starting place and then you can tweak the sliders to taste.
Were you fooled?
It's not that tricky.
The answer is still the same.
"Energy is an amazing quantity, but before we can start making calculations using it, we're going to need to learn about something called potential energy."
"-What's happenin', forum?"
"So imagine that you're in your bedroom, getting undressed and you're butt-ass naked."
But then you look out your window and you see this pervert.
Buhh...
"Now, I don't know this perverted cat's name, so we'll just call him Quagmire."
"Now, Quagmire's video got, like, a half million views and I don't know why."
"I mean, look at him."
Just creepin'.
Waiting for you to leave the room so he can sneak in and sniff your underwear.
"And what's with cats, you know?"
"I mean, a dog might rape your leg, but he isn't gonna cut off your penis and wear it like a mask"
like this freakin' stalker.
Buhh...excuse me while I go take a shower.
"Okay, I actually didn't want to review the next video, but like literally billions of you sent it to me."
"Literally, billions... or hundreds, but you know, who's counting?"
So this awful video got like a million-and-a-half views in a day after it was promoted on FailBlog.
And you know what?
Just here...enjoy.

So I'm gonna step back.
How did Firefox come into being?
"Firefox had started in a few years before, in 2001 maybe, where it became clear that the old products had a bunch of problems."
"Not only was it really built for developers and much too powerful, not too powerful but not elegant and not beautiful on how it displayed its power."
"And it was a combined browser, email client, IRC client, app launcher environment."
"This was a cause of intense fighting and so a small group of engineers went off and had an idea for doing something more elegant, just a browser, that was focussed on a product a family would want to use."
So there were five or six of them.
[Question]
Yeah.
So Dan says a couple of those guys were at Netscape working on the suite as their day job and during their spare time some were community members and some were not engineers like Asa was involved
"So that had been bubbling a lot for a while, and so on."
It wasn't anywhere near done and it was both a source of a relief and some contention for the engineers working on it.
Was there more you wanted to say?
Ok.
"So it had been bubbling a lot and existed in a source code repository,"
I think when we formed the foundation it was 0.2 or maybe 0.3.
That's probably a good time to tell the story of the name of Firefox.
"So when it was first started, the engineers thought"
"""wow we're building a new browser out of the ashes of Mozilla 1.0"" and so it was named Phoenix."
[Question]
For a really non-product but Mozilla/Browser when it came to have a name it was Phoenix.
"Well, there is a company, Phoenix Technologies, it's a BlOS company, it's been around forever, they once had a browser kind of thing and so the World of Trademarks contacted us and said we couldn't use the name Phoenix and we looked at it and they were probably right, they had a product that was pretty close."
"So of course, from Phoenix, the next obvious name is Firebird."
"So our browser was Firebird for one or two releases and it turns out there was, and still is, an open source database project by the name of Firebird."
[Question]
"We used to have this beautiful, little bird: the mountain plover; also gone."
"This is sobering information, so what can we do?"
We can choose a better future.
"Let's apply the empathy that we have for our cats, dogs, and other pets to endangered species like this chimpanzee, but all endangered species."
Let's have fewer children; that's one of the most powerful-- (Applause)
- Thank you! - (Applause)
- I didn't expect that response. -
"That's one of the most powerful things that we can do in the United States; if we want to have kids, great; let's have two."
"If want to have more than two kids, let's adopt."
What else can we do?
"Well, we won't go there."
"So, what else can we do?"
We can help educate girls and provide economic opportunity to women in developing countries.
(Applause)
Amen!
"When we do that, those ladies choose to have to have smaller families, and we have more nutrition, more health care, more education for their kids, and the impact on the global population is huge."
"Finally, what we can do is we can give more to our planet."
"We can give half of our donations, let's say, to people and people-related causes, and half of our donations to the planet, to ocean conservation, to wildlife conservation."
"I want to mention, by the way, that today, we only give about 2 to 5% of all giving that goes to environment and wildlife as a category."
"You've been very patient with sometimes, a difficult topic;"
"I just want to say that the thing to think about is do we change, as a species, what do we do, so that our fellow living beings who happen not to be human can thrive alongside of us a 100, 500, and 1,000 years from now."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
"-- Hi, Jonathan!"
"Can you tell us who you are, please?"
"-- So I am the CTO at Normation, a company I founded in Paris, France, back in 2009."
I've basically a sysadmin background.
I've been using CFEngine since 2009 when the version 3 came out.
-- And can you tell us what is the role of Normation in CFEngine?
-- Normation is specialized in configuration management automation in general. we've actually been leading CFEngine training sessions across the world since 2011.
I think that to this state we've trained more than 150 people in CFEngine
I think the first session was in Paris for obvious reasons -- because we're based there.
Even in the presence of cycles in our relation.
"This is an important conversation for our children, for our communities, for Democrats, and Republicans .Speaking is difficult but I need to say something important:"

"I'm going to start with a quote by the Dalai Lama,"
"""Today, more than ever before,"
"life must be characterized by a sense of universal responsibility not only nation to nation and human to human but human to other forms of life."""
That's what I'm here to talk about;
"I'm passionate about wildlife conservation, thus, other forms of life."
"In the last ten years, I've done everything I can to learn as much as I can about it."
"I've read books, I've talked to experts,"
"I've gone to conferences, and traveled the world."
I wanted to see for myself what's going on in these places.
"I visited chimpanzees in Uganda,"
I visited mountain gorilla families in Rwanda.
"Everywhere I go, the root cause of the dwindling numbers of these species is human population pressure."
"A recent visual example I saw of this is in Uganda, with farms going up the hillside right to the boundary of Bwindi National Park, part of the last remaining habitat for the mountain gorilla."
Let's talk about population.
"We're at 6.7 billion people in the world today, expected to rise to nine or ten billion just in the next 40 years."
The problem is we've already got a billion people who don't have enough to eat.
"What is it going to be like when we increase the pressure, the human population pressure, by another 50%?"
"So, I think, what we are going to have are more conflicts, more wars over scarcer resources,"
less drinking water per person.
"We're going to have less food per person, more disease, and suffering."
"It's difficult to comprehend, but that's suffering on a global scale when we are talking about billions of people."
I know this is sobering to think about.
- Have you seen it?
Just asking.
- Why did you ask?
- What?
Wait here.
I'll be back.
"- OK, just go."
How's the giant ghost bat?
Giant ghost bat my ass.
"Che, it's a pity you don't get to see a giant ghost bat."
I'm scared.
I'm scared?
Shit.
"Getting a sense for the way space time works in special relativity is very challenging and one of the ways that traditionally we Become accustomed to this and help wrap our minds around the weirdness, is to challenge ourselves with paradoxes."
"Almost invariably, they end up having to do with simultaneity because it's the relativity of what right now means that is really so current to everything that we are used to seeing."
"So, in this optional clip, I'm going to take advantage of my time and go through two of the most famous paradoxes in special relativity and discuss them in some detail and hopefully that will help clear things up and I suspect spur a lot of forum discussion because I'm not going to manage to clear everything up here."
"So let's start with a, a ladder paradox."
Ladder paradox is if you want urban parking problem.
The idea is you have a long
ladder of length L and the short garage of length G but G is less than L and you want to fit the long ladder into the short garage.
And the idea is very simple.
You come running with a ladder at the garage at a very high speed.
"Then, therefore the"
long ladder is going to be Lorentz contracted to the point if v is high enough where it is shorter than g.
"Notice that by making v close enough to c, I can make the Lorentz contracted ladder as short as I want."
"And voila, the ladder fix in the garage."
The ladder is fixed in the garage but note it only fixed in the garage while its moving very rapidly to the right.
"An obvious puzzle occurs because this may be true but relativity says I can look well, view the same situation from the point of view of somebody sitting on top of the ladder."
"And from the point of view of the ladder, the ladder is at rest, that's an inertial frame, the ladder is moving with a constant velocity to the right v. in the"
"ladder frame the ladder itself is stationary, while the garage is moving at exactly the same speed v but to the left approaching the ladder."
But from the
"ladder point of view, the ladder's length is L, its at rest."
"If you were to invoke the edit menu while you're on ""This Words"""
"There is an option in there that says ""replace."""
And replace essentially suggests misspellings.
But it does not do a document-wide check as you're used to with Microsoft Word or Word Perfect.
It does it on a word-by-word basis.
"Do you have a microphone or no? ...Zahir, oh, ok, good."
I want to make sure that people on the phone.. what Zahir was saying that
There is an edit mode that lets you go into a replace mode and it'll actually give you suggestions for a given misspelled word.
"But you can't do a document check for all of your errors like you can, with, you know, more sophisticated spell checkers."
I've never played with that.
"And when I get home, that's something I'm going to mess around with."
It sounds like it would be a good thing for me to know about.

For those of you who are Windows screen reader users-- when you are move letter by letter or word by word you are always on the character that you are landing on.
"And if you type, you're always going to push that character to the right."
"So whether you're moving three words or ten letters, it doesn't matter."
Your cursor is always going to end up on the character that will be pushed to the right if you type.
"With the i devices, the difference is significant, in that, if you arrow to the left you're before the word or letter."
"If you arrow to the right, you're after the letter."
"And one of the things I keep doing now is I'm hitting the Option Right arrow-- um, and I'm thinking I'm before the word, but I'm actually ending up after the word."
"So, I'm actually finding that a little confusing myself because I've been working on a Windows PC all week and this is a little bit different for me, cuz I haven't taken notes with this maybe in a week, week and half."
"So, let me see if I can quickly get this word fixed here for you guys."
"[Apple software speaking voice reading letters of the alphabet, speaking some words]"
"And what I'm showing you guys, and this is very interesting, you can tell, all the notes I take"
I email to myself.
I don't edit them on this device.
I email them to my PC.
And I edit them using Windows.
"I've always wanted to be able to teach everybody, every single person and that's not been easy and I don't think I can teach everybody."
"But this experiment, hopefully which becomes an ongoing activity in my"
"life, I feel like this gives me the ability to reach out to you on a one to one basis and hopefully."
"Make you learn, and be excited."
Finally.
I love change and uncertainty.
Because life would be pretty boring if I knew exactly what was going to happen when.
I know sometimes in life you want certainty.
But I'm talking about most of life.
Uncertainty is what gives you value in life.
So remember we are experimenting here.
I want you to come with that attitude.
I'm going to learn
"Finance in a new way, and I'm going to go with it."
There'll be glitches.
There'll be errors made along the way from your side.
"Maybe from technology, maybe from some errors in the assignments or so and so forth."
I'm almost sure we'll try our best not for that to happen.
"But if something happens, remember, you are a pioneer, I am a pioneer, and we are working on it together."
I'm looking forward to seeing you in a week.
And may the force be with you.
See you soon.
Bye.
"Often times we think about the dangers of vehicles on the highways, but we rarely think about how dangerous they can be when we're parked in a driveway."
"You know, probably more children die every year than we'll ever imagine from being backed over, from a caring, loving, parent, or a visitor, who never intended to cause harm to that child."
"You know, with children playing, they're not paying attention to what the adults are doing, or the drivers are doing."
"And even from inside the vehicle, they could even check both mirrors,"
"left / right, rear-view mirror, and think that they really are clear, and that they can't see anybody."
"But you'd be surprised how a child can somehow maneuver their way into the back of a vehicle, into a blindspot, and you may never even know they're there, until it's too late."
"Then the driver puts the car into reverse, backs out, and that's all it takes."
"It's going to be important for a person to know where the children are at, at all times."
"Maybe even to say, everybody could you move into the yard, or could you move onto the porch until we back away, and are out of the driveway altogether."
"And today, it's something enjoyed by about 300,000 people every day."
"Tela mentioned, more than 100 million TED talks have been viewed."
"When you think about that, it's strange, you know, 100 million lectures viewed on the Internet, who would've thought?"
How did it happen?
This event here today actually seems equally miraculous to me.
TED itself had really nothing to do with organizing it.
"And, trust me, organizing an event like this takes a huge amount of effort."
"And, yet, it's one of more than 100 would be held this year around the world as part of this TEDx program of independently organized TED events."
The program still in Beta hasn't really even started yet.
No one is making any money.
"This is being done for passion, curiosity."
How did that happen?
So I should warn you that the story I will tell it's not like a top-down plan of some determination to propagate TED to the world.
I think you'll discover TED has a life of its own.
"More mysterious than that, it's a story of a very strange, but I think beautiful, cultural phenomenon that has emerged out of a really remarkable community, which by the way includes you."
"So, TED past, present, and future."
TED started as an experiment in convergence.
"The brilliant Richard Wurman and Harry Marks figured it out 25 years ago that industries of technology, entertainment, and design were converging, that if you brought together the people from those 3 worlds, they would have interesting things to say to each other."
"So, it turned out the first TED held in 1984 showcased the brand-new Apple Macintosh and Sony showed off this strange, shiny, silver, round disks containing digital sounds which were the first CDs."
"And both objects, if you like, oozing technology, entertainment, and design."
People were wowed.
Event lost money and wasn't held again for another 6 years.
"But, after that -- (Laughter) after that it's been held annually,"
It really took off.
"And, strange things started to happen."
The content broadened.
"In addition to the T, E, and D, of TED, in came story tellers, adventurers, entrepreneurs, business leaders, just ordinary human beings with a surprising story to tell."
"Remarkably, instead of the audience going,"
"""oh, this is diluted."
"This is losing relevance to me."", they loved it."
Why?
Why?
(Guitar music throughout)
Music is a language.
Both music and verbal languages serve the same purpose.
They are both forms of expression.
They can be used as a way to communicate with others.
They can be read and written.
"They can make you laugh or cry, think or question, and can speak to one or many."
And both can definitely make you move.
"In some instances, music works better than the spoken word, because it doesn't have to be understood to be effective."
"Although many musicians agree that music is a language, it is rarely treated as such."
"Many of us treat it as something that can only be learned by following a strict regimen, under the tutelage of a skilled teacher."
"This approach has been followed for hundreds of years with proven success, but it takes a long time."
Too long.
Think about the first language you learn as a child.
"More importantly, think about how you learned it."
"You were a baby when you first started speaking, and even though you spoke the language incorrectly you were allowed to make mistakes."
"And the more mistakes you made, the more your parents smiled."
Learning to speak was not something you were sent somewhere to do only a few times a week.
And the majority of the people you spoke to were not beginners.
They were already proficient speakers.
Imagine your parents forcing you to only speak to other babies until you were good enough to speak to them.
You would probably be an adult before you could carry on a proper conversation.
"To use a musical term, as a baby, you were allowed to jam with professionals."
"If we approach music in the same natural way we approached our first language, we will learn to speak it in the same short time it took to speak our first language."
Proof of this could be seen in almost any family where a child grows up with other musicians in the family.
Here are a few keys to follow in learning or teaching music.
"In the beginning, embrace mistakes, instead of correcting them."
"Like a child playing air guitar, there are no wrong notes."
Allow young musicians to play and perform with accomplished musicians on a daily basis.
Encourage young musicians to play more than they practice.
The more they play the more they will practice on their own.
"Music comes from the musician, not the instrument."
"We have to want until next week to see, but it's, it's kind of clear to many of us that perhaps this larger arrangement, the network, the environment as a network might be greatly influencing the kinds of resource dependencies as well as the kinds of meaning."
Making and sense making that go on between firms in that environment.
Crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
Crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion

For the sake of Locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul
I walk down the sidewalk
Run down the boardwalk
Stop and make small talk
But I can't say no to you
"I can't say no, I can't say yes"
I can't even write down my own address
"I can't touch Heaven, it's a little too far"
It's the only way to travel
Got dreaming on a par
I'm staring through the window
Wondering where you are
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour
Across every nation
From the harbor to the station
It's a form of inspiration
It's a power to the state
They run down the railways
Sail across the seaways
Fly through the airways
But they can't say no to you
"I can't stand up, I can't stand still"
I know you wouldn't like it if I told you how I feel
I just want to say that it's only common sense
But the words always fail me at my own expense
"The ribosome is composed of a large and of a small subunit and these are depicted in the film as tumbling, rolling clusters of body amorphous by themselves, but organized and structured when in the act of translating the message."
First the small subunit with the aid of an initiation factor captures the message.
Then the first transfer RNA carrying its quanine amino acid is brought to the ribosome message complex by a second dancing initiation factor.
This requires energy and that is represented by a puff of smoke.
"Next the large ribosomal subunit tumbles into place and then the process of bringing each amino acid to the ribosome message complex is accomplished by the T-factor and its GTP cohert and so in the order prescribed by the balloon colors in the message chain, each amino acid is brought to the assembly site to be added to the growing chain by the peptide synthase."
"Next in an energy requiring step the messenger RNA, tRNA complex is shifted so as to bring the next message unit into the ribosome to allow the process to repeat itself."
At the end the terminator factor seeing the termination signal clears the completed protein from the last tRNA releasing it from the ribosome.
So that the ribosome can do its job again the two subunits are split apart and separated from the messenger by the ribosome releasing factor.
"My diagram is of necessity static, but protein synthesis is a dynamic process."
This movie tries to bring those dynamic interactions to life.

And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture.
"The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras, and those cameras can, frame-by-frame, reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment."
"So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject."
"And if you look in a comparison, on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us."
"So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this."
"But these were the early days of this technology, and it wasn't really proven yet."
We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count.
"And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons."
We could go up into the millions of polygons.
It seemed to be infinite.
"This was when we had our ""Aha!"""
This was the breakthrough.
"This is when we're like, ""OK, we're going to be OK,"
"This is actually going to work."""
"And the ""Aha!"" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt, and we could put Brad in this device, and use this Contour process, and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights, and we could, in fact, scan him in real time performing Ekman's FACS poses."
Right?
"So, effectively, we ended up with a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing."
(Laughter)
"From there, we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face."
"So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes, a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of doing."
"Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44."
We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.
"We brought in Rick Baker, and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry."
"And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji, and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time."
"And we commissioned them to make a maquette, or a bust, of Benjamin."
"So, in the spirit of ""The Great Unveiling"" -- I had to do this --"
I had to unveil something.
So this is Ben 80.
"We created three of these: there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60."
And this really became the template for moving forward.
"Now, this was made from a life cast of Brad."
"So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct."
"For example, sending them overseas so they can rest their bodies, and sending them to sanatoriums."
"In case of Fukushima, the current radiation level is so high I'm afraid such measures may not be enough."
"After all, they have eaten produce from local sources."
"Fukushima is ""Forbidden Forest"" of Belarus, so to speak."
Forest so dangerous no one can enter.
"Still, many people including children are allowed to live in the ""Forest."" I cannot permit this."
And such unusual changes in health do not happen in Fukushima alone.
I think this issue should be addressed in a more comprehensive manner.
"Indeed, there are many areas with high radiation in Kanto where children should be evacuated out."
"In Belarus, in the areas where the radiation level simply exceeds 0.1 microsievert, children did get ill, though you can't simply compare those areas to Kanto because they're self-sufficient."
But there are actually people in Kanto who claim to have nosebleed and diarrhea.
"As Dr. Hida [expert in internal radiation exposure] pointed out, if you see both nosebleed and diarrhea, that's a clear sign of internal radiation exposure."
I think it's OK for us to be overly nervous.
The most important thing we need to do now is to protect children.
It's better to overreact now and be criticized for the overreaction later than not doing anything.
"As we have seen today, various problems are happening one after another."
Those who can escape should do so.
And we have to remember the importance of keeping a record if any unusual change in health happens to us.
"Ms. Noro, thank you very much."
We will end our program with the forecast of the dispersion of radioactive particles by the German Weather Services over the next three days.
Please watch out for the weather and the wind direction when you go out during this weekend.
On the ninty-sixth day we sailed again.

We want to have debates on these programs that really matter to people and improve their lives.
"I think you guys have a very good case to be made about the work that you do, and that's what we want to keep very focused, very positive on."
"And however the process works, if it doesn't it doesn't, but you know, the main point is keeping up what you're doing, telling the story of the good work that you're doing, to encourage support amongst those who might not be supporters currently or new members who might not know about the program and also to encourage long-standing supporters who after all are still there doing great work."
I think those are very important things for you all to be doing.
Brad:
"Well, Elyse, thank you very much for that answer, and coming to the regular order, it was very impressive work of Senators Reed and Collins in getting 34 Senators to go on the letter to the Secretary of Energy on the reallocation in FY ""13, and we're hearing fairly soon, Elyse, from DOE."
We hope to have good news to share on that.
Elyse:
I think they had a fairly short time frame of figuring these issues out.
"The fiscal year is winding down to it almost, September."
"We are hopeful that we've made a good case, and we are certainly joined by large numbers."
I think I heard there is a similar letter effort in the House.
Brad:
Yes.
"With a number of Republicans, and that's very encouraging."
Elyse:
Yes I think those kinds of efforts really help bolster our efforts here.
We'll have to see.
We want to have a robust program.
We want there to be a program in every state.
"I think that only helps us going forward, and as we fight for FY ""14 appropriations."
Brad:
"And turning to that, we have 225 people, Elyse, listening to the Webinar."
"Let's talk for a minute about the ""14 process."
"We just want to ask folks to engage on the letter that I mentioned for the reallocation for FY ""13."
So now we're turning to a situation where we will both have outside groups like
NASCSP and other stake holders submitting testimony by May 9th as we've already done in the House.
Is April 29th the Deadline?
Elyse:
"I think we've heard April 26th, and that's a Friday."
"The reason they might have chosen that day is on many subcommittees that's the last day of this work period, and the week of the 29th is a recess."
"So I think that's why many of them chose the 26th, but I should double-check my dates."
"Then, we have cluster computing, which is, the common thing is, like Google, gigantic warehouse, and buys a 100,000 of the same computer, and puts it altogether, and houses it altogether, and that's called a cluster."
And all the computers work together to do whatever you need them to.
"Cool? side note, personally, this isn't on Dan's lectures, this is mine. my definition cloud computing."
"Google has its own cluster, its own cluster of machines, but they don't always use all these computers."
"Sometimes, a lot of them are idle like in Christmas break, people are searching more, so they need more machines, but over the summer that people are searching less they still have the machines."
"So, what do they do with them?"
"Well, came out the idea of the cloud that you can rent out these computers for whatever services other people need."
And it's just opens up a world of possibilities.
"The ideas that because these computers are for you to use, you get to them over the internet, and you can get to them over the internet from your phone, computer,"
"laptop, anywhere anytime."
"And this just opens the possibilities everywhere, but it's not actually that much of a new technology."
"It's just like, oh, a new way to use the Internet and the computer we already have."
"It's pretty cool, but it's just very applicable and really nice."
Awesome.
"So, the five parts of the computer."
[INAUDlBLE] is tower.
A computers are usually split into five parts.
"The first being the processor, which has the control, the brain which actually does the work and the datapath which shares the wires that connects the different part of the brain."
"And, then there's the memory, which is the storage, both long term, short term, anything."
"Registers, caches, hard drive, whatever you can think is part of the memory."
"And then, there are the devices, the inputs and outputs."
"Keyboard, mouse, monitor, whatever you need."
"This is called, well, we'll get to that in a moment."
This is called the Von Neumann
Architecture.
"And you should know John von Neumann, I believe in the 60's, he came up with this architecture and he's a famous guy."
"John von Neumann came up with this architecture and is still used today, decaed and daecades later, and he's pretty famous."
You should know him.
He maybe tested on.
Awesome.
So what's inside the processor? we're back on hopefully.
"There is the processor, brain and datapath."
So let's say that you are going to make $100 down payment on an item then you are going to pay $100 a month for 24 months.
Okay?
"So, if we are going to pay $100 a month for 24 months that means we are going to pay $2,400."
Does that make sence?
"Because we would take the $100 times 24 months, which would give us $2,400."
"We have already paid $100 down so that makes it $2,500 that we have paid for the item if we pay it over a 24 month period."
"So, in other words, if it takes us two years to pay for it."
"If we would have paid cash for it in this particular case, we would have paid $2,200."
So what you have to consider is it worth $300 to finance it over the next 24 months versus putting that $100 a month in a savings account for the next 24 months and just paying cash for the item.
"And, if I wait the 24 months then hopefully it might cost the same thing."
"Will it cost the same thing, the 2,200 instead of me having to pay the $2,500 it would cost to finance it?"
And that is something you need to look at before you make a major purchase if you don't have the cash for that purchase.
So one of the things that I want you to think about.
"Lets, look at the chapter."
This chapter looks at practical buying strategies and talks about some different things you need to think about before you actually buy.
One of those things is time and purchases.
There are good times to buy cars and there are bad times to buy cars.
There are good times to buy new TV's and there are bad times to buy new TV's.
"So, this gives you some ideas and some suggestions on what you need to do."
"Another thing that you need to make sure to do, try not to get too emotional with what you are buying."
A lot of times we go to the car lot and we find this car and we are just so..That is The vehicle that I have to have!
If you have that in mind.
"If you know that nothing else is going to meet your needs then it is going to be very, very hard to negotiate on that vehicle."
"So, you have to have a back-up plan."
"You have to say, Okay that is the car I really, really want, but if I don't get it that's okay because I found this other one that I am willing to take."
"So, then you have negotiating power."
"And I will tell you, when you go to buy a car, they are going to use it."
Have you ever!
This has never happened.
I have never gone to buy a car that I wasn't told someone else is looking at it.
"You know isn't it kind of funny that you have been watching that car for two or three months or maybe six months and the day you decide to go try it out and drive it, someone else is looking at it and is probably going to buy it before the day is over."
It's a marketing strategy!
"X, 1, 2, 4 and whatever but what we need to do that is that organize them like date and time and course and what not."
"And so whenever video editors wrote script, weÃ¢ÂÂd just kind of the programming that you got from here and a little bit previously to do this automatically."
Whenever we record videos we just give it to her and she sorts it automatically and saves the video editors hours of time.
"Okay, thatÃ¢ÂÂs great and I think people once you get a little experience with programming youÃ¢ÂÂil see things like that every day that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing people could be yourself but itÃ¢ÂÂil less often be yourself spending their time doing tedious things that are not fun for humans."
That you could write a few
"lines of python code to solve and so I hope, at the end of this class and I think by this point in the class many of you really should be at a level where youÃ¢ÂÂre instead of just solving the problems that weÃ¢ÂÂre giving you in the homeworks, youÃ¢ÂÂre finding real problems in your life and in your friends lives that you can solve by writing a little bit of code."
"So, I hope everyone will be doing that and spreading the value of programming literacy beyond that, beyond just yourself."
Second thing we want to talk about building big matrices.
We're gonna build our that big A matrix today and I'm going to teach you how to use.
"Okay, so today, you know, a lot of people use FFTs And there's nothing special about that, they're just means you're a player in the game."
We're gonna learn SP Diags today.
That takes you up a level.
Cuz not a lot of people know that.
"They don't even know what you're talking about and you're like dropping on them,"
"like you don't even know that, yeah."
That's what I walk around doing all day on the ave.
I'm one of those crazy guys.
"And turns out that those dudes don't know SP Diags All right so here's what we are going to do, we're going to make this matrix, and we're going to make it to be."
We're going to chop it up to five points.
In each direction.
"In the x direction five points, Y direction five points."
So our matrix remember is not a five by five.
Remember we're going to restack out data.
It's gonna be five by five times five squared right.
So this is going to be our discretion So that is going to be the size of the matrix we are working with.
Okay.
"So first of all, let's talk about this matrix A. And let's talk about what we want to put in here."
"So first I want, I'm going to make a vector of 1s."
Big vector of ones.
"And what I'm going to do, is I'm gonna make this, what's called the spdiags command."
"And what this is, spdiags, means sparse diagonal."
Diagonals.
The message that arrives at Bob is not C. It's C'.
"Because at the perfect cipher, the attacker can't learn anything new about the message from C, but she could modify it."
Maybe she had a pretty good guess.
Maybe there was a number in the message somewhere or something that she wanted to change.
"Well, she could flip the bits at that part of the message, change the ciphertext that Bob receives to C."
"It would decrypt, and with the one-time pad encryption and decryption are the same function."
The decryption of C' would be M'.
"The attacker can actually control the difference between M and M', because the way the one-time pad works is just XOR."
The attacker could decide whatever difference she wants to introduce in the message.
This is a dangerous property for a cipher to have.
Another big problem with the one-time pad is that it's very impractical.
"The real reason that it's impractical is because the keys have to be as long as the messages, and we can never reuse the key."
The is this property that the number of possible keys is equal to the number of possible messages.
Maybe what we should try to do is to find a more practical perfect cipher.
"Unfortunately, Claude Shannon proved that that's not possible."
That's what we're going to look at next is why this property that the key space has to be at least as big as the message space i s a requirement for a cipher being perfect.
"Let's take a look at an approach for actually finding shortest paths in graphs, and we'll use this example once again."
"It will help to actually have names for the other nodes, so I'm going to add these in."
Just remember what breadth-first search does for this graph starting from A.
We mark A as visited and we add it to the open list.
We pull off the open list and add all the neighbors of A to the open list.
"Letter C, B, and D then we choose one of these nodes,"
"Let's say C and add all its unexpanded neighbors to the graph, but all its neighbors are expanded."
"Do the same thing with B. B has F, and D's unexpanded neighbors are E."
"Now, F's unexpanded neighbors are G, and E has no more unexpanded neighbors."
We finish this step for a search.
"What we get here is that by the assumptions of breadth-first search, the shortest path from A to B is this direct link from A to B."
"The search would have actually terminated here, but we ran that anyway."
These are supposedly the shortest paths in terms of number of hops to all these nodes.
It actually makes sense.
"One hop to C. One hop to B. One hop to D. Two hops to F, sure."
"Two hops to E, sure."
"#The sun, it shines on everyone."

"In the last June 30, numbers of Egyptians went down on the streets of cairo and other cities to protest against the first elected Egyptian president Morsi"
The army interfered and did a coup against Morsi depending claiming that its decision was a respond to the call of the huge number of protesters on the street as army claimed and their numbers varied
Army used a military chopper to take footage for the protests and market it to the media and the world
And the number of the against President Morsi protesters were like stock market exchange
The numbers race (variations) posed mathematical questions before being political
Some used Google Earth to investigate
"Out of the ordinary, Google made a statement to deny all these claims"
"Wael Fakharany, the regional manager of Google said"
"""All the statistics that were cited to Google about the protest in june, 30th or pro president Morsi are fake"" without going into too much mis-claims about the number of protesters"
"Analysts, specialists and some western media websites tried to use the technology of Google Earth"
"Not to count numbers but to measure the area, hence the capacity of the streets and squares to carry the protesters"
"They found that the space of Tahrir square is at most 53,000 square meters"
"Masking tape helps protect your car, your buffing pads, and, of course, makes it easier to clean up at the end of the day."
"Now that everything is taped off, it's time to get to work."
Work in two-by-two areas and complete the rest of the car.
"Now that we've compounded, polished and jeweled the paint, the next step is to seal it."
"Apply paint sealant one panel at a time, then remove with a microfiber towel until every painted surface is covered."
"Once cured, the sealant will protect your freshly restored paint and help hide any scratches that were just too deep to safely repair during the correction stage."
"Now we've sealed the car so it looks spectacular, and it's protected."
"Now, if remember back in the previous episodes, we talked about putting Carnauba wax on top, and that's exactly what"
I'm going to do.
"That's going to bring in a pop, that shine back to this paint."
So let's get started.
"The trick here is to add a light, thin layer of Carnauba wax on top of the cured sealant."
"It's possible to do two or three panels before removing the wax with a clean microfiber towel, and the car should take no more than 15 to 20 minutes to get insane depth and shine."
"Although the Porsche took about eight hours or so from start to finish, it was totally worth it."
"Remember, we started off with paint that was completely neglected and in need of some serious correction."
"And after a bit of testing, we managed to restore the paint to near perfection with a safe and easy-to-use machine."
"All right, guys."
"Well, we finally finished this beautiful Porsche Speedster."
"Now, the one thing that we've learned is that you need the right tools."
"You need the right techniques, and a little bit of patience."
"And you, too, can have your car look as amazing as this."
"Now remember, download your free PDF and product guide at ammonyc.com."
"If you have additional questions, shoot me an email or visit my blog for other how-to videos."
"Well, that's it for you guys."

"A bit overwhelmed and actually humbled, with all the faces I see out here today."
You represent a lot of great memories from my family and I.
So stick with me as I kind of fumble through the next few minutes.
"Writing has always been a form of therapy for me,"
"So, today, I welcome you to the congregation of voices that reside in my head."
Might be a scary thought.
"April and May were bursting with flowers,"
"July and August were hot and sunshiny, and September and October were a kaleidoscope of colorful leaves."
"It was just the way the world worked, and it was magical."
"If you had told me back then that one-third of Earth's population had never seen snow or that July 4th was most definitely not a beach day,"
I would have thought you were crazy.
"But in reality, seasonal change with four distinct seasons only happens in two regions on the planet."
"And, even in those two, the seasons are reversed."
But why?
A lot of people have heard of an astronomer called Johannes Kepler and how he proved that planetary orbits are elliptical and that the sun is not at the center of the orbit.
It was a big deal when he figured this out several hundred years ago.
His discovery solved a lot of mathematical problems that astronomers were having with planetary orbit measurements.
"While it's true that our orbit's not perfectly circular, those pictures in our science books, on TV, and in the movies give an exaggerated impression of how elongated our orbit is."
"In fact, Earth's orbit is very nearly a perfect circle."
"However, because Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse, even though it doesn't look like one, and the sun isn't quite exactly at the center, it means that our distance from the sun does change through the year."
Ah-ha!
"So, winter happens when the Earth is further away from the sun!"
"Well, no, not so fast."
The Earth is actually closer to the sun in January than we are in July by 5 million kilometers.
January is smack-dab in the middle of the coldest season of the year for those of us up north.
Still not convinced?
How about this:
Summer and winter occur simultaneously on the surface of our planet.
"When it's winter in Connecticut, it's summer in New Zealand."
"So, if it's not the distance from the sun, what else could it be?"
"Well, we need to also need to know that the Earth doesn't sit straight up."
It actually tilts.
And that axial tilt of the Earth is one of the main reasons for the seasons.
The Earth spins on an axis that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical.
"At the same time, the Earth revolves around the sun with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space."
"Together with the tilt, the spinning and revolving causes the number of hours of daylight in a region to change as the year goes by, with more hours in summer and fewer in winter."
"So, when the sun is shining on the Earth, it warms up."
"After the sun sets, it has time to cool down."
For a few days at least.
"Because they're pacifists and suddenly they get hit, and they're insulted and they're treated so degradingly and so unnecessarily."
"That makes us really skeptical of the system represented by these policemen, those agents who maltreated them so incredibly."
"So I think it's not very intelligent to let the police, even though it's just a few individuals, to let them do those things."
It's not very intelligent at all.
You're turning people against you.
"Against you as a system, as a state, as whatever."
"I think it's unnecessary, absolutely unnecessary."
"And that night was very unpleasant, and it was unpleasant not to be there to see it and talk about it."
"That day I was on holiday and I didn't go to Madrid, like other times, to the demonstration."
And it was unpleasant not to be there and not to be able to inform about it.
ST:
Let's change topic to something radically different which has helped me to process my emotions.
In my experience of the 15M there's one thing that's really important: humour.
"Whether it's humour in the shape of stories like @putohelicoptero, @acampadapolicia, the posters or even my own tweets."
From time to time I had a kind of humour registry that helped me.
"I'd like you to tell me what you thought about the use of humour within the 15M, and how important it has been."
JL:
The other day I went to a bookshop and I saw on one of the shelves a book of banners from May '68.
I was confused so I took the book and I was surprised to find tweets.
"They were what I would have regarded as great sarcastic phrases for Twitter and banners, very much in line with the 15M."
But suddenly they were there.
"Obviously the cultural and terminological references are different, but there was so much creativity."
"That's for starters, because I remember seeing it the other day."
"And I've laughed so much, from the very beginning in the Puerta del Sol because there were such good phrases."
"Some were devastating, and others were very funny."
"You ended up laughing, copying them down and tweeting them, and sharing them because they're so creative, and the 15M has always considered creativity and humour way above aggresiveness and affiliation."
The richness of so many different messages.
"Some people think they're naive, and that just making jokes is a far cry from organising a revolution."
There are people who think so and say so.
People who think that in the Puerta del Sol there is no party.
"I've heard it in assemblies: ""we're not here to celebrate anything"""
The story started when Dr.
"Jaggers, who was Jessica's surgeon, received a phone call by the New England"
Organ Bank in the middle of the night.
The New England Organ Bank offered him the organs for another one of Dr. Jaggers' patient.
"Dr. Jaggers felt that the organs were inappropriate for this as a patient, But in part of the phone call, asked if they could use them for Jessica."
The New England Organ Bank somehow assumed that if Dr. Jaggers was asking for the organs for
"Jessica, they would match the blood type."
Vice versa is the work flow at the Duke
Transplant Center and Dr. Jaggers explicitly assumed that if the New
"England Organ Bank were offering the organ for Jessica, they would check the blood type."
"At the end of the day, nobody checked."
"In the aftermath of Jessica's death, a group experts were put together to assess what went wrong in this process."
They estimated that about one dozen caregivers had the opportunity to notice a mismatch.
"Typically, a single mistake in this type of process would have been caught."
"If one person forgets to check the blood type, well, there are eleven others who could have noticed."
"But if twelve people, at the same time, all make a defect at once, the outcome is tragic."
"British psychologist, James Reason, has developed a model to explain accidents and disasters."
This model is referred to as the Swiss cheese model.
The idea of the Swiss Cheese models is as follows.
Think about a slice of Swiss Cheese.
"In the slice, we have a couple of holes and we think of a hole as a defect."
"Now, the Swiss Cheese model, which doesn't look at one slice of cheese in isolation, but asks what happens when you stick multiple slices of cheese on top of each other."
"With a certain small, but positive"
"likelihood, you can stack up the slices of cheese and all the defects line up and the outcome is tragic."
This is the idea of redundancy.
As you add multiple layers of cheese on each other.
"It is less and less likely that you can see though all the slices at once,"
"But, again, the outcome probability is still not zero."
So what's the probability of a defect in a situation like this?
"Now, if we draw this as a process flow diagram, redundant check typically corresponds to a parallel path in the process flow diagram."
I've illustrated this here with these three paths that are all happening on the way of producing this flow unit.
"Now, the orange boxes here are the redundant test point."
(Applause)
"""Open Architecture Network"" is an amazing project that brings together the world's designers and architectures to collaborate and do stuff that anyone could not do."
It's a beautiful site that gets better every month.
"We had ""Pangea Day."""
James Nachtwey brought the story about TB.
"""The encyclopedia of Life"" has been built, that's a massive project that TED was part of."
"""Once Upon a School"", ""Next Einstein in Africa"", and this ""Charter for Compassion"". are just some of the ones that have been done."
"So, the kerfuffle was over, you know,"
"TED numbers started to grow, and it really started to feel like there was something good going on and the puzzle was, how could you get these ideas that were exciting people in the conference?"
Could you get them out into the world at large somehow?
"So, if you wind the clock back a bit to when I started the foundation that owns TED,"
I was really obsessed with this question: how do you make a difference?
How do you leverage money spent to really have maximum impact?
"And, I thought about these 5 things, all of which have massive amplification of human attention."
"And, then, it hit me that there was really a bigger thing that encompasses them all."
"And if you focused on that, you know, that might be the way to go."
"Think about ideas, you know, they start off as these little electrical patterns in someone's brain, you know, they weigh nothing. but they occur in the right circumstances, can spread to another brain, they can excite the body that houses that brain to do stuff, and if you're lucky, pass on the pattern to other people."
The ideas do the work for you.
That's a really amazing thing.
"And so we wondered how we could let the amazing ideas that happen at TED, which are after all the most infectious ideas I have ever seen, boy, if you could see those into the world, what might happen?"
And how to do it?
"I hired a woman, June Cohen to help me figure out the answer to this question."
"She is an experience media executive, long-term TEDster."
"And our first shot was television, you know, big audience."
We thought TED talks would look fantastic on TV.
"Unfortunately, all the TV executives we spoke to didn't see that."
We got nowhere.
"And so in 2006, we thought we do a little experiment, and just try putting a few of them up ourselves on the web, and see what happened."
We were worried that they would have none of emotional impact of the live event.
We were worried that TEDsters would be annoyed that stuff would be given away.
"But so, it was just an experiment."
"Majora Carter, Hans Rosling and Ken Robinson, these were three of the first ones we put up."
So in just this little sort of case study of New Haven and
"Yale, you can see how citizenship and"
"leadership came to have different meanings, how people were understanding what they were supposed to be doing as citizens in a different way as they lived the experience of fighting a Revolution."
Okay.
I ended that on time.
I even read my--I'm so impressed with myself--[laughs/laughter] the instant lecture.
Okay.
"And I ended two minutes early, so you have time to get your midterms."
"Have a wonderful spring break, and I will see you after."
"My name is Bacar Fati and I am vice president moreover, I am a founding member of the NGO Senim Mira Nassequê, and I am vice president."
"So, these people have been working from its creation for the training, information and awareness of people to abandon the pratices of... mainly female genital mutilation."
"But there is a broader activity of cutting, in the sense of putting an end to the practices especially with the NGO Saber Bom."
As we know of course that in our country there are many ethnicities that have those practices as part of their culture.
"So, in this moment we are doing a good work with the participation of other NGOs I think we are making an effort in that sense, and we are in the right way."
I am here today to take part of a training so that we can start producing and spreading our activities through blogging news.
"And today it is my second time in this activity so I think I am already learning and I have learned many things that allow us, from Senim Mira, to start spreading information about the activities we are promoting in different parts of the country."
"Right now we are in Bissau, but soon we will have another partnership indeed, the second partnership with the NGO (?) and that will help us a lot on implementing the activities in the field."
How do you show  two and three-digit numbers on a number line?
"In this lesson you will learn how to show numbers on a number line by thinking about hundreds, tens, and ones."
Let's review :
You know you can model 45 using place value tools.
If we used a place value board we know we would need four tens and five ones to show 45.
We can do the same thing with a three-digit number such as 253.
"We would need two hundreds, five tens, and three ones."
Two hundred fifty three.
A common misunderstanding when using number lines is thinking that number line models always count by or use units of one.
If we were to put fifty two on a number line...
Let's see what that looks like.
"Five tens, we know is fifty."
"And, we have two ones..."
Two jumps of... two more jumps?
"One, two."
"Cauliflower, when you get it, comes with this green stuff around and it's kind of hard to get in to."
"So, what I do is just peel back some of these leaves - get my knife in there and once you get a few pieces out, it gets easier."
"So, just pull those out."
"Once you slice one of them, you want to make sure to take one out because it will dry out."
"And since I slice this top off here, I want to take those as well, and the rest of it you can put back in its plastic bag and save."
"It is better if you can use the whole thing at once, but this is lunch for Phil and I, the entire cauliflower would be a bit much."
This is going to get dry out a little bit but just do the best you can.
I'm going to put it back into the plastic bag that it came in and pop it back in the fridge.
"So, you want to wash up your cauliflower, just make sure that there's not dirt or anything like that on it."
"One of the things that I really love with this kitchen is the first place that Phil and I had been that doesn't have a microwave, which is awesome because we don't use microwave and it kind of gets in the way of the use of space in the cupboards."
"The last place we lived in we used the microwave for storage actually, but cupboards are much more efficient, so we were excited about that."
"Alright, so get your cauliflower cut up and"
I'm going to cut it into bite size pieces.
"At his point, is you want to, you can steam this or boil it."
"I'm just going to have it raw because we're having it for lunch and lunch is when I like to get raw vegetables because it's the warmest part of your day and the most active and most able to handle those cooling raw foods, especially in winter time in Ottawa - it's pretty cold here."
"Alright, so there is Phil's bowl, he always eats more than me - he's a guy and bigger than I am."
I'm just going to pour some of the sauce over the top.
"You can use as much or as little as you like - that's look pretty good, some on mine."
Here you go my lovely simple garlic herb sauce recipe over cauliflower.
You can have a few chopped onions or some parsley on top there if you a garnish - it's very easy to make if you have a bean dip already made.
Hey!
Starting another The Moustache In The Kitchen!
Say hi to everyone.
Moustache:
"Hi, everyone."
The Moustache In The Kitchen
"Today we're going to make the vanilla sugar, which I had said to you..."
"That we would make with the remaining vanilla, which was supposed to stay drying,"
From the Confectioner's Cream episode.
"It can be used in cake, in Palmier's dough, can be used in dough's pie,"
It can be used in lots of things you want!
It's delicious and you reuse the vanilla.
(laughter)
"No, I say that jokingly, but its true."
I get a huge luxury that when I make my videos
I pretend that the students are so enthralled by what I have to say that I can just imagine it.
And what's good about that is that it gives me energy...
"It's much harder to sit in front of a room full of 30 kids and you're not sure whether some are getting it, some are there, some are here."
"What happens is that.. that energy gets conveyed in the videos and when the students watch it, they can pause and repeat as many times as they want."
I just got a letter from a kid who watched one video 30 times and it took him 30 times to get the idea.
And what he said was that there no one on the planet that he could have paid to tutor him that constant 30 times without judging him.
And I think that's what students really like.
Tom:
"You do have a non-profit, you're out there in the universe of cyberspace but are any of the educational systems in this country"
- the districts - either at the local or state level - coming to you and saying 'how can we strengthen the relationship between what we need and what you do?'
Sal:
"Yes, we started some pilots last year, just almost on a whim and its gotten pretty exciting."
"Some of the local schools in the Bay Area, they said: 'what would you do if you could do anything you wanted with a 5th grade classroom?"""
"We said that we'd have every student working at their own pace: watching videos, doing the self-paced exercises."
Only moving forward once they'd mastered concepts.
Right now you get a 'B' or a 'C' on a topic.
"That's fine, you passed, even though you don't know 10 or 20% of the material."
And then you move on to more difficult topics.
"So we are saying everyone at their on pace, master concepts first and then what happens to the teachers is that they get all of this data: who is working on what, what videos are they watching."
What exercises are they doing.
So the teacher no longer has to give these 'one size fits all' lectures.
The teacher can actually get the data and say:
"""Hey look, Tom's having trouble with negative numbers, and everyone else is working at their own pace,"
"let me sit down next to Tom and actually have a 1-1 intervention with Tom."""
What we've found in the classrooms has been pretty crazy before maybe 10% of the teacher's time was spent on that really deep 1-1 mentorship.
Now it is 90% of their time.
So what we consider to be the relevant metric which is the student-to-time-with-the-teacher ratio.
That's gone through the roof.
Tom:
Do you have any advice following the Arab spring that just hit the middle east?
For the rest of black Africa that is still facing some sort of oppression?
"We see a year later what's happening with the Arab Spring and now in the Arab world, in Egypt we see how difficult it is to really allow freedom to take hold, but you've got to start the process."
You can't romanticize or demonize Africa.
You've got to take it for what it is and then engage the larger world and use every resource available to try to change it.
"Well, Dr. King said injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
"So he would have embraced people in the Arab Spring, he'd talk about Occupy Wall Street"
"To hammer home the point that people should not be oppressed, and that we must open the doors of opportunity for all."
His words seem to have the sort of premonition that is so poignant upon every relistening.
"Every time we hear them again, well I don't know what will happen to me now, but it really doesn't matter because I've been to the mountain top."
And you can hear the people responding.
Ha ha!
"And he said I've looked over and I've seen the promised land stretching, seeing out in a melismatic Sam Cooke like [singing] that's old school."
That's for the old people.
Don't worry.
Dr. King would have warned against the kind of vigilant hyperbole that existed in the aftermath of Barack Obama's ascent to the presidency.
From King's assassination to Barack's inauguration
"We know that the impact of King's death is monumental, opening up space for the very conception that the black man could lead this nation."
He also would've been critical of him.
That was his role.
That was his job.
"He was a prophet, not a politician."
Some people think that Barack Obama is Moses when his job description says he's pharoah.
Which means then that you're in the business of occupying political space to bring about the greatest outcome for the most citizens in your nation.
That means compromise in a way that prophets find problematic.
I think that Dr. King would have been deeply troubled by the persistence of inequality and he would've pushed rather vigorously for the relief of the most vulnerable in our society.
Neither the democrats of republicans speak about poverty.
They keep talking about the middle class like everybody middle class.
There are millions of poor people in this nation!
And Martin Luther King Jr. loved them and died with poor people!
Martin Luther King Jr. opened up this rhetorical resistance to American culture.
At its best hip hop tells the truth.

"Urgot's role is really, ""tanky fighter ranged carry who assassinates other carries"" and we didn't want to change that about him."
We just went too far with the last nerf on Acid Hunter.
"Cho'Gath is one of our oldest champions and he needed a tune-up, so we're making three upgrades:"
"We're quickening his cast times, fixing an issue where Rupture's delay before hitting was random, and making his Vorpal Spikes scale in size as Cho'Gath himself grows."
What do these changes mean for Cho'Gath?
"Sometimes we want to give longer cast times for gameplay reasons, like with Karthus's Requiem, but Cho'Gath is not one of those champions."
We found out that his cast times are really long so we're bringing them down to about a half second.
This is going to make Cho'Gath feel a lot better about chaining his abilities together.
"For Rupture, it was basically hitting somewhere in between .5 and .75 seconds randomly."
We fixed that bug and now Rupture's timing is consistent right in the middle of those two values.
Now Cho'Gath players can actually plan for the delay of the ability just like other skill shots in our game.
The Vorpal Spikes change really is more for fun.
"They do get bigger and hit more targets as he grows, and not with just Feast but skills like Lulu's ultimate or the Summoner Spell Surge."
This is going to make him a little bit stronger but mostly it's going to make him feel a lot better.
The Tribunal is about building a more sportsmanlike community.
"If you find hostile players in your game, remember to report them after the match."

LYLA FlSCHER:
Hi.
Welcome to 6002x.
"I am Lyla Fischer, the head teaching assistant for 6002x."
"As you know, this course is entirely online."
"So before we start learning about circuits, let's learn about the tools that you will use to navigate through the course material."
Let's start with what is on your screen right now.
"How did not bother with their own fame, and what they left behind."
look at these men as a reference to people who have preached the Gospel of Jesus and how they gave their lives for King.
"Although few have known their names, Christ was known by them."
Then the Ministry wanted to be blessed in the sight of God.
"Not importatevi if you were to give the failed, but worry about heavenly things."
"All your suffering will be rewarded in heaven, along with the prize that Christ gives to those who serve with the heart."
"I would that all the brothers that I listen to, who are Ministers of the Gospel, are encouraged by the fact that the Lord God is immutable."
"Present in any church, whether large or small, and if God exists, is a glorious Ministry, because it is God who invites us to parectipazione."
"I think that in heaven there will be big surprises with those names that are great in the Earth, which could also be there ..."
"But those serfs who give themselves in Amazonia, they push in places undreamed of ..."
Well those are the men of real success!
"The Ministry is not determined by the amount of people that you're hearing, but for the quality of the action of the Holy Spirit in their hearts."
Don't get discouraged if you're not under the limelight ...
Be aware that the message we preach is powerful to save both Jews and Gentiles.
"Preaching boldly, and believe that God will do this."
"And if God exists, certainly the Ministry shall be blessed."
Escape from the limelight even as if they wanted to show that you can be more important than God.
"Whether you're famous, eloquent, whether you're known, none of this is important."
The only important thing is that you his faithful in delivering what the word
"God says, and not what we want the word of God says."
The human results are not important.
Sermon and sowing the word of God.
"One day the Lord will reward your efforts, your comfort heart, and we rejoice in him."
"Between listening to a great preacher, unfaithful to God, but with a good rhetoric and eloquence, and listen to a simple preacher who is not very eloquent, does not have the gift of speech, but is faithful to Scripture."
Well I always listen to preferirò the second to the first.
"Be faithful, preaches the word ama Scriptures, loves Christ."
And you'll have success.
In the eyes of God.
Some time ago I had the opportunity to hear Dr. Carson in the United States.
I was very touched.
"Told by his father, who had written a book: ""memoirs of an ordinary Pastor"" In that Conference, there were about 8000 persons there present."
"Carson with great frankness told him that many of the shepherds who were listening, are pastors of small churches and anonymous, with poor growth and does not have his own chance to speak to an audience so large."
Yes.
Was Mozilla the open source browser in those days?
Mozilla was in those days a technol..
"Sorry, the question was ""Was Mozilla the open source browser in those days?"""
Mozilla in those days was seen as a technology development organisation.
And Netscape liked to think that it was building the browser.
[Question]
Did everyone hear Dan?
"The initial theory was like the Linux kernel, where Mozilla would be the technology development asset that builds the kernel and other organisation would build the commercial products from it."
So we had this ongoing tensions and one of them was Mozilla was becoming a product in its own right.
"It turned out that as the Netscape and AOL management began building their product to drive traffic to AOL, more people started using the Mozilla version than the Netscape version."
That was going on in the background and let to some of these tensions.
"So I was fired and the belief at Netscape at the time was that by getting rid of me,"
Netscape management would then have the ability to control the Mozilla open source project and could convert it into a set of people that helped Netscape build the product that they wanted.
"Essentially, to view the community as a free work force that would help build the Netscape product."
"Of course, the competing view is that we're all building an open source project that has to meet the needs of the community and that people who contribute and build the product have some say in what happens to it."
"What happened at that point was that the two groups of people, the small group of people that had been mozilla.org staff and the larger group of people which were all the engineers contributing to Mozilla reunited to form one shared outlook."
What happened was that essentially the engineers working at Netscape were very clear that the leadership that they were following was Mozilla.
And it was me.
And it was not their management.
"So, everyone involved voted to continue to try to build an open source project."
So I remained the General Manager of Mozilla.
"I remained the leader of the Mozilla project and the spokesperson for the development of the Mozilla project, much to the surprise of the Netscape and AOL management."
We learned a lot of lessons out of that.
We learned from that that leadership depends on who will follow you.
You need to lead people.
"My own view is that you have to be leading in the right direction enough of the time, that enough people follow or enough people also lead in that direction."
[Question]
This would be...
I was fired in 2001 and yes...
Yes.
Yeah.
"I'm sorry, you want to choose something that's 5500K or higher in terms of the color temperature."
"You want to go below 5500K, 5500K is about daylight, so it's just the minimum part of daylight."
"The ones that I have I believe are 6,000K, 85 watt, 4800 lumens."
"Ok, so you can see the setup basically, it's a very simple setup."
You have the two lights that are on either side side of the screen which illuminate the background.
"Now, what I am going to do is switch around so you can see what I am looking at as I am facing the camera."
"Ok, here is my setup so what I am doing when I am reading from the screen, when"
"I am doing a professional video and looking at the camera, this is what I see."
It's in my kitchen my little dining area.
"Basically, it's a real quick setup."
"You have two lights, I am sorry, two lights on either side, so a total of four lights."
"Those are usually called the ""key lights,"" and they illuminate me as I am doing my videos."
"Now, if you zoom up, or if I zoom up I should say and focus there a little bit, you can see that they're clip-on lights."
"They are the shop lights, eight inch shop lights."
"Inside those the bulbs are actually lower wattage, they can be 26 watt cfls"
"Now, you want to choose ones that have a warmer appearance, so you are talking about warmer bulbs, you don't want to get the daylight."
"You want to get 3,000K to 3,500K color temperatures."
"The ones that do the screen that illuminate the screen, those are daylight."
"These you want to warm, you want to have more of a warm appearance to whoever is on camera, and those are 3,000K to 3,500K color temperatures"
"Next you see, now normally, that right there, you can see the iPad that is sitting there."
"Normally, the iPad, there's a camera, and the camera I am holding right now."
"The camera is there which I'll go over in a second, and then you have the iPad."
Of course an iPad is expensive.
"You can get a Droid tablet, that's fine."
"You can also rig up something depending on how it is, rig up something so that you could put a table, and then use a laptop as your teleprompter if you even wanted to do a teleprompter so now let's talk about the camera."
"In fact,"
let me go ahead and get my cell phone camera to talk about the camera.
"Ok, so I gave you a little tour."
"A real quick recap as you have the screen, I use a white projection screen."
"You have the two screen lights on either side, very high lumen bulbs to wash out the white background, so it's over-exposed."
"Next, I have on either side of me I have the key lights which are on each side, I have two"
"lower wattage, I think it said 26 watt bulbs, and again, held within the shop lights."
"Because with purchasing you just, it is kind of like renting or leasing a house, you are kind of borrowing that car for three years and you pay lease and with that lease you can use it so many miles a year and if you go over that it costs you more."
"You do have to pay some money up front but, some different options."
And I want you to look at the different options.
"On page 197, here is Check Out A Used Car."
And it gives you some suggestions on some things that you will want to look at before you decide to purchase a used car.
"On top of page 198, Figuring It Out."
This explains how to determine whether you should buy versus leasing an automobile.
And it shows you how to get the total cost to buy and how to get the total cost to lease.
And I am calling that to your attention because you are going to do one of those in your assignments for today.
"So, it is extremely important that you know that what is on the top of page 198 will give you the information to enable you to do that problem today."
I love that your book gives you information on bargaining.
Throughout this course one of the things I have told you is that my husband and I because we take cash in when we buy a car we have a lot of bargaining power.
"I mean when you say I am willing to write you a check right now today for $8,000 so I will give you my car and I will trade it for that one for $8,000."
"And what I tell them is that it is $8,000 total."
"That includes the taxes, the title, all your little bitty fees you add on."
I am not doing any of that.
"I am giving you my car and $8,000."
Are you willing to do that?
"And you know when you lay it out there in black and white, ha."
And you can do that.
I mean first you can let them...
I will tell you what they try to do that really drives me crazy is instead of talking price of the car they want to talk monthly payment.
"Guys don't fall into that trap. $100 a month, and usually it is $400 a month or $300 a month for six years, is a lot of money!"
Figure out what that car is costing you!
"You know, if you are going on 60 months and I think come people don't realize 60 months is five years!"
"So, if for the next five years you are going to be paying $300 a month and I am trying to just do this in my head, but you are paying $300 a month times 60."
"You know, what is that car going to eventually cost you?"
"And I know right now interest rates are very low, but are you going to be satisfied with a car over five years."
"Because, what tends to happen with a lot of people when they finance for a long period of time"
like that is then when they get ready to trade their car in it is not worth what they owe for it.
So they are what we call upside down.
"And we talked about upside down in another chapter earlier in the book, but that means you owe more than it is worth."

"What we're doing in this video is study a proof of the Pythagorean theorem, that was first discovered,as far as we know by James Garfield in 1876."
What's exciting about this is that he was not a professional mathematician.
You might know James Garfield as the twentieth president of the United States.
"He was elected president in 1880, and then he became president in 1881."
And he did this proof while he was a sitting member of the United States House of Representatives.
What's exciting about that is is it shows that Abraham Lincoln was not the only US politician or the only US president who was into geometry.
And what Garfield realised is that we can construct a right triangle-
"Let's say this side over here is length 'b'(blue) and this side is length 'a'(red), and let's say this side, the hypotenuse of my right triangle, has length 'c'."
And let me make it clear -- it is a right triangle.
He essentially flipped and rotated this triangle to construct another one that is congruent to the first one.
So let me construct that.
So we're going to have length 'b.'
"And it's colinear with length 'a', It's along the same line as length 'a.'"
They don't overlap with each other.
So this is a side of length 'b.'
And then you have your side of length 'a' at a right angle.
And then you have your side of length 'c.'
"So the first thing we need to think about is, &amp;amp;quot;What's the angle between these two sides?&amp;amp;quot;"
What's this mystery angle going to be?
"Well, it looks like something, but let's see if we can prove to ourselves it really is what we think it looks like."
"If we look at this original triangle, and we call this angle 'theta,' what's this angle over here, the angle that's between the sides of length a and c. what's the measure of this angle going to be?"
"Well, theta plus this angle has to add up to 90, because when you add those two together, they add up to the 90."
So 90 and 90 you get 180 degrees for the interior angles of this triangle.
"So if these two angles together is 90, then this angle is '90 minus theta'."
"Well if this angle up here is congruent -- (And we've constructed it so it is congruent.) the angle corresponding to theta is also going to be theta,"
And this angle right over here is also going to be 90 - theta.
We keep on going on like that.
We'll go out 1000 different steps.
"Each of these will be a distinct state, because this will be the state with time t equals 0."
"Here time t equals 1, t equals 2, t equals 3."
"But really, although it looks like we're getting different states, in another way of looking at it, we're always getting the same state."
We're just going back and forth from here to there and back to here and back and back.
We're going around in circles.
"In order to recognize that these are in fact the same states, we're going to have to take t out of our state, and we're going to have to deal with the t someplace else."
"We want our representation of a state to be just (here, there)."
We've got to figure out someplace else to put the t.
"I'm not sure what the right way to do it is, but why don't we do it this way?"
"We have a path, which is state, action, state dot, dot, dot-- keeps on alternating between states and actions."
"Let's change that so that the path is a state followed by a tuple of the action and the total time it took after applying that action, then the next state, then the next action and the total time after applying that, and so on."
That'll be our new representation.
"States are going to look like that, and paths are going to look like that."
"Now, I want you to write the new successor function for the bridge problem."
"We'll call it bsuccessors2--the ""2"" just to keep it distinct from the first version."
Again it returns a dict of state-action pairs.
"A state now is just a two-tuple of (here, there), and the here and there are still frozen sets."
It's pretty much the same except we dropped out the time t.
Go ahead and implement that for me.
"Hey Pokémon fans, I'm JWittz and for today's Pokémon fact of the day, we're going back to the Pokédex to talk about more reasons why it is NONSENSE!"
Now I've done plenty of videos in my extended series on weird and creepy Pokémon Pokédex entries (and I'm sure I'll do more of those in the future) but for now we're going to talk about something a little different: sizes and weights.
They don't make any sense.
Just how big is a Charizard?
"Big enough to ride, right?"
"If you're asking Game Freak, you might be wrong."
"Despite Pokémon having the most successful long-lasting media franchises of the past two decades, size just seems to be one of the things they can't keep consistent."
"Most of the time, we think we have a good grasp on the size of Pokémon thanks to the TV show, other shows we've seen, and referencing Pokémon to real life animals."
"But when you look at the official, cannonical sizes from the games themselves, things are a little messed up."
"For starters, the anime differs from the games greatly by having the occasional giant pokémon appear."
"This never really bothered me as a kid, but today it just baffles me for some reason."
So that's where his account ends.
Now we're going to pick it up with Daggett who offered his own account afterwards of what happened.
Okay.
"""On Monday morning, the 5^(th) instant the town of"
"New Haven was justly alarmed, with the threatening appearance of a speedy invasion from the Enemy."
Numbers went out armed to oppose them....
"Having gone as far as I supposed was sufficient,"
I turned down the hill to gain a little covert of bushes which
"I had in my eye; but to my great surprise I saw the Enemy much nearer than I expected, their advance guards being a little more than 20 rods distant, with plain open ground between us."
"They instantly fired upon me, which they continued till I had run a dozen rods, discharging not less than 15 or 20 balls at me alone; however thro' the preserving providence of God, I escaped from them all unhurt, and gained the little covert at which I aimed, which concealed me from their view, while I could plainly see them thro' the weeds and bushes, advancing towards me within 12 rods."
"I singled out one of them, took aim and fired upon him."""
Okay.
So he takes one shot.
"""I loaded my musket again, but determined not to discharge it any more, as I saw I could not escape from them [laughs] and I determined to surrender myself as a prisoner."""
"So he's charged out with his gun, he takes one shot, and he's like: 'what am I doing?"
[laughter]
I'm a guy with a gun and the
British Army.
What am I doing?'
"He's like: 'okay, I'll surrender myself as a prisoner.'"
"""I begged for Quarter and that they would spare my life."
"They drew near to me, I think two only in number, one on my right hand, the other on my left, the fury of infernals glowing in their faces, they called me a damned old Rebel and swore they would kill me instantly."
"They demanded, quote, 'What did you fire upon us for?'"" [laughter]"
Okay.
I love the question.
"'Why are you shooting at us, you old crazy man sitting in the bushes?'"
"""I replied, 'because it is the exercise of war.'"" [laughter]"
That did not impress the
"British, and apparently, they actually--they didn't treat him very well so they-- one of them pretended to stab at him with his bayonet and actually stabbed him a little bit, and some of them sort of [laughter] hit him on the head, and there's a long account here which I don't have time to read in which he talks about: 'this guy hit me in the head and that guy hit me on the shin and then some guy hit me with the barrel of his gun.'"
"And he actually--he ends up being forced to march at the head of the British troops back to New Haven, from wherever he is."
"And he says I think in his account, 'I finally--I saw the"
New Haven green and I was so happy I was back in New Haven.'
"Because they're in the remote corners of those three countries, and the roads are awful, they're still very isolated."
They're still very self-sufficient.
They grow their own food.
They get water from springs.
They use local materials to make furniture and houses.
"They used to have kings and courts and armies and nobles, but colonialism put an end to all that."
"There are wondrous musicians, and they carry libraries of knowledge and stories in their heads."
The first person to write about the Zande was an anthropologist named Evans Pritchard.
"He lived among the Zande in southern Sudan for almost 2 years in the late 1920s, and he wrote this classic book, ""Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Zande""."
"Over 50 years later, I found myself in Zande Land."
"As a Peace Corps volunteer, that was when I was young and glamorous-- is a Peace Corps volunteer in the Central African Republic, I taught high school for three years and most of my students were Zande."
I returned to Zande Land several times to do fieldwork for my graduate degrees at the University of Paris.
My own experience with witchcraft matched up pretty well with Evans Pritchard's account.
"In English, the word witch conjures up images of old ladies with warts on their noses wearing pointy hats and riding on broomsticks."
"Zande witch is, on the other hand look like regular people."
"There your family, friends, and neighbors."
"For the Zande, some people happen to be born with a special power inside of them that can cause harm when it heats up."
And it tends to heat up in a person gets angry or jealous or is offended or feels cheated.
"When someone's witchcraft heats up, bad things happen."
The best way to explain what witchcraft does is to use an example from Evans Pritchard.
It's common for the Zande to sit under granaries during the heat of the day.
"So one day there are two men sitting under the granary, and they're just talking; chatting as friends do, and suddenly it collapses on top of them and kills them."
"If you ask a Zande the question, why did the granary collapse, just like the bridge engineer, the Zande will be able to tell you structural deficiencies."
"The posts were rotten, the termites were eating away at the posts, and so it collapsed."
But that answer is not sufficient for the Zande.
"They will also ask, why did the granary collapse of the precise moment when those two men were sitting under it?"
Why didn't it collapsed an hour earlier or an hour later?
Why didn't those two men sit at another granary that day?
So the answer to that question is witchcraft.
"In other words, witchcraft does not explain why a granary or a bridge collapses, but it does explain why a particular person is under that granary or on that bridge when it does collapse."
Another example is a hunter killed by an elephant.
Several men go on a hunt.
The College of Arts and Sciences attracts faculty from around America and the world.
"Individually, they bring many unique and fresh perspectives, but they all share something in common: a love for Alaska and a passion to teach and inspire."
Steven Johnson:
"You know, we get obsessed with things and we pursue them rabidly and that's a good thing when it comes to knowledge, and discovery and teaching."
"That's good, and that's what you want."
Dr. Jocelyn Krebs:
Undergraduate research is a great opportunity that students have at UAA.
"It can be very challenging to do, especially at large schools, and we create a lot of opportunities here and it's really essential for students that want to go on to medical school, go on to graduate school. and really for anyone that wants to be able to think critically about the world"
Chris Barnett:
"You know, I get to be here in the setting of Alaska and still be able to do the biomedical research"
I previously didn't think was available.
I think it's the best of both worlds for me.
Steven Johnson:
"We have grown as a university in just ways, that other, older institutions couldn't even comprehend."
We have created an environment where students can thrive.
Hillary Jochens:
The attention that I get from faculty and small class sizes and the research opportunities have been remarkable.
Steven Johnson:
The students that we are turning out are extraordinarily good students.

[Amy Goodman]
I want to go back to that moment when Mitt Romney made his entrance on Thursday night.
"He walked down the aisle of the Republican convention, and as he was passing the New York delegation, he shook the hand of the state Republican Party chair, Ed Cox, and then he shook hands with David Koch, actually put his hand on his shoulder, pointed at him, and then shook his hand."
"While [Democracy Now!] was there on the floor, we captured the handshake on video."
"The pool feed that went out, that the networks broadcast, cut away just before the handshake, showing two enthusiastic young women supporters, and then an overhead shot of the convention center."
Then the shot comes back to Romney further down the aisle. shaking hands as he ascended the stage.
And we show that split screen.
"For our radio listeners, you can go to democracynow.org."
"I think it's an interesting metaphor for the money behind the scenes, not highlighted even by the media."
Medea?
[Medea Benjamin]
"Well I think in the last--past conventions, you'd see it more overtly: they'd be giving out the bags, would have the corporate logos on them, and it would be so easy to know who is [sic] the sponsors."
I'm Kelly MacDonald for Accessible Media attending the Design Enabling
Economies and Policies conference hosted by OCAD and G3ict.
This two-day think tank will examine new strategies in digital inclusion beyond current approaches.
"Axel Leblois, President and Executive Director of the Global Initiative for Inclusive Information and Communication Technologies."
Or G3ict for short.
AXEL:
"As you know, there was a significant milestone back in 2006, when the United Nations General Assembly actually passed the text of the"
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
"Which today, has been signed by 153 countries and ratified by 104."
"Which means, in the short part of time, that Convention has established itself worldwide as the global legal framework to protect the rights of persons with disabilities."
KELLY:
The conference had guest speakers that addressed the crowd.
"Jutta Treviranus,"
Director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCAD University.
So the Inclusive Design Institute is a regional research hub with many postsecondary partners;
"Eight, in fact, all in the greater Toronto area."
"And partnerships with collaborating private sector organizations and community organizations, all working together to try to ensure that the emerging technologies that we all depend upon become accessible to the full diversity"
That is the users within our community.
KELLY:
A joystick plugged into an interface allows the user to move the cursor around on a mobile phone.
Three press-buttons connected to an interface allow the user to perform the same functions on a tablet.
"So there's a central facility here at OCAD University that includes actually 9 labs, with various functions."
And it's spread over 3 buildings.
"But, in additions to that, there are satellite facilities at the 8 other academic institutions as well."
KELLY:
Attending the first DEEP conference
I'm Kelly MacDonald for Accessible Media.
"Now, what does this continue command actually do?"
What happens if we set a stepping variable to false?
"Is it the program resumes until it exits, the program resumes until the next breakpoint is reached, the program resumes until the next function is called, or does the program stay in the same line?"
Keep in mind that all of these options assume that we return true in our program.
(whispering) Hi!
"You need the folks in DC who can advocate from their perspective here in Washington, but you also need everyone on the ground and states making phone calls and sending emails to explain what it actually means for that particular state and for communities in that particular state."
You need both.
If you only have one or the other it doesn't quite work out as well.
You really need to work in tandem.
So I appreciate all of Brad and Arley's efforts and everyone on the ground who is helping us make the case.
"Brad: our greatest Appreciation is Senator Reed because, frankly, it has been a lonely struggle these last couple of years."
I don't know if you were on the call earlier but I referred to the difficulties getting out of the gate on the recovery act issues and some of the bad publicity.
There's an amazing success story now to be told about weatherization for one million homes weatherized.
That's where the briefings held on the Hill are so important to tell that very positive story.
"Talk about things that are not frequently mentioned such as the weatherization supply chain, or in Rhode Island or virtually any other state the vendors, the contractors, the suppliers who participate, the manufacturers."
More 95% of the content of products that go into weatherization are manufactured right here in the US.
"There's a story to be told there, and it's a great privilege to work with Senator Reed and your staff in helping to increase the funding for weatherization."
Let's get this program back to the pre-recovery act level of funding so it can really deliver on its promise to help bring energy efficiency to low-income Americans.
Elyse:
"That's our goal, and again I really appreciate everything that everyone here on this call and all of your other colleagues are doing."
Brad:
"Well let us know on the letter, we will help make the maximum effort."
We will reach out to the 225 people who are listening to this right now as well as everyone in our network and work with the other stake holders.
It sounds like you're going to give us a very short turn around.
Elyse:
Unfortunately that's what it's looking like.
I do appreciate you recognizing that and still helping us nonetheless.
Brad:
"We will do it, and we appreciate, knowing how busy your schedule is, taking the time."
Elyse:
"Oh, thank you."
"Thank you for inviting me, and again thank you to everyone."
"Everyone has been so helpful, and I just want to keep encouraging that."
Thank you.
Brad:
"Thank you, Elyse, and have a good rest of the afternoon."
"Ok we're going to be joined here momentarily by Steve Capanna from the White House, but I would like to turn it to my colleague, Arley Johnson"
[narrator voice]
"Because the need for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to advocate for themselves is not limited by boundaries, Partners programs are being conducted in most states in the U.S., and a number of foreign countries."
"The individual needs vary, but there are some common themes."
The desire for full inclusion often rises to the top.
I think that the tips and the tools that you learn about advocating for yourself or for others are great.
You can use them for any disability
"Being a blind person, I come against things all the time as far as what I can and can't do because"
I'm blind.
They don't know what I can and can't do because they don't want to give you a chance.
"You have to speak up for yourself, so I learned to be more assertive. speak up for myself and sell myself."
I have to do that.
[narrator voice]
"While many graduates focus on issues of housing and employment, Doug Hedrick has zeroed in on respect, campaigning for the use of language that sees individuals with disabilities as people."
"The father of a son with autism, Hedrick went before the board of his"
local school district and got action.
"The eight month program gives you a lot of tools in your toolbelt, and I'm just starting to use a few of them."
Some of the ones that I've used is being able to speak to school boards and facilitating a People First language policy.
"What Partners asked me to do, in the course, was to change or create policies, and I saw an opportunity with my school board in Burke"
"County to say, let's use a People First"
language policy let's adopt that.
And the interesting thing is ... and this is what I've learned in Partners.
When you explain this to people. people generally do the right thing.
"People want to facilitate change if it's the right thing, and using a People First"
language policy is just a very good thing.
"And they adopted this policy last year, and they're using it today."
[male narrator]
Others have joined Hedrick as advocates of people first language a movement that has been supported and pressed by the North Carolina
Council on Developmental Disabilities
"Together with other Partners graduates, Hedrick has helped push for People First language with webinars, telling supporters how they can carry the message to their own communities."
"They are demonstrating leadership in their communities, as many Partners graduates do."
Debra Wilson completed the program and later was named a member of the
North Carolina Council on Developmental Disabilities.
Thank you.
"Imagining a solo cello concert, one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites."
"As a child studying these eternal masterpieces,"
Bach's music would intermingle with the singing voices of Muslim prayers from the neighboring Arab village of the northern Kibbutz in Israel where I grew up.
"Late at night, after hours of practicing,"
I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents' stereo.
It all became music to me.
I didn't hear the boundaries.
I still start every day practicing playing Bach.
His music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me.
"But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression,"
"I realized that with today's technological resources, there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument."
"The power and coherency that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience."
The excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept.
"The excitement from using multi-tracking, the way I did in the piece you will hear next, comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers, all generated from a single source."
My cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas.
"When composers write music for me,"
I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.
I hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds I have never heard before.
I want to create endless possibilities with this cello.
"I become the medium through which the music is being channeled, and in the process, when all is right, the music is transformed and so am I."

bjbjLULU JUDY WOODRUFF:
And to our two-part look at immigration.
On the U.S. Supreme Court docket Wednesday is a tough new law in Arizona.
NewsHour correspondent Tom Bearden traveled there recently and sets the scene for tomorrow's arguments.
TOM BEARDEN:
Daniel Bell's family has raised cattle on this land along Arizona's southern border since the 1930s.
"But in the past few years, he's had to repair the simple barbed-wire fence that separates the U.S. from Mexico more and more often, because the steady stream of people entering the country illegally are always cutting it."
"DANlEL BELL, Arizona:"
So this is a common occurrence every day that we deal with on the ranch.
To comfort them told him this:
"""The Ministry that our Lord God will reward, isn't so much the visible fruit of Pastoral Ministry, teaching, or for evangelisation but the Messenger will be faithful to God who will be rewarded """
"The Lord God takes care of the people, because it is a sovereign God and faithful, and then takes care of his slaves."
"We're the remains clinging to the truth and walk humbly before Christ, for our financial support, the Lord God will take care."
The truth is this: the Lord is not indebted to those who serve him humbly based in truth.
God does not need anything to these people: it simply takes care of them!
Our family lived so for almost 10 years.
"Then you have nothing to fear, because since we donated to the Ministry, you can be sure that the Lord God knows that the name and honor of God are involved and will not allow its name suffers from delusions or stains."
He will worry that you have the support and care you need.
"Because God is his name and zeloso honor, so you a privilege to serve the Lord God."
"And this we already know in this life, that we receive 100 times more whatever"
"We have left behind, but the best of all this, and in the life to come, we will be with him for eternity."
"These brothers working in harsh and difficult conditions must remember what most matter: in the day when God will call us,"
What will count in the end is right if there was this sense of submission and faithfulness to the Gospel message.
"If these are true brothers and are seeking the help and God's presence in their Ministry, as well as the word says, urging and invoking (with a spirit Bereano) people to repentance, these people will be blessed, and should rejoice because it is just that what the Lord wants from them."
"Be faithful, you who serve the Lord."
"When their aim is the glory of God, the good of the Church and the salvation of sinners, this can draw various consequences: can first define the implementation of Ministry."
You can find a face with others who don't have the same motivation and can be tricky.
But we must remember that it is more important to be approved by God that by men.
It is important to be like God rather than men.
"Be faithful, and God will bless you for eternity."
Serving God is the most spectacular thing of this world.
"If your leader is God, your benefits and your retirement will be from another world!"
Worth it!
A hug.

My pleasure.
"And I apologize for calling in a few minutes late, and I apologize to the speaker who I interrupted as a result."
"From what I caught at the very end it seemed interesting, so I'll let you all get back to that."
Brad:
We'll get right back to that.
"Thank you, Steve, and have a good rest of the day."
Steve: you too.
Thanks Brad.
Brad: before returning to Mark Schmeissing I just want to take care of a couple housekeeping matters.
I understand from questions that have come in that some folks in the audience have had difficulties with the audio portion.
"And some folks have been saying, ""When will the recorded webinar be made available?"" Before we go off the air here today and we complete the discussion of CSBG we will tell our"
listeners when the recorded webinar will be available.
"Someone else also wrote in, Mr. Todd Richardson, for the lobbying and advocacy work that we're going to be doing for the member request letters that"
"Senator Reed's legislative director referred to earlier, will we be sending out talking points for those of us making the calls?"
Answer:
"Yes, definitely, Todd, we will be doing that."
As soon as we get the letters from Senators Reed and Collins we will be sending those talking points out to everybody who is on this webinar and everyone who is part of our network.
"So we will be coming back to more questions that have come in, but what I'd like to do at this point, just to alert Mark Schmeissing, you do have a number of questions, Mark."
"So let's come back and complete your regular presentation, and then let's get right into the questions for the remaining 30 minutes of this webinar."
Mark:
That sounds great.
Thanks Brad.
So I'm just going to finish up with the overview of ROMA Next
Generation Grant.
We've talked through what we are doing in that process.
"If we go to the next slide, you'll see a diagram developed by the urban institute."
This figure is supposed to show how the three different training and technical assistance efforts are fitting together.
"In the center you'll see those core organizational standards that mainly speak to organizational capacity (things like leadership and governance and community engagement, human resource management, financial operations)."
Those are the things that are being developed through the Organizational Standards Center of Excellence.
Around that you'll see ROMA 2.0 which is another way that the ROMA Next Generation Center of
Excellence is referred to.
That ROMA cycle is the ongoing community action system that's framing our specific and special mandates to address the causes and traditions of poverty.
"While in Denmark and also to some extent Sweden, we draw all the people to the cities and closing small schools, and then ""you wonder"" why people move away from the local areas.."
Could we learn from Norway?
Ole:
Ehrm ..
I've actually been working together with Norway.
Seen cultural cooperation with..
"""Nord Trøndelag"" it's called where they have jazz festivals and where they work with art and business certainly, but also the schools that are around in the villages totally worn out"
"Norway don't always use there oil money in the right way, I would say .. but some things we can learn from Norway"
"In particular, we could learn modesty of Norwegians"
Norway has the largest number of middle managers who do not want to be leaders but I like the Norwegians because they remain committed to their values
I have stayed in a folk dance farm up in Norway which was organic awarded in Norway very special..
They made the costumes and danced under the midnight sun
It was very cozy.
I also have a stringed instrument
Martin:
Yes you play the violin and viola..
Ole:
Yes!
This gives rise to ... and that's a leading question ..
Is it something that gives perspective to all this philosophy?
Ole:
"Well, first it's a good way to get thinking as music affects your mentality"
Martin:
Sherlock Holmes also enjoyd it
Ole:
"Yes, but it's proven with children and so on that in music, at least, classical music because of its mathematical structure you become more gifted by playing and wierd enough .."
"If you have thought a lot in a period you will also be better at playing but generally yes, music is incredible"
"Especially classical music for ... especially Bach who is fabulous but the entire Danish culture is far down the road built on societies and associations and in music clubs, it was the amateur music which has been an excellent element in creating precisely those things that you're talking about because of democracy, in spite of lack of skills and abilities you have been allowed join in anyway"
Martin:
"But then we're back to Peideia, the bourgeois formation included music, cause it was good in developing people into good people"
I also think it has something to do with the nobility.
They had so much time and could do what they thought was fun and what gave them the most and it was to ride and fencing and paint watercolors speak French and of course play music and they would not go down as modern nobility does today with drugs and self-pity because the transcendental activities built them up as human beings rather than take them down

"*Sheik Sadeg Al Gheryani, Tripoli*"
"In the name of God the merciful, praise be to God the creator of the universe and peace be upon our prophet and his people and all who were guided by his guidance"
"I have been asked, from within the country, from our cities, Misrata and Tripoli and other Libyan cities to clarify what the Libyan people should do in this current situation, in these difficult times."
"I say that what Gaddafi's security brigades are doing in their violent, deliberate indiscriminate attacks on Libyan cities can only make hearts break and is scarcely to be believed"
"The Libyan people, who began their uprising peacefully asking for their rights and still want it to be peaceful, even though the regime has forced them to take up arms the Libyan people must now bear their responsibility."
"In the following way: in the liberated cities, the people must continue to go out in protests to call for their rights and to stress the unity of the country, and to support the countries which have declared their support for the Libyan people, and condemn those countries which have taken an opposing position, and those who are still in the position of spectators, especially the Arab nations must be urged to take a position."
Libyan ex patriot communities must also take on this role.
"In European countries, in Arab countries, in front of embassies."
Because international movement is connected to the popular movement.
And without that health insurance...[cuts off]
When someone is born with a malformed heart valve there's no question we cover the treatment necessary to care for that person.
"Similarly, there should be no question that when someone is born transgender we provide the care they need."
There are clear Standards of Care for treatment of a legitimate diagnosis.
Gender Identity Disorder or Gender Dysphoria are recognized medical terms &amp;amp; diagnoses.
"I have read one of these exclusionary insurance statements, and it is just appalling."
"Uh, the idea that, uh, it would be, and it is, it's the equivalent of saying"
"""we will not give insurance to short people."""
"You know, it is how you are born."
This is not about cost and benefit.
"This is about the sanctity of human life, and respect for human dignity."
So we cannot sidestep that as we talk about policy.
"Otherwise, [we entrenching ?] a very fundamental core of our value a value of extending liberty and freedom to all of us."
"What we're talking about is a treatment that is medically necessary, as determined by the American Medical Association."
So I'd like to tell you what I believe this issue is really about.
"It's about the American value of equality, and so I say let's live the values of our Constitution: equal treatment under the law."
And I thank the mayor and the council for your support of this issue.
"The American Medical Association to me, for me, has resolved the question by deeming this a medically necessary procedure."
"Uh, based on the briefings I've received,"
"I've also concluded that surgery is not optional, it is actually an appropriate treatment."
"This is a small price to pay for fundamental,uh, helping people to lead happy lives."
We heard several testimony about suicidal considerations.
And I think it's time to end that and to provide the means necessary for people to become the gender they truly believe they are.
When people present me with facts and figures it doesn't override what my heart tells me is the right thing to do.
"And I could not in good conscience allow this city's police officer's to go without health coverage, and I don't feel any different about this issue today."
What was mentioned in testimony is that the suicide rate for transgender people is 33%.
"It seems to me that $32,000 is pretty, um, cost efficient in saving a life."
"And more than that, it's the right thing to do."
"Well I want to thank, uh, Clay Neale [sp?], uh, Jennifer Yoakum [sp?], and Warren Jimenez [sp?]"
Amy Ries [sp?] and Karen Burkes [sp?] on my staff who have all worked on uh this issue over the past 2 1/2 years.
"Again, to our community partner Basic Rights Oregon, to the trans community of Portland who uh each and every day make this city a better place, and it's really my honour and privilege to serve on a City Council where we can bring an ounce of fairness, uh, in return."
"Um, when I put down this gavel, you can clap and cheer."
It's a  in German or Northern Germany where there is a wreath of greenery and then typically four candles set in a square fashion around this circular wreath.
And it would sit on the table.
"And so she wanted to make them go sideways, she was drawing a fold out drawing of the wreath and its four candles as her first drawing."
"Um, as an adult."
"So my suggestion to you is, don't think that it is necessary to start at some peculiar place which they must have, like three-dimensional objects, then move to representations of those, like a sculpture, then slip away another dimension and go to ."
Then slip away another dimension and go to two dimensions.
No - just drop them in the deep end and say please draw.
And you'll find they will do lines for surface edges without asking you what can a line stand for. and _.
"And they will start learning shapes that are relevant and they will start using spacial systems that are like sighted children, and then they will themselves mature as they themselves evaluate their own drawings."
"By the way, the box that I was asking her to draw was exactly a _ matte the box that you could fold up and put in my pocket, complicated enough that it would be a challenge for anybody and so it was a nice sort of task: draw a cube, draw a table, draw a glass, draw a hand, draw _ box."
These are examples of things that you can offer people as targets and they will draw them and they will criticize their own drawings and be satisfied with some parts and then drive themselves into more sophisticated drawings.
"Okay, is that enough?"
Constance:
"Okay, I know that there is other questions."
Dr. Kennedy:
"I am happy to stay, love talking about this, love to know your experiences."
Constance:
"Clearly, again another very passionate person with lots of information."
So Dr. Kennedy will be at the back and thank you
Dr. Kennedy:
My pleasure.

"My favourite Prime Minister is this man right here, Winston Churchill,"
"He was an incredible leader for our country, and indeed the whole free world at the most impossibly difficult time."
"Just a few yards away from here is the Cabinet Room, and Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister sat in that Cabinet Room, and decided, with his colleagues, to fight on against Nazi Germany and Hilter, even after France had fallen."
"That was a heroic decision, a right decision, and actually meant the world was saved from Nazi tyranny."
"It was the most important moment in British history, and I think it's because of his courage and guts that we made the right call."
NEWS READER:
"""Behind Winston Churchill we stand united as never before in history."""
"Well, obviously, he came to office in 1940, at a desperately difficult time; France was about to fall, the war was going extraordinarily badly from Britain's point of view, Hitler was rampant across Europe."
"It looked like the end for the free world, the end for Britain, and the end for"
Churchill too.
It's where they combine all of the things that they've learned through this class and doing it for a large cooking group.
"At first they're scared, but generally by the end, and it's all done they're really happy with their results."
"They felt like they've made a good product, they've pleased the people that they have been producing their meal for and they've had fun."
I liked it where it combined everything that they could do in their class and give them some practical experience in what they've learned.

How to Study for an Online Course
"To be successful in any course, you will need to develop good study habits."
"Much like face-to-face courses, one aspect related to studying for an online course is your study environment."
As you discovered earlier in the module each person has their own learning style.
Your learning style should be taken into consideration when selecting your study environment.
"Some individuals need a very quiet place to study to be able to concentrate; others need music, or other sound, in the background."
"Contrary to some people's belief, studying with the TV on is not usually effective."
"Also, your learning style will help you decide if you should study by yourself or in a study group."
"Choose the location where you study carefully, taking into mind that it needs to have good lighting, be at a comfortable temperature, and be free from distractions."
"To study successfully, you must manage your time effectively."
"Make sure to schedule adequate time over the course of the week to watch lecture videos, read course materials, work o"
Good afternoon!
"I am the only ex 87 detainee speaking speaking and as most of the speakers have spoken in English and will be in English, I would like to speak in Mandarin."
Ok!
"Dear citizens, dear friends, it has been 25 years!"
I was asked why the sudden hype this year when you guys had all along been keeping a low profile.
"Not so! we had on several occasions in the past, marked the event in different ways."
"This year is a special year, we are very happy to see so many of you attending."
It's 25 years passed.
"In 1987, 16 citizens were arrested under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in the first round with 6 more in the second."
"Two more were added in the following year, which makes the total 24, of whom many are still nursing the wounds or have not been able to forget that sudden twist of fate."
Those arrested had different encounters.
"""Beyond the Blue Gate"", a book written by lawyer Teo Soh Lung, has given a more detailed accounts of life in prison."
"Her account was interspersed with sometimes high-handed treatment, sometimes hilarious moments."
Other detainees have also reminisced about their prison ordeals.
"As far as I am concerned, I started off not knowing what the ISD (Internal Security Department) officers wanted from me."
It's to be distracted and allow the environment and stimuli in the environment to control our attention.
"So yeah I think it was the book and other developments that trained us to pay attention, but the fact that that was has been a fairly short part of our history doesn't mean we should give it up easily, but cherish it all the more and protect it all the more."
PETER NORVlG:
I'm all for protecting it.
And we are going to go to questions in a few minutes.
There's the mic so if people want to ask questions please line up there.
And while we're doing that I just want to mention one more thing which is maybe the book that is closest to yours that's popular now is Clay Shorkey's Cognitive Surpluses and he talks about what he calls cognitive surpluses is this idea that its the thing television stole form us
"That in history from most of history, we had to spend all of our time just sort of surviving."
"And then in modern society, we got this new notion of leisure time and that was something that never existed before, and then television took it away to the tune 200 Billion hours a year in the U.S. alone."
"And clay points out, if one percent of the TV watchers throughout the world stop watching TV, and did something useful, they could produce two Wikipedias a week."
(Laughter)
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Just what we need (more laughter)
PETER NORVlG:
What's your comment on Clay's take?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"I think Clay's a very smart guy and think he's a very hopeful guy and if in fact we see that change in behavior that would be a good thing, but what we know from the statistics is that TV viewing hours have gone up throughout the entire era of the web and in fact they hit their highest era since the Neilson Company began monitoring TV last year."
"And if you had to those TV hours which are now at the highest point ever, all the time we waste online as opposed to creating Wikipedia or doing other useful things, you see the time we waste with media today is enormous and far greater in the Hey day of Television. yeah we might all start changing and getting together and creating all kinds of things or we might still continue to waste a lot of time online and TV."
I don't know.
PETER NORVlG:
Okay let's go to questions.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Start from this side.
MAN 1:
"I haven't read you book yet, but I have a question for you."
Part of growing up is making breaks in your past.
For me growing up was going away to school and then from school going to another school and from there going to another school and then finally moving away.
And going to start working.
And you took these points in my life and I had to choose who I was going to stay in touch with.
"One of the things with that the previous talk with the Facebook of that and these social networks, you have to choose who not to stay in touch with and how is that part of making us smarter and making us dumber in that conversation?"
"How is staying with the burden of your choices as a young person, is that holding people back?"
"And is that, I went through all these breaks before the internet and I'm sure you probably did to."
"In terms of the budget and the Grand Bargain, what we're hearing is the discussion, especially on the Senate side between democrats and republicans, is to do another Grand"
Bargain.
The additional tax increases won't be what you call a big tax increase.
They will go in and change the tax loopholes.
They will eliminate some of the big tax loopholes that benefit some high earners and some big businesses like Exxon and others.
But if they can get the tax code to where it ought to be they will generate probably another $600 million in tax revenues.
And the President started a big bruha amongst the democrats and the republicans last week where he's actually beginning to start talking about cutting some of the entitlement programs.
"We're talking about Medicare, Medicaid, Social"
"Security, beginning to make some cuts on those because so many of the Baby Boomers are retiring and entering into that retirement workforce."
And that is ballooning those costs associated with it.
So that is the deal.
Can you increase the taxes by closing loopholes enough and can you increase revenue enough on the other side to spur economic growth and to rebuild the infrastructure and then keep the country from going into a recession.
We think the politics are excellent in the Senate.
It's hard to say what's going to happen in the House.
But there is some discussion that hopefully some of the regulars of the
"Republican Party will begin to talk with Boehner, can begin to talk with members of the House."
"And it may be a situation where it won't be a majority bill in the house, but if Republicans and Democrats are free to vote on the issues themselves when it comes to the budget there may be enough votes to cobble together some democrats and some republicans to get something passed in a Grand Bargain or in a budget."
"The downside of that is with the Republican Party trending so far to the right now is that most republicans don't necessarily fear a democratic challenger in the next election, but they fear an even more conservative member of the party upending them in a primary."
That's the politics of it.
So we don't know what's going to happen in the House.
I know there is some work going on.
I know the
"President is having these meetings now with republican individuals separately with lunches, dinners, and everything else, and also collectively."
We hope all of that will come to some sort of fruition.
I will speak a little bit more about CSBG after the conclusion of the CSBG presentation.
Brad:
"Great, Arley."
"Thank you very, very much for that overview, and let's turn to Mark Schmeissing who is the NASCSP"
Acting Director for Research for CSBG.
"Mark has been analyzing the numbers for CSBG and it looks like we've got some pretty big challenges on our hands, Mark."
Mark:
"Thanks, Brad."
"Evidently we didn't know what was going to happen on the 16th, but by the 15th we had to be deployed in different cities of Spain, as we did."
We were clear about this.
So to us this was something natural.
We worked there because this was something important to us.
Evidently it was important because we empathized with some of the demands that were on the table.
ST:
"Maybe due to your preparation, or your perspective, the fact that you weren't caught by surprise, comes the situation that you, personally, and your media outlet was directly associated with the 15M."
"And you are a sort of medial outlet part of 15M or something like that, no?"
JL:
To inform about 15M does not mean TO BE PART of 15M.
In the same way that a journalist on the mainstream media who informs daily about the PP is not part of PP or a person who informs daily about the PSOE is not part of PSOE.
Or a person who informs daily about the NGOs is not a member of an NGO.
That's obvious to me.
"Now, I have no problem admitting that I empathize with many of the things that were happening on that square, no problem at all."
"Not one, because among another million things in which I don't believe, I don't believe in keeping my distance or in being extra careful in dealing with something."
"Firstly, being part of the 15M is very complicated because it's nothing."
"I have to insist, 15M is a diagnosis."
You can share certain parts of the diagnosis.
Each person's solutions are completely different.
"And being part of something... for the journalists who were at the Puerta del Sol not only those of Periodismo Humano, but also many other mainstream media corporations who had their journalists there, for those journalists- not the corporations- I think that the defence mechanism of warning that they were there doing their job and were not part of it, is the same defence mechanism used by the 15M as a general rule when someone asked them if they're left or right-wing."
Then the 15M said:
"""Wait, you don't understand... what I do in the street isn't that, it's different""."
"And the journalists who were in the 15M were informing on what we saw, but to say that we're part of the 15M as many have said indicates that they don't understand what the 15M is because you can't be a militant of the 15M."
You can't.
"And secondly, a lack of respect towards our work as journalists."
"Not towards those of Periodismo Humano, but towards those from Punto Radio and La Sexta, towards those from 20minutos and TVE..."
"Many people who were there informing about the 15M in their own way, maybe in personal networks and not through more institutional channels for whatever reason."
ST:
"Let's continue with journalism, which I was saving for later but since we're on the topic..."
"I'd like you to tell me first how you think the movement, the #15M and the camps have been treated in the media, generally speaking."
JL:
I think there were various phases in the media treatment of #15M.
"But he showed incredible bravery, incredible courage at bringing the nation together, forging a courageous spirit, taking on Hitler, and eventually winning."
"So it was a very difficult time for Britain, a time when you needed the best possible leader, the most courageous possible leader to come forward, and in Winston Churchill we were incredibly fortunate to have that man."

Steven:
"When historians talk about late 19th-century Paris, they often talk about a culture of display, and this is a painting that is all about that."
Beth:
"We're looking at Mary Cassatt's painting,"
"Woman with a Pearl Necklace in a Loge, and this is, perhaps, Mary Cassatt's sister pictured in the Paris opera house."
"She's sitting in a private booth, and we can see behind her a mirror, which reflects all the other private booths in the opera house."
Steven:
"So the Paris opera house, situated at the intersection of the Grand Boulevards, is a building which is a kind of jewel itself, but that also puts its occupants on display."
"In other words, the stage of the opera house is not simply where the ballet takes place, but the stage is also the audience."
Beth:
"The architecture of the Paris opera house enabled seeing and being seen, and afforded numerous opportunities in small, little balconies and spaces where one could glimpse the fashionable elite of Paris, and we certainly feel that we're looking at one of the members of that elite in this painting by Mary Cassatt."
Steven:
What you said is exactly right.
Look at the composition.
Mary Cassatt must have been turned away from the stage
"looking into the box towards her sister, and Lydia is, in turn, looking back out towards the audience, and so we're seeing Lydia the way that the audience would have seen her, had they glanced into this box."
She is this object of display within this jewel box.
Beth:
"But Cassatt doesn't paint herself reflected in the mirror, where she must have been as she looked at Lydia and painted her."
"The significance of Assata Shakur being put on the FBl's terrorists list, the first woman ever to be added to the most wanted list?"
LENNOX HlNDS:
"My view on this is that this is a disingenuous act on the part of, driven by the state of New Jersey and particularly the state police."
"As you know, for decades, the state police have wanted and demanded that the Cuban government extradite Assata Shakur to the United States."
There is no extradition policy between Cuba and the United States.
"Just to deal with this in context, the Cuban government, pursuant to international law— that is, particularly the refugee convention— have granted Assata Shakur political asylum."
"Now, what is the basis for that?"
"It is if an individual has a well-grounded fear that if they return to the country from which they left, they would either be persecuted or prosecuted based upon their political beliefs or/and their race or religion."
"Now, this is not a new concept."
"There have been numerous individuals who have left the United States and went to foreign countries, allies of the United States, where those countries have refused to extradite them."
"France, for example, in the 1970s, there were Black Panthers who hijacked planes and went to France."
"Now, both France and the United States have extradition treaties."
"Not only that, France signed the 1963 Tokyo Convention, the 1970 Hague Convention and the 1973 Montreal Convention, with the United States."
"All of these are international agreements that require countries, host countries, that are holding individuals—who have hijacked planes—to extradite them or try them."
"France, after conducting their own independent review of these Black Panthers, refused to extradite them to the United States based upon France's assessment that if they would be returned, they would be subject to political and racial repression."
"So, I say that the Cubans"" position is well grounded in international law."
"Now, why today is Assata Shakur now being branded a terrorist?"
"If we look at the definition of terrorism, what is it?"
It is the use or the threat of use of force against a civilian population to achieve political ends.
What happened in the case of Assata Shakur?
"You have heard, in her own words, this woman was a political activist."
She was targeted by whom?
J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI in a program that was called COlNTELPRO.
That program was unveiled by whom?
"Frank Church, Senator Frank Church, in the 1970s."
He chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee.
"That committee determined that the FBI was using both legal, but mostly illegal, methods—to do what?"
"In the FBl's own words, they wanted to discredit, to stop the rise of a black messiah— that was the fear of the FBl— so that there would not be a Mau Mau, in their words, uprising in the United States."
"And they were, of course, referring to the liberation movement that occurred in Kenya, Africa."
"Now, the FBI carried out a campaign targeting not only the Black Panther Party."
They targeted SCLC.
They targeted Martin Luther King.
"Well, let me read the FBI press release, and you can respond to how they describe it."
"And we want to bring Angela Davis in, as well."
"This was their press release yesterday describing the May 2nd, 1973, shooting."
"They said, ""*On May 2, 1973, Chesimard and a pair of accomplices *"
*were stopped by two troopers for a motor vehicle violation on the New Jersey Turnpike. *
"*At the time, Chesimard—a member of the violent revolutionary activist organization known as the Black Liberation Army—*"
"*was wanted for her involvement in several felonies, including bank robbery.*"
*Chesimard and her accomplices opened fire on the troopers. *
"*One officer was wounded, his partner—Trooper Foerster—was shot and killed at point-blank range. *"
*One of Chesimard's accomplices was killed in the shoot-out and the other was arrested and remains in jail.*
"*Chesimard fled but was apprehended.*"""
That's their statement yesterday.
LH:
Right.
"Also in their statement that I read, the superintendent of state police claimed that Assata Shakur took the Officer Foerster's weapon and shot him while he was on the ground."
There is not one scintilla of evidence at the trial attesting to that.
"In fact, as I was saying before, she was incapable of lifting her hands, much less firing a weapon."
"Now, you asked what is the reason for this allegation at this time."
"We have to remember that 10 years ago,  a little over 10 years ago, the then-governor of the state of New Jersey, former Governor Christie Todd Whitman, she had issued and posted a $1 million bounty for Assata Shakur."
Today it has been doubled.
"But we believe that putting Ms. Chesimard, putting Assata Shakur on the FBl's 10 most wanted list is designed to inflame the public and to characterize her as a terrorist, when none of the acts alleged relates to terrorism."
"In fact, of all of the charges that have been leveled against her in New York, case after case, she was acquitted, or the charges were dismissed."
There was insufficient evidence to support any of the charges.
AG:
"Well, let's just—in 1971, armed robbery case was dismissed; 1971, she was acquitted of bank robbery; 1972, hung jury; 1972, kidnap of drug dealer, acquitted; and then several other cases dismissed."
"Angela Davis, you're in Chicago right now to give a major address tonight at the University of Chicago."
"Can you talk about this news of Joanne Chesimard, Assata Shakur, being—now being put on the top 10 wanted terrorists list, the first woman ever to be put on this list?"
ANGELA DAVlS:
"Well, first of all, it was a major shock to hear that Assata Shakur has become the first woman to be added to the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list and then to learn that they're adding another million dollars to the reward, the bounty really."
It seems to me that this act incorporates or reflects the very logic of terrorism.
I can't help but think that it's designed to frighten people who are involved in struggles today.
"Forty years ago seems as if it were a long time ago, four decades; however, in the 21st century, at the beginning of the 21st century, we're still fighting around the very same issues— police violence, healthcare, education, people in prison, and so forth."
The middle part (alto) is mostly for extend harmonization
Imagine a string group is like a hamburger.
The violins are the beef. the cellos are the bread. the violas are like vegetables.
Not the most important but weird without them.
Continue with the metaphor or the burger.
Improve the taste of the burger means improvement of the ingredients
"Breads have similar taste anyways. so people will mostly focus on the beef, so vege-like violas are ignored"
Now you can cook beef in different ways. even breads can served with butter or soup
Greens?
Eat them raw.
This cycle that happens over and over centuries  makes the situation now viola is facing
There are lots of composers in the world who loves and plays the viola
Here are some examples
Our first example is J.S. Bach
His 5th son is also a composer
He recalled that his dad loves the viola
"Well, J.S. Bach is the father of music and he knows how to play all the strings and keyboard instruments but he sits the viola section when he plays the string quartet"
"He composed 6 string quintet with these quintets, he added the 2nd viola  to enhance the texture of the pieces"
Bach said he loves the sound and the volume of the viola
Our 2nd example is Mozart
Mozart is well known for writing nice sections for violas in his quartets
He wrote a Violin and Viola concerto to his mom
During the premiere of this concerto
Mozart plays the viola and let his dad plays the violin
This is not because the viola part is easier
Both parts have many similar passages and difficulties
But Mozart still chose to play the viola there is no evidence to prove why he did that so I think Mozart secretly loves the viola
There are more famous composers who had play the viola
"However, there are no famous violists so there is no composers to write songs for the viola then there is no pieces to train violists as a result, there is no famous violists"
The theory is similar when you find a job the job requires you to have experiences but you have no job to gain experiences
Paganini is known as one of the most virtuous violinists
"He did try swap from playing the violin to the viola and he knows that there is no good pieces for viola so he paid a composer, Berlioz, to write him a  concerto to show off his viola skills"
What?
Roomate?!
Did something happen?
"No, I'm fine."
Voiceover:
"Let's say I am an economist, and I am curious about whether, in general, things are getting more expensive or not, and if they are getting expensive, by how much?"
"The way I'd approach that is,"
"I'd think of, what are just a bunch of goods and services that the average person would buy?"
"I would think up some type of basket of goods and services, and I would try to weight that basket, based on how people actually spend their money, so I would say, ""Okay, 40% of people's money"
"""on average are spent on housing;"
"""maybe another 10% is spent on transportation;"
"""maybe another 10% is spent on food,"" and I would go out into the market, and I would try to take an average of what these things cost, and I would sample a bunch of products, a bunch of services, so I could get a decent average of that."
"This is not a simple thing to do, but I am an economist, and I am serious about trying to calculate it."
"Let's say that when I take that weighted average of all of the stuff, I just come up with a number."
"I'm not giving you the details of how it's actually calculated, but to give you the idea of what they are doing."
I get a number.
"To rent, to buy or lease your average automobile; to lease your average apartment; to buy your average servings of food for a given family; all the rest;"
"let's say I come up with, that costs, and I'm making up a number here,"
"let's say that it costs $20,000."
My basket of goods and services.
Just based on the way that I've weighted it.
This is all happening in year 1.
This is in year 1.
"I'm curious whether between year 1 and, let's say, year 5, and year 5, whether things got more expensive."
"I'll take that same basket of goods and services, so, basket of goods and services, and I'll try to figure out what is their weighted average cost in year 5?"
"This is a lot harder than it might sound right now, because the baskets of goods and services change."
"If computers get faster, do you use the same computer, or do you think about what the average computer is, which would now be a better computer?"
"If most people's TVs got bigger, do you use the same TV in year 1 and year 5 or do you adjust for what is now the average TV, which is now bigger?"
"If houses have gotten bigger on average, do you use the same house, or would you use the average house?"
"There's a whole bunch of areas here that you can really tweak, and these are actually huge subjects of debate, on what is the actual increase in cost."
"Let's say that you're able to do this in what you think is a pretty reasonable way, and you find that the same basket of goods, adjusted for things like technology and all of the rest, now costs $22,000."
"Your takeaway from here is that the same things that cost $20,000, the things that gave you the same standard of living in year 1, to get that same standard of living in year 5, you now need to spend 10% more."
"Every single year: fewer electricians, fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers, fewer welders, fewer pipefitters, fewer steamfitters."
"The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys -- the ones that have been in decline, over and over."
"Meanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars -- at a minimum, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers -- that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure, which is currently rated at a D minus."
"So, if I were running for anything, and I'm not,"
I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.
"And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us, but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites."
"They're two sides of the same coin, just like innovation and imitation,"
"like risk and responsibility,"
"like peripetia and anagnorisis,"
"like that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore, and like my time that's gone."
"It's been great talking to you and get back to work, will you?"
(Applause)
The same statistic was run for female students.
"Again, I made up the data to illustrate the effect."
Females tended to apply predominantly for major B with 900 applications for major B and just 100 for major A.
The university accepted 80 out of 100 applications in major A and 180 out of 900 in major B.
Please tell me the rate of acceptance in percent for major A for the females student population.
I believe the first step I took at the Mechina was my first step towards success in life
"After you finish the Mechina, you have the tools to succeed later on in life, in the army, in everything that follows"
"I think this Mechina in general isn't a Pre-military Academy, but a preparatory academy for how to live life"
"When we thought about erecting an institution in the city we deliberated what kind of institution it should be, and we decided that this is what Am Yisrael really needs now"
I went to Rabbi Drukman and asked him who should lead the Mechina
He told me to call Rabbi Boaz [Sherman.
"They asked me to lead the Mechina, to found it"
I debated about it and in the end
I decided to go ahead with the idea
"We brought a bus from Ashkelon, some guys from here and there we told the guys we recruited:"
"""Guys, there will be a new Mechina here next year"""
It was a very special experience.
"We began with 30 guys, ""the pioneers"" who came to the Mechina."
They began the idea in a really nice way.
"We came to Kiryat Malachi we sought a place for the Mechina, though we couldn't find a suitable place so we rented an apartment and a storage area which would serve as our Beit Midrash."
"Threw all of that type A energy into having kids, and we had four kids in just over five years."
(Laughter)
"And I was busy nuking those Dino Nuggets, (Laughter) serving flourescent mac and cheese, and blue yogurt."
I didn't want anybody telling me what to feed my kids;
I didn't want anybody telling me what to eat.
"And then one morning, five years ago, over breakfast, everything changed, and our youngest child had an allergic reaction."
I was so clueless.
"As I raced her to the pediatrician's office, she said, ""Robyn, what did you feed the kids for breakfast?"""
"And I said, ""Well, tubes of blue yogurt,"
"L'Eggo my Eggo waffles, and scrambled eggs."""
"And she said, ""Well, those are three of the top eight allergens,"" and she starts rattling off these statistics about food allergies."
"And I had totally rolled my eyes at the whole thing, and I thought, ""Since when?"" because I hadn't known anybody with a food allergy when I was a kid, and I didn't understand why all of the sudden a PB&amp;amp;J and a carton of milk were loaded weapons on a lunch room table."
"So as I got everything under control and I got the kids back down, and everybody was down for a nap that day, every analytical gene in my body went off, and I wanted to see the data."
And that morning I learned that from 1997 until 2002 there'd been a doubling of the peanut allergy.
I learned that one out of 17 kids under the age of three then had a food allergy.
"I learned that one in three American kids now has allergies, autism,"
"ADHD, or asthma."
"And I later went on to learn, according to the CDC, there'd been a 265 percent increase in the rate of hospitalizations related to food allergies."
That was people checked in to the ER - big kids and little ones.
That wasn't somebody making it up.
"And as I learned that a food allergy is when your body sees food as foreign, and launches an inflammatory response to drive out that foreign invader, it just begged the question, is there something foreign in our food that wasn't there when we were kids?"
I don't think anything really could have prepared me for the answer that I found.
"Because as I dug into the data, I learned that in 1994, in order to drive profitability for the food industry, scientists genetically engineered an E. coli bacteria to create an artificial growth hormone to help a cow make more milk."
"The analyst in me - it made perfect sense: you drive profitability for the dairy industry, there's the argument you can lower the cost of milk, who can stand in front of that?"
"But at the same time, I kept coming back to the fact we were genetically engineering E. coli bacteria to create an artificial growth hormone that we were injecting into our dairy cows."
And we were the only developed country in the world that did it.
"Canada, the UK, all 27 countries in Europe,"
"Australia, New Zealand, Japan - they all said, ""This has never been proven safe."""
"The product label for the product said that it caused fertility problems, reproductive problems, mastitis, ovarian cysts."
"It resulted in an increased antibiotic use in animals, and so for that reason, these countries never allowed it."
"And yet, we did."
"And then studies started to come out showing that it elevated hormone levels that were linked to breast, prostate, and colon cancer."
"It has sort of the, these harps and a mysterious sound, and now. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Another man I can never know, because I cannot talk with him, for I am a mute and cannot speak."
"I am cut off from other men, but in my own silence. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; So we have Finn's internal monologue. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Here, know things they can never know. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Which is an interesting thing, because here is a man who cannot speak."
"And yet, narrates."
So who is he narrating to?
"In a way, the only people that he can speak to is the audience."
And though he speaks in symbols and abstractions.
He is the only one who speaks the truth.
"So, at the beginning of the film, Lewton and Robson are setting up a disjunction between image and sound, between what people say and the truth."
Between what can be seen and what can be heard.
"Now a scene that really emphasizes this split, and plays with it, is the scene of surgery."
Now watch and think about how the split between image and sound make this a powerful moment.
It begins with the steady sound of breathing of the patient and the cold clinical sound of the radio.
"At the same time, because we're in the room with that characters, we're privy to the terrible truth that we have a man who's not a doctor that must begin cutting into this body."
"It's interesting, interesting stuff watch. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Under anesthetic. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Alter to Panama, patient is asleep breathing very heavily. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; If the patient is completely anesthetized you may proceed."
"Are you ready? &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Alter to Panama, we are ready. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Panama to all tear."
"Capt Stone will bring his right hand to the point which we have already established. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; It's cold clinical and full of tension, but then we must begin cutting, framing moves in and we don't actually see the knife, we must imagine."
"Then we see it, then we don't. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Inside to a depth of one. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Inside to a depth of one. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Now here comes a moment when other people in the room begin to notice what's really happening and we have the split between image and sound."
"We, and people in the room will know that"
Stone is not doing the surgery.
"But the doctors on the other end of the radio, think that he is because all they have is sound, and everybody's lying through sound here. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Quarter inch, continue with the incision vertically 4 inches. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; In a way of course we're relieved that he can't do it because then we don't have to see it."
"But it's the complicity of everyone else in the room at covering up Stone's inability that it's troubling. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Make the incision. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I'll turn to Panama, wait a minute we're not ready yet. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; And now the lie begins."
It's a game played between showing and hearing.
"We can see the truth. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; [inaudible] we are ready, please repeat. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; The doctors on the other end can't."
But when the patient is off screen and the actual cutting happens we don't see it.
"We have to infer what is happening on screen, or off screen rather."
This reminds me of Lewton's old maxim that what the audience can imagine is far worse than what he can actually show.
Now here's a film that wants us to listen to it very carefully.
It's also a film that's uses the typical strategies of Hollywood film fairly effectively.
"And I've got an example, since it's our first film that uses an underscore, and example of how underscoring works."
"[music] and it's quite good, so note how the soundtrack plays up the emotions that aren't expressed on the surface."
"This is a love scene, Ellen is hopefully and, and full of romance."
"Hopeful that it will finally happen between her and Stone, but he knows that he cannot commit."
"So, in the summer, any location that's about 40 degrees north of the equator,"
"like Hartford, Connecticut, will get 15 hours of daylight each day and 9 hours of darkness."
It warms up for longer than it cools.
"This happens day after day, so there is an overall warming effect."
Remember this fact for later!
"In the winter, the opposite happens."
"There are many more hours of cooling time than warming time, and day after day, this results in a cooling effect."
"The interesting thing is, as you move north, the number of daylight hours in summer increases."
"So, Juneau, Alaska would get about 19 hours of daylight on the same summer day that Tallahassee, Florida gets about 14."
"In fact, in the summertime at the North Pole, the sun never sets."
"OK, then, it's all about daylight hours, I've got it!"
"Well, no, there's another important piece to this puzzle."
"If daylight hours were the only thing that determined average temperature, wouldn't the North Pole be the hottest place on Earth in northern summer because it receives 24 hours of daylight in the months surrounding the summer solstice?"
But it's the North Pole.
There's still icebergs in the water and snow on the ground.
"So, what's going on?"
"The Earth is a sphere and so the amount of solar energy an area receives changes based on how high the sun is in the sky, which, as you know, changes during the day between sunrise and sunset."
"But, the maximum height also changes during the year, with the greatest solar height during the summer months and highest of all at noon on the summer solstice, which is June 21st in the northern hemisphere and December 21st in the southern hemisphere."
"This is because as the Earth revolves, the northern hemisphere ends up tilted away from the sun in the winter and toward the sun in summer, which puts the sun more directly overhead for longer amounts of time."
Remember those increased summer time daylight hours?
And solar energy per square kilometer increases as the sun gets higher in the sky.
"So, when the sun's at an angle, the amount of energy delivered to each square of the sunlit area is less."
"Therefore, even though the North Pole is getting 24 hours of daylight to warm up, the sunlight it receives is very spread out and delivers less energy than a place further south, where the sun is higher in the sky because it's more tilted toward the sun."
"Besides, the North Pole has a lot to make up for."
It was cooling down without any sunlight at all for 6 months straight.
"So, as the seasons change, wherever you are, you can now appreciate not just the beauty of each new season but the astronomical complexity that brings them to you."
In Digital Video Production we learn the process of creating a short film.
"We begin with the story, coming up with an idea that will be both narratively interesting and practical for us to shoot."
"We learn the basics of camera, sound and lighting techniques, combining classroom training with hands-on experience with the equipment and software provided by the Digital Arts Initiative."
"Professor Kolbe brings an incredible amount of knowledge, having worked in ""The Industry"" for many years."
"We study composition, movement, pacing and directing through critiquing our own work and analyzing popular movies and TV shows."
During this whole process we are planning and story-boarding our own short films.
And it kind of makes sense.
"You have a cluster of people together and you have a variety of different avenues, ways for students to make their thoughts known, so colleges and, as I said, particularly Yale became known as the sort of seedbed of sedition."
"As one Loyalist said of Yale in the 1770s,"
"The college is no longer remarkable for its scholarship but instead for ""its persecuting spirit, its republican principles, its intolerance in religion""-- but this is a person of"
"Loyalist sympathies, who says, 'Yale used to be great."
It's all downhill now.
"They have those crazy, wild, radical students.'"
"Or, as a British officer put it in 1779-- he happens to be the British officer who invaded New Haven-- quote, ""That place (New Haven) is a spacious and very considerable town; it has the largest university in America, and might with propriety be styled the parent and nurse of rebellion."""
Okay.
"We are the parent and nurse of rebellion--'Yale, hate Yale.'"
"Okay, but this is not to say that colleges in this period are"
"little isolated seedbeds of rebellion and everybody else is sort of sitting around whittling pieces of wood, thinking, 'oh, I wonder what the British are doing today.'"
Right?
It's not as though the colleges are isolated from the communities or that the colleges only notice the communities when they're going to go out and burn random citizens' tea as they did in New Jersey.
"There were obviously, there were connections between whatever was going on in these colleges and whatever was going on in these towns, and we're going to see that play out a couple of times in this lecture today."
Sometimes things that went on in the town spread their way onto the Yale campus.
"An example of this is in the late 1760s when there was a rally on the New Haven town green against British policy, and the Yale students apparently attended that rally and got very stirred up by the rally and decided to continue it on the Yale campus, at which point a big group of students decided it would be a really great idea to declare their political sentiments by toasting English radical John"
Wilkes.
"And they decided not--And I don't know where this number came from, because I didn't have time to research where the number came from, but you'll hear why I questioned it."
They decided that they would toast John Wilkes forty-five times.
[laughter]
Okay.
That's forty-five drinks.
[laughs]
"So one observer, who I gather from my research this morning had Loyalist sympathies, said that ""instead of drinking 45 glasses in honor of Wilkes and Liberty,"" the Yale students ""drank themselves 45 degrees in extremo"
"DRUNK."""
[laughter]
"So we've got plastered Yale students like: 'yeah, liberty'--[laughter] but that's the town spreading into the realm of the gown."
"Now, in the 1660s we're seeing these sort of public demonstrations-- New Haven, Yale campus protesting policies-- but not anything that dramatic happening."
But things become worse as relations between England and its colonies became worse and as actions became more aggressive on both sides.
"People in New Haven, as in a lot of other places, became more aggressive in their politics and became stronger in their actions."
"They made bolder decisions, and a great example of that is again here in New Haven, 1774."
I am from Canada so I have some beautiful Canadian maple syrup.
Canada number three which is the dark amber maple syrup.
Hmm.
So good!
"I love it more than the light maple syrup and this has more flavor and for sure not using the table syrup, those are like the maple flavored syrup, donít use those."
"Itís gotta be the pure stuff, those other maple syrups have a lot of refined ingredients."
They usually made from corn syrup and those arenít very good for you so donít use those.
See how our vegetables are doing.
They are staring to sweat which is a good thing.
Think of it like a sauna.
A good dressing thatís made properly gets nice and thick like this and like I said this is a glazed that weíre gonna put over our carrots and parsnips and so whatís gonna happen is its gonna thicker even more in the oven and what makes a glazed is a little bit of sweetener so thatís why weíre using the maple syrup coz that what makes it have that beautiful glazing action.
"Ok with the mustard seeds you wanna wait until you can smell them but once youíve been able to smell them, theyíre gonna burn pretty quickly after that so timing is critical."
Then what youíil do is take your vegetables which should be nicely softened but not necessarily fully cooked coz they are gonna go into the oven.
"Get them all out, give the glazed a"
little last stir and then pour it right over the vegetables and get it nicely mix in there.
"So there they are ready to go into the oven, more glazed is better because then you can drizzle it up whatever else your eating."
"These mustard seeds are getting mix nicely as well now theyíre not necessary, if youíre not a huge fan of mustard or you canít find the whole seeds just leave them out."
The glazed on its own is nice as well.
"So pop this up into the oven, the glazed needs about 5 minutes to thicken a little bit and to soften the flavor because itís gonna be pretty strong raw so you do need to bake this sauce."
So pop this up to the oven five minutes maybe more if you like.
"So there they are, maybe hard to tell on the video but the sauce has actually glazed around the vegetables meaning that itís gotten kind of sticky and thicker and just plain yummy."
Like I said excellent as part of an appetizer night or some side for another dish you can find the recipe for the maple Dijon glazed vegetable at HealthyVeganRecipes.net.

The world health organization declaration of a flu pandemic is a frist of such a virus in more than 40 years
The WHO's director general is Margerat Chan
The world is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic
We are the in the earlist day of the pandemic
The virus is spreading under a closed and a careful watch no previous pandemic has been detected so early or watched so closely in real time right at the very beginning
The declaration of the bug widely know as swine flu is a pandemic rasies the alert level world level
The move will trigger a wave of heightened health measures among the WHO 193 member states but its succession to pandemic status refelcts only its geographic spread not how virulent it is
"The new strain of swine flu emerged in April in Mexico and the United States 5 year old Mexican boy,Edgar Hernandez was among the first cases"
"But inevitably,  you go on, you forget."
"So this is what he wrote,"
"""The compassion came and it is simply doing nothing but to start over."
Compassion was experienced here and  practiced on the most basic form.
"Compassion for myself  and for my breath, to be sure that the more life-altering and monumental expressions of compassion to be had, perhaps this is just a seed  of a strong foundation of lasting compassion to be applied and lived in any relationship  for the world at large."
"Things, plants, animals, people,  all act and leave their mark on this world and I cannot control them."
"I need to be able to experience their movements and their contributions to the universe, with compassion just as  I practice the breath compassion."""
What a wonderful thing that this simple practice brought this deep compassion and I have witnessed this in so many of my students.
I am so grateful that I am able to do this work.
Thank you.
(R. Brady) Our next speaker will be Meena Srinivasan who is an international mindfulness educator.
She has brought it to classrooms of both middle school and upper school.
"She has quite a bit to say about how to bring mindfulness into the classroom, she has much experience doing so."
(Meena Srinivasan) Thank you Richard.
"I'd like to begin from a space of gratitude to all of my teachers, and to everyone who helped  make this conference a reality."
"And of course, gratitude to all of you, because there are so many other places  that you could be right now, especially during summer vacation,  yet you chose to be here and to spend a week sharing  in the practice of mindfulness."
"I think that this mindfulness  in education movement is really signaling a pedagogical shift, and a shift towards authenticity  and one that is infused with relationships and a shift towards the whole child that was so beautifully spoken about."
It is just a real gift to be here  and to share in that with all of you.
"Earlier on, in my career as an educator, first of all, I became a teacher like many teachers because I had this motivation  to want to serve and to want to contribute and to want to make the world  a better place in some way."
"Early on, I was at a conference and I had encountered this pretty well-known  Thai intellectual named Sulak Sivaraksa, some of you might have heard about him, He is a well-known engaged Buddhist."
I was asking him something theoretical about social emotional learning.
"He just looked at me and he said:""My dear, a good teacher must first be happy."""
I am going to quote Auden  and not the Buddha.
I had read Parker Palmer and I had read that teachers teach you who they are.
But it really wasn't until  I had encountered the Plum Village mindfulness practice that I was able to touch that peace in myself and really understood  how the teacher transmits their presence.
"A good friend of mine, once wrote that the unwritten curriculum in the classroom is the teacher's presence."
"Through the practice, I was able to get tools and ways in which I could really cultivate that happiness, that joy within myself."
"Of course, I was really eager to go back  and share with my students."
But what Thay really emphasizes is that the way in which you really share is through your way of being  and it starts there.
"And then,  you will develop that authenticity where when you are sharing mindfulness practices, they come rather naturally."
"So, I am going to share one story of transformation that happened in my classroom teaching."
"Then with time permitting, share some specific practices that I share with my students."
Here's our first example of a martingale.
We can construct one from a random walk.
"Let Sn be equal to the sum of the Xi's from i equals 1 to N, where the Xi's are IlD with mean mu, then we can set Mn equal to Sn minus n times mu, and in that case, Mn is a martingale."
"We can see this because of the following, the expected value of Mn plus n, conditional time n information, is equal to, what we have over here on the right-hand side."
"So recall, Mn plus n will be equal to Sn plus m, minus n, plus m times mu."
"So this here is Sn, and here's our m plus m times is mu."
"Well were taking this expectation conditional on time n information, so in that case, what we can do is, we can take out the first nxi's, because they're known to us as a time end, so we can take them outside the expectation."
"And what we're left is the expectation of time n, of the sum of the xi's from i equals n plus 1 up to n plus m."
"Well, the xi's are IlD, so knowing the value of the first nxi's tells us nothing about these."
"We also know that they've got mean mu, so therefore the expected value of this sum here, is equal to m times mu."
We also have the n plus m mu over here.
"Now when we simplify all of this, this m-mu will cancel with this m-mu, we're left with the sum of the xi's and i equals 1 minus n times mu, and of course, we see that this is equal to Mn."
"So in fact, we have shown that the expected value of m, subscript m plus n, conditional on time n information is equal to Mn, and so it's a Martingale."
"In this example, we're going to consider what we will call a Martingale betting strategy."
"Let x1 x2 and so on be IlD random variables, where xi can take on two possible values, it can take on 1 or minus 1, in each case it takes on that value with probability 1/2."
"So you can imagine xi representing the result of a coin-flipping game, you win $1 if coin comes up heads, and you lose $1 if coin comes up tails, that assumes that you bet, $1 on the game."
"What we're going to do now is to consider a doubling strategy, where we keep doubling the bet until we eventually win, once we win, we stop and our initial bet is $1."
"So the first thing to note, is that the size of the bet on the nth play is 2 to the n minus 1, and that's because of the following, so on the first play, we bet $1 which is equal to 2 to the 0."
"On the second play we bet $2, because we're doubling our bet, and this is equal to 2 to the power of 1."
"On the third play of the game we would double our bet again, so we would bet 4, and that's equal to 2 squared, and so on."
"So we can see that every time you played the game, we've doubled our bet and so the play, the size of the bet on the nth play is 2 to the n minus 1."
"That of course assumes we're still playing at time n, because we will only be playing at time n if we haven't yet won the game up until this point."
"Let Wn denote the total winnings after m coin tosses, And assume we start off with W0 equals 0."
"What we're going to show, then, is that Wn is a Martingale."
"To see this, first note that Wn can only take on two possible values, it can only take on the value 1, or it will take on the value minus 2 to the n plus 1, and that is true for all n."
Why is this the case?
"Well, consider the following two situations."
"The first situation is as follows, suppose we win for the first time on the nth bet."
"Well in that case, Wn is equal to minus this sum here."
Where does this sum come from?
"Well, we've lost $1 on the first bet, $2 on the second bet, and so on, up to 2 to the n minus $2, on the n minus first bet."
Then on the nth bet we win and we win 2 to the power of n minus 1.
"That is our big power, our power of delay."
Now people may ask why should the House of Lords exist?
Why should you have a chamber with any power at all if it is not elected?
"And that is a perfectly good question, but there is also, I think, quite a good answer."
You need in any Parliament to get the best results for the country as a whole.
"The proper balance is between democratic accountability with also a large number of Parliamentarians who are not primarily constrained by the political party they belong to, but are able because of their background, having been successful in business, in industry, in the arts, in politics or whatever, are able to make a personal contribution."
"And as long as the elected chamber has the last word, even if it is only after a year or so, then we feel that that balance is being properly maintained."
In the old days the House of Lords was as powerful as the House of Commons.
If you could not persuade the House of Lords then they effectively had a right of veto.
"That progressively became more unacceptable throughout the 20th Century because they are not and have not been an elected chamber, and therefore at the end of the day they are not a democratic assembly."
"So what we have now is a situation where the House of Lords, the most it can do is delay legislation for up to 1 or 2 years."
"That is quite a power to have because sometimes the Government is anxious to get legislation on the statute book and if the House of Lords is disagreeing or blocking, then compromises have to be reached that are acceptable."
Bills come to the House of Commons predominantly.
"They are looked at in various stages, but perhaps not in their entirety."
And then they reach the House of Lords.
"The House of Lords is not duplicating what the Commons does, it is actually going over some aspects of bills which may not have been looked at all."
"The House of Lords is, if you like, supportive in that the House of Lords scrutinises, advises and makes changes if possible to the amendments which come from the House Commons."
"The House of Lords is not a law making body, it is a scrutiniser, it is an advisory body and it advises the Commons on some of the"
legislation which goes through the Commons in an attempt to improve it.
"And often when a bill is being discussed during the Commons it comes to the Lords, the Lords makes some amendments to it; hopes to make improvements."
"Then it goes back to the Commons, to look at again."
"Many times the Commons approve of what the Lords have done and accept the amendments; many times they will not, so they change it back again."
It comes back again to the Lords; the Lords will look at it again.
"But at the end of the day, when you have had this to-ing and fro-ing and the improvement of legislation, the Commons has its say because the Commons is the supreme authority; it is the elected authority."
"But the relationship is there in this bi-cameral Parliament, and this is how it should be."
Parliamentarians are the agents of scrutiny within the United Kingdom's Parliamentary system.
But how do they execute this crucial role and how much influence do they have?
"When a bill is introduced into Parliament it goes through many stages, both in the House of Lords, where I sit, and in the House of Commons."
In the House of Commons a small committee will look at the detail line by line.
In the House of Lords any single Member can propose an amendment to a bill and it has to be debated and looked at.
So there are lots of opportunities to change the bill.
"But perhaps where that falls down is that, in most cases, the Government whips will not want to see too many changes to their bills."
"In Europe this variability decreases and almost all animals possess red variants of the mitochondrial DNA, while in Africa the yellow family predominates."
Why variability was lost?
The variability captured with domestication was lost during Europe and Africa colonization.
The expansion of Agriculture occurred through serial short range migrations.
Let's imagine the genetic variability captured by domestication as a bowl of spheres of different colours.
"At each movement, early farmers moved out of domestication centre at a speed of about 1 Km per year. they were taking a handful of spheres, that is animals, funding a new settlement and then multiplying spheres in a new bowl."
"Following demographic expansion, the progeny of the farmers moved again, taking a handful of spheres from the second bowl."
Each new handful didn't contain all the colours in the previous bowl and this caused a gradual loss of variability.
"Hence mitochondrial DNA agrees with archaeological and archaeobiological data and indicates a cattle domestication in South-West Asia, where the highest variation is observed."
Let's use a magnifying lens on Italy now.
I repeat: there's more genetic variation in South-West Asia and less in Europe.
"In Italy the pattern of cattle diversity is quite strange: in Southern and Northern Italy patterns are very similar to Central Europe, while Central Italy shows many colours and wide branching, much like South-West Asia."
"Surprisingly, the Central Italian explosion of diversity is delimited by ""normal"" North and South, with the expected red genealogy."
"We know from archaeological data that after domestication cattle moved either through the Balkans and colonized North Europe along the Danube river, or along the Mediterranean coasts."
"It is possible to calculate distances between animals comparing DNA letters and counting how many times the same letter is in the same position, and how many times is in a different one."
This so-called genetic distance can also be calculated between groups of animals.
Genetic distances between maternal DNAs confirm what previously suggested by diversity patterns.
"North and South Italy are close to Central Europe, while Central Italy is closer to South West Asia and Anatolia."
"Even for the European red genealogy, cattle from Central Italy are closer to S-W Asia and Anatolia, while reds from North and South Italy are close to Central Europe."
"So, something happened: these animals, surrounded by other ""normal "" animals, arrived to Central Italy from the sea, rather than via the land route."
"Let me introduce you these breeds: the first one is Maremmana, here you may see a female, with typical lyre shape horns."
Males have crescent-shaped horns.
"The Chianina, the largest cattle in the world: the famous sire Donetto reached a weight of over 1700 kilograms."
"American colleagues get mad, since we hold this primacy..."
"Calvana, a beef breed and Cabannina, a small size dairy breed."
What happened then?
"We have high diversity in South West Asia, low in Europe, and both in South and North Italy, high in Central Italy, whose animals look like those in the domestication centre."
"They arrived on our shores but they're unable to sail by themselves, so somebody must have shipped them."
"To guess who, we should understand when did these animals dock to Central Italy."
Historical records report on Central Italian bovines.
"Columella, a Roman expert in Agriculture, describes them in the I century BC."
Other fonts report that even before the Roman king Numa Pompilio used to offer huge white bovines to gods in religious ceremonies.
"If the scientists find anything that  the Buddhists are incorrect round around the 2600 years old tradition in Buddhism, Buddhism will change."
"So far, science has changed  and it changes so rapidly because of how Buddhism is leading us  through the science with the understanding of what  has just been the meditation tradition."
"So, is that an answer to your question?"
"(Man) What I am more interested in  is shifting the focus a little bit from happiness and suffering to the cause is that we don't see reality clearly, that is what creates the suffering."
(R. Brady) I see that is an important question and we have heard it.
Others may want to be thinking about it  and talking with you about it.
But let us hear some more questions.
(Woman in the audience) I just wondered if anyone could talk about on line learning and bringing mindfulness into that.
"I know that is on the rise,  I am an on line teacher, and I just wondered how to be mindful on line."
(T. Koffler) Thank you for that question.
"It seems like keeping up with technology is also a very important way to spread any body of work, including mindfulness."
"We just recently, because of the many people around the world that were asking for our programs, as well as to learn mindfulness, addressed that through an on line training program."
"And we had a lot of resistance  from our faculty and quite a bit of discussion around,  'is that possible?'."
"Because truthfully, we all know,  mindfulness should be something that we want to share and learn  as a body of work between human beings."
Either I develop community and so on  and so forth and develop the practice.
"From my short experience of teaching our first ever online training, which was 5 weeks for an hour and half each session, we discovered that it was something we could do as long as the participants were committed to developing their own practice at home."
"So, we are continuing on the way and  we are also know that many organizations,"
"Dan Siegel for one,  Mindful Schools for another, many organizations outside of Mindfulness Without Borders are teaching their learning  and offerings on line."
"So, I think it is something to expect and  certainly still in development, a work in progress."
(R. Brady) Thank you.
"(Man in the audience) Thank you very much to the panel, to each of you for insightful discussion."
"I think, in listening it refers to me that one of the biggest problems teachers face is, with increasing class sizes, will be the ability to give direct  one-on-one attention to the students."
"When you are standing in front of a class with 30, 40, sometimes even 50 students, it becomes a temporal impossibility  to give the attention that in my experience was always very formative, to have a teacher that really is there and even sees you and is working directly with you."
"Last year, I worked with a non-profit organization that makes it demanded to find spaces for teachers and educators to make that 1-on-1 relationship possible and teaching and learning institutes can have it in schools."
"So, when I heard Jack and Meena speak about teachers developing their presence for the classroom, as well as John Bell at the end speaking of how a lot of people who leave the school system feel like it was because they were not cared about in it,"
I wonder what can teachers do to really develop that presence for the students in the classroom.
Of course that is for everyone.
(J. Miller) I think one thing is that  we can use a variety of groupings.
We can use small groups and moving  from large group to small group.
It is going to be difficult  to do a individual when you have 35.
"Again, I am a believer in the circle."
"If you can set the class up as a circle,  and I have class up to 35, when it gets over 35, it becomes a problem."
"So, I'm not sure if you can see it in the screen but these mushrooms are starting to release their juice here."
"Getting nice and soft, that was all the oil you needed there."
"So you can see now that the mushrooms have reabsorbed all of the liquid that they put out, that's when you know they're done and it's time to add the next thing which"
"I'm gonna put the onions in and another reason you put the onions in second of the mushroom is because of that juice so if the onions been in first, the mushrooms would be kind of infused with all the onion flavour."
This way they stay separate but as you combine them in the dish their flavours merge together just not as much as if the mushrooms were totally in first.
So I let the onions soften up a little bit before adding the zucchini and letting them soften a little bit as well.
What I'm gonna do next is put a little sprinkle of salt on there.
I'll give it a good stir around and then put the lid on this dish so that the juices can come out from the vegetables while they cook.
"The salt helps that cooking process so as soon as you get that salt on there, give it a little stir around and then get that lid on pretty quickly."
Alright!
So giving it a few minutes to cook in here and as you take the lid off you can see a lot of steam coming up.
There's gonna be lot of moisture in here which is perfect because the next thing were gonna add is the seasoning.
And what I'm gonna use is some of my garlic and onion powder.
You can find these mixes on the hidden section of the website at HealthyVeganRecipes.net/Europe.
"So, I've got some garlic and onions, I've really want to make sure that this dish came out savoury because it is oats and it's usually a breakfast dish."
"So I've got a whole onion in there as well as the onion and garlic powder and then I'm just gonna use some of my Italian herb mix, also in that hidden section of the website."
"Give it a squeeze as you put it in there and I'm gonna put on what's goona looks like a lot, the reason is it's going for the vegetables as well as the oats."
"Like I said, we really want to make sure that this taste like dinner and not breakfast."
So give that a stir around.
And then make sure that those seasonings coat the vegetables first and then you're gonna put the grains in which I've got about two cups of oats here.
They are rolled oats?
"Yes, sorry."
Rolled oats!
And you want to season those oats as well so I'm gonna give them a two minutes in the heat with no moisture just the vegetables.
Make sure those flavours really coat around the rolled oats.
"So, the oats are looking a little bit toasted, they've got seasonings on them so I'm gonna do now is add the liquid and I'm using water but if you have vegetable broth that would be perfect."
I'm gonna be kind of careful with it because I'm not sure how much to add before the oats gets to be really mushy but I've got about two cups of water here ready to go.
And if you have an oven this would be lovely if you put the water in and then pop it in the oven to bake it since I don't what I'm gonna do and looks like I'm gonna do about cup and a half of water and so like I don't have an oven what I'm going to do instead just put this lid back on here and allow those oats to really cook in there.
So my avocado was a little bit different and what I'm gonna have to do is scoop it out with a spoon rather than my usual flip it inside out because the skin is very flimsy.
Doesn't like to flip!
And over here are oats that have a few minutes to cook.
"I can see they're looking very soft, they're trying to stick to the bottom of the pan a little bit so I turned the heat off for the last few minutes and now I think it's time to give it a try and see how this works out."
[laughter]
"And in later years, he said he so enjoyed himself reading Blackstone during that period that he decided to become a lawyer right there and then."
Okay.
It's this one lone little reading calm student in the midst of not a lot of other reading calm students from what
I could tell.
"Unlike that little Blackstone student, a volunteer company of about seventy Yale students-- which is roughly half of the student body at that point-- formed to fight."
They were led by Captain James Hillhouse.
He is indeed New Haven Hillhouse.
"He was a Yale graduate of a few years before, so he's not that much older than these men."
"And a Yale senior, who ends up being one of these fighting Yale students, offers an account of what happened at this point."
He says--He notes that troops landed in the south part of West
"Haven, ""about five miles from the center of the town."
"College was of course broken up and the students, with many of the inhabitants, prepared to flee on the morrow into the neighboring country."
"To give more time for preparation and especially for the removal of goods, a volunteer company of about a hundred young men was formed, not with the expectation of making any serious stand against such a force, but simply of retarding or diverting its march."""
"So these students formed; they don't think they're going to beat the British, but maybe they can delay them a"
little bit.
"""In common with others of the students,"
"I was one of the number, and I well remember the surprise we felt the next morning (July 5) as we were marching over West Bridge towards the enemy, to see Dr. Daggett,"" who is the former President of"
"Yale, Naphtali Daggett, who is now a professor of divinity, so he's a Yale professor, ""how surprised we were the next morning, to see Dr. Daggett riding furiously by us on his old black mare with his long fowling piece in his hand ready for action."
"We knew the old gentleman had studied the matter thoroughly and satisfied his own mind as to the right and propriety of fighting it out, but we were not quite prepared to see him come forth in so gallant a style to carry his principles into practice."""
"So, they see this professor go riding off with his gun, going to fight the British, like: 'wow, [laughs] that's pretty impressive.'"
"And I think in the first lecture I mentioned this, and said it was the President of Yale riding out."
"Daggett had retired as President, so for the sake of accuracy, he's now not President but a professor riding off to fight the British with his gun."
So now this student goes on:
"""Giving him a hearty cheer as he passed, we turned down towards West"
"Haven at the foot of the Milford Mills, while he, Daggett, ascended a little to the west and took his station in a copse of wood where he seemed to be reconnoitering the enemy like one who was determined 'to bide his time.'"
"As we passed on towards the south we met an advanced guard of the British, and taking our stand at a line of fence, we fired upon them several times, and then chased them the length of three or four fields as they retreated, until we suddenly found ourselves involved with the main body""--"
"Okay, [laughter] so it was--a couple of soldiers were like: 'get them, uh oh [laughter]--""and in danger of being surrounded."
"It was now our turn to run, and we did for our lives."
Passing by Dr. Daggett [laughs] in his station on the hill we retreated rapidly across West
"Bridge, which was instantly taken down by persons who stood ready for the purpose to prevent the enemy from entering the town by that road."""
Okay.
"And, you know, we think we have it tough in this country because Arizona keeps screaming that it needs more water from California, and California says no, we're going to divert the Columbia River down to Los"
"Angeles or something like that, and the people that live in"
Oregon get all up in arms.
"But that is nothing compared to the problems of the Middle East and North Africa, where water is actually one of the ground- the basic reasons for conflict among nations in those areas."
"And if you doubt that, look at where the dams are that"
"Turkey has built on the Euphrates and the Tigress, and what that means for Iraq and Syria."
Okay?
Or look at all of the issues surrounding the
"Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which are many and cultural and religious and many other things, but they also have a lot to do with water."
So the water cycle is really quite critical.
And I want to just mention a couple of things about it.
"The standard issue with water is that most of it's in the ocean, and it evaporates from the ocean; of course, it evaporates more when the oceans are warmer."
"Remember the El Niño effect-- right?--when that warm water from the Western Pacific flows back over towards the Eastern Pacific, then the evaporation of the oceans increases, you get a lot more water in the atmosphere, and rainfall goes up, from the Galapagos to Arizona, and right through to Connecticut."
So the oceans are a very important source of evaporation.
"However evaporation off of freshwater lakes is also significant, and anyone who lives in"
"Rochester or Buffalo will tell you just exactly how significant it is, after they've had a three-foot snowfall from lake effect snow-- right?--which is basically been driven by this process."
"So the water goes up and it cycles through the rivers, back into the ocean, and long-term basically the amount going in equals the amount going out, and as long as the West Antarctic ice sheet doesn't collapse, or Greenland melts, the level of the ocean stays about the same."
"By the way, the estimate on the Antarctic ice sheets is that if the ones that are currently grounded melt, that means there's an ice sheet that's offshore, but it's resting on the ocean bottom."
"And there are two big ones: one is the Ross Sea ice shelf,"
"I think, and the other one is an ice shelf on the other side of the continent."
"If those two melt, then the ocean goes up about ten meters, about thirty feet."
So the level of the ocean will go up and down a bit.
"So there's a very interesting thing that's going on with evapotranspiration out of forests, and I'm going to illustrate it first with a picture and then with a story about the Amazon."
Okay?
"So if we go to the Mediterranean, and we look at the impact of what the dairying culture did, on the Mediterranean--so people started keeping sheep and goats, and goats are incredibly efficient at removing brush and grass from the landscape-- basically what the goats did is that they desertified the periphery of the Mediterranean, all the way around."
They did it between about 5000 and 2000 years ago.
"So if you back, you can read in Greek and Roman commentary about all of the wonderful grain that was grown in North Africa, in places like Libya and in"
"Tunisia and Algeria, and you can read descriptions of the wild forested habitat of Greece."
"And you go to those places today, many of them don't look quite this desolate, but they're certainly much more"
like this than they are like a nice deciduous forest or a chaparral.
So goats had a big impact.
"And you ask yourself, ""Well why does that happen?"""
And so we have shown that Wn is a
Matingale.
"Now let me mention this example is quite complicated, but it was worthwhile introducing because it is easy to generalize this example to the case where you allow random bets on each play of the game, as long as those bets only depend on what you've seen up to that point, you will actually still get a Martingale."
"For a final example, we look at something called Polya's Urn, we won't go through all the details, in fact, you can complete the details yourself."
"Considering urn, which contains red balls and green balls, so we've got some urns like this, there are red balls in there and there are green balls inside this urn."
"And at each time step a ball is chosen randomly from the urn, if the ball is red, then it's returned to the urn with an additional red ball."
"If the ball is green, then it is returned to the urn with an additional green ball."
"So what we're going to do is we're going to see that there are n plus 2 balls in the urn, at time n."
"And this follows, because we begin with two balls, and after every play of the game we add an additional ball, either an additional red ball, or an additional green ball."
"So we have n plus 2 balls in the urn, after time n."
Let Xn denote the number of red balls in the urn after n draws.
"Then, if Xn is equal to k, Xn plus 1 can only take on two possible values, it will take on the value k plus 1, or the value k."
"It will take on the value k plus 1, if the ball withdraw on the nth plus 1 play is a red ball and that will occur with probability k over n plus 2, k because there are k balls-, k red balls in the urn and n plus 2 because n plus 2 is the total number of balls in the urn."
"Likewise Xn plus 1 would be equal to k given Xn equals k, if we draw a green ball, because if we draw a green ball we will not be adding an additional red ball."
"So Xn plus 1 equals k, given Xn equals k that occurs with probability n plus 2 minus k divided by n plus 2."
"And now, what we claim and what you can easily check, is that Mn, which is equal to Xn divided by n plus 2, is a"
Martingale.
Prof:
"Now I want to turn to the lecture, and I'm going to start the lecture with my true confession of the day."
Okay.
I did something a little insane and I'm not entirely sure how this is going to work out.
I did it for you.
"I--Basically, on the syilabus it says that the title of this lecture is ""Citizenship and"
"Leadership"" or ""Leadership and"
"Citizenship."""
I don't even remember which one I put first.
"And initially, my idea had been when I wrote the syilabus for this course before the semester even started-- well, this is going to be a"
"lecture that has something to do with new ways of-- how the Revolution changed people's sense of themselves as citizens, how people were behaving differently because of the approach of Revolution and then because of the fighting of Revolution."
And I was going to talk a little bit about crowd actions and about how the Revolution itself wouldn't really have been possible without crowd actions.
"I talked, I know, a little bit about mob actions and we've seen some in action."
"So I was basically going to talk about how the Revolution politicized people, how it--on a mass scale for many different kinds of Americans-- brought them in to the public sphere, made them think and act politically in a way that perhaps they hadn't before."
And then I was going to accompany that with a brief discussion about the elite in this environment being on the one hand appreciative of the sort of mass popular involvement because there would be no Revolution without it-- that is the Revolution--but on the other hand they're elite folk so they're all-- some of them at least are a

"My name is Tim Karges, I am one of the staff pilots at Life Lion at Penn State Hershey Medical Center, in Hershey Pennsylvania"
"We are a flying ambulance, I'm the driver"
"My name is Ella Kennedy, I am a flight nurse for Life Lion, we are a flying ambulance, a flying ICU"
We get them from point A to point B very quickly
"My name is Steve Weihbrecht, I a flight paramedic for Lion Line at Penn State Hershey Medical Center"
I work as a team with a registered flight nurse and a pilot
"We do interfacility transfers, calls, 911 emergency kind of thing as part of the team, I assist the nurse in any way with her care, perform duties up to my level as a paramedic"
"We provide what is called womb-to-tomb care,"
"I may go out on one flight caring for a tiny neonate, the next flight could be a 90 year old patient who is perhaps aseptic"
"So I'm a jack of all trades, master of many."
"It's pretty much a flying computer, I punch buttons, I can take the aircraft, and lift off and do a hover and fly from here up to State College, and not touch the controls, and let the computer do all the work until we're 80 feet over the runway at State College"
"It's pretty much almost all weather, we stay out of the ice, and we stay away from thunderstorms but otherwise I can go up in the clouds and fly on instruments (?)"
"Two patients, pretty regular, we can take two without a total reconfiguration"
"Normally we carry one, we carry a nurse, a paramedic, sometimes we carry extra crew"
We take a respiratory therapist if we're flying a baby out of a neonatal unit
"Working in the aircraft, with my partner and myself, it's only us"
"Whereas in the hospital, you may have a physician at your side, in the aircraft it's just my partner and me"
"The various medical devices we have on the aircraft are used to monitor the patient's defibrilation in case of cardiac arrest situations, maintain their vital signs, it's a very noisy environment."
They also provide blinking lights and alarms which alert me visually because in the aircraft I cannot hear the beeps quite as well as I would perhaps an ICU emergency department
"My name is Greg Rupert, I'm the program manager at Penn State Hershey Life Lion paramedical services."
"The critical care transport system consists of communications link they provide coordination for our medical crews and our operational transport crews the drivers and the pilots, to complete the missions."
"As soon as they say go, we launch."
Our communications center talk to the crew in the air
"The crews in the air actually will proactively prepare medication drips have them primied in tubing and in their pumps, and when they land at that facility, and go to that patient we've reduced that bedside time that you have with that patient"
"We get a lot of people that stop by and thank us, come by after they're better but the flights, they kind of hit home a little bit more, are with the babies"
"I had twin sons born prematurely, one didn't survive when I do that type of flight, when I can make a difference, when I feel like I can go out far, maybe to a smaller hospital, and pick up a baby, maybe give that baby a fighting chance that's the ones that last a little bit, make me feel a little bit better"
"When I was in Nursing School, I was actually working here at the Hershey Medical Center"
"I saw the helicopter land, and I had no idea that flight nursing even existed"
"I'm an adrenaline junkie, and I saw that aircraft, and I knew that that was what I had to do"
"So there you see a group of people, all different levels of society--lawyers, man of leisure, eccentric barbers, chair makers, grocers--all different levels of society who have all come together for this one purpose and have gone over a series of months here to increasingly become more and more serious about what it is that they're doing."
So it certainly tells you something about the mindset in
"New Haven in early 1775, and not only in New Haven, as we've already heard in the course."
"Things became more dramatic on April 21,1775, when news of the Battle of Lexington arrived in New Haven."
"And what was interesting to me this morning was when I was reading accounts of people in New Haven reporting when they heard this news, several of them literally stated the precise time of day, like: 'at noon on the 21^(st) someone told me.'"
"They actually had it down to the hour and the minute when they heard about the events at Lexington, which to me was really telling, because it's what you do-- afterwards--when something really momentous or tragic or notable or historic happens, you think: where was I when that happened?"
Where was I when the Challenger blew up?
"I was a receptionist at an advertising agency sitting at my desk, but I remember that, because I remember everyone around me getting upset and it was a big deal."
"And so here are these people kind of doing the same thing, remembering after the fact:"
'I remember where I was.
It was noon on the 21^(st) when we heard in New Haven that the
British had actually fired on colonists in Lexington.'
"In New Haven, a Yale student wrote in his diary:"
"""Today tidings of the Battle of Lexington, which is the first engagement with the British troops, arrived at New Haven."
"This filled the country with alarm and rendered it impossible for us to pursue our studies to any profit."""
"And this is the moment I mentioned in Tuesday's lecture when Benedict Arnold-- who is one of the men in that group of sixty guys who decide they'd better arm and drill; he's one of those men--when he decides that they need arms and they're going to march to Massachusetts, and he sort of fights the New Haven town committee to get the key so that he can grab arms and go march with his men up to"
Massachusetts.
"So I'm linking today's lecture with Tuesday's lecture, so I'm very proud."
"And actually, he and his men, as they were preparing to leave town and sort of go off to fight, they drew up an agreement which they all signed, a sort of pledge to each other, and a public statement as to what they were doing and why they were doing it, which is worth quoting because you'll hear in the middle of it something you might not expect to see in a statement being drawn up by a bunch of guys who just-- by force--armed themselves and they're going to go march to Massachusetts to fight the"
British.
So this is the beginning of their statement:
"""Be it known that we, the subscribers, having taken up arms for the relief of our brethren and defense of their, as well as our, just rights and privileges, declare to the world that we from our hearts disavow every thought of rebellion to His"
"Majesty, as supreme head of the British"
"Empire."""
Okay.
"They've taken up arms, they're marching to fight the"
"British, and the first thing they say in the first sentence of their proclamation is we're not rebelling against the King."
"That--When I read this I thought, wow, that's--And I've been saying over and over again in class it's--that all of these things are mixed in together."
"People are upset, they're angry at what's going on, they're angry at British policy, and they're loyal to the King, and they're thinking about independence, but they're unsure about independence, and they're still linked to England."
"And in a way, that statement is a great example of that; guys who are holding guns and about to march to fight, are being sure to state that they are not rebelling against His Majesty as supreme head of the British empire-- or, they don't want to be accused of ""opposition to his legal authority, and shall on every occasion manifest to the world by our conduct this to be our fixed principle."""
So they're not rebelling against the King.
"Instead they said that they were, quote,"
"You're on-going support is vital to our future and allows us to be a visionary art company and impact not only Liverpool and Merseyside but also helps us pioneer into new places across the UK and I'm pleased to say that we are we are programming some of DaDaFest's works into different places such as Belfast, Preston, St Helens, and Newham"
"I also wish to thank, the London 2012 cultural Olympiad people who have been incredibly supportive we wish them every success with this year's programme when it launches in a few weeks time"
"But also all the amazing partner venues that we work with,the Bluecoat, Unity Theatre, The Blackie"
"Liverpool Anglican Cathedral, FACT, The Walker Gallery and Liverpool University"
And our amazing volunteers - they are a joy to work with and we do get them to do some very weird and wacky things
"like today they've all been dressed up in white coats on the platform on Lime Street stopping people to ask ""are you normal or not normal"" this has been fascinating because in an hour they had ran out of their surveys and we had to print more so thats showing people want to discuss this"
To finish I just want to make sure that you are aware that we not only deliver DaDaFest and it will now be a biennial from this year so the next ones 2014 but we also as a company deliver lots of different projects throughout the years and we have been working in Liverpool since 1984 to empower disabled and deaf peoples participation and leadership in the arts and cultural sector
We have had an on-going programme with young disabled and deaf people and I'm really proud of that programme
This year we are working with them to put on Young DaDaFest at the Blackie next week an event were the young people themselves have created and make a performance event it empowers them and gives them a sense of a community that goes beyond their schools
We've seen some wonderful moments and seen some real achievements but tonight we're going to see more because we have one to share with you here we met a young lady called Shauna Hogan in 2003 when she performed an Irish dance at the very first Young DaDaFest she has gone onto really develop herself within dance and also likes to swim and so we put her into an opportunity where she could maybe meet get some funding to help her career she's now got a place to study dance at Liverpool Community College
"Her swimming is going to take her to Puerto Rico soon, so she needed some money so we helped her put an application in and she was chosen and awarded to win £3,000 to help her with her ambitions in that so really want you to give her a big welcome because I'm going to present her with her cheque tonight"
So please Shauna
I want to say thank you.
I want to say thank you to all my mentors.
"Thanks you very much, thank you"
"Can I, can I just say thank you on behalf of Shauna"
"What you won't know is that Shauna is actually going to represent Great Britain in Puerto Rico in September in the Special Olympics, the Olympics which are very much forgotten"
"They get no funding, so this is going to be an absolute boom so we can, actually pay her fare to go, which is £700"
So thank you very much
Well done Shauna.
"And back to the marvellous Nick, hasn't he done a good job tonight, thank you, thank you"
"Lullabies for Tiny Annabelle, no25850381"
"In November, a poem by Eamon Grennan"
"""Black—the cracked hilarity of crows."
Jagged black laughter over your head.
"Bodies in their fit of being: one couple jostling for a branch, another pair preening each other's feathers."
"Down here you're feeling the sheer quiet that settles on the body after body-work—digging a ditch, cutting back hedges, raking the last of the leaves onto a blue tarpaulin."
"Load after load you lay in a mulch-line along the fence, packing a trench, tamping it down,"
letting scents of autumn have a last fling with your nose and mouth.
"When you've put the rake away, the crackling sheet of plastic neatly folded, and you walk under bare trees where crows are cackling, coughing, rattling branches, it's good to feel your body as only an over-floating sense of satisfaction, mind buried in its warm earth, in a quiet that's flesh, that's spirit, that's what a crow might feel for a minute or so in sunshine—belly full, perching a chimneypot, out of danger—or what you'd find among the small stones and yew bushes of a well-tended cemetery, or in an old dog spread in dreamless sleep, or in any settled something that's hardly breathing, just feeling body-heat hold itself easy in the last hours before the first snow.

In academia it is called essentialism going back to this idea of essences or humors vs constructivism which means that it is socially constructed.
I talk here about sex vs. gender.
Biology vs culture these are all interrelated so saying here and I will probably say this a couple of times in this as we talk about sex in general we talk about sex being what is between your legs and gender being what is between your ears.
In these then change happens only because people have worked to make that happen often at great personal sacrifice up to and including dying for the cause.
Interspersed are brief biographies of activists so you get a sense of what it has taken to get us to where we are today the things that we so take for granted that people really had to work for us to have those.
Last I want to talk about this definition of feminism.
"Feminism is another F word not the F word that most of us think of and in this, it has two basic components to it."
"We will look at different sorts of theories in different ways of defining what equality is on this, but the underlying piece on this is an ideal of equality between men and women, across race, across sexual orientation, across ability all of these people are ideals of equality."
The second part of this it has actions to create this sort of equal world that the idea calls for.
Its not one idea or the other its both of them together its both end as Patricia Hill Colleens talks about our ways of dealing with hierarchies or identities.
So I will leave that from you and I will join you in discussions as well this week.
See you soon.
"Thank you for that welcome and thank you for coming, this is a great moment and its been two years in the planning and it's just, it always takes your mind away when you actually come to this point and you can look back and go wow we've been through a lot of blood sweat and tears to get here but now lets party and that's what we really want you to do unlike my normal speeches, i'm using that word a lot at the moment, I've written it down i normally i usually go off the cuff but I've written it down because there's so much I've to say and i don't want to forget anybody okay, her we go, on behalf of the staff and board I'm delighted to welcome you here for our 11th DaDaFest we are thrilled to be delivering such an exciting and diverse program in these austere times and thank all the partners and funders for their belief and support of our work"
This year's theme is all about the fact that we inhabit bodies that constantly change and how this affects how we are viewed by the world but also how we view ourselves because a lot of us think as we acquire impairments and maybe become this other person that we're no longer of value and we want to actually say totally the opposite from this festival
Disability is still stigmatised and misunderstood and we are proud that we can provoke conversation with the work on offer in DaDaFest 2012
"We have lots of events so they are all highlights as far as I am concerned we are so pleased that we have this Amazing collaboration with the Bluecoat and that they are putting so much effort to it their staff have been phenomenal so thank you but also Ine with Niet Normaal, we first met Ine four years ago with the DaDaFest 2008 and she knew then she wanted to base this work here in Liverpool and so we were able to link her with Gary, sorry is that me?"
I'm standing in the wrong place
"And he's been a co-curator with Ine's concept for Niet Normaal so thank you for all the work you've but into that, it's great"
"We've also got Film, music, theatre, workshops with the amazing live programme - which will be kicking off on 17th August and thrilled to bits that we're working with the Philharmonic Hall with an amazing collaboration with Evelyn Glennie on the 18th of August"
"There will be a one off performance with Pagoda Chinese Youth Orchestra and Merseyside Signing Choir who have linked up with a Deaf School in Shanghai, and are going to be performing the Jasmine Flower which will be signed in English and Chinese, It will be phenomenal so please get your tickets for that"
"This year we're welcoming overseas artists such as David Roche, Benny Prasad"
"Nudd and Galloway ""wee hee"" no, no fans yet you will be and all the amazing Niet Normaal artists who have been ??? to this collection which is fantastic"
There are so many other people I can't name them all so I'm going to stop there with the artists but read them in the book
"But what's really important is that this festival is rooted and comes from Liverpool so we're delivering a number of participation projects with different partners such as an inter-generational story-telling project with Steve Biko housing a poetry workshop funded by Jackson and Canter, looking at how legal language needs to be a bit more de-mystified so it's least - less interrogating for, for people to engage with the legal profession"
We are also hosting a number of seminars with different partners
"Hope University and Liverpool University, Shape and Catalyst Arts."
Liverpool Primary Care Trust have been incredibly supportive and we're really pleased to be acknowledging and promoting the five ways to health and wellbeing through the eight weeks of DaDaFest and we'll be producing questionnaires and surveys to glean information to help to see how DaDaFest can affect that

"let me go find this nature and ask somethings where is it? what kind of nature is this? never having any mercy and everyone is running after this nature even Imams today are saying the disasters are coming from nature say, it came from Allah to disobedient children of Adam the 21st century disobedient ones are revieving the anger of Allah SWT say they say, no!"
Allah is most merciful
"He is always forgiving to you are you not reading the Fatiha? read the Fatiha! you must be reading it if you are praying five times a day, then you must be reading the Fatiha forty times you are not understanding? they are not understanding because they became nature people they didn't become the messengers of Allah the ones who are trying to give the message to the people and themselves"

"he's going to forget about my rizq? he said, keep everything to yourself that kind of Imams we are looking for they say about him, Mahzub it's okay we need that kinds of Mahzubs in these days we need that kind of people to stand up to say to the kings to say to the presidents to remind this to them, not going and bowing down, going al the way kissing their feet the Imams and the Shaykhs, this is what they are doing today if you ask them, they have their reasoning of course endless reasoning they come with your position is not allowing you to do that you are not for dunya, you are for akhirat your duty is to remind people it doesn't matter if they are good ones or if they are bad ones it does;t matter is they are small figures or big figures it doesnt matter if they have titles in this world or they dont have it this is the duty but because of dunya again,they are bowing down saying harm may come or they may stop us they may push us around"

"The letters č, š, ž and dž are like the English sounds in ""ch""in, ""sh""in, vi""s""ion and ""j""uice."
"The letters ď, ľ, ň, and ť are called “soft consonants” and are pronounced with the blade of the tongue at the roof of the mouth."
"The letters c, dz and j are also soft, like ""ts"" in ba""ts"", ""ds"" in ro""ds"", and ""y"" in ""y""es."
"Signs over a vowel show that the vowel is pronounced long: á, é, í, ó, ý ú. A long vowel is never followed in the next syllable by a short vowel."
"The letter ô is like English ""wo""man, and ä is the same as the letter e."
"The letter ch is like ""ch"" in Scottish lo""ch"". V is more like English ""w""."
"The letters b, d, ď, dz, dž, g, h, z, ž are voiceless when they are at the end of a word (for example, 'd' will sound like 't')."
"The accent is always on the first syllable of the word. That is different from Russian, for example, in which the stress can be anywhere."
"Like other Slavic languages, Slovak is difficult for English-speakers to pronounce., especially because several consonants often come together. In the sentence: “Strč prst skrz krk!” there is not one single vowel (it means: “Stick a finger through your neck!”)!"
Grammar.
"The grammar is similar to Russian, but there are some differences. Slovak, unlike Russian, has a separate word for “to be”:"
"Unlike English, Slovak does not have articles (such as “the” and “a”)."
"There are three genders in Slovak, therefore it is important to know whether a noun is masculine, feminine or neuter. There is no article to make it obvious (unlike in German), but it changes the adjective's ending."
"Like many other European languages, Slovak verbs agree with the person, and there are different forms for 'I', 'you', 'he', etc. Verbs have different aspects to show whether or not the action is complete. There are also different cases that show how a word is used in a sentence. Different prepositions use different cases. All of that makes grammar quite complicated for English-speakers."

Devil's food cake
"Devil's food cake is an old fashioned chocolate cake made of chocolate or cocoa and baking powder. It is moist, soft, rich, and very good for keeping. It is a light-textured chocolate layer-type cake with a deep reddish brown color. The cake gets this bright red color from the large amount of red food dye used in the preparation. Devil's food cake is usually thought of in terms of dark chocolate, but originally it was red. Today cooks, using modern processed cocoa, sometimes add a touch of red food coloring to bring back the authentic color."
Devil's food cakes can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days.
Variations.
The Devil's Food Cake may also be called a Red velvet cake.
Partridge
The partridge is a medium sized bird. They are known as game birds because they are hunted and eaten by humans. They are in the Pheasant family (Phasianidae).
"Partridges are in the song ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"". The line ""...and a Partridge in a pear tree"" is sung."
Color and shape.
"Most partridges are brown, gray and white. They are camouflaged and difficult to see. They have short legs and short bills. Partridges are smaller than Pheasants but they are bigger than Quails."
Partridges can not fly very well and they do not migrate. This means they always stay in the same area all year round.
Habitat.
"Partridges live in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. They live in places such as moors, grassland and farmland. They feed mostly on seeds, and nest on the ground. This means their nests are not very safe from predators such as foxes. Partridges use their camouflage to make it difficult for predators to see them and their nests."
Bromsgrove
"Bromsgrove is a town in the north of Worcestershire. The town is about north-east of Worcester and south-west of Birmingham. 29,237 people lived there in 2001."

Can't Be Tamed
Can't Be Tamed is the third album made by American singer Miley Cyrus. The album has twelve songs including three singles.
Development and singles.
"""Can't Be Tamed"" is Cyrus's first single. It was released May 18th, 2010. ""Can't Be Tamed"" had good reviews from critics. The song peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached its highest peak at number five on both the Irish Singles Chart and New Zealand Singles Chart. The music video is Cyrus performing with backup dancers throughout a museum. Cyrus is first trapped in a giant cage, being watched by people in the audience as they were trying to see the rare creature 'Adias Cyrus' she then escapes and trashes the museum. She has promoted ""Can't Be Tamed"" by performing it at several places, including a performance on ""Britain's Got Talent"" and the critics had negative ratings and reviews. The song is also a part of Cyrus' second world tour, Gypsy Heart Tour."
"""Who Owns My Heart"" is Cyrus' second single. It was released on October 22, 2010. Cyrus described it as a ""total dance track"" with a cool idea. Cyrus' ""Who Owns My Heart"" is a club-oriented song that speaks of meeting a potential love on the dance floor. The song tries not to proceed to question, ""Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?"" Bill Lamb of About.com thought that, despite its beat, the overall sound of ""Who Owns My Heart"" is faceless and dull. The video starts with Cyrus asleep, blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom. She wakes up and shakes on the mattress. Following, Cyrus goes to a bathroom, her outfit is a white tank top, white boy shorts, a fishnet hair wrap, rollers, and heavy metal jewelry. While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings as she sits on the edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for a party. When the chorus comes on, Cyrus appears shaking in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hot pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and big hair. Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing on top of a big, wooden table. In continuing after, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video finishes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up."
"""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"" is Cyrus' third single. It was a single on June 11th, 2011. It was made by Poison in 1988. Miley's version is one minute and 29 seconds shorter than Poison's official song. Hollywood Records released Cyrus' cover in June 2011, and a music video was created and released in 2010."

Factorial.
"Factorial is a function which gives the number of ways to arrange formula_10 objects. The term is called the ""index"". The result of a factorial is also called a factorial."
The symbol for factorial is !
The first factorials are:
formula_87
formula_88
formula_89
formula_90
formula_91
formula_92
formula_93 is equal to one because there is exactly one way of arranging 0 objects. Factorials are undefined for negative numbers. Factorials of fractional numbers can be calculated using the Gamma function.
Absolute value.
Absolute value is a function which gives the distance from zero (or magnitude) of a number.
The symbol for absolute value is formula_94
Examples of absolute values:
formula_95
formula_96
formula_97
formula_98
formula_99
The absolute value of formula_100 is the same as the absolute value of formula_101 (formula_102). This is because subtraction is anticommutative.

Succession to the British throne
The line of succession to the British throne is the order in which members of the royal family would come to the throne if the reigning king or queen died.
"At present the first in line is William, Prince of Wales and then Prince William's son, Prince George of Wales."
"Traditionally, males came before females in the line of succession. However, the law changed on 26 March 2015, so at present, for people born after 28 October 2011 the succession is decided only by age: older children come before younger children. This system of inheritance is called absolute primogeniture, as opposed to male-preference primogeniture. When someone who is in line to the throne has a child, that child comes after them and their older children, but before anyone else in the line of succession."
Excluded from the line of succession are Catholics and illegitimate children.

"Humans or machines can use templates. Some computer programs that work with the Internet use a template to separate the way the program works from the way it shows the words and pictures. It can be a way to copy words and pictures. In computer programming, templates save time because the programmer does not need to write the same words over and over."
"When doctors plan to give a person a new bone joint made of metal or plastic, they can use a template in the shape of the new joint. This type of template is put on an x-ray picture of the person to help to decide the size of joint needed."

Isthmohyla pseudopuma
"The meadow tree frog or Gunther's Costa Rican tree frog (""Isthmohyla pseudopuma"") is a frog that lives in Costa Rica and Panama. In Panama and parts of Costa Rica, it lives between 1000 and 2400 meters above sea level. On the Pacific side (west) of the mountains in Costa Rica, it lives no more than 864 meters above sea level."
Appearance.
The adult male frog is 37.6 to 42.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 41.1 and 45.6 mm long.
This frog is brown and light brown on the back and yellow on its belly. It has a white stripe on both back legs. Some of them have blue color on their middles.
Actions.
"This frog hides during the day in bromeliad plants and other plants with large leaves. At night, it goes to trees and bushes to look for food."
"These frogs lay eggs after heavy rains. The males go to water, deep water if they can, and sing for the females. The females choose the largest male frogs. The female lays 500 eggs at a time, 1800 to 2500 eggs per female per year."
"The tadpoles eat plants and dead things. They will also eat frog eggs and smaller tadpoles. They will eat eggs and tadpoles from other species or other Gunther's Costa Rican tree frogs. If the pond starts to dry up, the tadpoles become frogs quicker than if it did not dry up."
Threats.
"This frog is not in danger of dying out but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives, because of climate change, and because there is more ultraviolet B light than there was. This light can hurt this frog."

Discography.
An inquest into Duggan's death began on 16 September 2013. On 8 January 2014 a jury decided that his death was a lawful killing. It was decided that it was lawful because the police officer who shot Duggan told the jury he believed that Duggan was holding a gun and was going to shoot it. Witness B said that Duggan was not holding a gun. He said that Duggan was holding a mobile phone. There was a gun in a sock 10–14 feet away from where Duggan was shot. The sock and the gun did not have Duggan's DNA on them. Duggan's family were angry about the jury's verdict.
On 11 January there was a vigil for Duggan outside Tottenham police station. Hundreds of prostesters were there.

Duggan's family said that ""He was not a gang member and he had no criminal record."" Duggan had been convicted of having cannabis in 2000 and having things that he knew had been stolen in 2007. ""The Daily Mail"" said that he had also been arrested many times. The things he was arrested for included the murder of Gavin Smith and attempted murder. He was not charged with the murder of Smith because there was not enough evidence."

History.
Christian creeds.
"It is likely that the earliest creed of Christianity that deserves the title in full is the Apostles' Creed. The Apostles' Creed seems to have been formulated to resist Gnosticism; it emphasizes the birth, physical death, and bodily Resurrection of Jesus Christ. It reads:"
"The Nicene Creed is clearly derived from the Apostles' Creed, and represents an elaboration of its basic themes. The most important additions to this creed are much more elaborate statements concerning Christology and the Trinity."
"Christians today probably use the Nicene Creed most widely, followed by the Apostles' Creed."
"Jewish Creed: the ""Shmah""."
"The Jewish faith recognizes a single creed called the Shmah or Shema Yisrael, a statement of faith in strict unitarian monotheism, the belief in one God. This creed is embodied in a single prayer recited twice a day: ""Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One"", also translated as ""Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is unique [""or"" alone]."""
In Hebrew: שמע ישראל אדני אלהינו אדני אחד
"This is pronounced phonetically in Hebrew: ""Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad""."
Islamic creeds.
"The most basic attempt to put the religion of Islam in a brief statement of doctrine is the shahada, the proclamation that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His prophet."
More detailed credal declarations of Islamic dogma constitute aqidah.
The six Sunni articles of belief are:
"Also from the Aqidah of the Salaf is the belief that the faith (i.e. Eemaan) consists of (both) speech and action and that it increases and decreases. This differs from the Murji’ah a sect who uphold the belief of “Irjaa’”-to hold that sins major and minor, do not affect the faith and that faith neither increases nor decreases."
"And they uphold the belief that the Quran is the Speech of Allah, His Revelation and Light. It is not created, since the Quran is from Allah and that which is from Allah is not created. One of the attributes of Allah is his Speech. Since His attributes have been with Him eternally, His Speech cannot be created and therefore, the Quran is not created. According to the Salaf, debating about it is disbelief. It is not denied except by a Jahmee. A Jahmee is one who denies Allah’s attributes."

Earliest history.
"Ripley existed in 1086 when it was held by a man called Levenot. In 1251 Henry III said there could be a weekly market here and two annual fairs. In 1291 there were ""two water-mills with fish ponds"" in Ripley."
Industry.
The Ripley area has been industrialized since the late 18th century.
"One of the earliest companies to take advantage of mineral resources around Ripley was the Butterley Company in 1790. One of the early, and most well known, examples of the work of the company includes the graceful arched roof of St. Pancras Station in London, recently restored as an international rail terminal. A recent Butterley achievement was the design and construction of the Falkirk Wheel which lifts large canal boats."
Shadwell DLR station
"Shadwell DLR station on the Docklands Light Railway is between the termini of Bank and Tower Gateway to the west and Limehouse to the east. It stands on a viaduct shared with National Rail trains (on the c2c line to Essex), with a single island platform accessed by stairs and a passenger lift (via the entrance on Watney Street). It opened on 31 August 1987 as part of the first tranche of DLR stations. The 1991 Bank extension joins the main DLR line just west of Shadwell."
Wide receiver
"A wide receiver (or WR, wideout) is an American football player whose main duty is to catch the football when it is thrown by the quarterback."
"Wide receivers may also block, run with the football and sometimes throw the football besides just catching it. They can wear jersey numbers 10-19 and 80-89 in the National Football League, but there are no limits in college football."
Universal Studios Japan
"Universal Studios Japan is one of four Universal Studios theme parks. It is in Osaka, Japan. The park opened on March 31, 2001."

"A gap year is time taken between completing secondary school and going to a university or college or also between college and graduate school or a profession. It is generally a practice of young people from Australia, Poland, Scandinavia, United Kingdom and United States. The time between the two events is often, but not always, a year. It is often used to travel or to gain experience with an internship at the lowest cost possible."
Beam bridge
"A beam bridge is a strong, horizontal structure that rests on two end supports, and carries traffic by acting as a beam."
"Beam bridges are often used for heavy cars and trains to pass, and some are also built for people to walk on. Beam bridges used to be made from wood and were called ""log bridges"". Modern ones are mostly made of steel. Beam bridges are usually placed over highways, rivers or gaps in the earth so people or cars can cross over them. Beam bridges are simple but they cannot be as long as more complex and expensive kinds. Beam bridges can be connected to make one longer bridge."

Hypoglycemia
"Hypoglycemia is when the level of blood sugar is lower than normal. A normal blood sugar level is about 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter. All of the cells in the body need sugar to do their jobs and to survive. When a person does not have enough blood sugar, their body cannot work normally."
"Hypoglycemia can cause many symptoms. Some common symptoms are nausea, feeling hungry, sweating, feeling sad, and heart palpitations (feeling the heart pounding). Bad hypoglycemia can make a person act like they are drunk or have taken drugs. Very bad hypoglycemia can look like a stroke."
"Hypoglycemia can happen to anyone, at any age, but it usually happens in people who are diabetic. It is often a complication of treatment for diabetes with insulin or oral medications."
"Hypoglycemia is treated by returning the blood sugar levels back to normal. Often, a hypoglycemic person can bring their blood sugar levels back up by eating. In the worst cases, when the blood sugar is very low, hypoglycemia is treated by giving sugar water intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). In some cases, the liver is able to handle the issue by making glucose."
"The brain and other parts of the body cannot work without sugar. Because of this, severe (very bad) hypoglycemia can cause serious medical problems (like seizures) or even death if it is not treated quickly enough."

Cypripedioideae
"Lady's slipper orchids are the orchids in the subfamily Cypripedioideae. They are special because of their slipper-shaped pouches on their flowers. The pouch traps insects so that they must climb up past the modified stamens, where they get or give pollen, fertilizing the flower."
Some people think this subfamily should be different from the Orchidaceae as a family Cypripediaceae.
Pollination.
"A lady slipper orchid has a deep pocket that is actually a bee trap. When a bee crawls down into the flower to get the nectar, the pocket on the flower closes shut. Because of this, the bee is stuck for a while, wiggling and squirming, getting pollen all over itself."
"The bee finally finds a small opening near the top of the orchid, and it gets out so that it can get trapped inside another lady slipper, where it will give that pollen to the other lady slipper's stigma."
"The lady's slipper is also known in the United States of America as the ""moccasin flower"", because it looks like a shoe or moccasin."

She travelled to Kolkata with her brother. There, she received (got) a Pandita and a Sarasvathi Award for her expertise in Sanskrit Poetry. Born in the home of an important scholar named Brahmin, Pandita Ramabai had more freedom than many Indian women. Her father taught her and her mother to read Sanskrit writing. She then began to study Christianity in India, and later in England. She decided that it was the best religion; that she should be a Christian. However, she had not yet received Jesus into her ""heart"". Ramabai later said,"
Life.
"Shortly after her ""true conversion"", Pandita Ramabai began a faith mission for the girls and widows of India. Pandita and her helpers began a school and prayed for what they needed every day. Wheta went to refugee camps and saved widows and girls from death or abuse."
"Soon she had over a thousand women and girls at the mission. Helping this many people during a time of great famine was very hard, but Pandita wrote in her autobiography,"
"Every day, Pandita Ramabai and her helpers taught the women to read and write, showed them cleanliness, and helped them prepare for a job. She also taught them about Jesus. She opened Ashrams at Pune, Mumbai. She established a Christian High school at Gulbarga, (now at Karnataka) and her daughter Manorama was the principal. Manorama studied in the United States and traveled to Australia."

"The Ruy Lopez is one of the most common and well-liked openings. There are many ways to play it. It has always been popular in master chess. White's idea is to try and undermine the center by attacking the knight with his bishop. However, White will not be always able to win a pawn immediately:"
"For this reason White usually plays a longer-term strategy, starting with:"
"Here, Black has two main options. Black can either play with an open center, with 5... Nxe4 or play a closed, positional game with 5... Be7. These openings are called the Open Ruy Lopez and the Closed Ruy Lopez."
Closed Variation.
The closed variation of the Ruy Lopez comes after these moves:
This line leads to a closed . White's idea will be to break open the center with d4. Play typically continues:
"These are the main moves for White. However, White can also play 7. h3 or 7. a4. These moves are played in order to avoid the Marshall Variation."

Foreign portfolio investment
"Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) is the capital inflow from one country to another that takes the form of portfolio investment, which is more liquid and involves less control than direct investment. Foreign portfolio investment is a type of passive investing where investors purchase securities of foreign companies, but do not actively participate in the management of those companies. The term ""passive"" means that the investors are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the companies they invest in; they simply buy securities and hope that their value increases over time."

"where ""p""i is the ""i""-th prime number, and"
"Basically, they proved that if a number is superabundant, the exponent of a larger prime number is never bigger than a smaller prime number during prime decomposition(the process of a composite number become smaller prime numbers). All primes from 0 to formula_4 are also factors of ""n"". The equation says that a superabundant number has to be an even integer. It also is a multiple of the ""k""-th primorial formula_5"
"Superabundant numbers are like highly composite numbers. Not all superabundant numbers are highly composite numbers, though."
Alaoglu and Erdős observed that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant.

"Eye liner was first used in Ancient India, Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia as a dark black line around the eyes. As early as 10,000 BC, Egyptians and Mesopotamians wore various cosmetics including eye liner not only for aesthetics but to protect the skin from the desert sun. Eye liner may also have been worn to protect the wearer from the evil eye. The characteristic of having heavily lined eyes has been frequently shown in ancient Egyptian art. They produced eye liner with a variety of materials, including copper ore and antimony. Ancient Egyptian kohl contained galena, which was imported from nearby regions in the Land of Punt, Coptos and Western Asia."
"In the 1960s, liquid eye liner was used to create thick black and white lines around the eyes in the make-up fashion associated with designers like Mary Quant. The '60s and '70s also saw new fashion trends which made use of eyeliner, eyeshadow and mascara in new ways. As goth and punk fashion developed, they employed eyeliner for a dark and dramatic effect."

Hemingway's early life.
"Ernest Hemingway was born in 1899. He grew up in Oak Park, Illinois, near the midwestern city of Chicago. He was the second child in a family of six. His father was a doctor. His mother was a painter and a pianist."
"Each summer, the family traveled to their holiday home in northern Michigan. Ernest's father taught him how to catch fish, hunt, set up a camp, and cook over a fire."
"At home in Oak Park, Ernest wrote for his school newspaper. He tried to write like a famous sports writer, Ring Lardner, and he made his writing skills better."
Start as a news reporter.
"In 1917, Hemingway decided not to go to a university. The United States had just entered World War I and he wanted to join the Army, but they rejected him because his eyesight was not good enough."
"Ernest found a job with the ""Kansas City Star"" newspaper in Kansas City, Missouri. He reported news that happened at the hospital, police headquarters, and the railroad station. One reporter said: ""Hemingway liked to be where the action was."""
"The Kansas City Star told its reporters to write short sentences, and to report unusual details of an incident. Hemingway quickly learned to do both."
His life outside of America.
Hemingway worked for the newspaper for nine months. He then joined the Red Cross to help on the battle fields of Europe. His job was to drive an ambulance and to take wounded soldiers off the battlefield.
"The Red Cross sent him to Italy. There, he soon saw the first wounded. This was when a weapons factory in Milan exploded. Later, he was sent to the battle front. He went close to the fighting to see how he could act in the face of danger. Soon, he was seriously wounded."
"Soon after healing, the war ended. Hemingway returned to the United States. After less than a year he had changed forever: he needed to write about what he had seen. Hemingway wrote many short stories about people who experienced World War I."
Gone to Chicago.
"Some time later, Hemingway left home for Chicago to prove to himself, and to his family, that he could earn a living from his writing."
"But he ran out of money and began to write for a newspaper again. The Canadian newspaper, the Toronto Star, loved his reports in Chicago. They hired him and paid him well."
"In Chicago, Hemingway also met Sherwood Anderson. Anderson was one of the first American writers to write about common people. Hemingway saw that Anderson's stories showed life as it really was. This was similar to what he wanted to do."
Anderson gave Hemingway advice about his writing. He told Hemingway to move to Paris. Life was less costly there. Anderson said that Paris had many young artists and writers from many nations.
In Paris.
"Hemingway decided to move to Paris. Before he did, in America, he married a woman he had recently met. Her name was Hadley Richardson."
"Paris was cold and grey when Hemingway and his new wife arrived in 1921. They lived in one of the poorer parts of the city. Their rooms were small and they did not have water from pipes. But the ""Toronto Star"" employed him as its European reporter, so they had enough money for the two of them to live. That job gave Hemingway time to write his stories."
"Hemingway enjoyed exploring Paris, learning French customs, and meeting friends. Some of these new friends were artists and writers who had come to the city in the 1920s. Among them were poet, Ezra Pound, and writers Gertrude Stein, John Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Seeing that Hemingway was a good writer, they helped him publish his stories in the United States. He was thankful for their support at the time, but later denied that he had received their help."
"Hemingway travelled all over Europe. He wrote about politics, peace conferences, and border disputes, as well as sports, skiing, and fishing. Later he would write about bullfighting in Spain. The ""Toronto Star"" was pleased with his work, and wanted more of his reports, but Hemingway was busy with his own writing."
"He said this: ""Sometimes, I would start a new story and could not get it going. Then I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think. I would say to myself: 'All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know.' So finally, I would write a true sentence and go on from there. It was a wonderful feeling when I had worked well."""
His first success in 1925.
"Hemingway's first book of short stories was called ""In Our Time"". One of its stories, ""Big Two Hearted River,"" told of the effects of war on a young man who was taking a long fishing trip in Michigan. Hemingway had learned from his father, when he was a boy, about living in the wild."
"The story is about two kinds of rivers. One is calm and clear, and is where the young man fishes. The other is a dark, threatening swamp. The story shows its main character trying to forget his past, as well as the war. He does not talk much about the war. The reader learns about the young man, not because Hemingway tells his readers what the man thinks, but because he shows that man learning about himself. Many people believe it is one of the best modern American stories of all time. Because of this, ""Big Two Hearted River"" is often published in collections of best writing."
"After the book was published in 1925, Hadley and Hemingway returned to the United States for the birth of their son, after which they quickly returned to Paris."
"Writing ""The Sun Also Rises""."
Hemingway was working on a long story. He wanted to publish a novel so he would be recognized as a serious writer. And he wanted the money a novel would earn.
"The novel was called ""The Sun Also Rises"". It is about young Americans in Europe after World War One. The war had destroyed their dreams and had given them nothing to replace those dreams. The writer Gertrude Stein later called these people members of ""The Lost Generation."""
"The book was an immediate success. At the age of 25 Ernest Hemingway was famous. Many people, however, did not like Hemingway's art because they did not like what he wrote about."

Irai Leima
Irai Leima () or Ireima () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism) of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess and the divine female personification of water and aquatic life. She is also considered to be the incharge of the diseases.
"She is the consort of Irai Ningthou (literally, ""king of water""). Both are regarded as the divine spirits of water bodies."
Mythology.
"Irai Leima is the daughter of King Heibok Ningthou and the princess of Heibok Ching. Her father was an expert in witchcraft and black magic. Irai Leima is known for her exceptional beauty. One day, she was fishing in the Liwa river. King Kwakpa (Kokpa) of Khuman dynasty saw her and fell in love with her. He proposed her. She replied that her parents' wish will be her wish. So, King Kwakpa consulted his subjects. They presented Heibok Ningthou many presents. King Kwakpa planned to marry Irai Leima if her father agreed or to bring her by force if her father rejected. Seeing the arrogance of Kwakpa, Heibok Ningthou turned all the gifts into stone. At this, followers of Kwakpa fled the place. Kwakpa returned home disappointed."
"One day, King Kwakpa got intoxicated after drinking a juice of the roots of Tera plant (""Bambax malabaricum""). He wanted to meet Irai Leima. So, he went to her place riding on a Hiyang boat. Seeing his approach, she fled to Pakhra Ching mountain. Kwakpa chased her. Seeing all these, Heibok Ningthou turned the Hiyang boat into stone and the oar into a tree. Getting angry, Kwakpa ran towards Heibok Ningthou to kill him. Then, Heibok Ningthou turned Khuman Kwakpa into a stone. Irai Leima saw all this and was afraid of her father. She left her father and ran away. She passed the Pakhra Ching, crossed the Liwa river and entered the house of Sarangthem Luwangba. She hid herself inside the granary of the house. When Sarangthem Luwangba and his good lady Thoidingjam Chanu Amurei left the house for field, Irai Leima came out from her hiding place. In the meantime, she completed all the household chores. When the couple returned home, she hid herself again. The couple got surprised at this but it happened everyday. So, one day, the man returned home earlier than usual. He found out the truth. But when he came near Irai Leima, she had disappeared below the granary. He looked under the granary but he saw nothing. He was amazed at this. So, he discussed the issue with all his clan members. They searched everywhere but didn't find her anymore."
"Irai Leima appeared in the dream of Sarangthem Luwangba and told him that she was merged into his clan and became his daughter. The matter was reported to King Senbi Kiyaamba of Ningthouja dynasty. The king sent maibas and maibis to examine the case. The examiners said that the mysterious lady was a goddess and she should be worshipped. King Kiyaamba also told Luwangba to do so. From that year onwards, Irai Leima was worshipped as a goddess."
"The day on which Luwangba first saw Irai Leima was the first Monday of the Meitei lunar month of ""Lamta (Lamda)"". And the day on which the maibas and maibis came was the first Tuesday of ""Lamta (Lamda)"". Still today, from the time of King Senbi Kiyaamba (1467-1508 AD), the Sarangthem family members annually hold a grand feast (""Chaklen Katpa"") in honor of the goddess. Later, Irai Leima came to be known as Hiyangthang Lairembi."
Worship.
"When a person gets ill after bathing in a spring, pool, stream, people believed that the water spirits (Irai Leima and Irai Ningthou) had caught the person. To get well again, people worship the two deities. For this, the maibas perform the rites and rituals. The offerings include 2 eggs and 7 bamboo vessels filled up with rice paste."
"The also highly respect the deities. They offer many wild sacrifices. The sacrifices maybe a white fowl, a pig, a dog or a he-goat."
Identification with other deities.
"Irai Leima (""Ireima"") is considered as one of the divine manifestations of Leimarel (Leimaren), the supreme mother earth goddess. She is also described as a form of goddess Imoinu."
"Irai Leima is also known as Hiyangthang Lairembi. During the reign of King Garib Niwaj (alias ""Pamheiba""), goddess Hiyangthang Lairembi was converted to Hindu goddess Kamakhya (a form of Durga). The 3rd day of Durga Puja is observed as the ""Bor Numit"" (literally, Boon Day)."
Panthoibi

History.
"Brooklyn is named after a Dutch town called ""Breukelen"". Dutch people were the first people from Europe to live in the area. When they got there, there were already some Native American people living there called the Lenape. The Dutch started the town in 1634 as part of the colony of New Netherland."
"During the 19th century Brooklyn expanded and filled Kings County. It remained a separate city before the people there voted to join New York City in 1898. Today, many parts of Brooklyn are home to people who are mostly from one culture or ethnicity. Other parts are mixed."
"The Brooklyn Bridge is old and famous. It goes over the East River and connects Downtown Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan. The longest bridge in New York, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Bay Ridge connects Brooklyn to Staten Island."
Cornish language
Cornish (Cornish: Kernewek) is a very old language from Cornwall in the southwest of England. Cornish is a Celtic language and is very similar to Welsh and is related to Gaelic.
History.
"A long time ago, Cornish was the only language spoken in Cornwall, but more and more people began to speak English, instead of Cornish. In 1550, when the prayer book was written in English instead of Latin, the Cornish people got angry and there was a rebellion. Because many Cornish-speakers died and they would now hear the Bible in English, Cornish was used less and less."
"By 1800, only a few people could speak Cornish, and since no one spoke it to one another any more, Cornish became endangered."
"People say that a woman called Dolly Pentreath was the last person who could speak Cornish. That is not quite true, but she was one of the last people to use it instead of English."
Methods of spreading.
"Some people learned about Cornish by traveling around talking to people who could still speak it and by reading old plays and books. Some people wanted to learn the language and speak it and so in 1904 a learned man, Henry Jenner, wrote a book to help people. Some people then began to learn the language and speak it again."
Today.
"No one knows how many Cornish-speakers there are now. People think that about 8,000 to 13,000 people probably speak Cornish. Some young people have grown up speaking it. Most people in Cornwall know a few sentences or words in Cornish. In 100 years, Cornish has grown from almost no speakers to many thousands, which is very exciting for many people."
"There are now many new books, films and songs in Cornish. The Bible has now been translated into Cornish. There is an event, the open Gorseth, with a story and poetry competition. Sometimes, Cornish is used in churches."
"There used to be a problem with Cornish: three different dictionaries had different spellings, and people did not agree about how to write words or say them. That was confusing for people when they have not been speaking for long. In 2008, people who used different types of Cornish came together and agreed on a new standard form of Cornish to be used everywhere."

Watergate scandal
The Watergate scandal was a serious scandal during and after the 1972 presidential election.
"A United States President and Republican, Richard Nixon was running for election against Democrat George McGovern. Afterwards, Frank Wills, a security guard, discovered clues that former FBI and CIA agents broke into the offices of the Democratic Party and George McGovern months before the election. They secretly listened to phone lines and stole several important documents."
"When these men were found, they were discovered to have been associated with Nixon. He had helped them cover all the evidence of the scandal, and may have even hired the men to begin with. ""The Washington Post"" was a newspaper which played a big role in exposing the misdoings, specifically aided by reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. This showed the public that Nixon was not as trustworthy as he seemed."
"Nixon chose to resign from office on August 9, 1974 because he wished not to be impeached. This means that he might have been charged with crimes. The U.S. Congress could not impeach him if he resigned. After this, Gerald Ford, his vice-president, became the President by default. Ford pardoned Nixon for all of his crimes later on. The name ""Watergate"" comes from the hotel in Washington, D.C. where the first crime and break in took place, and is often associated with political scandals."

Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Adopted on March 30, 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment (Amendment XV) to the United States Constitution granted African-American men the right to vote. It was one of the Reconstruction Amendments."
Background.
Nowhere in the original Constitution or the Bill of Rights were Americans given the right to vote. The Fifteenth Amendment gave African-American men the right to vote. But not until the 1960s did judicial interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment conclude the right to vote was a fundamental right of all citizens.
The reasons behind the omissions of voting rights in the Bill of Rights and Constitution is that including them would have been too controversial at the time. Each state had different rules for who could vote. Some allowed free blacks the right to vote. Others allowed women the right to vote. A few states required ownership of property in order to vote.
"In the Election of 1868, Republican Party candidate, Ulysses S. Grant, won the presidency by only a narrow majority of the popular vote. He received support from free black voters in the South. Without that support, he probably would have lost the election. At the time blacks could not vote in the Northern states. The Republican party needed help to stay in power and thought that black votes would help. At the time Republicans controlled both the Senate and House. The proposed amendment was passed by Congress in 1869 and sent to the states for ratification. It was quickly ratified by three-quarters of the states in early 1870. Part of the reason why is that Republicans also controlled the state governments in the South. Southern Democrats were not able to block the measure."
Results.
"After passage, the Fifteenth Amendment did not have much of any impact on black voting in the South for nearly a century. Southerners used various methods including terrorism, poll taxes and grandfather clauses to prevent blacks from voting. Congress and the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down voting restrictions. For example, in a landmark decision in ""Smith v. Allwright"" (1944), The Court decision made it unconstitutional to keep African-Americans from voting in a Democratic Party primary in Texas. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which stated that all Americans had the right to vote, including African-Americans. But overcoming these problems on a case-by-case basis was proving to be unsuccessful. As soon as one form of discrimination was stopped, a new one appeared in its place. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, removed further barriers to minorities voting. It was amended five times by Congress to extend its protections as needed."
Solar eclipses on Mars
"The two moons of Mars—Phobos and Deimos—are much smaller than the Moon, greatly reducing solar eclipses on that planet."
Eclipses.
Phobos.
"Phobos is only 20 by 25 km (12 by 16 mi) and has a rapid orbital motion, so someone on Mars would only see the solar eclipse for no longer than about thirty seconds. Phobos also takes only 7 hours 39 minutes to orbit Mars, while a Martian day is 24 hours 37 minutes long, meaning that Phobos can create two eclipses per Martian day."
Deimos.
"Deimos is too small, 15 by 10 km (9.3 by 6.2 mi), to cause an eclipse. The best someone on Mars would see would be a small object passing the Sun."
View from Earth.
"Both moons are too small to cast a shadow on Mars that can be seen from Earth. However, since the creation of artificial satellites, the shadow of Phobos on Mars has been seen."

"The center's best known feature is the Sails Pavilion. It is a exhibit and special event area. The Sails Pavilion's roof includes Teflon-coated fiberglass ""sails"". They are intended to show San Diego's maritime history. The Pavilion was first built as an open-air facility under the roof. This made it hard to get people to use it. Because of this, the Pavilion area was enclosed in glass. This made it much more usable."
History.
San Diego approved the construction of a new convention center in 1983. It was built on land owned by the Port of San Diego. Construction of the building began in March 1987 and was finished in November 1989. The center was made larger in September 2001 by doubling its square footage.
"Notable events hosted at the convention center include the Comic Con International convention. It hosted the 1996 Republican National Convention, which nominated Bob Dole and Jack Kemp for President and Vice President of the United States."

"The Ragdoll is gentle, easy going, and affectionate. The breed was named ""Ragdoll"" because they often go limp and relax like a rag or cloth doll when it is picked up. The original mother cat that the breed was created from was involved in a car accident, but contrary to popular belief, this is not why the breed goes limp when picked up (injuries from an accident are not passed on to offspring genetically)."

Some of the identities were found in his “lost notebook”. When the notebook was discovered, mathematicians proved almost all of Ramanujan's work. His discoveries have led to many advancements in mathematics. His formulae are now being used in crystallography and string theory."
"In 2011, Ramanujan's birthday was made “National Mathematics Day” by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh."

Dieppe Raid
"The Dieppe Raid is also known as the Battle of Dieppe, Operation ""Rutter"" and, later, Operation Jubilee. It was a Second World War Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe. The attack took place on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942."
"The attack began at 5:00 a.m. and by 10:50 a.m. the Allied commanders had to call a retreat. Over 6,000 infantrymen, mostly Canadian, were supported by a Canadian Armoured regiment. They were also helped by a strong force of Royal Navy and smaller Royal Air Force group."
"The goal was to capture a major port for a short period and to gather information. Upon retreat, the Allies also wanted to destroy coastal defences, port structures and important buildings. The raid was also intended to improve morale and demonstrate the commitment of the United Kingdom to attack a Western front in Europe."
"None of these goals were achieved. There was not enough Allied artillery support. The troops were trapped on the beach by obstacles and German gunfire. After less than 10 hours since the first landings, the last Allied troops had all been either killed, evacuated, or captured by the Germans."
"Instead of showing the British commitment, the terrible number of Allied deaths showed that the Allies were not ready to invade France for a long time. The attack did help the Allies to gather some information."
"A total of 3,623 of the 6,086 men (almost 60%) who went ashore were either killed, wounded, or captured. The Royal Air Force did not get the ""Luftwaffe"" to start a battle. The RAF lost 96 aircraft (at least 32 to being shot down or accidents), compared to 48 lost by the ""Luftwaffe""."
"The Royal Navy lost 33 landing craft and one destroyer. The events at Dieppe affected the plans for the North African (Operation ""Torch"") and Normandy landings (Operation ""Overlord"")."
Background.
The British decided the Dieppe attack could be planned within a month. They were very careful to keep the attack secret. No records were kept of the plans.
"After the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk in May 1940, the British started to plan an attack force. It would use new ways of doing sea landings on beaches (amphibious warfare)."
The British started planning was to see if they could capture a port. This would allow them to test out how to use ships in the attack. It would also allow them to test new equipment.
"Dieppe, a coastal town in France, is built along a long cliff by the English Channel. In 1942, the Germans set up two large artillery batteries at Berneval-le-Grand and Varengeville. One important consideration for the British planners was that Dieppe was within range of the Royal Air Force's fighter aircraft."
"There was also pressure from the Soviet government to attack the Germans in Western Europe. By early 1942, The Wehrmacht's Operation ""Barbarossa"" attacks did not destroy the Soviet Union."
"However, the Germans moved into southern Soviet territory, pushing toward Stalingrad. Joseph Stalin demanded that the Allies attack in France to force the Germans to move 40 divisions away from the Eastern Front. This would make the fighting less hard for the Red Army."
Plan.
The Dieppe raid was a major attack planned by Vice-Admiral Lord Mountbatten.
"The attacking force would consist of 5,000 Canadians, 1,000 British troops, and 50 United States Rangers."
"It was originally planned in April 1942 and code named Operation ""Rutter"". The Allies planned to do a major attack on a German-held port on the French coast and to hold it for two tides. They would destroy enemy buildings and defences before withdrawing."
This plan was approved in May 1942. It included British parachute units attacking German artillery batteries. The Canadians would land on the beaches and attack. The parachute operation was cancelled and instead No. 3 Commando and No. 4 Commando would land by sea and attack the artillery batteries.
Land component.
"The Canadian government wanted that Canadian troops to do some fighting. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, commanded by Major General John Hamilton Roberts, was selected for the main force."
"The plan called for an attack, without any heavy air bombing."
The lack of enough bombing was one of the main reasons for the attack's failure. Some people think that air and naval bombing was not done to limit casualties of French civilians in the port.
"The Dieppe landings were planned on six beaches. Four were in front of the town, and two to the eastern and western sides."
"Armoured support was provided by the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)). 58 of the new Churchill tanks would be sent ashore using the new landing craft tank (LCT). In addition, three of the Churchills had flame-throwers and all could operate in the shallow water near the beach."

"Andrew Jackson originally known as Andrew Jackson, Jr. (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was an American politician. He was a General in the War of 1812. He later became the seventh president of the United States of America. He was the first Democrat and is on the twenty dollar bill. His nickname was ""Old Hickory"". He forced many Native Americans to leave their homeland so white people could live there, and many died. This was called the Trail of Tears."
Early life.
As a boy Andrew Jackson was a messenger for the Continental Army. The British caught him and mistreated him.
He was the first U.S. president who was not born into a rich family. He was not a rich man and did not have a college education. He moved to Tennessee and became a politician.
Military.
"During the War of 1812, he became a general and won the Battle of New Orleans which made him very famous. He joined the war because of childhood trauma that he had endured during the Revolutionary War; both his mother and his brother died during the war, and Jackson blamed the British and wanted to avenge his late loved ones."
Marriage.
"In 1791, he fell in love with Rachel Donelson Robards. They went through a marriage ceremony. However, the marriage was not legal because she had not been granted a divorce from her first husband. Therefore, they married legally three years later. They had no children, but they adopted several. He became rich and owned a large plantation."
Politics.
"In the 1790s Jackson was a member of the United States House of Representatives, the United States Senate, and the Supreme Court of Tennessee. In 1823 he returned to the Senate."
Andrew Jackson reorganized the Democratic Party and was its leader.
"In 1828, he defeated John Quincy Adams in the Presidential Election of 1828, he became president on March 4, 1829, and four years later he was re-elected to a second term as president. In the Nullification Crisis of 1832-1833, South Carolina declared secession from the United States. Jackson threatened war, and then compromised."
"In January 1835, Jackson was almost assassinated when an unemployed painter wanted to shoot him but both his guns jammed. He is the first president to have had an attempted assassination."
"During his presidency, he signed the Indian Removal Act which allowed the U.S. government to violently force the Native Americans to move from their land and go west. Many Native Americans were killed and the path they walked to get to the west was called the Trail of Tears."
Andrew Jackson was against the national bank of the United States because he felt that banks and their banknotes were for rich and powerful people and did not serve the interests of the common man. The national bank expired during Jackson's presidency. Jackson chose not to continue the bank.
"On March 4, 1837, Andrew Jackson finished his second term. After that, vice-president Martin Van Buren was elected president and continued many of the things Jackson did. Jackson was a big influence on other Democrats during the 1800s."
Legacy.
"Jackson's legacy among historians is mixed, going downhill, and heavily debated. Some have liked him because he was against aristocrats, bankers, businessmen, the British Empire, cities, and paper money, and in favor of ordinary country people. Some have disliked him for the same reasons and because he was in favor of war and against Indians."
Pillow
A pillow is a soft cushion that a person puts under their head when they are sleeping in a bed.
"A pillow is made from two pieces of cloth that are sewn together and stuffed with a soft material, such as feathers, duck down, or synthetic batting (man made soft stuffing). Pillows are usually rectangular. Pillows are covered with a fabric sheet called a pillowcase. The pillowcase protects the pillow from getting dirty."
"The word ""pillow"" comes from Middle English ""pilwe"", from Old English ""pyle"" (akin to Old High German ""pfuliwi"") and from Latin ""pulvinus"". The word ""pillow"" was first known to be used before the 12th century."
History.
"There is no clear inventor of the pillow. Millions of years ago, animals learned to use pillows. An early example is monkeys resting their heads on their arm. Many animals, including birds, use wood and stone nests as pillows. Many domesticated animals have also learned to make use of human-made pillows and cushions. They also rest on members of their own and other species for the same reason."
Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.
"In ancient Mesopotamia, people slept on stone pillows. Pillows were a status symbol. Early pillows were rectangular and had grooves shaped for the head. Pillows showed the wealth of a person — the more a person owned the wealthier they were."
"Anicent Egyptians used pillows as a solution to back, neck and shoulder pain. They also prevented insects from crawling in their hair, mouth or nose at night. Anicent Egyptian pillows were made out of wood and stone and looked like stands. These pillows were mostly used for the deceased."
Whaler
"A whaler is a person who hunts whales, or the boat they use."
Other reeds can be made from metal or plastic.

Muhammad
"Muhammad ( – 8 June 632) was an Arab religious, political and social leader. He founded the religion of Islam."
"Born in Mecca, Muhammad's parents died in his childhood and he grew as an orphan. At the age of six, his grandfather Abd al-Muttalib took care of him, though he died just two years later. In young life, Muhammad accompanied his uncle Abu Talib on trade trips. In 610 AD, at the age of forty, while Muhammad was praying, he reportedly met Gabriel and received the first revelation of the Quran. At first, Muhammad preached these revelations to his close friends and family. He started preaching monotheism publicly where he received opposition from the Meccan polytheists. The polytheists boycotted Muhammad for three years, in which Muhammad could barely eat or drink. He was attacked with stones, ridiculed while praying, and eventually forced to leave his hometown of Mecca."
"While Muhammad was traveling towards Medina, he came across Taif and preached there where polytheists threw stones, causing Muhammad to bleed and almost collapse. After reaching Medina with Abu Bakr, the Medinan Muslims helped Muhammad and made a mosque there."
"He is believed to be a descendant of Ishmael, a son of Abraham, and the last of all prophets (""the seal of the prophets""). He is seen as an example for all Muslims to follow."
Life.
Childhood.
"Muhammad was born about 570 AD in Mecca. His father, whose name was Abdullah, died six months before Muhammad's birth. His mother, Amina, died when he was six years old. So, his grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib, took care of him after the death of Amina but he too died two years later when Muhammad was nine. After his grandfather's death, his uncle Abu Talib took care of him and was a support to him for many years of his adult life."
Beginning of the prophethood.
"In 610 AD, when Muhammad was forty years old, he went for a walk to the mountain of Hira near Mecca. According to Muslims, the angel Jibrail (Gabriel) spoke with him in a cave on the mountain. The story says that when Muhammad first saw the angel Gabriel, he fainted because Gabriel was so large. This is what Jibrail said to Muhammad:"
"""Read... in the name of God Who made man from a drop of blood... God is Most Rewarding... He Who taught man to write with pen... and taught man what he knew not."""
"Muhammad went back home to his wife Khadijah and told her what had happened. New revelations came to him commanding him to preach what was being sent ""down"" from God. When Muhammad first started teaching, many of the people of Mecca, who worshipped idols, did not like the things that Muhammad said. But there were also people who listened to his preaching and obeyed his messages. These people were the first of the followers of Islam. Leaders of Mecca punished and tortured the followers of Islam. Some followers of Islam were executed. Muhammad resisted this and continued to teach Islam."
The Hijrah.
"After Muhammad finished in Mecca, he took his message to Medina, where some people learned about him and his followers. They welcomed him into their city, and Muhammad wanted them to convert to Islam. They agreed, and many of his followers went to Medina. This movement from Mecca to Medina is called the ""Hijrah"". The Hijra was also the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Muhammad stayed behind until all of his people left Mecca safely."
"As Muhammad stayed in Mecca, his uncle Abu Lahab trained seven men to kill Muhammad in his sleep. According to history, they did not see him leave Mecca. The men went into his house and found his cousin, Ali. Abu Lahab and his horsemen went to the desert to look for him and his friend, Abu Bakr."
His stay in Medina.
"Muhammad and Abu Bakr arrived in Medina. Some people welcomed Muhammad to their homes. He used his camel to show everyone where he would build his house. Also, the first mosque of Medina, a small place for prayer, was built in the back of this house."
The people in a strong Jewish tribe in Medina disagreed with the teachings and rules set by Muhammad. This tribe told their allies in Mecca to sell all the things and homes that Muslims of Mecca left behind. The Muslims and those from Mecca were advised to fight for their property. Muhammad told them not to do that.
Muslims were called all over Medina to gather at a mosque that Muhammad prayed in. They were told to fight against the people of Mecca who burned down their homes and stole their property.
The wars.
"The Quraysh pagans of Mecca heard about this, and they sent a larger army numbering 1000 warriors to fight the Muslims. They met in Badr, but the pagans were defeated and Abu Jahl, one of the pagan leaders, was also killed."
"But, the Muslims lost the second battle at Uhud. One year after the fight at Badr, the army of Mecca had outside help. Muslim archers failed to listen to Muhammad's instructions and Khalid ibn al-Walid cleverly took advantage of that. Hamza, Muhammad's last uncle, was killed when a slave from Mecca threw a spear into his chest. Muhammad himself was injured."

Kona coffee
"Kona Coffee is one of the kinds of coffee that is made in Kona, Hawaii. And it is famous for being the second most expensive coffee in the world following the Blue Mountains. It is too rare and accounts for only less than 0.1% of all coffee production all over the world."
History.
"In 1825, the person who was one of the royal family of Hawaii went to Britain with the king of Hawaii and brought coffee plants on the way home. Those plants spread to many regions of Hawaii. In 1828, coffee plants were planted in the Kona region. After that, many farms were made there. But, because of pest damage and the price decline of coffee, most farmers quit their jobs. In this situation, Japanese immigrants moved to the Kona region and started to grow coffee to pay their land cost by coffee. This is the beginning of kona coffee. Now, Kona coffee is drunk at the dinner party in White House because this is the only coffee that is grown in America and the quality is quite high."
Distribution.
"Kona is one of the districts of Hawaii, and it is located western. Also,it is the only place which grows coffee in the U.S. states. It has a good natural environment for growing coffee thanks to some volcanoes that give soil many nutrients. Also, the unique oceanic climate of the Kona region, which is cooler and rains a lot more than that of flat ground, is good for growing coffee. Furthermore, there is a terroir that is called “ Kona coffee belt” that is around 32 km long and 3.2 wide area. In this territory, there are many farms and shops that sell Kona coffee directly from the farms and as much as 900,000 kg of coffee beans are harvested annually."
Kona blends and Flavor coffee.
"There are some blended Kona coffees that are made by mixing some kinds of coffee beans because 100% Kona coffee is quite expensive because of labor and land cost. In the Hawaii-grow coffee law, blended coffee that accounted for 10% of Kona coffee beans can be called Kona blended coffee. The coffees that have extra flavor like macadamia nut, vanilla and so on are also famous. Those flavor coffees are made by adding flavor during roasting."
Taste.
"This coffee has a less bitter taste and softly sourness. Because of its great sourness, this coffee is called “Queen of sourness”. You can feel the sweet and fresh smell like tropical fruits. Also Kona coffee is graded 5 stages according to the size of the beans. The bigger beans are graded better and those coffee beans have better taste. The biggest coffee beans are called “extra fancy” and there are only 15 % of Kona coffee. Following “fancy”, “No 1”, “select”, “prime”. Other coffee beans are called “ Hawaiian coffee”. Also, there are coffee beans which are called Peaberry. It is round beans although originally one is half round. Those coffee beans contain more nutrition."

Johann Georg Albrechtsberger
"Johann Georg Albrechtsberger (born 3 February 1736 in Klosterneuburg near Vienna; died 7 March 1809 in Vienna) was an Austrian composer, organist, music theorist and music teacher. He is most known today because he was Beethoven’s teacher for a time."
Life.
"From the age of seven, Albrechtsberger was a choirboy. He had lessons in organ and music theory. As an adult, he had several jobs in churches in small towns. He became Kapellmeister at St Stephen’s Church, Vienna in 1793. This was the best job for a church musician in the empire."
Writing music.
"Albrechtsberger wrote hundreds of compositions. He wrote most of them before he got the job in Vienna. He wrote in a classical style. Albrechsberger enjoyed doing things with music which were not normally done. He would ask string players to tune their strings in different ways (called “scordatura”). He would also write slow movements with muted strings. As well as classical sonatas he wrote lots of fugues. Several people, including Mozart, thought of him as the greatest organist in the world."
Teaching.
Albrechtsberger was a very important music teacher. Joseph Haydn thought he was the best teacher in Vienna. He was very interested in contrapuntal music of the Baroque period. He copied many fugues by Bach and other composers.
"When Beethoven was a young man, he had some composition lessons from Joseph Haydn. When Haydn was going to travel to England for several months, he asked Albrechtsberger to teach Beethoven while he was gone. These lessons took place from 1793 to 1795. A few years later, Albrechtsberger said about Beethoven that “he learned absolutely nothing and will never accomplish anything decent”. Beethoven said that Albrechtsberger was a “musical pedant”. However, Beethoven still studied Albrechtsberger’s books on music theory. The string quartets which Beethoven wrote near the end of his life show the influence of Albrechtsberger."
Fidelio
"Fidelio is an opera in two acts by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is Beethoven's only opera. The German libretto is by Joseph Sonnleithner based on a French story. The opera tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard called ""Fidelio"", rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison."
"""Fidelio"" is an example of a “rescue opera”, a type of opera which was popular at the time. The hero (or heroine) has to fight against cruel people in order to rescue a lover. It was written at the time of the French Revolution. At this time, ideas about freedom and peace were being talked about by everyone, and this led to wars all over Europe. The famous Prisoners’ Chorus is a song for freedom, just like the last movement of his Ninth Symphony."
"Beethoven spent some time working on the opera before he was completely happy with it. The first time it was performed (in 1805) it was a three-act opera called ""Leonore"". There were a lot of French military officers in the audience and they thought they were being criticised. In 1806 it was performed again with two acts and a new overture (now known as ""Overture: Leonore No. 3""). But arguments between Beethoven and the theatre management meant there were no more performances. Eight years later Beethoven revised his opera again. This time it was called ""Fidelio"", and it was a great success. It has remained a famous opera ever since."
Plot.
"The setting is a Spanish state prison, a few miles from Seville, in the late 18th century."

In 1948 Funatsu Village and Shin-Yokoe Village became a part of Sabae Town. Since then Sabae Town was gradually growing until it became Sabae City.
"Gozaemon Masunaga, the ""ancestor of domestic eyeglasses,"" started  manufacturing eyewear frames in Fukui around 1905. At that time, most people in Sabae were working in the farming industry. Farming was challenging in winter, since the Fukui region experiences a lot of snow.  Masunaga started this industry because the eyeglass industry does not depend on the season. He invited craftsmen from Osaka to try to spread the industry as a side business of a farmer in Fukui. At that time, education and the development of printing technology were spreading so people started to read prints such as newspapers. The demand for eyewear has expanded. In 1935, the eyewear industry spread to Sabae and Fukui. The industry succeeded in manufacturing the titanium-based eyewear frames in 1981 for the first time in the world. After that, a large military factory was converted to an eyewear factory after the end of World War II made Sabae’s eyeglasses industry famous."

In meantime Sabae Jin'ya became Sabae Han (historical term for the estate of a daimyo in the Edo period) (1720-1871)"
"Manabe Akikatsu (1804-1884) is known as the most famous Sabae's feudal lord, who in 1856 opened Kyōyōkei - a place where the lords can relax. Kyōyōkei was the foundation of the current Nishiyama Park."
"When Sabae became Han there was a plan to build a castle. However, the Sabae Castle was never built. There were many problems such as financial difficulties and the occurrence of famine. Instead, Manabe Akikatsu took the money that was meant for the castle and gave it to the villages that were suffering from famine."

It may mean ""to "" or ""to "" in verbal form. According to ""The History Of Manipur"" written by Wahengbam Ibohal, the words ""Lai"" and ""Khu"" are the names of tribes. The last part ""-rembi"" means chief, head or graceful in feminine form."
History and Origin.
"According to the Poireiton Khunthok, Laikhurembi () was the chief queen of Thongaren (). This book talks about her body in ways that show her personality. They say she had a wide mouth, which means she was loud or boastful. They say she had small breasts, which meant she used her heart less than she used her head; she was a thinking person and not a feeling person. They say she had sideways eyes, meaning she did not look at people straight on."
"Scholars think this queen may have had Asian ethnicity. Some scholars think Laikhurembi could come from a tribe that had both ""Lai"" and ""Khu"" people in it. Other scholars think ""Laikhurembi"" is just her title and not her name."
"Laikhurembi () is the daughter of Lai-ren Humchouba (, : Hoom Chao Hpa). In Meitei language (Manipuri language), ""Lai-ren"" means ""Chief of Lai"". In Meitei language, the word ""Lai"" has many meanings."
"Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of King Thongaren (). Then king asked her to marry his younger brother, Poireiton, instead, because Poireiton's wife had died. Poireiton was beginning a journey to ""Tai Pang Pan"" and King Thongalel thought it would not be good for Poireiton to go without a wife. However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. Instead of Laikhurembi, King Thongalel sent his second wife Leinaotabi to accompany her brother in law Poireiton as a wife."
Description.
"The Goddess Laikhurembi had special powers. She was ""Yungyatnaba"" (lit. ""erect and sharp"") which meant she could see objects accurately no matter how far away they were. She could look at a person and see who he or she truly was inside. When she made a judgement, she would announce her decision wisely, and people got the right rewards for what they had done (""things given in recognition of service, effort or achievement"")."
"No one could find the Goddess Laikhurembi unless she wanted them to find her. No matter how hard a person would look, she could hide and stay hidden."
Kleophrades Painter
"The Kleophrades Painter was a red-figure Athenian vase painter. His real name is unknown. His name is taken from a potter's signature on a vase. He was active from about 510470 BC. His work is considered some of the finest of the red figure style. He was probably the pupil of Euthymides, one of the red-figure Pioneers. His work is identified by its stylistic traits. He was very productive. More than 100 vases of his work have survived. He worked in both black- and red- figure styles and techniques. He was conservative, often using old-fashioned techniques. His subjects were traditional but with a emphasis on the Trojan War. He preferred painting large vessels such as amphores."

He was a strong supporter of indigenous Australian rights (including land rights) and national aid for schools. In 1977, he was elected to the House of Representatives as member for Melbourne Ports. When Bob Hawke became Prime Minister in 1983, he put Holding in charge of Aboriginal Affairs. During his term, Holding tried to make federal laws for Aboriginal land rights. But Brian Burke, the Labor Premier of Western Australia, did not want this, because it would have upset the mining and agricultural industries, which were very important to his state. Holding was forced by Hawke to drop the proposal. In 1987, he was moved to the Ministry of Employment Services and Youth Affairs. The next year, he was made Minister for Transport, and then later Minister for Immigration."
Kottabos
"Kottabos () was a party game played at symposia in Ancient Greece. It was popular in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. It was also popular with the Etruscans. The game is played by flinging a bit of wine from one's cup at targets. The player would utter the name of his lover. The game was probably of Sicilian origin but spread throughout the Greek world. Many Greek poets mention the game in their works. By the time of the Roman Empire and the Age of Alexander the Great, the game had died out. It is not mentioned in Latin literature."

He is also the inventor of the ""didjeribone"", a sliding didgeridoo made of plastic, played in a similar way to the trombone."
Symposium
"A symposium (plural: symposia) was a drinking party in Ancient Greece. Guests were males. Well bred women did not attend.

The symposium was an aristocratic institution often held to celebrate a young man's entry into adult society, an athletic victory, or a poetic achievement. It was an occasion for male conversation and debate. Party-goers reclined on couches and pillows. Guests played a game called kottabos, wrestled, and held song contests. A symposium is described in Plato's ""The Symposium"". The party is attended by Socrates and the young, drunken, and nearly nude Alcibiades."

History.
"The station was built as the terminus of what would become the Hudson Bay Railway in 1908. At first it served by terminating services from the cities in the south. but later destinations were expanded. By 1929 trains were running to Churchill, Thompson, Flin Flon, Lynn Lake, Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Prince Albert. By the 1960s all train services were operated by CN. In 1978 Serives were taken over by Via Rail whom at the time operated a total of 18 departures per week out of the station."
The 1978 timetable consisted of:
In 1980 terminating services from Saskatoon were cancelled. Then in 1981 Via received a budget cut which saw tri-weekly services to thompson and to Winnipeg via Swan River discontinued. In 2002 services to Lynn Lake were cut back to Pukatawagan followed by the service being cancelled in 2006 and replaced by a twice weekly mixed use train operated by the local first nations. In 2011 one of the 3 weekly trips to and from Churchill was made to terminate here rather than continue on to Winnipeg. In 2018 flooding saw services to Churchill cut back to Gillam and they weren't restored until over a year later. During the Covid 19 Pandemic terminating services were cancelled and service to Winnipeg and Churchill were retained on a once weekly freequency. This is because the route served vital communites without reliable road access. Service has since reached pre-pandemic levels.
Services.
Currently The Pas sees 7 departures per week to a few destinations:
The Pas also sees 1 train per week which arrives from Churchill which terminates there.
Fly orchid
"The fly orchid, ""Ophrys insectifera"", is a flower which uses scent for mimicry."
The plant uses scent to mimic the wasps' female sexual pheromones. This attracts male wasps. The wasps pollinate the flowers as they try to mate with them.
"It is a remarkable example of sexually deceptive pollination and floral mimicry. The plant is pollinated by only two species of wasp of the genus ""Argogorytes""."
"The soil the orchid grows in is poor, and it needs mycorrhiza to help it get nutrients."
Emilia Romagna Grand Prix
"The Emilia Romagna Grand Prix is a Formula One motor racing event held at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari, often referred to as ""Imola"" after the town where it is located. The event takes the name ""Emilia Romagna"" from the Italian region where the circuit is located. The venue has previously hosted the Italian Grand Prix in 1980, and the San Marino Grand Prix from 1981 to 2006."
Nunsiade
"The Nunsiade (or ""Anunziazion"", Annunciation) is a traditional Friulian liturgical song for Advent. The text is taken from the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke, from verse 26 to 38. Since the Latin text begins with the words ""Missus est angelus Gabriel"" it is usually called ""Missus"" in Italian."
"The tradition started from Patriarch Francesco Barbaro in the church of St. Mary in the castle of Udin, from 1596 and 1616. Since the end of the 17th century many authors wrote many ""Nunsiadis"", among the other Zuan Tite Tomadin, Antoni De Zorz, Meni Pecile, Vigji Comencin, Zuan Tite Candot, Jacop Tomadin and Vitori Franz. The version of Candot is the most singed nowadays."
Lyrics.

"Marahuaca odorous frog (""Myersiohyla inparquesi"") is a frog. Scientists have seen it on Tepui Marahuaca Sur in Amazonas, Venezuela. Scientists have seen between 2600 meters above sea level."
"This view is disputed by some. ""Society for the Scientific Study of Religion"" stated in 1990 that there was not sufficient research for a consensus, and that ""one should not automatically equate the techniques involved in the process of physical coercion and control with those of nonphysical coercion and control""."
Management style of cults.
An oft-repeated criticism of cults is that their management style is dictatorial and exploitative. The following is one example:
Use of violence.
"Ownership of weapons and violence has occurred in some cults. The Branch Davidians under the direction of David Koresh used violence against Federal agencies, with tragic results for both sides. The later FBI report reveals the extent of their arms stockpile."
"The People's Temple included guards armed with submachine guns. These guards killed the visiting U.S. Congressman Ryan, and stood around the believers as they committed suicide. Members of the Manson Family were convicted of several murders."

"Michener wrote that he did not know who his parents were or exactly when and where he was born. He was raised by an adoptive mother, Mabel Michener, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Some have argued that Mabel was his birth mother. He graduated from Swarthmore College, where he played basketball, in 1929. He later studied at the Colorado State Teachers College. He taught there for several years. He also taught at Harvard University."
"His writing career began during World War II. He was assigned to the South Pacific Ocean as a naval historian. He used his time there as the basis for ""Tales of the South Pacific"", his first book. This book was the basis for the musical ""South Pacific""."
"Michener met his wife Mari while in Japan. His novel ""Sayonara"" is autobiographical."
"On January 10, 1977, he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald R. Ford."
"In his final years, he lived in Austin, Texas, where he died of kidney failure on October 16, 1997 at the age of 90."
War of 1812
The War of 1812 was fought between the British Empire and the United States from 1812 to 1815 on land in North America and at sea. The British forces were helped by Canadian militia (volunteers) and Native Americans because British soldiers were busy fighting Napoleon I in Europe.
"In nearly every battle, the British defeated the attacking American forces. The war increased nationalism in both Canada and the United States."
Causes.
One reason given by Americans for declaring war was that the British were bothering American ships. The British claimed to be looking for British sailors who had deserted. Many British sailors deserted from the
"miserable conditions and the harsh discipline. Originally, many of the sailors had been pressed into service. It was the practice of the British to arrest any man they found on a street and to force him to serve on their ships. Many British sailors who escaped signed on as crew aboard American merchant ships. The British claim was somewhat true."
"In 1807, an American ship was boarded and then fired on, which created outrage among the American public. The British were also seizing American sailors at sea and forcing them to serve in the navy."
"The numbers of American seamen pressed into British service is not well known and may have been greatly exaggerated. The British were also sponsoring Native American territories in the Midwest to stop the United States from expanding westward. That made 10,000 Native Americans fight for the British."
"Napoleon I started the French invasion of Russia in 1812, just as the war started in North America. The Americans thought that the British would be busy fighting the French during the Napoleonic Wars to do much in North America."
The war.
"Fighting began when the United States started to attack the Canadian provinces in 1812. However, the British and the Canadians successfully defended their borders. In 1813, British and American ships fought in the Battle of Lake Erie. Americans under Oliver Hazard Perry won, which gave them control of Lake Erie. American forces raided and burned Toronto, which was then called York."
Felixstowe
"Felixstowe is a town in Suffolk, England. It has the largest container ports in Europe."
"About 30,000 people live in Felixstowe."
Malcolm Lowry
"Clarence Malcolm Lowry (; 28 July 1909 – 26 June 1957) was a British writer. He is most famous for his 1947 novel ""Under the Volcano"" about an alcoholic Consul in Mexico. Lowry was himself an alcoholic and a lot of his writings were about the effect alcohol had on his life and on the lives of his characters."

When her uncle finds out that Charlie has discovered his secret he sets out to murder her before she exposes him."
Rope (movie)
"Rope is a 1948 American drama movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It stars James Stewart, John Dall and Farley Granger. It tells the story of two young intellectuals, played by Dall and Granger, who murder one of their friends in an apartment in Manhattan. They do it in order to prove that it is possible to commit the perfect murder. Then they hold a dinner party at which they invite the parents of the victim as well as their former teacher, played by Stewart. During the dinner party they come close to boasting about their crime and arouse the suspicions of the teacher who eventually exposes them and alerts the police. The movie is famous for seemingly being made in one long shot without changing the camera angle. It is also known for implying a homosexual relationship between the two intellectuals at a time when homosexuality was rarely mentioned in movies or popular American culture."
Early modern period
"The early modern period of human history, is a time from 15001800 (roughly). This time follows the Middle Ages. It is the start of recognizable nations that we know today."
"In the history of Europe, the early modern period follows the Medieval period. It begins around the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, and includes the Renaissance period, and the Age of Discovery. It includes the discovery of America, and the discovery of the sea route to the East. It ends around the French Revolution in 1789."
Europe.
"In 1453 Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire. Science, transport, and communications improved. This is also called the Renaissance. For European countries with many ships, this was the Age of Discovery. Europe was beginning to expand to the New World."
"Trade with Asia was common, after Europeans found their way around Africa and into the Indian Ocean. Late in this period the European countries started setting up colonies there."
Asia.
"The Mughal Empire began in 1526. This Empire had a orderly government, widespread economic prosperity and religious tolerance. At this time Asia was flourishing in Math and Science. Also the Ottoman Empire was ruling the Middle East, along with the Persian Empire."
National Assembly
Literary works.
"Bradford wrote ""Of Plymouth Plantation"". It was a history about Plymouth colony. It is often called a journal. It was a collection of what he saw and what he thought was important. This was written in two books. The first book was written in 1630 but the second was never finished. During the years 1646 and 1650, he wrote about the colony's history up to 1646."
"In ""Of Plymouth Plantation"", Bradford saw what was happening to be like what happened in the Bible. As Philip Gould writes, ""Bradford hoped to show the workings of God to future generations."" The book was not published until 1656, the year before his death, and it was well liked. Bradford has been called the father of American history. Many American authors have put what Bradford said in their books. Thomas Prence did so in his book named ""A Chronological History of New-England in the Form of Annals."" Today it is considered very important and studied in American schools and colleges. Bradford's journal was included in another work entitled ""Mourt's Relation"". This was written in part by Edward Winslow, and made into a book in England in 1622."
Homeless Bird
"Homeless Bird is a book by Gloria Whelan, an American author, about life in India for a 13-year-old girl named Koly.

Plot Summary.
"Koly is a 13 year-old girl who lives in Vrindavan India with her parents and two brothers. Based on Indian tradition, her family has made an arranged marriage for her. Her husband is a sickly, young boy named Hari. Once they are married, Koly must go to live with his family. But soon Koly finds out that Hari has tuberculosis and he will die very soon. Hari's parents had decided to take Hari to the Ganges River and Koly comes along too. While going to the city of the Ganges River, Hari dies. When Hari dies, Koly becomes a widow. Koly's sassur (father- in-law) is a kind man who teaches students. He teaches Koly to read and shows her a book of poems signed by the author Tagore. Koly's sass (mother-in-law) is not a nice woman. She treats Koly as just another mouth to feed."
Hari's sister Chandra is soon married. Koly is sad because Chandra was her friend and now she is leaving. Soon Koly's sassur dies and now both Koly and her sass are widows.
Sass and Koly are very poor. One day Sass gets a letter from her brother inviting them to live with him in Delhi. They make a stop in Vrindavan to pray at a temple. They take a rickshaw to the temple. Sass gives Koly money to buy lunch. Koly goes to buy the food but when she goes back to the temple her sass is not there. She looks around and cannot find her. Finally she sees the rickshaw driver. He tells her that her sass left on a train hours ago.
"Koly cries because her sass has left her. The rickshaw driver says to go to the temple and pray so the monks will give her food. Koly is very unhappy and scared. She sees the rickshaw driver again and he offers to bring her to a house for widows. At the home Koly meets a nice widow named Tanu. Together they find jobs making marigold garlands and beaded bracelets. However, Koly's talent is embroidery. She finally gets a job embroidering. Her new boss' name is Mr. Das."
"Koly also teaches the rickshaw driver, Raji, how to read. Raji owns a farm and drives rickshaws for money. They talk and become friends. However he leaves to fix his farm."
"At her new job, Koly makes friends with a girl named Mala. Mala is good at embroidery but very outspoken. Mala also steals expensive cloth and thread from Mr. Das. This later causes Mala to lose her job."
"Raji comes back and tells Koly that he is fixing up his farm and building a home. He wants Koly to come to his farm with him. She is confused until Raji says he wants her as his wife. Koly is surprised that Raji wants to marry her because she is a widow, and in her society it is shameful to be a widow. However Raji wants to marry Koly because he does not care about appearance and only wants someone he can talk to. Koly is still unsure but agrees to think about it."
Tanu and Koly finally have enough money to buy a room for more widows to live in. Koly decorates the room with embroidered quilts.
"In the summer Raji writes that he has built a room for her work on her embroidery. Koly is happy and agrees to marry him. She works on a wedding quilt and says they will marry when she is done embroidering it. She keeps her job, and agrees to take her work to Mr. Das every couple of weeks."
"Koly, just like the homeless bird in one of the Tagore poems, has finally found her home."

Anne Hutchinson
"Anne Hutchinson (baptized July 20, 1591 - 20 August 1643), was a religious dissenter in Puritan New England. Her parents are Francis Marbury and Bridget Dryden. Her father, being a clergy, homeschooled Anne Hutchinson. She got more education than most other girls at that time. She was the defendant in the most famous of the trials intended to suppress religious dissent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She was born Anne Marbury in Alford, Lincolnshire, England. She, her husband William, and their children left England for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634. Once settled, she began holding weekly meetings in her home to discuss sermons and theology."
"Her religious views did not agree with those of her Puritan neighbors. They believed good works were necessary for salvation. Hutchinson believed that only faith (Sola fide) was necessary. She also believed that God revealed himself to people without the help of the clergy. Community leaders viewed Hutchinson as a threat. She was found guilty of heresy in 1637, and told to leave the colony."
"Hutchinson and her family moved first to Rhode Island. After her husband's death in 1642, she settled near present-day Pelham Bay on Long Island Sound. In 1643, Hutchinson, all her children except one, and all her servants were killed in an attack perpetrated by Native Americans. Her death was regarded by some in Massachusetts Bay as evidence of divine judgment."

LaWanda Page
"LaWanda Page (October 19, 1920September 14, 2002), born Alberta Peal, was an American actress and comedienne best known for her role as Aunt Esther in the 1970s TV sitcom ""Sanford and Son"". She later reprised the role in ""Sanford Arms"" and ""Sanford""."
Early life and career.
"She was born on October 19, 1920 in Cleveland, Ohio. Page was raised in St. Louis, Missouri. LaWanda Page and Redd Foxx were very close friends from the time they were pre-teens. They attended school and grew up together in St. Louis. Later on, they both entered the field of comedy separately and performed stage acts. Page later recorded several live comedy albums for the Laff Records label in the late 1960s and early 1970s under the LaWanda stage name. One release, a gold-selling album called ""Watch It, Sucker!"", was titled after one of her Aunt Esther character's catchphrases to capitalize on her newfound TV fame. During her tenure as a stand-up comic, which lasted all the way to the 1990s, she was often called ""The Queen of Comedy"", or ""The Black Queen of Comedy"". Other than the expletive-free ""Sane Advice"" album, released two years after the run of ""Sanford and Son"", most of Page's albums and stand-up material were raunchy in nature."
Other film and television appearances.
"In 1977 Page appeared in an episode of ""The Love Boat"", ""Martin,"" ""227,"" ""Family Matters,"" and ""Diff'rent Strokes."" She appeared on ""Circus Of The Stars"" as a fire eater."
Death.
"Page died of complications from diabetes on September 14, 2002. She is interred in an outdoor crypt at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California."
"Her daughter, the evangelist Clara Estella Roberta Johnson, died on June 4, 2006, in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 69."
Atmosphere of Mars
"The atmosphere of Mars is the layer of gases surrounding Mars. It is mainly made up of carbon dioxide. The average atmospheric pressure of the Martian surface (6.0 mbar) is much lower than that of the Earth (1,013 mbar). The pressure is well below the Armstrong limit, meaning that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body: 98.6 °F (36.6 °C)."
"The Martian atmosphere contains 96% carbon dioxide, 1.9% argon, 1.9% nitrogen, and traces of oxygen, carbon monoxide, water and methane, and so on. Ever since the discovery of methane in 2003, scientists say that this might indicate life. It has also been suggested that is may be caused by geochemical processes, volcanic or hydrothermal activity."
"The atmosphere of Mars is quite dusty, giving the Martian sky a light brown or orange-red color when seen from the surface. Data from NASA pointed out that the dust particles are 1.5 micrometres diameter."
"On 18 March 2015, NASA found an aurora that is not fully understood and an unexplained dust cloud in the atmosphere of Mars."
"Liquid water on Mars was once commonplace, which means the atmosphere was thicker. Many studies have found that the atmosphere of Mars has been weakened over time due to solar winds. On Earth, the magnetic field protects us from most of the wind. Mars used to have a magnetic field, but cooling of the core has resulted in the magnetic field being lost."
Solar Wind Composition Experiment
"The Solar Wind Composition Experiment (SWC) was an experiment that took place on the Moon during the Apollo program (Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16). It was done to measure the solar wind outside of Earth's magnetosphere. It was the first notable measurement of isotopic solar material."
The experiment was suggested by by a Swiss team headed by Johannes Geiss of the University of Bern and Peter Eberhardt of the Swiss Institute of Technology. It was partially funded by the Swiss Government.
"The SWC experiment was done by getting a aluminum sheet and facing it towards the sun. The foil was to collect the ion types and energies of the solar wind on the lunar surface. After the experiment, the sheet was placed into a Teflon bag, and sent back to Earth to be studied. The experiment was successful and found Helium, Neon and Argon isotopic compositions coming from the sun."

History.
"The islands were originally lived in by Caribbean Indians called Arawaks. By the time the first European explorers discovered the British Virgin Islands all of the Arawaks had left. The first Europeans to try and settle in the British Virgin Islands were the Dutch, but the English came soon after and the English and the Dutch settlers used to fight. The Spanish also claimed the islands, but no Spanish people ever tried to settle there. But the Spanish did attack the British and Dutch settlers."
In 1672 the British took control of the islands during a war against the Dutch and they have held on to them ever since.
"During the early years after European settlement the British Virgin Islands was a plantation economy which relied heavily upon slave labour. After slavery was abolished in the British Virgin Islands there was a long period of decline and many people left. Those who remained were mostly descended from African slaves, although many of them also left to try and find better lives elsewhere."

The head of Government in the British Virgin Islands is called the Premier, and he is in charge of a group of ministers of government which is called the Cabinet. Laws are passed by a group of elected politicians in the House of Assembly.

The same year (2003) Dizzee Rascal was stabbed in Ayia Napa. Some newspapers tried to link this to a conflict between Dizzee and a UK-based hip-hop group So Solid Crew.
"Dizzee has been described as ""the vital unvarnished voice of modern-day inner-city UK"", and a social element is usually present in most of his songs. However, Dizzee proves that social commentary does not have to be boring. There is often a funny element to his singing, and some might find this (very British) humour similar to that of Mike Skinner of The Streets."
"Altogether Southwest Alaska is 442,194 km² (170,732 mi²), slightly larger than California."
Demographics.
"Southwest Alaska had a population of about 53,000 people. This is less than 10% of all the people in Alaska. More than half of those people are Alaska Natives. About 121 towns and villages are in Southwest Alaska. A lot of them are very small and far away from other towns."
"Natives in Southwest Alaska are descended from different tribes, the Yupik, the Alutiiq, the Aleut and the Dena'ina Athabaskans."
"In modern times Alaska Natives are organized into corporations. The corporations have the job of speaking for the members. Four of the corporations are in Southwest Alaska, the Calista Corporation, the Bristol Bay Native Corporation, Koniag Incorporated, and the Aleut Corporation. Each one represents a different part of Southwest Alaska."
Economy.
"Most of the land in Southwest Alaska is owned by the Federal government, the State of Alaska, and the native corporations. There is not much of it that belongs to private persons."
"The economy in Southwest Alaska is based on three main things. Resource extraction, meaning the removal of natural things like wood, coal, or fish. Subsistence, meaning people who get their own food is another. The third is government spending."
"Fishing is important here. There are big boats that catch lots and lots of fish that end up in stores or in food made from fish. There are also lots of small boats where people fish for their own food or just for fun. A lot of the big boats are owned by people who don't live on Southwest Alaska. Kodiak and Unalaska are two of the most important fishing ports in the United States. They make a lot of money from catching salmon, trout, king crab, and halibut. Because so many of the big boats are owned by companies or people from outside Southwest Alaska most of the fish and the money they make from it does not stay in the area."
"Hunting and other tourism are some of the other important businesses in Southwest, but only for part of the year."
"There is also mining in Southwest Alaska. Most of the time they are looking for gold, platinum, or mercury. There is not a lot of mining but there are a lot of people who do not agree about it. One thing they don't agree on is the Pebble Mine, which would put a large open pit gold and copper mine near where a lot of the fish that are caught in Bristol Bay come from. Right now it is not allowed to drill for oil in Bristol Bay either, but some people in the government want to change that."
Wildlife.
"Southwest Alaska is one of the best places in the world to catch salmon. There are also lots of brown bears. They come to eat the salmon, as well as berries and other plants. Bear watching is a popular tourist attraction at Katmai National Park and Preserve. This area is also home to a number of caribou herds. More western Aleutian Islands have no mammals larger than a fox. In the summer, lots of birds fly up and make their nests on the tundra here. A lot of the Aleutian Islands have lots and lots of seabirds on them."
Transportation.
"There is no way to get to Southwest Alaska in a car. There are roads in the towns and some of them have roads going to another town, but there is not a road going into the area from anywhere else. Because of that people travel by boat or airplane in Southwest if they need to go a long way. The town of Bethel is a place where big boats will come from the ocean. When they get to Bethel their cargo is moved onto smaller boats that go up the rivers. There are many airports as well. Some of them are big enough that big jets can land there, but a lot of them are small. Snowmachines, also called Snowmobiles are used here a lot in the winter. When the rivers are frozen people use them like a road to drive to another town."

For example, a parent might make their own child sick in order to get attention and sympathy from friends and medical professionals."
Symptoms.
"People with Münchausen Syndrome exaggerate or create symptoms of mental or physical illness. Some people with Münchausen make up detailed stories about medical problems they have had, or they may fake symptoms. However, others may harm themselves in many different ways in order to make it seem like they are sick. For example, they might take laxatives to make it seem like they have diarrhea, or take blood-thinning medications to cause bleeding. They might inject themselves with bacteria so that they get an infection. They might cut or burn themselves in order to create wounds. Sometimes, after getting medical treatment, people with Münchausen also do things to slow down or prevent their recovery - for example, by ripping out stitches."
"The goal of this behavior is to get treatment, attention, sympathy, and comfort from medical professionals. For a person with Münchausen, being a patient feels familiar and comfortable. This meets a deep psychological need that the person has."

You can see multiple dimensions in this picture. Made in 1937 it shows how old Pablo Picasso would be now, though also how experienced he was then, being born in 1881. The level of experience it would take to be capable of such a level of geometric art work is surprisingly high considering there have been so many artists over the eras who have mastered it."

Name.
"The meaning of the name ""Emoinu Ahongbi"" (""ꯏꯃꯣꯢꯅꯨ ꯑꯍꯣꯡꯕꯤ"") can be found by splitting it up word by word. Here, ""E"" (""ꯏ"") refers to human being. ""Moi"" (""ꯃꯣꯢ"" or ""ꯃꯣꯏ"") refers to . ""Nu"" (""ꯅꯨ"") refers to female deity or goddess. So, ""Emoinu"" means ""goddess who rears the human beings"". ""Ahongbi"" means ""giver of plentiful household properties""."
Description.
Dr. Parratt described Emoinu Ahongbi (alias Emoinu Ahong Achaubi) as another form of Goddess Leimarel Sidabi. Leimarel Sidabi is the supreme mother. Imoinu is regarded as an ever resourceful lady. She always gives wealth and prosperity to the mankind. She was shown as having a human appearance. She resides near the fire hearth. The goddess is believed to be the controller and regulator of good conduct and behavior of the human beings.
"Imoinu Ahong Achaubi is a deity for good moral behavior, besides wealth and prosperity. As a social code of conduct, a Meitei woman should go out from home only after prayers and worship of the goddess and other household deities. When she returns home, she should pray to the deity."
"The Meitei people believed that goddess Imoinu lives in the houses of those who strictly obey her favorite social and moral behavior norms. Imoinu blesses such people with ""nungai yaifaba"" (well being and prosperity), ""watta padaba"" (having neither shortage nor excess), ""tekta kaidaba"" (unaffected by troubles of life) and ""punshi nungshangba"" (long life). These are the basic needs of life in the human world."
Mythology.
Origin.
"After the creation of the sky and the planets, Sidaba () (the Supreme Being) ordered His wife, Leimarel Sidabi () (the first woman) to produce another Leimarel. The second Leimarel would be the second woman. Her responsibility was to take care of the mankind on the planet called earth. Goddess Leimarel Sidabi obeyed her divine husband's order. She created another Leimarel. The appearance of the second Leimarel was similar to the first Leimarel. The first Leimarel named the second Leimarel as ""Emoinu Ahongbi""."
Lover.
"Once goddess Imoinu fell in love with a man. The two became lovers. They swore to be husband and wife. One day, she visited his house in his absence. She discovered that he was already married to another woman. After knowing this, she sacrificed her love. She swore on not to see the man again. She never married to anyone. So, she remained as a virgin goddess."

At times, the Pharisees were a political party, a social movement, and a school of thought. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, Pharisaic beliefs became the foundation for Rabbinic Judaism. The term 'Judaism' today almost always refers to Rabbinic Judaism."

Results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries
"This article will show the current results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The Democratic Party presidential primary is a process of choosing delegates, or people that represent someone, to go to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. People in each state will vote on who they think will be good for the presidency, and each candidate gets a certain amount of delegates based on the number of votes they receive."
The primaries began on 1 February 2016 in Iowa. The remaining candidates are former first lady and secretary of state and senator Hillary Clinton and senator Bernie Sanders.
"On June 6, 2016, the Associated Press reported that senator Hillary Clinton has gotten enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee. However, their count includes some superdelegates. Since superdelegates can vote however they want at the Democratic convention, their votes could change at any time before then, so it is possible (but only remotely possible) that Clinton will not get the nomination. Bernie Sanders endorsed Clinton on 12 July 2016."

Armenian calendar
"The Armenian calendar was the main calendar used in Armenia during the medieval period. The year in this calendar is exactly 365 days long, divided into twelve months of thirty days each, plus five extra days that are called ""aveleacʿ"" in the Armenian language, which are not a part of any month. The first year in the Armenian calendar is equal to the year 552 AD in the Gregorian calendar. This calendar was mainly used in the medieval era, but is also used in modern times by some Armenian nationalists."
"This calendar has no leap days. For that reason, it shifts backwards against the Gregorian calendar over a period of 1,461 years."
Months.

Simple Network Management Protocol
"Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a part of the Internet Protocol Suite. SNMP is used in network management systems to monitor status of devices and also spot problems. It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an Application Layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects."
"SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which describe the system configuration. These variables can then be queried (and sometimes set) by managing applications. It is a standard for managing devices such as routers,switches,servers etc."
Overview and basic concepts.
"In common SNMP usage, there are a number of systems to be managed, and one or more systems managing them. A software component called an ""agent"" (see below) runs on each managed system and reports information via SNMP to the managing systems."
"SNMP agents expose management data on the managed systems as variables (such as ""free memory"", ""system name"", ""number of running processes"", ""default route""). But the protocol also allows active management tasks, such as modifying and applying a new configuration."
"The managing system can retrieve the information through the GET, GETNEXT and GETBULK protocol operations or the agent will send data without being asked using TRAP or INFORM protocol operations. Management systems can also send configuration updates or controlling requests through the SET protocol operation to actively manage a system. Configuration and control operations are used only when changes are needed to the network. The monitoring operations are usually performed regularly."

Book of Enoch
"The Book of Enoch is a book claiming to be written by Enoch. He was the great-grandfather of Noah and son of Jared in the Bible. However, scholars consider it to be Pseudepigrapha. It is not part of the Bible canon and only the Ethiopian Orthodox Church says it is part of the Bible. The Book is an old Hebrew text, likely written in the 2nd century BC, and contains material on the origins of demons and giants, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why Noah's Flood was morally necessary, and a description of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah. It is interesting to many Christians because the ninth verse of the first chapter is quoted in the Epistle of Jude 1:14-15."
Anton LaVey
"Anton Szandor LaVey (April 11, 1930 – October 29, 1997), born Howard Stanton Levey, was the founder of the Church of Satan. He created a religion called LaVeyan Satanism. He wrote several books describing his beliefs. His first book was called ""The Satanic Bible"". He reported a dramatic life story, although some say he lied about his past."
Early life.
"LaVey was born Howard Stanton Levey in Chicago, Illinois to a Jewish family of Ukrainian descent. His family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area of California soon after he was born. He was talented with musical instruments, particularly the pipe organ and calliope. He read a lot. His biography says that he stopped going to high school to join the circus. When the carnival was not active, he played organ in burlesque houses. He then worked as a police photographer in San Francisco, though this has been questioned."
Church of Satan.
"In the 1960s, LaVey began giving lectures at his house to a group of people he called his ""Magic Circle."" A member of this Circle told him that his ideas could become a religion. He agreed, and founded the Church of Satan in 1966. In 1969, he published ""The Satanic Bible"". ""The Satanic Bible"" was a collection of writings he had published in the past years that outlined his philosophies and the basics of the religion. It was influenced by Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, and other authors and philosophers. In 1971, LaVey published ""The Compleat Witch"" (later released as ""The Satanic Witch""). ""The Satanic Witch"" was a manual of magic. In 1972, LaVey published ""The Satanic Rituals"". This contained instructions for performing rituals. In the 1990s, LaVey published two books of essays, ""The Devil's Notebook"" and ""Satan Speaks""."
Death.
"LaVey died on October 29, 1997. His death was caused by pulmonary edema (fluid in his lungs). This was brought on by his heart disease."
Hurricane Ike
"Hurricane Ike was one of the most damaging tropical cyclones in United States history, having caused about $38 billion dollars in damage. It was the sixth-costliest Atlantic hurricane in U.S. history. Hurricane Ike was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, third major hurricane and the most-intense hurricane of 2008 in terms of pressure. Ike may have caused up to 195 deaths. Most deaths happened in Haiti and the U.S. together. Haiti was still recovering from Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav, and Hurricane Hanna."
Storm history.
"The storm that eventually became Hurricane Ike started near the west coast of Africa on August 28. The storm grew quickly as it moved to the west-northwest. On September 1, the storm formed into Tropical Depression Nine when the storm was over the central Atlantic Ocean. Later that day Tropical Depression Nine became Tropical Storm Ike."
After the storm.
"In spring 2009, the name ""Ike"" was retired due to severe damage it caused, particularly in Texas. It was replaced by ""Isaias"" for the 2014 season."

"""Rolling Stone"" gave the album three out of five stars."
Euromaidan
"Euromaidan () was a period of demonstrations and civil unrest in Ukraine. It began on the night of 21 November 2013 with protests demanding that Ukraine become part of the European Union. On 30 November 2013 riot police attacked protestors, violently putting a stop to the protests. The protesters then demanded the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych. Many people were killed in the riots."
"Many people in Ukraine, particularly in the western part of the country, wanted to be part of the European Union. But President Yanukovych wanted to maintain close relationships with Russia. This angered pro-EU civilians. They started Euromaidan. On 30 November, the police intervened, sometimes violently. As a result, more people came out to protest. Many people blocked the streets with their cars in a protest called ""Automaidan""."
The President fled in February 2014 but protests continued. In March 2014 the Russian Federation captured Crimea which angered many other nations. Some people feared this might lead to a global war.
Riots/revolution.
"As the riots continued, the protesters were attacked. Hundreds were killed or injured. Ukrainians got the freedom they wanted and a new government, although they have not yet entered into the European Union. Meanwhile Ukraine lost Crimea to Russia."
"Russia did not like that the Ukrainian government was overthrown as the new more nationalist and anti-Russian government did not favor them. Some of the people in the east, in the Donbas, preferred the old President, and declared independence and wanted to join Russia. Many people in Ukraine, particularly in the east, suffered in fighting."

Carbapenem
"Carbapenems are a class of antibiotics which act against a wide range of bacteria. Their structure is difficult for bacterial enzymes to break down. They were originally developed from a product of ""Streptomyces cattleya""."
"Carbapenems are one of the ""antibiotics of last resort"" for many bacterial infections, such as ""Escherichia coli"" (""E. coli"") and ""Klebsiella pneumoniae""."
"Recently, alarm has been raised about an ""Indian superbug"". This is a strain resistant to Carapenems, which was discovered in Delhi. This strain produces an enzyme which chops up the antibiotic molecule."
"At present there are no new antibiotics in development to replace carbapenems. However, some older antibiotics may treat bacteria that are resistant to carbapenems."
French Wars of Religion
"The French Wars of Religion were a total of eight wars that were fought in France in the 16th century. between Catholics and Protestants (also known as ""Huguenots""). In all of the wars until 1585, the Catholics were supported by the French kings."
First war.
"The first war started in 1562, when the Protestant Prince of Condé, Louis de Bourbon, fled Paris with his supporters and captured the city of Orléans. His army was defeated by the Catholics at the Battle of Dreux in December, and the Catholics placed Orléans under siege. During the siege, a Huguenot killed the Catholic leader, Duke Francis of Guise. A peace treaty was signed in March, ending the first war."
Second war.
"The second war began in 1567, when the Prince of Condé tried to kidnap King Charles IX in an incident known as the ""Surprise at Meaux."" Condé put Paris under siege, but the Catholics attacked his army and defeated him. The Protestants and the Catholics raised large armies, but there were no more major battles. In March 1568, another peace treaty was signed."
Third war.
"The third war began in 1568, when Condé and his ally, Gaspard de Coligny, suspected that the Catholics would try to murder them. They went south and raised an army. A Catholic army, led by the king's brother, Henry of Valois, who would later become Henry III of France, attacked them and won a victory at Jarnac. At the Battle of Jarnac, Condé was captured and executed. Coligny, now the leader of the main Protestant army, fought another battle against the Catholics at Moncontour. This battle, one of the deadliest of the era, was another Protestant defeat. Many of the Protestants withdrew into the fortress town of Saint Jean d'Angély, and the Catholics besieged them there. While the Catholics besieged Saint Jean d'Angély and lost thousands of troops, Coligny joined forces with the Protestant Count of Montgomery and his army. The Protestants marched across France and, in June 1570, defeated the Catholics at the Battle of Arnay-le-Duc. The Catholics, running out of money, made a peace treaty with the Protestants."
Fourth war.
"In 1572, the fourth war broke out when the Catholics, led by Henry of Valois and Henry of Guise, the son of Duke Francis, who was killed during the first war, killed Coligny and thousands of other Protestants during the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Many Protestant survivors fled to La Rochelle, one of the main centres of Protestantism in France. The Catholic army put La Rochelle under siege but could not conquer the city. After losing thousands of soldiers, the Catholics agreed to a peace treaty. Between the fourth and the fifth wars, King Charles IX died, and his younger brother, Henry, became King Henry III."
"""Funeral Oration"" was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his ""History of the Peloponnesian War"". Thucydides records the speech as if every word in the record was what Pericles said. However, people agree he did, at least, correct or change the speeches a little. Thucydides says in his ""History"" that the speeches are not completely the same as what was really said, but written to show the main ideas of what was said. It is quite certain that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war. However, people are not sure how much Thucydides' record is the same as Pericles' actual speech."
"The Funeral Oration is important because the speech was different from usual Athenian funeral speeches. David Cartwright describes it as ""a eulogy (description) of Athens itself..."". The speech is about what great things Athens did, delivered to encourage the people."
Gettysburg Address and Pericles' funeral oration.
American Civil War scholar Garry Wills calls Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address the modern parallel to Pericles' Funeral Oration.
Gorgoneion
"In Ancient Greece, the Gorgoneion () was originally a magic pendant showing the Gorgon's head. (The use of magic against evil, or bad luck is generally called Apotropaism)."
"The gorgoneion was linked with the gods Zeus and Athena; both are said to have worn it as a pendant. It was also popular as a royal symbol, worn on shields and capes. These can be seen on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo."
Evolution.
"Homer wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions, but only about the head, as if the creature had no body. Jane Ellen Harrison notes that ""Medusa is a head and nothing more...a mask."" The body was added many years later. Up to the 5th century BC, the head was shown as being very ugly, with her tongue sticking out, boar tusks, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her."
"The direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. In some cases a beard, (probably representing streaks of blood) was added to her chin, making her appear as a wild and sexual god, like Dionysus."
"Gorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid-5th century Greek vases are not as ugly, strange or frightening. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized. The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman."
Usage.
"Gorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC. One of the earliest is on a coin found during an archaeological dig at Parium. Other early 8th-century examples were found at Tiryns. There is a similar image from the Knossos palace, dating from the 15th century BC. Marija Gimbutas even argues that ""the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates""."
"In the 6th century BC, gorgoneia of a basic type of ""lion mask"" were found all over Greek temples, especially in and around Corinth. Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily; probably the earliest one is in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse. Around 500 BC, they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings, but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles (antefix) of smaller buildings throughout the next century."
"As well as temples, the Gorgon image can be found on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast. The Gorgon coins were made in 37 cities, making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods. On mosaic floors, the gorgoneion was usually near the door, as if guarding it. On Attic kilns, a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents."
"The Gorgon image remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the Byzantine Empire, including Kievan Rus (now the Ukraine). The image was used in Western Europe by the Italian Renaissance artists. In the 20th century, the gorgoneion was used by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company."
Origin.
"Gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of the Mother Goddess cult linked to ""dynamic life energy"". She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image. Jane Ellen Harrison, on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks. These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at him."

"Many of George Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theaters in New York City. These comedies, with plenty of songs, were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s."
"One of Gershwin's musical plays, ""Girl Crazy,"" introduced a young singer named Ethel Merman. She became one of the most celebrated performers in America. In the play, Merman sang a song George Gershwin wrote just for her. It was called ""I Got Rhythm""."
"Many songs that George Gershwin wrote for musical plays and movies have remained as popular as ever. Over the years, they have been sung and played in every possible way—from jazz to country."
"One example is the song, ""Someone to Watch Over Me."" It was written for the 1926 musical ""Oh, Kay!"""
Jazz and his music.
"In the nineteen twenties, there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music?"
"In 1924, jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized how little time he had to do it. The concert was just a few weeks away. Gershwin got busy, and, in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra. He called it ""Rhapsody in Blue."""
"Gershwin himself played the piano part of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" at the concert. The audience included some of the greatest classical musicians of the time. When they heard his music, they were electrified. It seemed to capture, for the first time, the true voice of modern American culture. Today, we can still hear Gershwin playing ""Rhapsody in Blue."" An old mechanical piano recording Gershwin created has been reproduced exactly. There are also very early versions of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" which feature Gershwin playing the piano with Whiteman's orchestra. Those recordings, because they are early, do not sound like modern recordings. But they are recordings of Gershwin at the piano. This makes those recordings important."
"""Rhapsody in Blue"" made George Gershwin famous all over the world. Several hundred thousand copies of the printed music sold immediately. Gershwin was satisfied that he had shown that jazz music could be both serious and popular."
Musical works and opera.
"Gershwin also wrote an opera, ""Porgy and Bess. "" It was based on a book by DuBose Heyward. It is a tragic love story about black Americans along the coast of South Carolina."
"""Porgy And Bess"" opened in Boston, Massachusetts in 1935. Audiences loved it. But most critics did not know what to think of it. It was not like any other opera or musical play they had ever seen."
"Gershwin did not care about the critics' opinions. He believed some of his greatest music had gone into the opera. He said he had created a new musical form—an opera based on popular culture. Today ""Porgy And Bess"" is considered a masterpiece."
"Another well-known Gershwin piece is ""An American in Paris. "" It is a long tone poem for orchestra. Its first public performance was by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1928."
"Once again, opinion was mixed. Most people loved ""An American in Paris,"" as they loved all of Gershwin's music. Some critics liked it, too. They called it happy and full of life. Others hated it. They called it silly and long-winded."
Last days.
"George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He died while having surgery to remove the brain tumor. He was only thirty-eight years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. Everyone mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have written. Gershwin is still considered one of America's greatest composers. His works still are performed by many singers and groups. They are probably performed more often than any other serious American composer."
"Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg was one of the people who praised George Gershwin. Schoenberg said Gershwin was a man who lived in music and expressed everything through music, because music was his native language."
Aaron Copland
"Aaron Copland (, ; November 14, 1900December 2, 1990) was an American composer who wrote modern music."
"Aaron Copland wrote many kinds of music. He wrote music for the orchestra, piano, and voice. He wrote music for plays, movies, and dance. Copland also was a conductor, pianist, speaker, teacher, and writer."
Music critics say Copland taught Americans about themselves through his music. He used parts of many old American folksongs in his work. He wanted to do this after studying music in France. He said that composers there had a very French way of writing music. He said Americans had nothing like that in this country. So he decided to compose music that was truly American.
Early days of Copland.
"Aaron Copland was born November 14, 1900 in Brooklyn, New York. He died at the age of 90 on December 2, 1990. He was the youngest of five children. His parents had come to the United States from eastern Europe. They owned a store in Brooklyn. Aaron began playing the piano when he was a young child. He wrote his first song for his mother when he was eight years old. His dreams of becoming a composer began when he was young. When he was sixteen, he asked his parents to let him study composing with Rubin Goldmark. Goldmark had taught the composer George Gershwin."
"When he was in his early twenties, Copland went to Paris, France, where he studied music with Nadia Boulanger. She was one of the most important music teachers of the time. He returned to New York in 1924."
Known classical works.
"The famous conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky, learned about Copland's music. Koussevitzky led the orchestra for the first performance of Copland's early work, ""Music for the Theater"", in 1925. Koussevitzky also conducted Copland's ""Concerto for Piano and Orchestra"" in 1927. This work was unusual because Copland used ideas from jazz music in his concerto."
"Copland later wrote the music for two ballets about the American West. One was about the life of a famous gunfighter called Billy the Kid. Copland used music from American cowboy songs in this work. This piece from ""Billy the Kid: Ballet Suite"" is called ""Street in a Frontier Town""."
"In 1942, the conductor Andre Kostelanitz asked Copland to write music about a great American, Abraham Lincoln. Copland wrote ""Lincoln Portrait"" to honor America's 16th president. Copland's music included parts of American folk songs and songs popular during the American Civil War. He added words from President Lincoln's speeches and letters."
"""Lincoln Portrait"" has been performed many times in America. Many famous people have done the speaking part.Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was one of them. Here, actor James Earl Jones performs in Copland's ""Lincoln Portrait."""
"In 1942 the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra asked 18 composers to write music expressing love for America. For the competition, Copland composed ""Fanfare for the Common Man. "" This music is played in America during many national events, including some presidential inaugurations (when they become presidents)."
Legends.
The Moirang Shayon legends from the backbone of the Moirang Kangleirol.
"""Moirang Shayon"" (lit. ""Moirang incarnations"") is a genre of the seven incarnations of a God and a Goddess, induced under the direction of Lord Thangjing, in the ancient Moirang kingdom."
The list of the seven pairs of incarnations are:
Habutae
"Habutae is a type of silk. There are different kinds of ""habutae"" silk such as plain or striped ""habutae"". ""Habutae"" is traditionally used for kimono and undershirts. Recently, it is also used for general goods, works of art, and clothing. ""Habutae"" is smooth to touch, glossy, and soft. It has been said ""The quality of silk fabric begins with habutae and ends with it."" ""Fukui"" is a suitable region to produce ""habutae"" as the dryness and wetness of the air are well-balanced throughout the whole year."
History.
"In 1871, Kimimasa Yuri, who was a lord of ""Fukui"" Domain (region), brought some silk goods from Europe to Fukui when he joined a study tour in Europe. He showed the goods to people who studied silks in ""Fukui"" and they started doing technical research on weaving ""habutae"". In 1887, basic technology for weaving ""habutae"" silk was completed in ""Fukui"" city. The economic boom of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and World War I boosted progress and production of ""habutae"" in ""Fukui"". In the early 1900s, production of ""habutae"" in Fukui earned 1.7 million dollars, up to 60% of the total exports of ""habutae"" in Japan. The demand for ""habutae"" made in ""Fukui"" has kept increasing in Japan, and it is still used in many kinds of daily goods such as clothing."
Weaving Process.
"Most of the process of making Fukui ""habutae"" silk is the same as the process of making ""habutae"" in other areas, but the weaving process of Fukui ""habutae"" silk is different from the weaving process of ""habutae"" in other areas. Also, the weaving process is the most important part of making Fukui ""habutae"" silk. Fukui ""habutae"" silk is made in a process called ""nureyoko(濡れ横)"". ""Nureyoko"" is a weaving method of weaving warps and wefts which is the two basic components of weaving thread into fabric after wetting wefts with water. Threads are made from raw silks that are imported from other countries such as China and Brazil. This process makes the cloth tight, elastic, and strong. It takes one day to weave 20 meters of ""habutae""."

National Diet Building
"The National Diet Building (国会議事堂, Kokkai-gijidō) is the building where both houses of the Japan's government, the Diet, meet. It is located at Nagatachō 1-chome 7–1, Chiyoda, Tokyo."
Sessions of the House of Representatives take place in the left wing and sessions of the House of Councillors in the right wing.
"The Diet Building was completed in 1936 and is made of only Japanese materials, except for the stained glass, door locks, and pneumatic tube system."
History.
"Plans for a Diet building began in 1881. The planners hoped to finish it by 1890, when the Diet would meet for the first time. They realized they could not build a very impressive building in time, so they decided to make temporary buildings at first. The first Diet building was a Western-style building made of wood. It burned down in 1891. Another wooden building was made and finished in 1891. It burned down in 1925. A third building was made. The Diet used it until 1936, when the current Diet building was finished."
Current Diet building.
"In 1910, the Finance Ministry started a planning group to take control over the new Diet Building design from the Home Ministry. Prime Minister Katsura Tarō chaired the commission, which recommended that the new building should be made in the Italian Renaissance architectural style. Many other people did not like this idea."
"The ministry had a public design competition in 1918. 118 architect teams sent designs. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, produced a design similar to Ende and Böckmann's."
"The Diet Building was built between 1920 and 1936 with a floor plan based on Fukuzo's entry. The roof and tower of the building might have been inspired by another entrant, third prize winner Takeuchi Shinshichi, and are believed to have been chosen because they mixed European and East Asian architecture. The actual source for the ""Pyramid"" roof remains unclear, but Japanese historian Jonathan Reynolds suggests it might have come from from Shinshichi. Historian of Africa studies Zoe Strother says Shinshichi's design resembles the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which was a model for some prominent Western designs in the early 1900s, such as John Russell Pope's 1911 award-winning House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. and the downtown Los Angeles City Hall, completed in 1928."

Panthoibi Khongul
"Panthoibi Khongul ()(literally, ""in quest of Panthoibi"" or ""Panthoibi's footprint""), also spelt as Panthoipi Khongkul, is an ancient Meitei literary work (puya), narrating about the quest of goddess Panthoibi. The text highlights the love saga of Panthoibi and her ultimate lover Nongpok Ningthou, after leaving her husband's house. Many scholars believe the work to be written during the 12th century AD."
The text also talks about how the festival Lai Haraoba was begun after the union of the two lovers.

Chibbley.
"Chibbley was the ship's cat aboard the tall ship ""Picton Castle"". She was rescued from an animal shelter. She circumnavigated the world - sailed all the way around it - five times. Because ""Picton Castle""’ was a training ship, Chibbley had many visitors. She became a celebrity, and people even sent her fan mail. Chibbley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea."
Convoy.
"Convoy was the ship's cat aboard HMS ""Hermione"". He was named ""Convoy"" because he often went with the ship on convoy escort duties (where the ship would sail with a group of other ships for protection). Like the ship's sailors, Convoy was listed in the ship's book, and given a full kit, including a tiny hammock where he would sleep. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when ""Hermione"" was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by German submarine U-205."
Emmy.
"Emmy was the ship's cat on RMS ""Empress of Ireland"". She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy tried to escape the ship. The crew could not get her to return to the ship, and ""Empress of Ireland"" left without her. This was thought to be a very bad sign. Early the next morning, ""Empress of Ireland"" ran into SS ""Storstad"" while sailing through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. ""Empress of Ireland"" sank quickly, killing over 1,000 people."
Felix.
"Felix was the ship's cat aboard ""Mayflower II"" when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957. The goal of this voyage was to show cooperation between the UK and the US after World War II. Felix was given his own life jacket for the trip. During the voyage, he broke one of his paws. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. After Felix returned to the US, photos and stories about him appeared in ""National Geographic"" magazine, ""Life"" magazine, and ""Yankee"" magazine. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. Felix was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The captain of the Mayflower II wrote a children's book about Felix called ""Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures"". The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at Plimoth Plantation."
Mrs. Chippy.
"Mrs. Chippy was the ship's cat aboard ""Endurance"", the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. (The Expedition's goal was to cross the Antarctic by land.) After about a month, the crew realized that ""Mrs. Chippy"" was actually a male cat. However, by then, everyone was used to the name ""Mrs. Chippy,"" and kept using it."
"The ship became lost, trapped and then crushed in pack ice. At that point, Shackleton ordered his men to shoot the sled dogs and Mrs. Chippy, because he did not think they could survive."
Simon.
"Simon was the ship's cat of HMS ""Amethyst"" during the Yangtze Incident in 1949, during the Chinese Civil War. During the Yangtze Incident, the HMS ""Amethyst"" was attacked and was trapped on the Yangtze River for months. The ship and its crew were badly hurt in the attacks on the ship. These attacks killed 25 of ""Amethyst""’s crew, including the commanding officer. Simon was also hurt in the attacks, but soon he recovered. He started killing rats again, which was very important since the rodents had been destroying the ship. Simon also did the important job of keeping up the crew's spirits."
"After the ""Amethyst"" finally escaped the Yangtze River and returned to Britain, Simon was given the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon. He became a celebrity. However, not long after he returned to Britain, he died from an infection. Many people sent tributes to honor Simon, and his obituary appeared in ""The Times"" (an important newspaper in London). After Simon's death, he was awarded the Dickin Medal. He is the only cat ever to earn this award. Simon was also buried with full naval honors."
Trim.
"Trim sailed on many ships commanded by Matthew Flinders during 1801-1803. These ships' goals were to circumnavigate (sail all the way around) Australia, and also to create maps of its coastline. Trim became a favourite of the crew, and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. Trim stayed with Flinders until Trim's death. A statue to Trim was later built in his honor. It sits on a window sill on the outside of the State Library, in Sydney, Australia. There have also been many books written about Trim."
U-boat.
"U-boat was another ship's cat aboard a Royal Navy ship in the Second World War. Whenever his ship came into port, U-boat would take shore leave (he would leave the ship to do things on shore). He would spend days on shore, and usually would return only just before his ship sailed away. One day, U-boat did not return in time for roll call and his ship was forced to sail away without him. As the ship pulled away, U-boat was seen running down the dock after the sailing ship. He made a death-defying leap onto the ship and made it aboard. The crew thought that he seemed unafraid by what had just happened, and calmly started to wash himself on deck. The crew members were very happy that U-boat had come back, since they thought he brought them good luck."
Unsinkable Sam (Oscar).
"Oscar was the ship's cat of the German battleship ""Bismarck"". When ""Bismarck"" was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 sailors out of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer HMS ""Cossack"". ""Cossack"" herself was torpedoed and sunk on 24 October, 1941. 159 sailors were killed, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS ""Ark Royal"". Then this ship, too, was torpedoed and sunk in November of 1941. Oscar was again rescued, and it was decided that it was time for him to have a home on land. By now, Oscar had been renamed ""Unsinkable Sam."" He was given a new job as mouse-catcher in the Governor General of Gibraltar's office buildings. He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him hangs in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich."
Ship's cats today.
"Starting in 1975, the Royal Navy no longer allowed cats or any other pets to ride on any Royal Navy ships. This rule was created because of concern about hygiene (cleanliness)."
"Cats still ride on many private ships today. For example, ""Toolbox"" is a ship's cat who rides on the second ""Kalmar Nyckel""."
"American sailor Robin Lee Graham sailed with many cats on his ships ""Dove"" and ""Return of Dove"", while he was trying to circumnavigate the world by himself (starting in 1965)."
Calendula officinalis
"Calendula officinalis (pot marigold, ruddles, common marigold, garden marigold), is a plant in the genus ""Calendula"" of the family Asteraceae. It is probably native to India. It was the state flower of Junagadh and Bantva-Manavadar State, now part of Gujarat."
Uses.
Pot marigold florets are edible. They are often used to add colour to salads or added to dishes as a garnish instead of saffron.
The leaves are edible but are often not palatable. They have been used as a herb and in salads.
"The flowers were used in Ancient Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern, and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb and a dye for fabrics, foods, and cosmetics. They are also used to make oil that protects the skin."
African plate
"The African Plate is a major tectonic plate. It includes much of the continent of Africa, as well as the oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Since the continent of Africa includes the African Plate and the smaller plates to its right, some literature refers to the African Plate as the Nubian Plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole."
"Between 60 million years ago (mya) and 10 mya, the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift."
One hypothesis suggests a mantle plume beneath the Afar region. Another hypothesis suggests the rifting is just a zone of weakness as the plates to its east move northwards.
The African Plate's speed is about per year. It has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction. This is drawing it closer to the Eurasian Plate. There is subduction where oceanic crust meets continental crust (in parts of the central and eastern Mediterranean).
"Along its northeast margin, the African Plate is bounded by the Red Sea rift where the Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate."
"The African, Somali and Arabian Plates were once all part of the great southern supercontinent Gondwana, as was the Indian subcontinent."
OpenStep
"OpenStep was an operating system by NeXT. It is an x86 version of the NeXTStep operating system, which was also by NeXT."
Rhapsody (operating system)
"Rhapsody was the name given to Apple Computer's next-generation operating system. Apple got the Rhapsody operating system when they bought NeXT Inc. from Steve Jobs for $425 million. The same year Apple released Rhapsody to software developers so they could create versions of their software for the next release of the Apple operating system. But a key software vendor, Adobe Systems, did not like Apple's plan for the new OS. Without Adobe supporting them Apple decided not to go ahead with Rhapsody. Rhapsody was replaced by OS X, scheduled for 1999."
Palmchat
"The palmchat (""Dulus dominicus"") is a small passerine bird. It is the national bird of the Dominican Republic."
Arabian bustard
"The Arabian bustard (""Ardeotis arabs"") is a bird native to North Africa and the Middle East. It lives in the Sahel region (Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan), South Sudan, Kenya, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Saudi Arabia and Yemen."
"As in all bustards, the male Arabian bustard is much larger than the female. Males have been found to weigh , while females weigh . The record-sized male Arabian bustard weighed . These birds stand from tall in females to tall in males."
National Bohemian
"National Bohemian Beer is an American beer first made in Baltimore, Maryland. It is a premium Bohemian-style beer. Many people call it ""Natty Boh"" as a nickname."
History.
"In 1885, the National Brewing Company created National Bohemian beer. The first factory was in Baltimore, Maryland. The brewing stopped from 1920 to 1933 due to Prohibition. This was the period when nobody could drink alcohol in the US. In 1933 under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the factory of Natty Boh opened again. During the 1940s the factory of National Bohemian was the first in the US to adopt the six pack. In the 1970s, the Hoffberger family sold the brand name. During the next three decades, the brand of this beer was bought and sold by different companies. The copyright of the beer was purchased first by Stroh, then by G. Heileman Brewing, and then by Pabst, in 1999. Since the Hoffberger family sold the beer it has been brewed in North Carolina. From 1996 until 2011, National Bohemian wasn’t available directly from the bar, but only by cans or bottles. In 2014, an American citizen born in Russia, Eugene Kashper, bought the entire Pabst Company, so also National Bohemian."
Relationship with Baltimore.
"Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger, Natty Boh was first associated with the city of Baltimore. In 1953, Jerold Hoffberger helped to bring the St. Louis Browns to Baltimore where they became the Baltimore Orioles. He made National Bohemian the main sponsor of the baseball team. About twelve years later Hoffberger bought the team. Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the Orioles won two World Series and four American League pennants. Nattty Boh was served at the stadium. This was the period when National Bohemian became the beer of Baltimore because people identified the Orioles’ wins with the beer. Although the beer is not brewed in Maryland anymore, 95% of sales are still in Baltimore. This is why is it called ""the beer of Maryland""."
Mr. Boh.
"In 1933, the logo of this beer, Mr. Boh, was introduced. Mr. Boh is a one-eyed man with a black mustache. Thanks to the popularity achieved by National Bohemian with the Orioles, Mr. Boh became a symbol of Baltimore. His big face is still visible at the top of the old building where it was once brewed. Through the years, people started collecting gadgets with the logo of National Bohemian. Around Baltimore, several pubs serve Natty Boh as the main beer. These pubs are decorated with different gadgets of Mr. Boh."

The China Syndrome
"The China Syndrome is a disaster movie about a near-meltdown at a nuclear power plant. It was released on March 16, 1979, twelve days before the Three Mile Island accident. The term ""China syndrome"" refers to a scenario, not meant to be taken literally, where a reactor core could melt through the Earth ""all the way to China""."
Plot summary.
"News reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are filming a special on nuclear power at the (fictional) Ventana Nuclear Power Plant when they witness an earthquake followed by a reactor scram. In the control room, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) notices that the water level is high and asks another member of the crew to open a relief valve. Ted Spindler (Wilford Brimley) warns him that regulations do not permit opening the relief valve, but he proceeds to open it anyway. The control room crew then notices that the water level is actually dangerously low, and declare an emergency over the intercom ordering all personnel to safety areas. They manage to bring the water level back up to a safe level, meanwhile, Richard secretly films the incident. Richard wants to show the film on television, but the station manager will not allow it. Richard then steals the film and shows it to a group of nuclear engineers who determine that the plant came very close to the China syndrome, where the core would have melted through its containment and down into the Earth, contaminating a large area. Meanwhile, Jack Godell discovers that the welds on the main pump are not safe, and takes over the plant by force, locks himself in the control room, and demands to be interviewed on television. A SWAT team is called in, and proceeds to break into the control room. The other members of the control room crew cut wires in other areas of the plant to intentionally cause a scram. When the scram begins, the main pump fails, and Jack Godell is shot by the SWAT team."
Response of the nuclear power industry.
"Upon its release, the movie was criticized by the nuclear power industry, referring to the movie as ""sheer fiction"" and a ""character assassination of an entire industry"". Twelve days after the movie was released, however, the Three Mile Island accident occurred in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. Both the accident depicted in the movie and the real-world accident at Three Mile Island involved loss of water through a relief valve, as well as the control room crew incorrectly reading water levels."
Flag of Aruba
"Aruba's national flag () was adopted on March 18, 1976. The flag has a field of light blue (called ""Larkspur""), two narrow parallel horizontal yellow (""Bunting Yellow"") stripes in the bottom half, and a four-pointed white-fimbriated red (""Union Flag red"") star in the canton."
Flag of Curaçao

Gusinje
"Gusinje (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Гусиње, ), is a small town and municipality in north-eastern Montenegro. In 2011, it has a population of 4,027 people. The town is located in a very thin valley and it is surrounded by mountains. This is due to its location in the Plav-Gusinje valley. The majority of the population are Muslim and profess Islam. It has a mixed population of Muslim Bosniaks and Muslim Albanians. Both of these ethnicities however, live in peace and coexist with eachother."
Name.
"The name ""Gusinje"" (Гусиње) is derived from ""guska"" (goose). Its older name was ""Gousino"" (Гоусино). In the Ottoman period, it was known as Turkish ""Gusna"" (گوسن). In Albanian, it is known as ""Gucia""."

Andes
The Andes are a mountain range along the western coast of South America.
"They stretch over 7,000 km / 4,400 miles from the south of Argentina and Chile to the north of Colombia. They are also found in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador."
The Amazon river system has its sources in the eastern flanks of the Andes.
"The Andes are the longest exposed mountain range of the world, and the second-highest after the Himalayas. The Andes mountain range is the highest mountain range outside Asia."
"Aconcagua, the highest peak, rises to 6,962 m (22,841 ft) above sea level. The top of Mount Chimborazo in the Ecuadorean Andes is the point on the Earth's surface most distant from its center. Mount Chimborazo is an inactive volcano in Ecuador, which last erupted over a thousand years ago."
Geography.
The Andes has three sections:
"The northern part has two parallel ranges. They are the ""Cordillera Occidental"" (western) and the ""Cordillera Oriental"" (eastern). The term ""cordillera"" comes from the Spanish word meaning 'rope'."
"In Colombia, north to the border with Ecuador, the Andes split in three parallel ranges, western, central and eastern."
"In the north the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Snowy Mountain Range of Saint Martha) is an isolated mountain range apart from the Andes chain that runs through Colombia. Reaching an altitude of 5,700 metres above sea level just 42 km from the Caribbean coast, the Sierra Nevada is the world's highest coastal range."
The western range of the eastern Cordillia Oriental is the only one which reaches Colombia .
"The Andes range is about wide throughout its length, except in Bolivia where it is wide. The islands of the Dutch Caribbean Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, which lie in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela, represent the submerged tops of the northern edge of the Andes range."
Geology.
The Andes are a Mesozoic–Tertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the Pacific Ring of Fire.
"The Andes are the result of plate tectonics processes, caused by the subduction of oceanic crust beneath the South American continental plate. South America, like North America, has been moving west since the Cretaceous period. Thus the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate formed the Andes. This was caused by the westward movement of South America."
"The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the Triassic and Jurassic when Pangea begun to break up and several rifts developed. It was during the Cretaceous period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the uplifting, faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rock of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant and different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and weathering."
Climate.
"The climate in the Andes differs depending on which area, the altitude, and how close it is to the sea. The southern section is rainy and cool. The central Andes are dry. The northern Andes are normally rainy and warm, with an average temperature of in Colombia. The climate is known to change very much in rather short distances. Rainforests exist just miles away from the snow covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The snow line depends on the location. It is at between 4,500 and 4,800 m (14,800–15,800 ft) in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, going up to 4,800–5,200 m (15,800–17,060 ft) in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30°S, then going down to on Aconcagua at 32°S, at 40°S, at 50°S, and only in Tierra del Fuego at 55°S; from 50°S, many of the bigger glaciers go down to sea level."
The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be put in two climatic and glaciological zones; the Dry Andes and the Wet Andes.
Plants.
"Rainforests used to hold much of the northern Andes but are now reduced, especially in the Chocó and inter-Andean valleys of Colombia. Farming, deforestation, illegal crops, and population growth has done this."
"A direct opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the mostly dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. That area, and many Interandean Valles, normally have deciduous woodland, shrub and xeric (dry) vegetation, up to the mostly lifeless Atacama Desert."
"About 30,000 species of vascular plants live in the Andes. About half of those are endemic to the region: it is a hotspot. The small tree ""Cinchona pubescens"" is a source of quinine used to treat malaria. It is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that came from the Andes are tobacco and potatoes."

It is purported to be a rare disorder."

"Fall into Darkness is a 1996 American television thriller movie directed by Mark Sobel and was based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Pike. It stars Tatyana Ali, Charlotte Ross, Jonathan Brandis, Paul Scherrer, Sean Murray and aired on NBC."
"At first Frederick William tried to follow a policy of neutrality in the Napoleonic Wars. But in the end he entered into war in October 1806. On 14 October 1806, at the Battle of Jena-Auerstädt, the French defeated the Prussian army, and it collapsed. The royal family fled to East Prussia, where Emperor Alexander I of Russia (who, rumour has it, had fallen in love with Queen Louise) helped them against Napoleon."
"But Alexander was defeated as well. At Tilsit France made peace with Russia and Prussia. Napoleon dealt with Prussia very harshly, Prussia lost many of its Polish territories, as well as all territory west of the Elbe, and had to pay for French troops that occupied Prussia."
"Although Frederick William himself resigned to Prussia's fate, his ministers set about a reform of Prussia's administration and military."
After Napoleon's defeat in Russia (1813) Frederick William turned against France and signed an alliance with Russia. Prussian troops played a key part in the victories of the allies in 1813 and 1814.
"At the Congress of Vienna, Frederick William's ministers succeeded in securing important territorial increases for Prussia. After the war, Frederick William did not keep the promises he had made in 1813 to supply Prussia with a constitution."
"He died on 7 June 1840. His eldest son, Frederick William IV, succeeded him."
Population growth
"Population growth is the rate at which a population grows or expands. For example, if a population increased from 100 to 110 in a year, then it would have had a population growth of 10% per year."
World population.
"World population has been rising since the end of the Black Death, around the year 1350."
"Population began growing rapidly in the Western world during the industrial revolution. Several factors were notable: the coming of modern agriculture, and the control of epidemic diseases (black death, cholera, typhus). Modern water engineering brought clean water to many large cities. Deaths from world wars, especially WWI, reversed the trend, but only for a while."
"The most significant increase in the world's population has been since the 1950s in Asia and Latin America. Medical advances, and increases in farming, have been the main causes."
"A single example is both astonishing and revealing. Since 1945, half the forests of Indonesia have been replaced with farmland. As late as 1900, Indonesia was still a densely forested country: forests covered 84 percent of the total land area. Deforestation became serious in the 1970s, and has gone faster since then. About 170 million hectares (estimated in 1900) decreased to less than 100 million hectares by the end of the 20th century. In 2008, it was estimated that tropical rainforests in Indonesia would be logged out in a decade. Of the total logging in Indonesia, up to 80% is said to be done illegally."

History.
19th century.
"Olathe was created by Dr. John T. Barton in Spring 1857. He came to the center of Johnson County, Kansas. He later told about his ride to friends: ""...the prairie was covered with verbena and other wild flowers. I kept thinking the land was beautiful and that I should name the town Beautiful."" Purportedly, Barton asked a Shawnee interpreter how to say ""Beautiful"" in his native language. The interpreter responded, ""Olathe."""
"Olathe was incorporated in 1857. It was not the first city in Johnson County. Because it grew very quickly, it became the county seat in October 1859. Growing hatred across the United States about the issue of slavery led to many fights between abolitionist settlers and nearby slave state Missouri. These fights would grow, and they would become a part of the bigger fight known as Bleeding Kansas. When Kansas became a state in 1861, it was a free state. When it became a state, violence stopped. Peace, however, would continue to elude Olathe for many years to come. In 1861 Union officials and local military forces created a military post in the city. It had one company of soldiers, and it had the local militia."
"On September 6, 1862, William Quantrill led guerrilla Confederate soldiers in an attack against Olathe. A half dozen people died, and most of the city was destroyed. Quantrill captured the outpost, and he tried forcing the men to fight for the Confederacy. Kansas militia continued to stay in the Olathe military post for the rest of the Civil War."
"Confederate soldiers would try to attack Olathe two more times. The first time happened on August 20–21, 1863 as Quantrill was going through on his way to Lawrence, Kansas (see Lawrence Massacre). The second raid happened on October 24-5, 1864, when Confederate Major General Sterling Price with 10,000 men went through on their retreat South (see Price's Raid)."
"When the Confederates surrendered, the military post was ended in August 1865."
21st century.
"In 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau said Olathe was the 24th fastest-growing city in the United States. The same year, CNN/Money and ""Money"" magazine said Olathe was #11 on its list of the ""100 Best Cities to Live in the United States."""
"On February 22, 2017, Adam Purinton said racial things and shot at crowded Austins Bar and Grill in southern Olathe. He shot and injured three people. One person died. The victims were Alok Madasani, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, and Ian Grillot. Purinton was later arrested in Clinton, Missouri. He was charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. This shooting got international attention because two of the victims were Indian."

Vichy France
"The Vichy France or the French State was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine. It also governed the French colonial empire. It was led by Philippe Pétain, notable for helping to win World War I. When the French and British armies lost the Battle of Dunkirk and the rest of the Battle of France was being lost, the French Parliament made him Prime Minister. He negotiated an armistice with the Germans, agreeing to be neutral in World War II. Pétain became Head of State, effectively dictator, and usually did what the Germans told him to do."
"The Axis powers militarily occupied northern France and part of the southeast. The Vichy government, as a client state of Germany, controlled the ""Free Zone"" or unoccupied parts of France until November1942. The German army ran the Northern half. In 1944, the Vichy government, now effectively a puppet state, moved to Nazi Germany, and later disbanded. It became known as Vichy France after World War II."
Anguilla
Anguilla is a group of five islands in the Caribbean Sea. The islands are ruled by the United Kingdom.
"Anguilla was colonized by the British Empire and used to be part of what is now Saint Kitts and Nevis, but broke away in 1980 so it could stay part of Great Britain. Saint Kitts and Nevis wanted to be independent."
"It is named after the Spanish word for ""eel"", because it has such a shape."
Anguilla was first settled by Arawakan-speaking Indians who called it Malliouhana.
Politics.
"The King or Queen of the United Kingdom is the ruler of Anguilla, but she works through a governor. He or she names, or ""appoints"" the governor, and he is just working there in place of the monarch. The legislature is elected by the people, has 11 members, and is called the House of Assembly."
Economy.
"Anguilla has mostly been part of the British Empire since the 17th century. The British brought thousands of slaves from Africa and forced them to work, like they did all over the Caribbean and North America. Many of the slaves decided to run away rather than be forced to work. When the British decided to abolish slavery they paid all the slave owners a lot of money, but didn't give anything to the slaves. Now Anguilla gets most of its money from fishing and tourism."
Culture.
"Most people in Anguilla are Protestants, and speak English."

"Off the east coast of the United States, Bermuda's nearest landmass is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, about 1,030 kilometres (640 mi) to the west-northwest. It is about 1,373 kilometres (853 mi) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and 1,770 kilometres (1,100 mi) northeast of Miami, Florida. Its capital city is Hamilton."
History.
"in 1505 by Spanish navigator Juan de Bermúdez (who said it to be inhabited only with pigs), after whom the islands are named. Bermúdez claimed it for the Spanish Empire. Unoccupied, the island was settled by England in 1609, making it the oldest and most populous remaining British overseas territory. Its first capital, St George's, was founded in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the Americas."
Geography.
"The country is in the Atlantic Ocean, near the western edge of the Sargasso Sea. It is about 580 nautical miles (1070 km, 670 mi) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and about 590 nautical miles (1100 km, 690 mi) southeast of Martha's Vineyard. The island is due east of Fripp Island, South Carolina. It has 103 km (64 mi) of coastline."
"The territory has 181 islands. The total area is 53.3 square kilometres (20.6 sq mi). The largest island is ""Main Island"", sometimes itself called ""Bermuda""."
Climate.
"Bermuda has a subtropical climate. The weather is humid and, as a result, the summertime heat index can be high, even though mid-August temperatures rarely exceed Winters are mild, with average daytime temperatures in January and February around The temperature rarely drops below 10 °C"
Bermuda is very likely to be affected by hurricanes. The island's small size means that direct landfalls are rare. The last hurricane to cause significant damage to Bermuda was category 3 Hurricane Fabian on 5 September 2003.
The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall. It is collected on roofs and catchments and stored in tanks. Each home usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation.
Flora and fauna.
"When discovered, Bermuda had no people. It was mostly covered by forests of Bermuda cedar, with mangrove marshes along its shores. Only 165 of the island's current 1000 vascular plant species are considered native. Of those 15, including the cedar, are endemic."
"Many species of palm trees have been introduced to Bermuda. Coconut palms grow there, making it the furthest north place for the natural growth of this species. While coconuts grow on Bermuda, the lack of heat does not usually let them properly set fruit."
"The only indigenous mammals of Bermuda are five species of bats. All of these bats are also in the eastern United States — ""Lasionycteris noctivagans"", ""Lasiurus borealis"", ""Lasiurus cinereus"", ""Lasiurus seminolus"" and ""Perimyotis subflavus"". Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda includes its national bird, the Bermuda Petrel, and the Bermuda Rock Skink. The skink was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda. It has recently been discovered, however, that a species of terrapin predated the arrival of humans on the archipelago."

The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)
"The Sleeping Beauty is a ballet in a prologue and three acts. Marius Petipa and Ivan Vsevolozhsky wrote the story of the ballet. It was based on Charles Perrault's 1697 fairy tale ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"". Tchaikovsky wrote the music. Marius Petipa designed the dances. ""The Sleeping Beauty"" was first presented at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 15 January 1890. Carlotta Brianza danced the Princess and Pavel Gerdt the Prince, with Marie Petipa as the Lilac Fairy and Enrico Cecchetti as Carabosse. It was first presented in Europe in a shortened version by the Ballets Russes in London on 2 November 1921. Catherine Littlefield designed the first complete ""Sleeping Beauty"" in the United States, and presented the production on 12 February 1937 at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, with the Philadelphia Ballet."
Background.
"About ten years after Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"" was presented for the first time, Tchaikovsky was asked to write a ballet for the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. The ballet would be based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"". Tchaikovsky was very happy this story had been chosen. It was set in the age of Louis XIV. He would have the chance to write music in the Baroque style."
"Petipa gave Tchaikovsky very special directions about tempi, meter, and other musical matters. He even specified the length of particular pieces in exact numbers of bars. He asked for a Waltz in Act 1, a Mazurka in Act 2, and a Polonaise in Act 3. The ballet is tied together (and its drama and suspense heightened) through the repeated use of the two musical themes representing good and evil, personified by the Lilac Fairy and Carabosse respectively. Petipa's specifications stimulated Tchaikovsky's imagination, rather than hindered it as one might expect."
"Tchaikovsky's interest in setting the tale reaches back to 1867. It was then that he wrote a little ballet on the story for the children of his sister Alexandra Davydova. He had done the same for ""Swan Lake"". In November 1888, he had a conference with theater officials and Petipa. A draft of the scenario was drawn up. Petipa provided Tchaikovsky with a detailed analysis of the musical requirements. The composer set to work, and finished the score on 1 September 1889."
Story.
Prologue.
"A brief overture contrasts the themes of the malicious Carabosse and the benevolent Lilac Fairy. When the curtain rises, the court assembles for Princess Aurora's christening. Six fairies present their gifts. Carabosse, a fairy overlooked by the master of ceremonies, enters. She curses Aurora. The Princess shall die on her 16th birthday, she says, after pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel. The remaining seventh fairy the Lilac Fairy comes forward. She cannot put the curse to rest, but she can soften it. The Princess shall not die, she commands, but sleep one hundred years. At the end of that term, a Prince will awaken her with true love's kiss."
Act 1.
"Sixteen years after the christening of Princess Aurora, the court assembles in the palace gardens to celebrate Aurora's birthday. Villagers dance a waltz. Aurora dances an adagio with four noble suitors. Carabosse enters unnoticed and slips Aurora a spindle. The Princess pricks her finger on the spindle. She falls to the ground, sound asleep. The Princess is carried into the palace by the noble suitors. The Lilac Fairy puts the entire court to sleep, then causes a dense forest of trees and thorns to surround the castle."
Act 2.
"""Scene 1."" ""The Prince's hunt. A woodland glade with a river in the background."" The stage is empty. Hunting horns are heard. Prince Desire, his tutor Galifron, and his friends enter. They have paused in the hunt to take refreshments. Several dances are performed by various ladies of the court. The hunt is resumed. The Prince is tired so chooses to remain alone in the forest. Here, he meets the Lilac Fairy who emerges from a boat of mother of pearl on the river. She has chosen him as the prince to awaken princess Aurora, and presents various visions of the princess to him. He quickly falls in love with her from the visions and begs the Lilac Fairy to lead him to her. The Lilac Fairy guides him through the forest until they reach the enchanted castle where Aurora rests."
"""Scene 2."" ""Sleeping Beauty's castle."" The Sleeping Beauty lies on a canopied bed. The King and Queen sleep in armchairs nearby. The courtiers and pages sleep standing up and leaning upon one another. Dust and cobwebs cover everything. The Lilac Fairy and the Prince enter. He tries to rouse the Princess and the court, but without success. The Lilac Fairy stands aside without interfering. The Prince kisses the Princess. She awakens. The dust and cobwebs disappear. The court awakens. The King grants the marriage of the Prince and Princess."
Act 3.
"""The Wedding of Prince Désiré and Princess Aurora on the esplanade of King Florestan's palace."""
"The court assembles to celebrate the marriage of Prince Désiré and Princess Aurora. The King and Queen make their entrances with the newlyweds. The festivities begin with a series of ""divertissements"". The Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Sapphire Fairies dance. Several fairy tale characters dance: Puss in Boots and the White Cat; the Bluebird and Princess Florine; Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf; Cinderella and Prince Fortuné; and finally Hop o' My Thumb with his brothers and the ogre. The Prince and Princess dance a ""pas de deux"". Roman, Persian, Indian, American, and Turkish characters dance a Sarabande. The act ends with a ""tableau vivant"" representing the Glory of the Fairies. This ""tableau"" was changed to represent the Glory of Apollo."
Human settlement
"In archaeology, geography, and history, a human settlement is a place where people live, either permanently (all the time) or temporarily (only some of the time). When people go to an area to live there, it is called settling an area. When they come from far away it is sometimes called a colony. The term may include hamlets, suburbs, towns and cities. Nomadic people do not settle."
Microtia
"Microtia meaning 'small ear' is a deformation of the outer ear. Over 90% of the time, only one ear is affected, but both ears can be affected. More boys are affected than girls. The right ear is more affected than the left. One in 1000 people have microtia. It can affect hearing. There are four grades of microtia:"
"Grade III is most common, and can be corrected by surgery."
"Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed region in the South Caucasus. Legally, it is recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but from 1994 until the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, most of it was militarily controlled by Armenians as the Republic of Artsakh, which is not officially recognized by any other country, including Armenia which supports it. Currently, different parts of the region are controlled by both Azerbaijan and Armenia, with Azerbaijan controlling most of it and Armenia controlling a smaller central area."
Etymology.
"The names for the region in the different local languages all translate to ""mountainous Karabakh"", or ""mountainous black garden"". The word ""nagorno"" is Russian for ""mountainous/on the mountain"", ""kara"" is Turkish for ""black"", and ""bakh"" means ""garden"" in Azerbaijani."
History.
"The region became a subject of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1918 when both states gained brief independence. Two years later, Soviet Union conquered both of the new states and created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast within Azerbaijan."
"When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in Moscow and started campaigns of publicity and democratic reforms at the end of the 20th century, Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh sent letters to Gorbachev demanding him to move the autonomous oblast to the control of Armenia. When it was declined, the Armenians started an independence movement."
"In November 1991, seeking to stop this movement, the Parliament of Azerbaijan abolished the autonomous status of the region. In response, the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians held a referendum on December 10, 1991, which was boycotted by Azerbaijanis living in Nagorno-Karabakh and none of them participated in it, therefore the overwhelming majority of the population voted for independence."
Newcastle upon Tyne
"Newcastle upon Tyne is a city in north-east England. About 250,000 people live in the city, though more live in the area around it."
Newcastle upon Tyne is called Newcastle for short. It is famous for its big bridge called the Tyne Bridge.
"The local dialect and accent is called the ""Geordie"" dialect. People from Newcastle are also called Geordies. Pronunciation of ""alright"" is ""areet"", ""town"" is ""toon"" and ""house"" is ""hoos""."

Satyr play
"Satyr plays were an ancient Greek form of theatre, similar in spirit to burlesque. They featured choruses of satyrs, were based on Greek mythology, and were rife with mock drunkenness, brazen sexuality (including phallic props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment."
Premier League
"The Premier League, commonly known as the English Premier League, or the EPL (formerly called the Barclays Premier League due to sponsorship reasons and before 2007 the Premiership) is the top tier of English football. 20 teams compete in the Premier League each season, which is usually played between August and May. Each season, 38 games are played (playing all 19 other teams home and away). For historic reasons, a few clubs from Wales also compete in the English football system."
"The competition started in 1992, after 22 clubs from the Football League First Division decided to break away from The Football League (now the EFL). The Premier League has since become the world's most watched sporting league. It is the world's most lucrative football league, with combined club revenues of £1.93 billion ($3.15bn) in 2007–08. It is also ranked second by UEFA's Association Ranking, behind La Liga."
2022–23 season.

"They are made from sweet yeast dough fried in fat or oil, with a marmalade or jam filling and usually icing, powdered sugar or conventional sugar on top. They are sometimes made with chocolate, champagne, custard, mocha, or ""advocaat"" filling, or with no filling at all. The filling is injected with a large syringe after the pastry is fried."
Naming.
"The name of the doughnut is different in various areas of Germany. Most areas in German speaking regions call it a ""Berliner"". Residents of Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony often know them as ""Pfannkuchen"", which in the rest of Germany generally means pancakes - pancakes are known there as ""Eierkuchen"" (lit. egg cakes). In parts of southern and central Germany (Bavaria), as well as in much of Austria, they are a variety of ""Krapfen""; in Hessen they are referred to as ""Kräppel"" or ""Kreppel"", or, in Palatinate, ""Fastnachtsküchelchen"" (literally: ""little carnival cakes"")."
"In South Tirol, part of northern Italy, the food is called ""krafen"" or ""krapfen"". In Slovenia, it is ""krof""; in Croatia ""krafne""; in Bosnia, and Serbia ""krofne"". In Poland they are known as ""pączki"", in the Czech Republic as kobliha. In Hungary, it is called ""fánk"". All of these are essentially identical preparations. In Spain it is called ""Berlinesa"". In the Netherlands it is called ""Berlinerbol"". IN France it is called ""Boule de Berlin""."
"In English-speaking countries, Berliners are often called doughnuts and are usually filled with jam, jelly, custard or whipped cream. However, in South Australia, the Kitchener bun is a Berliner cut on the side for the filling of jam and cream. In Anglophone North America, the most common term for the jam- or jelly-filled pastry is ""jelly doughnut"". The name is somewhat misleading, since the jam or jelly used is specially made with less pectin, so that it does not ""set"" like jams and jellies manufactured for table use but has a consistency comparable to Bavarian cream."
The cream or custard-filled variety usually also feature chocolate icing and are sometimes called Bavarian cream or Boston cream doughnuts (the latter name from its resemblance to Boston cream pie). The Boston cream doughnut has been designated the official state doughnut of Massachusetts.
"In Ontario and the prairie western provinces of Canada, as well as parts of the Midwest in the U.S., such a round jelly- or custard-filled doughnut is commonly called a ""Bismarck,"" while a filled bar doughnut is called a ""Long John"", and usually contains pastry creme, custard or whipped cream but can contain a jelly filling. Other Canadian terms include ""jambuster"" in Manitoba, and ""Burlington bun"" in Nova Scotia."
New Year's Eve.
"Berliners are traditionally eaten to celebrate on New Year's Eve (""Silvester"") as well as the carnival holidays (Mardi Gras). A common German practical joke is to secretly fill some Berliners with mustard instead of jam and serve them together with regular Berliners without telling anyone."
Variations.
"In Portugal, berliners are slightly bigger than their German counterparts. They are known as ""bolas de Berlim"" (Berlin ball) and the filling is always an egg-yolk- based yellow cream called ""creme pasteleiro"" (lit. confectioner's cream). The filling is inserted after a half- length cut and is always visible. Regular sugar is used to sprinkle on it. They can be found in almost every pastry shop in the country."
"Such versions are also found in Latin America, in Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, where it's not only filled with custard (called ""Crema pastelera""), but with jam (especially red ones) or manjar blanco. In Brazil, berliners are called ""sonhos"" (dreams) and traditionally filled with yellow cream (called simply ""creme""). Some modern variants filled with ""doce de leite"" (a type of milk jam), or a mix of chocolate and ""doce de leite"", can be found in Rio de Janeiro's bakeries."
"In Israel, a version of the pastry called ""sufganiyah"" is traditionally eaten during the holiday of Hanukkah. While sufganiyot are usually filled with jam, many modern variants exist."

"John ""Johnny Appleseed"" Chapman (September 26, 1774 - March 11, 1847) is an American folk hero. He was a Christian missionary and pioneer. His nickname came from the fact that he planted apple trees throughout the American Midwest. Many people consider him an early conservationist or ""tree-hugger"". He wandered the country, usually barefoot, and with a cooking pot on his head for most of his adult life, planting apple trees, teaching the Bible, telling stories, and befriending Native Americans, wild animals, and other settlers. Many stories have been told about him and his journeys, as well as art, books, and later movies, which makes him a folk hero. He was born in Leominster, Massachusetts and is buried in Johnny Appleseed Park in Fort Wayne, Indiana."
Facts.
"John Chapman is said to have been in the Wilkes-Barre region some time in the 1790s, practicing his profession as a nurseryman, but just when he embraced the Swedenborgian faith and began his missionary activities we cannot be sure, though it is probable that it was before he ever reached western Pennsylvania. There are some early accounts of John speaking of his own activities as ""a Bible missionary"" on the Potomac when he was a young man, and Johnny was seen for two or three consecutive years along the banks of the Potomac in eastern Virginia, picking the seeds from the pomace of the cider mills in the late 1790s.The apple seeds that Johnny obtained were free, as the cider mills wanted there to be more apple trees planted to improve their business."
"At the time of his death, Johnny Appleseed left an estate of more than 1,200 acres of nurseries, and he left these to his sister. He additionally had four plots located in Allen County, Indiana, which was a nursery that included 15,000 trees."
"Records show that John Chapman appeared on Licking Creek, in what is now Licking County, Ohio, in 1800, when he was twenty-six years old. He had probably come up the Muskingum River to plant near the Refugee Tract, which would soon fill up with settlers, when Congress actually got around to granting the lands. In April, 1798, the Continental Congress had ratified resolutions to donate public lands for the benefit of those who had left Canada and Nova Scotia to fight against the British in the Revolutionary War. The lands were actually set apart in 1801 and patents issued in 1802. Grants of land ranging from 160 acres to 2,240 acres were awarded according to the exertions of the patentee in the War. Johnny, with true Yankee enterprise, went ahead and planted his nurseries before the refugees arrived. Licking County, then a part of Fairfield, contained only three white families. By the time families were ready to settle the area, Johnny's tracts of land were ready for market."
Compact disc
"A Compact Disc, also called a CD is a storage device that are small plastic discs which store and retrieve computer data or music using light. Compact Discs replaced floppy disks because they were faster and could hold more information. The CDs made floppy disks become obsolete. CDs were invented by both Philips and Sony at the same time, but not together. Sony and Philips did work together to create a standard format and the technology to read CDs in 1982. CDs can hold up to 700 MB worth of data, which is about 80 minutes of music. Mini CDs were also made for special small programs like drivers. CDs that have computer information on them are called CD-ROMs, or Compact Disc - Read Only Memory. The diameter of a normal CD is 120 mm. The middle hole in a CD is about 1.5 cm)."
Maidstone
"Maidstone is a town in Kent, in England. It stands on the River Medway. Maidstone is the county town of Kent, meaning the local government is based there. Its name means ""stone of the maidens"". The town of Maidstone is within the borough of Maidstone, which also includes several surrounding villages. In 2001, 75,070 people lived in the town of Maidstone, and there were 138,959 in the whole of the Borough."
History.
"During the Civil War a battle took place in 1648, which was won by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers. A year later, Andrew Broughton, who was then Mayor of Maidstone (and also Clerk to the High Court of Justice) gave the death sentence to Charles I. Today there is a plaque in Maidstone Town Centre describing Andrew as 'Mayor and Regicide' (a killer of kings)."
"Maidstone used to be an industrial area, with paper making and brewing being two of the most important industries, although both have mainly died out in recent years. Until 1998, Sharps Toffee factory was where Bassets liquorice allsorts and other sweets were made. Most of the heavy industry has now been replaced by light and service industries."
Today.
"Today, Maidstone is one of the top five shopping centres in the south east of England, with more than one million square feet of retail space. Most of this is in two shopping areas, ""Fremlin Walk"", which was built on the site of one of the old breweries, is , and ""The Mall Maidstone"" provides another . Both include multi-story car parks."

Court rulings.
Section 2 has been the source of every Supreme Court ruling directly addressing Twenty-first Amendment issues. Early rulings suggested that Section 2 enabled states to legislate with exceptionally broad constitutional powers.
"In ""State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co."", (1936), the Supreme Court held that a state could require a license fee for importing beer from other states and also for manufacturing beer within the state. The court recognized that ""Prior to the Twenty-first Amendment it would obviously have been unconstitutional"" for a state to require a fee for such a privilege."
"In ""Craig v. Boren"" (1976), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of proposed legislation with different ages for males and females regarding alcohol consumption in Oklahoma (age 18 for females, age 21 for males). The Court overturned the motion because of a presumed violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment."
"In ""South Dakota v. Dole"" (1987), the Supreme Court upheld the withholding of some federal highway funds to states in which the legal drinking age is less than twenty-one years of age is lawful. The Court held that the limitations on spending power in the Twenty-First Amendment did not prohibit Congress to indirectly achieve federal objectives."
"In ""44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island"" (1996), Rhode Island passed a law that banned liquor advertising from places that did not sell liquor. The petitioners based their suit on their First Amendment right to free speech. In a unanimous decision the Court held that states cannot use the Twenty-first Amendment to abridge freedom of speech protections under the First Amendment. However, the Court acknowledged the state was empowered to regulate the sale of liquor under the Twenty-First Amendment."
United States presidential election
"The election of the President and Vice President of the United States is an indirect vote in which citizens cast ballots for a set of members of the U.S. Electoral College. These electors then cast direct votes for the President and Vice President. If both votes result in an absolute majority, the election is over. If a majority of electors do not vote for President, the House of Representatives chooses the President; if a majority of electors do not vote for Vice President, the Senate votes. Presidential elections occur quadrennially on Election Day, which since 1845 has been the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, coinciding with the general elections of various other federal, state, and local races. The most recent United States presidential election was held on November 3, 2020."

Cheongsam
"Cheongsam (长衫) is typical, traditional clothing for Chinese women. Also known as Qipao (Ch'ipau)."
"A cheongsam usually has two long slits at either side of the hem for convenient movement and display of the legs. Unlike a short skirt, the slits of cheongsam show a woman's legs when she walks."
"A more formal description is: a longer, figure-fitting, one piece garment with a standing collar, an asymmetric left-over-right opening (youren) and two side slits."
"The modern Cheongsam was developed in Shanghai in the 1920s. Several alterations have been made to the design. It was popular in China from the 1920s to 1940s, as many noble and high-class women wore it. Although the cheongsam is thought to be traditional Chinese clothing, it is modern."
The traditional Qipao evolved from Manchu women's Changpao during the Qing Dynasty.
Kikuyu
Kikuyu is the largest tribe in Kenya. They are 22% of Kenya's population and are of Bantu ethnicity.
History.
"There are two theories explaining where the Kikuyu came from. First, it is believed the Kikuyus came from Central Africa, where all the Bantus once lived. They then moved south towards present day Tanzania where the migrating group separated again and the Kikuyus moved towards Mount Kenya, where they settled. The second theory is that they came from a mythical place called Shungwaya, which is present day Somalia."
"According to Kikuyu creation stories, Ngai (their God) made a man, called Gikuyu, and his wife, Mumbi, and settled them on Mount Kenya. Gikuyu and Mumbi had nine daughters who form the major groups of the Kikuyu people. Due to the fertile soil on Mount Kenya and the hard work of the Kikuyu people, they grew more than they needed and started trading with their neighbours, the Maasai (a Nilotic tribe). The Kikuyus swapped their farm produce and crops for the animal products from the Maasai, who kept livestock. It is also believed that the Maasai are the ones who married the nine daughters of Gikuyu and Mumbi."
Kikuyu language.
"Members of the Kikuyu tribe speak the Kikuyu language. The Kikuyu greeting is ""Wi mwega?"" which means ""Are you fine?"". There are a few Kikuyu dialects depending on region. Kikuyus from Nyeri, for instance, have other forms of greeting including: ""Wakia Maitu"" greeting an elderly female, ""Wakia Awa"" greeting an elderly male, and ""Wanyua"" for agemates."
"The Kikuyu language is also similar to other languages like Meru, Mbeere, and Embu which are believed to have been once part of the Kikuyu tribe but moved away and formed their own tribes. Even though English and Kiswahili are the main languages spoken in Kenya across tribes, the Kikuyu language is still spoken a lot today as a sense of cultural pride."

"Famous people from this tribe include: Jomo Kenyatta (the first president of Kenya), Mwai Kibaki (the third president of Kenya), Uhuru Kenyatta (current president) and Wangari Maathai (the first African female Nobel Peace Prize winner.)"
Incheon International Airport
"Incheon International Airport is the largest international airport in South Korea where all international flights leave and arrive every day. Gimpo Airport located near city Seoul used to be the international airport for Korea. However as the population grew and needs for places to stay increased in the area, Gimpo Airport no longer could expand its capacity to meet the growing demands for international flights. To solve the problem, a construction plan for a new 24 hour airport was started in 1992. Incheon International Airport is in Incheon City Jung-gu Unseo-dong (37°27′5″N, 126°26′4″E). Incheon International Airport Railroad (A'REX) and Incheon International Airport Highway were built to join the airport to Seoul. The airport is operated by Incheon International Airport Corporation (IIAC) and it is owned by the government of South Korea."
History.
"Incheon International Airport opened on March 29th, 2001. It was built on reclaimed land between Yongjongdo and Youngyudo. First stage of building started in 1992 and it took eight years and four months to finish. It cost 7.8 trillion Won. This allowed Incheon International Airport to have up to 170,000 flights, 27,000,000 passengers and 1,700,000 tons of cargo per year. Stage Two began in 2002 and was completed on June 20th 2008. The airport now has the capacity of holding 410,000 flights, 44,000,000 passengers, and 4,500,000 tons of cargo per year. When the airport is finished in 2020, it will have two passenger terminals, four satellite concourses, 128 gates, and four parallel runways. It will be able to have up to 100 million passengers, and 7 million tons of cargo per year."
Facilities.
"Incheon International Airport has passenger facilities (main passenger terminal, passenger concourse A), cargo terminal complex (A, B, C terminal), and operation facilities (control tower, runways, and meteorological facilities)."
Lao language
"Lao or Laotian is a language and is the official language of Laos. It is also spoken in the northeast part of Thailand. Lao, like the other languages of Laos, is written in an abugida writing system. The languages has variations, but the Vientiane dialect is considered the standard written form of Lao."
"Lao and Thai are both Tai languages and are very similar to each other. In fact, speakers of northern Thai dialects and Lao claim that they can largely understand each other, making the dialects mutually intelligible."
History.
"Lao is one of the Tai languages, spoken in what is now northern Vietnam and southern China. Mongol invaders and expansion in China pushed the Tai people south towards India. Their language was influenced by other languages in the region like the Mon-Khmer and the Austronesian languages. The written form of Lao originally came from the Pali language in India. The script form was brought to the region by Buddhists about two thousand years ago."

Highland Football League
"The Highland Football League (HFL) is a league of football clubs operating not just in the Scottish highlands, as the name may suggest, but also in the north-east lowlands (Moray and Aberdeenshire). It is one of the three 'senior' non-leagues (that is a league that is not the Scottish Football League (SFL), Scottish Premier League or one of the Scottish Junior Football Association's leagues) in Scotland. The HFL is a full member of the Scottish Football Association."
History.
Formation.
"The HFL was formed on 4 August 1893, at the Inverness Workman's Club. The original league consisted of seven teams: Inverness Thistle, Caledonian, Clachnacuddin, Forres Mechanics, Inverness Union, Inverness Citadel and Cameron Highlanders. Ross County were an eighth original member, but resigned membership in November 1893. Of the original teams, two are still playing in the league today (Clachnacuddin and Forres Mechanics), and two merged to become current Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle."
Recent History.
"Many of the member clubs have performed well when competing against SFL clubs in the Scottish Cup. However, from the 1990s onwards, the HFL has been a victim of its own success, with various teams defecting to other leagues. Furthermore it has also had to contend with overexposure of large teams in the area, such as Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, as well as the Old Firm to the South, and to an extent English football. However, the lack of Premier League, and to a lesser extent First Division, teams in the area, has worked in its favour, with some football fans being less willing to travel long distances to games in southern Scotland."
"The league has been somewhat weakened in recent years by the departure of many former members who have subsequently joined the SFL. This happened in 1994 when Caledonian, Inverness Thistle and Ross County left. Until then the HFL had operated with 18 clubs; this was reduced by the departure of the three mentioned clubs, but Wick Academy from the North Caledonian Football League were elected, to create a league of 16 clubs. This was the state of affairs till 2000 when Elgin City and Peterhead were elected into the SFL. In 2002 Inverurie Loco Works were elected into the HFL to give it a membership of 15 clubs, with which it continues to operate."
"In 2008, North Region Junior League sides Formartine United and Turriff United both submitted bids to join the Highland League, following in the footsteps of past Junior League side Inverurie Locos. If both teams were to join, the Highland League would have a total of 17 teams. An even team league is preferred, so only one club's application was likely to be successful. Whichever team is successful in their application was planned to join in the 2009–10 season. However Banks O' Dee and Strathspey Thistle also applied, giving the potential for an 18 team Highland league in 2009-10 if three of these four clubs were elected."
"On February 25 2009, Formartine United, Turriff United and Strathspey Thistle were accepted into the league for the following season, with Banks O' Dee being the unsuccessful club."
Results from the HFL and the Highland League Cup have featured on the Press Association vidiprinter since the start of the 1997–98 season.
"The Highland League is the subject of a song of the same name by the popular music ensemble I, Ludicrous."
Linked Competitions.
The HFL also administer several other competitions contested by some or all of the clubs. These competitions are:
Meselson–Stahl experiment
"The Meselson–Stahl experiment was an experiment done by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958, using ""E. coli"" DNA."
"With their experiment, they found that DNA replication was semiconservative. The DNA consists of two helices that are combined. When the two helices are copied, each will have one part coming from the original cell. The other part will be newly made. In chemistry, that is called ""synthesis""."
There are three different way this replication could happen:
"Meselson and Stahl found that DNA employs semi-conservative replication. They put the bacteria in an environment with a Nitrogen isotope. They first used N15. The bacteria then integrated this isotope into their DNA. Later they used an environment that contained N14. They then looked at which of the isotopes the bacterial DNA contained. They found that it contained both isotopes of nitrogen, which implies that conservative replication is not the correct conclusion. By having a closer look they could then also rule out disperse replication. Some helix strands were all v. Other helix strands from the time in the N15 environment had N14."
Woodford tube station
"Woodford is a London Underground station in Woodford in the London Borough of Redbridge, United Kingdom."
The station is on the Central Line between South Woodford and Buckhurst Hill. The station is also a terminus (an ending point) for services from Hainault by way of Chigwell.
History.
"The population of Trieste, practically nearly all Italian, promoted this union of the city to Italy in 1918, and since the end of WWI the city has been the capital of the Italian region called ""Venezia Giulia""."
"The population is 207.069 ab. (2004). It was nearly 300,000 after WWII because many Italian refugees flooded the city as a consequence of the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus."
"These days, Trieste is important because of its shipbuilding industry, science parks, universities and ""history on the border of western Europe"". Trieste will be connected to the Italian ""TAV railway"" (High Speed) network: a 300 km/hour (186 mph) fast train route is going to connect Trieste with Venice in the next few years."
Economy.
"During the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Trieste became a leading European city in economy, trade and commerce, and was the fourth largest and most important center in the Empire, after Vienna, Budapest and Prague. However the economy of Trieste fell into a small decline after the city's annexation to Italy following World War I, because it was cut off from the ""Mittleurope""."
"But Fascist Italy promoted a huge development of Trieste in the 1930s, with new manufacturing activities related even to naval and armament industries (like the famous ""Cantieri Aeronautici Navali Triestini (CANT)""). Allied bombings during WWII destroyed the industrial section of the city (mainly the shipyards)."
"As a consequence Trieste was a mainly peripheral city during the Cold War. However, since the 1970s, Trieste has had a huge economic boom, thanks to a significant commercial shipping business to the container terminal, steel works and an oil terminal."
"Trieste is also Italy's and Mediterranean's (and one of Europe's) greatest coffee ports, as the city supplies more than 40% of Italy's coffee. Coffee brands, such as Illy, were founded and are headquartered in the city. Currently, Trieste is one of Europe's most important ports and centres for trade and transport, with Trieste being part of the ""Corridor 5"" plan, to create a bigger transport connection between Western and Eastern European countries."
Offenbach am Main
"Offenbach is a city in the German state of Hesse. It is on the river Main near Frankfurt am Main. The city has about 120,000 people. The ""Deutscher Wetterdienst"" (German weather service) is in Offenbach."
Economy.
"Until the early 1970s the economy of Offenbach was mainly the machine-building and leather industries. The city is the home of the German Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies until today."
Twinned cities.
Offenbach has the following twin cities:
Heilbronn
"Heibronn ( ]; , local dialect: ""Hallbrunn"", ""Haalbrunn"") is a city in Germany in the state of Baden-Württemberg. With about 117,000 people, Heilbronn is the sixth largest town in Baden-Württemberg."
Heilbronn is also on the river Neckar and is known for the wine which was grown in their region and the Kätchen a famous sign.
Hildesheim
"is a city in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is in the district of Hildesheim and is about 30 km southeast of Hanover. The city is on the banks of the River Innerste, which is a smaller river that flows into the River Leine. It can be reached from Autobahn A7, which links Kassel, Göttingen and Hanover."
"It has about 110,000 people living there."
History.
"Hildesheim is one of the oldest cities in North Germany. The city may have been founded when the bishop moved from Elze to the Innerste ford, where it was an important market on the Hellweg trade route. The settlement soon grew into a town which was granted market rights by King Otto III in 983. Originally the market was held on a street called Old Market (""Alter Markt""), which still exists today. The first market place was laid out around Saint Andrew's Church. As the city grew larger, a larger market place became more important. The current market place in Hildesheim was made at the start of the 13th century when the city had a population of about 5,000. When Hildesheim obtained city rights in 1249, it was one of the largest cities in Northern Germany. For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a city hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence. Construction of the present City Hall started in 1268, and in 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the Hanseatic League. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519-1523 when they engaged in a feud. Hildesheim became Protestant in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in Imperial (Roman Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Roman Catholic as well. In 1813, after the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 as a province."
"The city was bombed in World War II, but the bombing had little importance in the course of the war. 28.5% of the houses were destroyed and 44.7% damaged. 26.8% of the houses had no damage. The center, which still had its medieval character until then, was almost levelled. As in many cities, priority was given to rapid building of badly needed housing, and concrete structures took the place of the destroyed buildings. Fortunately, most of the major churches, two of them now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war. During the war, valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in the basement of the city wall. In 1978, the University of Hildesheim was founded. In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic center began. Some of the new concrete buildings near the marketplace were torn down. Replicas of the original buildings were built in their place."
Population history.

Pforzheim
Pforzheim () is a city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg.
"About 116,000 people live there."
"After privatisation, NSE was divided up into several franchises:"
SR Class 4Lav
The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 4Lav to the electric multiple units built to work the semi-fast services on the route between London and Brighton. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class.
SR Class 6Pul
"The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designations 6Pul, 6Cit and 6Pan to electric multiple units built to work the routes between London and Brighton, West Worthing and Eastbourne. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class number. The 6Pul units were designated 6Cor until 1935 (the Cor designation was later used for 4Cor units)."
British Rail Mark 3
"British Rail's third fundamental design of carriage was designated Mark 3, and was introduced in 1976 primarily for use on the High Speed Train (HST). The coaches were also used as conventional loco-hauled stock as part of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) northern electrification scheme in the mid 1970s, designated Mark 3A and 3B. The final batch was built in 1988, but Mark 3-based multiple units continued to be built until the early 1990s."
Desiro
Desiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by Siemens of Germany.
"The Desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit (DMU or EMU). It is normally made as two and three-car trainsets. Although there are many differences between single trains, the basic body design is the same. These trains are mostly used for regional services, and belong to a new generation of light, modular trains which have become common in many European countries. They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars. They are mostly cheap to make and work. Their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations. However, they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort."
Austria.
"In Austria, the ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways) is right now using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains called ""ÖBB 5022"". These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have added more safety stuff."
Bulgaria.
"In 2005 and 2006, in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a €67-million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them working on the Sofia-Kyustendil-Sofia line. Another €117-million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BDŽ and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company. The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas."
Denmark.
"In Denmark, DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The train is mostly used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia. On July 2, 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010. Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains."
Germany.
"Germany's Deutsche Bahn first showed two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of 120 km/h, these ""Class 642"" units are mostly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units bought by DB until 2007, many private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs."
"The ""Class 642"" has two MAN diesel engines with an output of 275 or 315 kW each and hydro-mechanical transmission with retarders. It normally has 100 seats. When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers, up to three trainsets can be worked together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the ""Müglitzbahn"", have made greater passenger numbers."
"At first, DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers, but because of software trouble, this proved to be impossible. Therefore the ""Class 642"" can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the ""Class 643""."
Hungary.
"Right now in Hungary, 31 diesel Desiros are in service with MÁV (counting 8 units from Greece), mostly as suburban trains on the secondary line between Budapest-Esztergom and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends, the units also used as top inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and Sátoraljaújhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the Lake Balaton."
Malaysia.
The 57km KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit airport rail link uses the Desiro ET 425 M four-car Electric Multiple Units. There are 12 trainsets right now working in Malaysia.
These EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160 km/h.
Romania.
"Căile Ferate Române (CFR), Romania's national railway worker, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets. CFR, which is right now undergoing modernisation, has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train: """"Regio"", ""InterRegio"" and ""InterCity"" inter-city services, but mostly on its ""InterRegio"""" express trains. There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short-distance routes."
Russia.
"The Separatists decided to leave England for the Dutch Republic (where religious freedom was permitted). William Bradford went with them. It was illegal to leave England. The group was betrayed by an English sea captain who brought them to the English authorities. Most of the congregation, and Bradford, were put into prison. By the summer of 1608, the Separatists, and William Bradford, escaped to Leiden, Netherlands. Bradford was 18."
In the Dutch Republic.
"William Bradford moved to Amsterdam in August 1608. He lived with the Brewsters in Stink Alley. The Separatists had spent most of their money leaving England and were poor. After nine months, the congregation moved to the smaller city of Leiden."
When Bradford turned 21 he received some money. Bradford purchased his own house. He built a workshop and worked as a weaver. He was liked.
"In 1613, Bradford married Dorothy May, the daughter of a rich English couple living in Amsterdam. In 1617, the Bradfords had their first child, John Bradford."
"By 1617, the Separatists decided to travel to Virginia Colony in North America. The Separatists could practice their religion in the Dutch Republic, they wanted their children to keep their English customs and language. The colonists made a business arrangement with the Merchant Adventurers. These were a group of men who were willing to pay for the Pilgrims to go to the New World with the promise that the pilgrims would pay them back with furs and other goods they got from the colony. By July 1620, Robert Cushman and John Carver had made the plans and fifty Separatists left Delftshaven on the ship ""Speedwell""."
"Many families were split as some Separatists stayed behind in the Netherlands, planning to make the voyage to the New World after the colony had been established. William and Dorothy Bradford left their three-year-old son John with Dorothy's parents in Amsterdam, possibly because he was too frail to make the voyage."
Departure.
"The ""Speedwell"" planned to meet with the ""Mayflower"" and both ships would travel to Virginia Colony. The ""Speedwell"" proved unsafe and the passengers were put on the ""Mayflower"". This made the ship very crowded. Not all the passengers were Separatists. There were about 50 colonists who went because they had certain skills. These skills would prove useful on the ""Mayflower"" and at the colony. Bradford said they hugged each other and cried and said goodbye to family and friends for the last time. They knew they were pilgrims and lifted their eyes to heaven, their dearest country and this comforted them."
The Mayflower Voyage.
"The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the ""Mayflower"" spotted land. The ""Mayflower"" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor."
"They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Bradford signed the Mayflower Compact."
Anchored and first explorations at Plymouth Colony.
"Up to this time, Bradford, aged 30, had never been a leader in the colony. When the ""Mayflower"" anchored in the Harbor, the men went out to explore the land for a place where they could live. Bradford volunteered to be a member of the exploration parties. In November and December, these parties went out three times on foot and by boat."
"One of the earliest exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Indians during his time at Jamestown. According to Bradford, they set off in below freezing weather, many of the men already being ill, ""and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed"". During their trip they saw Indians who looked like they were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. The men camped and protected themselves from the cold and the Indians."
"They located a place that would be Plymouth Colony in December. During the first expedition on foot, Bradford was caught up in a deer trap made by Native Americans and brought upside down. During the third exploration, on 6 December 1620, Bradford and the other men found Plymouth Bay. A winter storm nearly sank their boat as they came near the bay. The explorers were very cold and started to get sick. The waves were high but they landed on Clark's Island."
"During this time, they searched areas all around the bay and found a place to live and build their homes. The location had a large hill. This hill is now called Burial Hill. It was a good place to build a fort for safety against any possible enemies. There were many brooks providing water. They would later find out that the site had been the location of a Native American village known as Patuxet; and that is why a large area had already been cleared for planting of food. The Patuxet tribe of Indians, between 1616 and 1619, had all died from bad sickness. Bradford later wrote that bones of the dead were easy to find in many places."
Plymouth Colony.
Great sickness.
"The ""Mayflower"" arrived in Plymouth Bay on 20 December 1620. The settlers began building the colony's first house on 25 December."
"On January 11, 1621, as Bradford was helping to build houses when he was got a great pain in his hipbone and fell. Bradford was taken to the ""common house"" (the only house that was finished) and they thought he would die that night, but he did not."
"Bradford got well but many of the pilgrims were not so fortunate. During the months of February and March 1621 sometimes two or three people died every day. By the end of the winter, half of the 100 settlers had died. They buried their dead in secret so the Native Americans would not see how many were dying. They buried them in Cole's Hill and tried to also hide the graves from the animals."
"There were only a small number of men who were healthy. Everyone, including the children had to work and care for the sick. One of these was Captain Myles Standish. He was a soldier who had been hired by the settlers to protect the people of the colony. Standish cared for Bradford during his illness. They became good friends. Bradford had no military experience and when he became governor he would come to trust Captain Standish's advice on military matters."
William was chosen by the people to be Governor of Plymouth Colony. He kept journals (a written record) which are very important even today because they are the only history of how the Mayflower passengers and their families lived in Plymouth Colony. He died before he could finish the second book.
Early service as governor.
"On March 16, the settlers had their first meeting with the Native Americans who lived in the region. Samoset, an Indian walked into the village of Plymouth and greeted them in English. Samoset had learned some English from the traders who had visited the area he was from. This soon led to a visit by Massasoit, the leader of the Pokanoket tribe. At that meeting, Massassoit made a treaty with Governor John Carver. The treaty said that they would be friends and protect each other against unfriendly Indians."
Bradford wrote down what was said. He would soon become governor and the treaty that was very important was the promise to help each other. This agreement was not liked by Massasoit's enemies in other tribes.
"In April 1621, Governor Carver became sick while working in the fields on a hot day. He died a few days later. The settlers of Plymouth then chose Bradford as the new governor. Bradford would remain governor most of his life."
"The elected leadership of Plymouth Colony was at first a governor and an assistant governor. The assistant governor for the first three years of the colony's history was Isaac Allerton. In 1624, it was changed to five assistants. This was called the ""governor's council"". These men gave advice to the governor and had a vote on important matters. They helped Bradford in managing the Colony. Assistants during the early years of the colony included Thomas Prence, Stephen Hopkins, John Alden, and John Howland."
Family.
"William Bradford married Dorothy in Amsterdam, Holland on December 10, 1613. They had one son. Dorothy fell from the deck of the Mayflower into the water and drowned a short time after the ship landed. Her husband was on an exploring mission. John was born in Leiden, Holland and died in 1620."
His second wife was Alice Southwarth in Plymouth. They had three children. She died in Plymouth in March 1670 and was buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth near her husband.
Optical gain medium
"An optical gain medium (also called an ""active laser medium"") can make light stronger. In general, gain media must be powered by another energy source in order to have energy to provide as light. Some gain media can be powered using electricity, but many others need light energy from bright flash lamps or a laser. Optical gain media are used in lasers. The first lasers used artificial ruby as their optical gain medium."
Microvillus
"Microvillus (plural microvilli) is a very tiny hair-like membrane in the body. The microvillus greatly increase the amount of surface area for a cell. In humans, the microvilli can give a cell 600 times more surface area. They are good for absorbing things and for secreting things. They are found in many places in a human body including the ear, the tongue, the nose and the intestines."
"On a tongue, the microvilli are the tiny hairs on the taste buds that send signals to the brain. These signals are interpreted by the brain, and tells the brain what things taste like. Over time, as a person tastes more and more things, the brain stores the information the microvilli send in a databank of information. This databank is used to compare new tastes to old tastes, and help to classify them by comparing and contrasting their qualities."
"In the intestines, the microvilli are able to absorb (take) nutrients from the digested food for the body to use."
Languages of the United States
"English is the ""de facto"" national language of the United States, with 82% of the population claiming it as a mother tongue, and some 96% claiming to speak it ""well"" or ""very well"". However, no ""official language"" exists at the Federal level. There have been several proposals to make English the national language in amendments to immigration reform bills, but none of these bills have made a federal language. However, some states have adopted the English language as their official language. On the other hand, a lot of another languages, like Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Polish, Finnish, Dutch, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Welsh, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Hindi, Mandarin, Hebrew, Cantonese, Chinese, Ukrainian, Navajo, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Portuguese, etc. Are spoken in the United States as second languages."

Messianic Judaism
"Messianic Judaism is a movement of Jews who believe that Jesus (called by them with his Hebrew name ""Yeshua"") is the Jewish Messiah, and who perform this belief in a Jewish way (observing the regulations of the Torah etc.). They are called ""Messianic Jews"". The main branches of Judaism do not consider Messianic Judaism to be Judaism, but rather a form of Christianity, because Judaism rejects Jesus/Yeshua as the Jewish Messiah."
Malcolm Sargent
"Sir Malcolm Sargent (born Ashford, Kent, 29 April 1895; died London 3 October 1967) was an English conductor, organist and composer. He was an extremely famous and popular conductor who had a lot of influence on music in England during his life. He conducted many choirs, both amateur and professional, as well as orchestras. He was the main conductor of the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts from 1948 to 1967. He made the Last Night of the Proms into a very popular and joyful concert which today is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide on television. He conducted the music of many British composers, helping them to become known to a wide public."
Life.
Early years.
"Sargent was born in 1895 into a working-class family. His father was a coal merchant at Stamford, Lincolnshire, who also played the organ. Sargent grew up in Stamford and became involved in a lot of amateur music making. He learned a lot about music from singing in church and playing the organ. He took his ARCO organ diploma when he was only 16 and became an organ pupil at Peterborough Cathedral. At 18 he got a job as organist at Melton Mowbray church. In the same year he got a music degree from the University of Durham."
"After conducting local choirs and orchestras he got the opportunity to conduct his own composition ""Impressions on a Windy Day"" with Henry Wood’s Queen’s Hall Orchestra, first at Leicester and then at the Proms in the Queen's Hall. Wood encouraged him in his conducting. He started to teach at the Royal College of Music and moved to London. He conducted the Robert Mayer children’s concerts and the Courtauld-Sargent concerts, a series which was aimed at people who had never been to concerts. He conducted for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes and, in 1928 he became conductor of the Royal Choral Society, a job which he kept until his death."
"Illness, and mid career."
"In 1932 he was very ill with tuberculosis, but he recovered during the next few years. He often conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra which had been formed in 1932 by Thomas Beecham. He did not often conduct opera, but he did conduct at the Royal Opera House: in 1936 with Gustave Charpentier's opera ""Louise"" in 1936 and in 1954 the first performance of Walton's ""Troilus and Cressida""."
"As an orchestra conductor Sargent was not always popular. He made many enemies with a remark he made in 1936 when he said that orchestral musicians should not have a secure “job for life” but should give their “lifeblood with every bar they played”. Sargent had only just recovered from a long illness himself, during which time the musicians had given him support, so they were very annoyed when he said this."
"He was very popular in Australia and nearly took a job there, but when World War II started he decided he should work in his own country. During the war, Sargent conducted the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939-42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942-48) and became a popular radio broadcaster with the BBC. He helped the British people to keep their spirits up during the war by touring and giving many concerts and not asking for much money. During one concert he was playing Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 7"" when there was an air raid. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than they would be outside, and started to conduct again. The orchestra played extremely well that night. In May 1941 Sargent conducted Elgar's ""Dream of Gerontius"" in an afternoon concert in the Queen's Hall. That night the Queen’s Hall was completely destroyed by a bomb."
"In 1945, Arturo Toscanini invited Sargent to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra. He gave four concerts, in which he included mostly British music."
The Proms and later years.
Sargent was chief conductor of the Proms from 1948 until his death in 1967. In 1950 he followed Sir Adrian Boult as conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He held that job until 1957 when he became Chief Guest Conductor. Everywhere that Sargent took the orchestra the audience were wild with excitement. The orchestra became internationally famous.
"Sargent was a very popular person at the Proms. He made the Last Night (the last concert of each season) into an exciting celebration in which the audience waved flags and joined together to sing, hum and clap. He conducted music by famous classical composers as well as British music by more recent composers. However, he did not conduct modern experimental music."
"During his time at the Proms foreign conductors such as Carlo Maria Giulini, Georg Solti, Leopold Stokowski, Rudolf Kempe, Pierre Boulez and Bernard Haitink were invited to perform. There were also some foreign orchestras."
"When the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra nearly had to come to an end after Beecham's death in 1961, Sargent worked hard to save the orchestra. A lot of the players, who still remembered the remark he made in 1936, started to support him again."
"By the mid-1960s Sargent was suffering from cancer. He was too ill to conduct the Proms in 1967, but on 16 September, at the Last Night, to everyone’s astonishment, he appeared at the end of the concert to talk to his audience. He gave his baton to Colin Davis who took over his job. Sargent looked very ill, and died two weeks later."
Achievement and reputation.
"Sargent received many honours. He was knighted in 1947 and received the Royal Philharmonic Society gold medal in 1959. His nickname was “Flash Harry” because he always dressed and behaved in a flashy style. He was often known as “Britain’s ambassador of music”, because he often toured all over the world with his orchestras, conducting British music, especially the works of Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst and Walton. If the professional musicians he worked with did not always like him, his audiences loved him and he was especially fond of the Promenaders. At his memorial service in Westminster Abbey the whole of the nave was reserved for Promenade Season Ticket holders"
Playoffs
"The playoffs, postseason, or finals are a series of games played after the regular season of a particular sports league. They are played by the most successful teams of the season. It is used to determine the season's champion. The teams that play in the playoffs are the ones with the most wins or points during the regular season."
"Playoffs are usually, but not always, done with a single-elimination system."
Lars
Lars is a male name. It is usually used in Scandinavian countries and Germany.
"Lars comes from the Roman name ""Laurentius""."

Elliot Richardson
"Elliot Lee Richardson (July 20, 1920 December 31, 1999) was an American lawyer and politician. He was a member of the cabinet of Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. As U.S. Attorney General, he was a known figure in the Watergate Scandal, and resigned rather than obey President Nixon's order to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox."
"Richardson served as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from 1970 to 1973, Secretary of Defense from January to May 1973, Attorney General from May to October 1973, and Secretary of Commerce from 1976 to 1977. That makes him one of only two individuals to have held four Cabinet positions within the United States government (the other such individual being George Shultz)."
"On December 31, 1999, Richardson died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 79."
Frequency probability
"Frequency probability or Frequentism is one of the interpretations of probability theory. Repeating a scientific experiment very often gives a number of results. It is then possible, to count the number of times that a given event happened and compare it to the total number of experiments."
"This interpretation of probabiilty was very important for statistics. People who use this interpretation are often called Frequentists. Well-known frequentists include Richard von Mises, Egon Pearson, Jerzy Neyman, R. A. Fisher and John Venn."
Other interpretations of probability are Bayesian probability and Axiomatic probability theory
Satellite navigation
A satellite navigation or satnav system is a way of pinpointing position very exactly.
"Satnav uses a system of satellites. The system gives exact positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to find their position (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation). The position is given within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a straight line (line of sight) by radio from satellites. The signals also allow the receivers to calculate the current local time to high precision. A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be called a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Global Positioning System is the biggest and most used GNSS. GLONASS, owned by Russia, is the second biggest. China, India, and the European Union are working on similar systems of their own."
Bad Santa
Bad Santa is a 2003 American Christmas criminal black comedy movie.
Property law
"Property law covers two types of property in the common law legal system, real property and personal property. In the civil law system, there is a division between movable and immovable property. Movable property is more or less the same as personal property. It includes money, stocks, notes, copyrights and patents."
History.
"The idea behind all property law is property. In some jurisdictions, historically all property was owned by the monarch. Land ownership was through land tenure in feudal systems. The first legal right of absolute ownership was under Roman law and was called ""dominion""."
Ritz Crackers
Ritz Crackers are a brand of snack cracker. They were introduced by Nabisco in 1934. They are disc-shaped and lightly-salted.
"Ritz Crackers varieties include the Original Ritz, Low Sodium Ritz, Honey Butter Ritz, Whole Wheat Ritz and Honey Wheat Ritz."
"Sydney Stern chose the name Ritz. The name appealed to people who went through the difficulties of the Great Depression by offering them ""a bite of the good life."""
Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS
"HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), the virus caused by AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and is one of the most serious public health challenges in the world. However, the world is committed to preventing new HIV infections and ensuring that everyone living with HIV has access to HIV treatment. In 2019, an estimated 170 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, since 2010, the number of new HIV infections fell by 23%. For example, in one year, this is different from the number of people diagnosed with HIV in one year. Worldwide, about 81 percent of people living with HIV know their HIV status in 2019. The remaining 19% (about 710 million people) still need access to HIV testing services. Important way HIV testing is the gateway to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services."
HIV/AIDS pandemic by continent.
Africa.
"HIV/AIDS is a major concern epidemic in Africa and cause of death in many parts of Africa. Although the continent contains about 15.2% of the world's population, Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for about 69% of HIV patients, and 70% of all AIDS deaths in 2011. In the North African countries have the lowest prevalence rates, as their populations usually share cultural patterns that reduce the spread of the disease, in contrast to what the desert countries did in Africa. Southern Africa is the most affected region on the continent. As of 2011, HIV has infected at least 10% of the population in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe."
Europe.
"AIDS cases in most countries in Western Europe have fallen to levels not seen since the initial outbreak; many people attribute this trend to active education campaigns, blood transfusion screening and increased condom use. In addition, since new AIDS treatments have proven to be effective (even if expensive) methods to suppress HIV, Western Europe’s AIDS mortality rate has also fallen very much in the past few years. There are many ways to transmit HIV, including paid sex, sex between men, injecting drugs, mother-to-child behavior, and heterosexual behavior. However, many new infections in this area have occurred through contact with HIV-infected people in other areas. The prevalence of adults (15-49 years old) in the region is 0.3%, and there are currently 570,000 to 890,000 HIV-infected persons. Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, the number of deaths from AIDS has remained low since the trough in the late 1990s. However, in some countries, there is still a large number of undiagnosed HIV, and the evidence of resistance to antiretroviral drugs in some newly infected people in the region is worrying. In addition, the risky behaviors of men who come into contact with men have recently increased."
Asia.
"As of 2008, 4.7 million people in Asia were infected with HIV. The United Nations believes that the epidemic in Asia peaked in the mid-1990s, and that the annual rate of HIV infection subsequently decreased by more than half. Regionally, the epidemic has remained fairly stable since the 2000s."
North America.
"In 2016, it was estimated that 1.5 million adults and children were infected with HIV / AIDS in North America, excluding Central America and the Caribbean. 70,000 adults and children are newly infected each year, with an adult prevalence rate of 0.5%. 26,000 people die of AIDS in North America each year."
South America.
"At the beginning of 2018, there are almost about 1 million people living with HI /AIDS in South America. By the number of its population, Brazil is the country with the most HIV-positive people with 830,000 people. As of April 2018, Chile is the country with the most infections. While the Falkland Islands are the only territory where no cases were detected. The biggest problem that exists is discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS in less developed countries. This is due to ignorance of the disease, with outdated premises and the high religious population by influenced to other people."
Oceania.
"In this region, the national conditions regarding HIV and AIDS vary greatly. Part of the reason is the distance between the major islands in Oceania. The extensive development of the region also plays an important role. It is estimated that the prevalence of between 0.2 to 0.7 percent, there are currently 45,000 to 120,000 adults and children living with HIV. Papua New Guinea is one of the worst AIDS epidemic in the region. According to UNAIDS, since 1997, HIV cases in the country at a rate of 30% per year, by the end of 2006, HIV prevalence in the country is about 1.3% from the population."
Sybil (cat)
"Sybil (2006 – 27 July 2009) was a cat living at 11 and 10 Downing Street. Named after ""Sybil Fawlty"" from the television show ""Fawlty Towers"", she was the pet of then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling."
"When introduced in September 2007, Sybil, who was black and white, was the first cat at Downing Street since Humphrey was reportedly removed in November 1997, due to Cherie Blair's aversion to cats. In January 2009, she returned to Edinburgh."
Saint Sarah
"Saint Sarah, also called Sara e Kali (Sara the Black) is a patron saint of the Romani people of Catholicism Faith. She was born in the 1st century into a family of Indian Saint Thomas Christians of South India who went as Merchants to Roman Egypt. According to legends, Saint Sarah sailed from Egypt to France in a boat with the Three Marys. Her day of honour is on May 24."
Baba Fingo
Baba Fingo or Father Fingo is a male Deity in Turkish Romani folklore. The Romanlar in Turkey believe in Baba Fingo as their Saviour. The festival Kakava is celebrated at Edirne on 5-6 May. The Romanlar make a Bonfire and go to the Meric River in the night. They believe Baba Fingo comes out of the water and protects the Romani people.
"The legend of Baba Fingo says that long ago, the people lived in Egypt. But the Pharaoh was cruel to them. So Baba Fingo led the people out through the Red Sea. Another legend says that Baba Fingo was a good and wise commandant who worked for Pharaoh, but he liked women and alcohol too much. The Pharaoh's other commandants were jealous of him. They tricked him with women and alcohol and he got lost in the river. Although the Romanlar have been quasi-Muslims for centuries, the popular Folk belief in Baba Fingo plays a very important role for them."
She played on the women's team which won a silver medal in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Her play was highlighted when she scored a crucial goal in her team's first match in the Olympic tournament.
Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS)
"Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is the name of a disease that normally begins in childhood. It causes Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics. The symptoms begin very suddenly. If it is not treated at the beginning the disease can be there also in adults. The reason for PANS can be a bacteria called ""Group A streptococcus"" (PANDAS type) or an immunologic reaction to other pathogens like certain bacteria or viruses. (PITANDS type)."
Signs and symptoms.
Patients suffering from PANS show sudden begin OCD and/or tics and at least two of these symptoms:
Similar conditions.
"PANS shares symptoms with other diseases. Therefore diagnostic tests must be done to exclude other conditions like Sydenham's chorea, lupus erythematosus, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Tourette syndrome. Proof of acute rheumatic fever would exclude a PANS classification."
Treatment.
There is no direct treatment for PANS available yet. This means today only some of the symptoms can be treated. But scientists are already working to develop treatments with antibiotics and immune-based therapies that can heal the disease. Nevertheless early and consequent treatment of the symptoms seems to be important. Otherwise the disease can become a lifelong problem.
Province of Cattaro
"The Cattaro (Italian province), called in Italian ""Provincia italiana di Cattaro"" was an administrative section of the ""Governorate of Dalmatia"", created during World War II by the Kingdom of Italy with ""Regio Decreto Legge"" of May 18, 1941."
Characteristics.
"The newly created province had approximately the borders of the Albania veneta, that was part of the Republic of Venice until 1797 in southern Dalmatia."
"In the province of Cattaro there were the cities of Cattaro, Perasto, Risan|, Teodo and Castelnuovo di Cattaro. The province had a small territory around the ""Bocche di Cattaro"" (Boka Kotorska) of 547 km² and nearly 39,800 inhabitants. The island of Saseno in Albania was annexed to the province, after separating it from the province of Zara (since 1920 this little island was part of Italy)."
"The population was mostly Slav, but there were nearly 3,000 autochthonous Italians, descendants from the Dalmatian Italians since Roman times: they were concentrated in the areas of Cattaro and Perasto."
History.
"Italian General Vittorio Ambrosio conquered in a few days all the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia, and occupied the area around Cattaro (called ""Kotor"" since 1919) in April 1941."
"The new Italian province of Cattaro was created by order of Italian leader Benito Mussolini the next month, with the ""May 19 Treaty between Italy and Croatia"". Francesco Scassellati Sforzolini was named ""Prefect"" of the Cattaro province, serving from June 1941 to June 1943."
The governorship of the Cattaro province (and all the Governorate of Dalmatia) was held by Giuseppe Bastianini until January 1943 when he was recalled to Italy to join the cabinet; his place as governor was taken by Francesco Giunta.
"In summer 1941 the Italian government started a policy of Italianization in all the Governorate of Dalmatia. New Italian schools were opened in the ""Bocche di Cattaro"" (now called Boka Kotorska). Administrative personnel from Italy moved to Cattaro city (nearly 6,700 Dalmatian Italians took refuge in Italy after the creation of Jugoslavia in 1919, and many of them were offered work if they returned to settle with their families in the Governorate of Dalmatia). Bastianini started needed public works, building hospitals, sewage and roads in the area."
"Some 500 Jews took refuge in the Cattaro province, after escaping the Ustasha and Nazi German persecution in their areas of former Jugoslavia."
"The province was spared the bloody guerrilla, that happened in the rest of Italian-occupied Montenegro, until mid-September 1943 when Germans took control of the area and the Italian province of Cattaro disappeared. The Italian Division ""Emilia"" of the ""XIV° Corpo d'Armata"" fought the German occupation of the Province of Cattaro, having 597 deaths e 963 wounded soldiers, from September 9 until September 16, 1943."
"""Comuni"" of the Province of Cattaro."
"These were 15 ""comuni"" (municipalities) in the Italian Province of Cattaro. The first name is in Italian, the second in Montenegrin-Serbian and the third in Croatian:"

Williams syndrome
"The ""New City"" of Jerusalem is the part outside the old stone walls. People started building the new city in the 1800s. Mishkenot Sha'annanim, Mea Shearim, and the Bukharan Quarter are some of the first neighborhoods in the new city."
"After World War I, the Ottoman Empire had been defeated. In June 1922, the League of Nations approved the British Mandate of Palestine. This gave control of the area to the United Kingdom. The land west of the Jordan River was known as Palestine. It was under direct British control until 1948. The land east of the Jordan River was known as Transjordan, and was governed by the Hashemite family. Transjordan gained independence in 1946."
"The mandate in Palestine ended at midnight on 14 May 1948. On the next day, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War began. Israel declared independence, the West Bank was annexed by Jordan, and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip."
"In 1949, at the end of the first Arab-Israeli War, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan. Israel controlled the western part of the city. Jordan controlled the eastern section, including the Old City, a walled section of Jerusalem dating from Biblical times. Israel took control of the entire city during the Six-Day War in 1967."
Jerusalem today is claimed by the state of Israeli as its capital. The United Nations does not agree to Israel saying that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.
Religious significance.
"Jerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy."
Jewish.
"According to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is where God told the patriarch Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac, to Him. The Jews built the Temple, the centre of Jewish worship in ancient times, at the site of Abraham's sacrifice on the Temple Mount in the Old City. Two buildings, one after the other, the First Temple and the Second Temple, stood at the site. The First Temple housed the Ark of the Covenant, a sacred box holding the tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments."
The Western Wall is a part of the Second Temple and Judaism's most sacred shrine. It is a stone wall that strengthened the western side of the Temple Mount in ancient times. The wall is sometimes called the Wailing Wall because of the sad prayers Jewish people said there to mourn the destroyed Temple.
"Other sites in the city that are sacred to the Jews include King David's tomb on Mount Zion, and the Jewish Cemetery and the Tombs of the Prophets on the Mount of Olives, a hill just east of the Old City. Many sites associated with Biblical figures are sacred to Christians, too."
Christian.
"Many monasteries, convents, shrines, and religious seminaries in Jerusalem mark events in the life of Jesus and in the formation of the Christian Church. According to the Bible, Jesus taught in Jerusalem and performed numerous miracles there. The Last Supper supposedly took place in a room known as the Cenacle (also called Coenaculum) on Mount Zion. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Old City is said to be the place of Jesus's Crucifixion (called Calvary or Golgotha), as well as His burial and resurrection. Several Christian sects own the church, which was originally built by Constantine the Great, then rebuilt and dedicated by the Crusaders in 1149 CE. The building stands at the end of the Via Dolorosa (Way of Sorrows), believed to be the path over which Jesus carried His cross to Calvary. Jesus was last seen by His followers on the Mount of Olives before He went up to heaven. All of these sites attract many religious pilgrims each year."
Islamic.
"Jerusalem is Islam's third holiest city, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad originally selected Jerusalem as the qibla: the direction Muslims should face during prayer. However, he later told his followers to face Mecca instead of Jerusalem when praying. Muhammad is said to have gone up to heaven from a stone now covered by a golden-domed shrine called the Dome of the Rock. The Dome of the Rock and the ancient Al-Aqsa Mosque are among the holiest sites in Islam. They are the main buildings on the Temple Mount, which Muslims call ""Haram al-Sharif"" (Noble Sanctuary)."
Architecture.
"Jerusalem's architecture is a mixture of old and new. The Old City contains architectural examples from each major period in the city's history. Many ancient historical sites and places of worship stand near modern shopping centers and industrial zones. Architecture from the late 1800s and early 1900s shows European influences. Usefulness rather than style characterizes new apartment buildings constructed by the government as housing for immigrants. Many buildings, old and new, have matching exteriors because all construction is required to be faced with a cream-colored limestone called Jerusalem stone, produced by nearby quarries."
Religion in Jerusalem.
Belz Beis HaMedrash HaGadol is the largest synagogue in Jerusalem.
Rocky Mountains
"The Rocky Mountains (often called The Rockies) are a range of mountains in the western United States and Canada. They stretch from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. The Rocky Mountains are more than 3,000 miles long (4,800 kilometers)."
"The highest point in the Rocky Mountains is Mt. Elbert. Mt. Elbert is 14,433 ft tall (4,401m)."
"The Rocky Mountains are relatively new, formed from 55 million to 80 million years ago (mya) during the Laramide orogeny. North America began to move westwards as Pangaea broke up. A number of tectonic plates began to slide under the North American plate. The angle of subduction was shallow, resulting in a broad belt of mountains running down western North America. Since then, further tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers has sculpted the Rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys."
"The rocks in the Rocky Mountains were formed long before the mountains were raised. The oldest rock is Precambrian metamorphic rock that forms the core of the North American continent. There is also Precambrian sedimentary argillite, dating back to 1.7 billion years ago. During the Paleozoic, western North America lay underneath a shallow sea, which deposited many kilometers of limestone and dolomite."
"In the southern Rocky Mountains, near present-day Colorado, these ancestral rocks were disturbed by mountain building about 300 mya, during the Pennsylvanian. This mountain building produced the ancestral Rocky Mountains. They consisted largely of Precambrian metamorphic rock forced upward through layers of the limestone. The limestone had been laid down in a shallow sea. The mountains eroded throughout the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic, leaving extensive deposits of sedimentary rock."
Brooklyn
Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York City. It also covers the same area as Kings County. Brooklyn is the second largest borough in land area.
"In the early 21st century, about 2.5 million live there. This is more than in any of the other four boroughs."
Brooklyn is the west end of Long Island. The East River separates it from Manhattan in the north. Brooklyn's only land boundary is with Queens in the east. Jamaica Bay separates Brooklyn from Rockaway in the south. The Narrows separates Brooklyn from Staten Island in the west.
"Coney Island is the south end of Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Museum is near the middle of Brooklyn, near Prospect Park."
CNDO is the short cut for Complete Neglect of Differential Overlap. It is both 1) a method for learning key facts about molecular orbitals as well as 2) the name of a particular set of computer programs. CNDO is based on quantum chemistry. It is one of the first semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods. It uses two approximations:
"CNDO builds a mathematical model of a molecule. CNDO starts with the position of the positively charged nuclei of the atoms and the negatively charged electron clouds surrounding them. Quantum chemistry tells the model the probability distribution of electron locations based on atomic orbitals. From this information, CNDO computes data about the resulting molecular orbitals."
CNDO/2 is the main version of CNDO. John Pople and coworkers first wrote CNDO/2.

Plot.
"The movie starts with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) getting ready for her Houston Astrodome concert on February 26, 1995. After her performance, the movie goes back in time to 1961. Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. (Edward James Olmos) and his band Los Dinos are at band practice. After band practice, they went to see a promoter in the other side of town. Los Dinos are then discriminated for being Americans of Mexican heritage. Los Dinos then performed at a Spanish nightclub, and are booed off stage by Mexicans for not knowing any Mexican music. The movie goes forward in time to 1981. Abraham had quit his dreams of becoming a music star and began helping his family. After work, Abraham sat down on his chair and began playing the guitar. His youngest child, Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) was playing a football game in the backyard. She noticed her father and was curious to know what he was doing. She started to sing in front of Abraham. Abraham was surprised, he started a family band, and named it Selena y Los Dinos. He puts A.B. Quintanilla III (Rafael Tamayo) on base and Suzette Quintanilla (Victoria Elena Flores) on drums. Selena became the singer of the group."
"The movie is now set in 1989, where Selena is performing at a Houston, Texas festival as an adult. In the next scene, Selena began talking to her cousin (Seidy Lopez) about her dreams of becoming a fashion designer. Suzette (Jackie Guerra) ran upstairs and told them that a rock guitarist is in their kitchen. The three of them began spying to see what's going on. Chris Perez (Jon Seda) began to audition as the band's new guitarist in front of Abraham. Abraham tells A.B. (Jacob Vargas) that he does not like Chris. This is because he is a rocker. However, A.B. tries to tell Abraham that Chris will change his style and look. The next day, Selena asks Chris to eat with her at a pizzeria. In the next scene, Selena's song ""Como La Flor"" reached number one on ""Billboard"" which made the group come together and celebrate. Selena is asked to perform in Mexico where 50,000 fans are waiting on her to sing. Selena came out to perform ""La Carcacha"". However, the crowd became very excited and started pushing people inside of the stage. Selena is later asked by her father to calm down the crowd. She performed a slower version of ""Como La Flor"" and calmed everyone down. After her performance, she and Chris walked on a pier. Selena told him that she was scared for the first time, while Chris tells Selena that he loves her."
"While on the bus, Abraham found out that Chris liked Selena. Abraham tells Chris and Selena that their relationship is over. He then fires Chris and orders him to leave. Selena tried to run after him, however, her father told her that if she did that he will disband the group. After this, Selena and Chris began to meet secretly and they eloped. Selena went to her father's house the next day. Abraham began crying and told Selena that he was sorry. He then accepted Chris into the family. In the next scene, Selena won a Grammy Award and opened her clothing stores. She hired Yolanda Saldivar (Lupe Ontiveros) as the manager. Yolanda began to steal money from these places. After this, Selena started recording songs for her crossover album. Abraham later finds out that Yolanda was stealing money, and holds a meeting to hear Yolanda's side. Yolanda tells Abraham that if given time, she will prove her innocence. Later that night, Selena performed ""Si Una Vez"" at the Houston Astrodome on February 26, 1995. After that night, Selena asked her mother to scratch her head and that she and Chris are thinking of starting a family. Selena then dreams of the crossover tour and sings ""Dreaming of You"". After Selena sings the opening of the song, a rose is thrown at her. Selena is seen being rushed to the hospital. Reporters tells everyone that Selena was shot by Saldívar during an argument over the missing financial records. In the next scene, a doctor walks towards Selena's parents. He tells them that Selena has died. ""Dreaming of You"" is played again, while her fans are seen holding pictures of her during a candlelight vigil. The movie ends with a picture of Selena waving goodbye reading ""April 16, 1971 – March 31, 1995""."
Characters.
"This is a list of the actors and their roles in ""Selena"":"
Production and marketing.
"Selena's family wanted to make a movie about Selena's life. They searched Hollywood, California for movie producers. Abraham then contacted Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz. They chose Gregory Nava as the movie director. Abraham told Esparza and Katz that he did not like Nava because of his ""ego"". The two producers told Abraham that everyone in Hollywood had an ""ego problem"". They also told him that Nava was the right guy."
"Nava spent one month with the Quintanilla family. He wrote down everything that the family said about Selena. By the fifth week, Nava had written the movie and showed Abraham the draft. Abraham was not happy — he did not want Selena's fans to think that eloping was a right thing to do. He also did not like the conflict between his character and Chris Perez. Nava responded that the information was ""life events"". He also said that even though he may seem like a ""bad guy"" in the movie, his actions after the marriage would make people see him differently. Abraham agreed and allowed the two stories in the movie. Salma Hayek was originally asked to play the role of Selena in the movie, but she turned it down. She felt that it was ""too early"" to base a movie on Selena and that it would be too emotional since Selena's death was still being covered on television."

Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Twenty-fifth Amendment (Amendment XXV) to the United States Constitution says that if the President becomes unable to do his or her job, the Vice President becomes the President (Section 1) or Acting President (Sections 3 or 4). This can happen for a short period of time, if the President is just sick or disabled for a short time. It could also happen until the end of the President's term (the President's time in office), if the President died, resigned, or is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office""."
"The Twenty-fifth Amendment also says what should happen if there is a ""vacancy"" in the Vice President's office (meaning there is no Vice President)."
"The Amendment was ratified by the states and became part of the U.S. Constitution on February 10, 1967."
Background.
of the Constitution says:
"This means that if the President is fired, dies, resigns, or is unable ""to discharge [his] Powers and Duties"" (unable to do the things a President has to do), the Vice President will take over their job. The Vice President will do the President's job until they get better (if they are just sick or disabled), or until the next Presidential election (if the President resigned or is dead). If neither the President nor the Vice President can do the President's job, Congress can decide who takes over the President's job. This is all the Constitution says about this subject."
This clause was not very specific. It did not say:
"In 1841, the ninth President, William Henry Harrison, became the first United States President to die in office. Before this, Representative John Williams had suggested that the Vice President should become Acting President if the President died. Also, after Harrison died, his Cabinet had met and decided that Vice President John Tyler would become ""Vice-President Acting President."" However, Tyler did not like this idea. He announced that he had become the President, and was not just doing the old President's job. He refused to look at any papers that were addressed to him as ""Acting President."""
"Tyler took the Presidential Oath, moved into the White House, and took over all of the old President's powers. Nobody formally challenged Tyler's claim to the Presidency. Eventually, both Houses of Congress passed a resolution saying that Tyler was the tenth President of the United States. This created ""the precedent of full succession."" A precedent is a rule or law that might be followed in the future if a similar situation came up again. ""Full succession"" means that the Vice President would become the President, not Acting President, if the actual President died. The ""precedent of full succession"" became known as the ""Tyler Precedent."""
"At other times, Presidents did not die, but they were unable to do their jobs because of illness. For example, during his Presidency, Woodrow Wilson had a stroke. However, the First Lady, Edith Wilson, and the official White House doctor kept the stroke a secret. Because of this, no one took over the Presidency, even though Wilson could not do the job at that time."
"Before the 25th Amendment, the office of Vice President had been empty eighteen times because the Vice President died, resigned, or had to take over for the President. For example, there was no Vice President for nearly four years after Franklin D. Roosevelt died."
These problems made it clear that the government needed more specific rules.
Kennedy assassination.
"On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Kennedy's assassination made it very clear to Congress that they needed to figure out a solution about presidential succession right away. The United States was in the middle of the Cold War. The new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, had previously had a heart attack in 1955 along with a family history of Johnson men dying relatively young (in their early 60s, which he did in 1973 aged 64). The next two people in line for the presidency were the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John McCormack (who was 71 years old), and the President pro tempore of the Senate, Carl Hayden (who was 86 years old). Congress started moving more quickly."
Proposals.
Members of Congress suggested two different amendments to fill in the details missing from Clause 6.
"The KeatingKefauver Proposal suggested allowing Congress to make a law about who should decide when a President is disabled. It was proposed in 1963 by Senator Kenneth Keating of New York,p. 345 and supported by Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver.p. 28 However, other Senators were worried that Congress could abuse this power, or would not actually make the law after the amendment was passed.pp. 30–35"
"The BayhCeller Proposal ended up becoming the Twenty-fifth Amendment. On January 6, 1965, Senator Birch Bayh proposed the amendment in the United States Senate, and Representative Emanuel Celler (Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee) proposed it in the United States House of Representatives. Unlike the KeatingKefauver Proposal, it suggested a way to fill the Vice President's position if it was empty, and also set out rules for how a President could be declared ""disabled.""pp. 348–350"
"On February 19, 1965, the Senate passed the amendment. However, the House passed a different version of the amendment on April 13. The House and Senate had to form committees to figure out a version of the amendment they could all agree on. On July 6, 1965, both Houses of Congress passed the final version of the amendment and sent it to the states for ratification."
Ratification.
"As with all Constitutional amendments proposed by the Congress, the Twenty-fifth Amendment had to be ratified by three-fourths of the states (38 of 50). Ratification was complete 19 months after the Amendment was proposed. Another nine states subsequently also ratified the Amendment; three states did not vote to ratify the Amendment."
The states ratified the Amendment in this order:
Effects.
Section 1: Presidential succession.
"Section 1 made the ""Tyler Precedent"" a law. It says that if a President is removed from office, dies, or resigns, the Vice President immediately becomes President (not ""Acting President"")."
Section 2: Vice Presidential vacancy.
"Before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, if the Vice President's position was empty, it stayed empty until the next election."

Tre fiamme (Galmanini)
The Tre flames is a ceiling lamp designed in 1946 by italian architect Gualtiero Galmanini.
Description.
"The three-flame chandelier is one of the first Italian works of industrial design, it is created in wood, brass and rope, with three lantern lampshades in opal glass."
Starry sky chandelier (Galmanini)
The Starry sky chandelier (Lampadario cielo stellato) is a ceiling lamp designed in 1956 by italian architect Gualtiero Galmanini.
"The chandelier, in a single numbered work of art, as a sculpture, was installed in 1956 in an apartment in Milan, following an art exhibition, with the prototype and the projects of the unique work. The work represents the birth of industrial design in the italian fifties. Its value today is priceless."
"The chandelier is characterized by a series of ceiling stars of particular significance, inspired by the world of planetariums, with the desire to piece together the stellar worlds. The starry skies were one of the typical representative works of Italian design of the 1950s, the most prestigious and interesting period of study in the history of Italian design."
"Galmanini's design work is a tribute to his friend and companion of innovative avant-garde architectural researches Piero Portaluppi with whom he frequently dissertated on astronomy, the universe and stars. Portaluppi collected astrolabes and sundials, often making inlays with stars, such as the famous window of Palazzo Necchi. Portaluppi was also the architect of the innovative Planetarium in Milan, with its starry sky."
"From the 1950s, also due to Galmanini's promotion in architectural circles, the roofs of starry skies became a symbol of architecture and innovative avant-garde."

Baltic states
"The Baltic states are three countries in Northern Europe to the east of the Baltic Sea and the south of the Gulf of Finland. They are, from north to south, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The languages that are spoken in these countries are different: while Lithuanians and Latvians speak Baltic languages (Latvian and Lithuanian), Estonians speak an Uralic language (Estonian)."
"By their culture and history, the Baltic countries are close to the Nordic countries. The biggest difference in the history was that the Baltic countries incorporated to the Soviet Union in 1940 (during the Second World War), but not the Nordic countries (with the exception of Karelia, a part of Finland which later joined the Russian SFSR). The three countries would become republics of the Soviet Union as the Estonian SSR, Latvian SSR, and Lithuanian SSR."
"All three Baltic states had their freedom back in 1991, when the Soviet Union came to an end. However, the states all consider the Soviet occupation to be illegal, which has been supported by the United States, European Union, and United Nations. Today, the Baltic countries are some of the richest and most advanced countries which were part of the Soviet Union. They became members of the European Union and NATO in 2004, joined the Schengen Area in 2007, and became part of the eurozone by 2015."
Paganism was the religion of Baltic people before most of them took Christianity during the Middle Ages. Baltic paganism never died out and some people are still pagans.
Topography
"Topography means ""the description of shape"". The word comes from Greek: ' ""place"" and ' ""(I) write"". It is an important part of earth science."
"When you talk of the topography of the land, you refer to the landscape features like valleys, hills and mountains, rivers and lakes, or the coastline. Everything that describes the form of the landscape, is part of the topography. Topographic maps show topography."
Bornholm
"Bornholm is a small, rocky island in the Baltic Sea. Bornholm is a Danish island."
"The island is a popular holiday resort for Scandinavians, Germans and Poles. Many yachters come here in the summer."
"At the end of World War II, the island was ""liberated"" by the Soviet red army, and held for several months after the German surrender. The island lies far east of the demarcation line between the allied forces in Europe. For some time the Soviet presence looked like an occupation. It was not until April 5th, 1946 that the island at last was free."
But then the Danish government took over and the island is today a Danish colony. But the struggle for a free island still goes on as it can be seen on this page Free Bornholm
Budapest
"Budapest is the capital and largest city of Hungary. It was made as such in 1873. In that year three towns on the River Danube, namely ""Buda"", ""Óbuda (Old Buda)"" and ""Pest"" were united. About 1.7 million people live in the city. Its highest place is ""János Hill (527 m.)"""
Climate.
Budapest has a humid subtropical climate with relatively cold winters and quite warm summers.
History.
Celtic tribes lived there before 1 AD. Later Roman empire transformed the first settlements into the Roman town of Aquincum. The Hungarians arrived in the territory of modern Hungary only in the end of 9th century AD.
"Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a great power that dissolved in 1918 after World War I. The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Battle of Budapest in 1945, and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956."
Landmarks.
"Budapest has historical buildings, baths and parks."
"The Roman Catholic cathedral, the St. Stephen's Basilica is in the 5th district of Budapest. The church is a Neo-Renaissance-style cathedral. It is one of the most significant church buildings in Hungary. The building is named in honor of the Hungarian founding king, St. Stephen (975-1038), whose right hand, the Holy Right, is kept here as a relic. With a height of 96 meters, it is the fourth-tallest building in the country and the third tallest in the capital after the Parliament and the MOL Campus."
"The former royal palace, the Buda Castle -as part of the Castle District- has been part of Budapest's World Heritage Sites since 1987. The Gothic-style royal palace was built in the 1300s and lasted until the end of the 1400s. Due to the Turkish occupation from 1541 to 1686, very serious damage was done to both the castle and the buildings of the Castle District. In the building of the palace, the National Széchényi Library has been located in the back, decorated with Art Nouveau elements, and the Hungarian National Gallery and the Budapest History Museum are located in the palace."
"Also on the Castle Hill, the Matthias Church is a Gothic church with a great historical past. It was originally built in Romanesque style in 1015, but was destroyed during the Mongol invasion in 1241. The current building was built in the 14th century and underwent a thorough reconstruction in the late 19th century. After the occupation of Buda, the church was transformed into a mosque, during which the late Gothic frescoes inside the church were destroyed. After the liberation of Buda, according to the plans of Frigyes Schulek, it was restored to its second, Gothic state. During the Second World War, it was used as a camp by the Germans and the Soviets during the siege of Budapest."
"The Hungarian Parliament Building, also known as the Parliament of Budapest after its location, is the seat of the National Assembly of Hungary, a notable landmark of Hungary, and a popular tourist destination in Budapest. It is situated on the Kossuth Lajos Square in the Pest side of the city, on the eastern bank of the Danube. It was designed by Hungarian architect Imre Steindl in neo-Gothic style and opened in 1902. It has been the largest building in Hungary since its completion, and the third biggest Parliament building in the world."
"Further north, the building of the National Police Headquarters (in the common language “Police-Palace”) located in the Árpád Göncz City Center. Since its completion, its shape and size have been one of the defining buildings of the whole of Budapest in terms of cityscape. The plans were completed in the 1990s by József Finta and Géza Meichl, and their construction was financed by Postabank collaborating with the Hungarian police. 36,000 cubic meters of concrete and 4.5 thousand tons of rebar were used for the construction. The headquarters can be divided into two parts, one eight-story and columnar and the other sixteen stories and cylindrical, with police antennas at the top that extend 93 meters high. In 2007, an unknown person fired at the building with a machine gun."
"On the south, in the 10th district of Budapest, located the transmission tower on Száva Street. With a height of 154 meters, it is the third-tallest structure in Budapest (after the Mount Széchenyi TV mast and the chimney of Óbuda Power Plant). The tower is well visible from the southern Pest region of the capital, but it can be seen in several lookouts of Buda too. It was built in 1987, and it is currently owned by Hungarian Telekom. As a backbone transmitter, it broadcasts digital terrestrial radio (T-DAB +) and digital television channels (DVB-T standard, MinDig TV and mobile phone DVB-H)."
"Other landmarks in Budapest are the Citadel, the Statue of Liberty, the Millenium Monument, the Zoo, the Hungarian National Museum, the Great Market Hall, the Dohány Street Synagogue and the famous thermal baths (Széchenyi, Szent Gellért, Király). Budapest is also known for the ruins of Aquincum, the capital city of the Roman Province of Pannonia."

Story.
"The Smart Brain corporation, the world's most powerful corporation, is trying to take over the world using Orphnoch, the ""next stage in humanity's evolution"", to covertly kill off the human population. In pursuit of this, they develop three suits of power armor, called Rider Gears (each for Delta, Faiz, and Kaixa), to find and protect the Orphnoch King, who can fix a defect within Orphnoch DNA which causes their genetic structure to break down, leading to death."
"The Rider Gears are stolen by Hanagata, the Goat Orphnoch and former chief of Smart Brain. He sends them to his foster children (dubbed the ""Ryuseiji"", after the school they attended) so they can stop the Orphnoch from achieving their goal. However, Rider Gears were designed to be worn by Orphnoch, and humans are unable to activate the systems without undergoing genetic generation."
"A young loner, Takumi Inui, is unwittingly drawn into the conflict between the Orphnoch and humans and becomes Kamen Rider Faiz to save the life of Mari Sonada, one of the Ryuseiji. Smart Brain begins training him in an attempt to retrieve the Faiz Gear."
"However, there is division amongst the Orphnoch, as those who wish to co-exist with humans rather than kill him, begin resisting the Smart Brain, who in turn targets them as well. Most of these ""renegade"" Orphnochs are either killed, remain neutral or begin siding with the Ryuseiji against the Smart Brain."
"When the Tokyo police discover the Orphnoch are behind a series of bizarre murders, they begin operations to defeat the creatures, largely unaware of the various factions involved. They even begin performing experiments on captured Orphnoch in an attempt to find ways of destroying them, though this does not go well."
"The Orphnoch King eventually awakens within a young boy named Teruo Suzuki, whom Naoya Kaido and Keitaro Kikuchi saved and befriended. Now, it is up to the holders of the Rider Gears to band together and fight for humanity's survival."

Dashcam
"A dashcam, short for ""dashboard camera"" is a video camera inside a car or other road vehicle that records driving and sometimes what's happening inside the car (useful for taxi drivers) they normally suction onto the cars windscreen and are powered from the car, some have an extra camera that can be put in the rear windscreen to record what's happening behind."
"Dashcams are useful because video doesn't lie, it can for instance be used to see who caused a crash, important because some people deliberately crash into innocent peoples cars and blame them for causing the crash, so they can claim it on their insurance, dashcam footage can settle this, it's also important in other accident investigations, even ones that you weren't involved in, they have also recorded meteors and even airplane crashes."
"Early kinds of dashcam were used by police to film their patrols, but ones made for the average joe have become increasingly avalible in the last 10 or so years."
Dashcams are very popular in Russia.
"The industrial products are transportation equipment, commercial and private aircraft, food processing, publishing, chemical products, machinery, apparel, petroleum, and mining. 4% of Kansas's GDP is from the aviation industry. Many parts of airplanes are made in Wichita. Also, many important companies are near Kansas City, Missouri. For example, the Sprint Nextel Corporation is one of the biggest telephone companies in the United States. Its main operational offices are in Overland Park, Kansas."
Energy.
"Kansas has many renewable resources. Kansas is one of the biggest producers of wind power in the United States. In 2019, Kansas had an installed capacity of about 6,100 Megawatts (MW) from about 3,200 wind turbines. Wind produced the biggest amount of electricity from the state at 41%. An additional 700 MW of capacity was scheduled to become available during 2020. Kansas is also one of the biggest national producers of renewable ethanol and biodiesel fuels; Kansas produces about 600 million gallons per year."
"Kansas is eighth in US petroleum extraction. Production has slowly lowered because Kansas's limited economical reserves (especially from the Anadarko Basin) are being used up. Since oil prices reached their lowest level in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained about the same; it had an average monthly rate of about in 2004. The recent higher prices have made carbon dioxide sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical."
"Kansas is also eighth in US natural gas production. Production has slowly lowered since the mid-1990s with the slow depletion of the Hugoton Natural Gas Field—the state's biggest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased coalbed methane production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over ."
Taxes.
"During his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor Sam Brownback said he would get rid of the state income tax. In May 2012, Governor Brownback signed into law the Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117. Starting in 2013, the ""ambitious tax overhaul"" lowered income tax, got rid of some corporate taxes, and created pass-through income tax exemptions. He raised the sales tax by one percent to make up for the loss of the other taxes. However, the sales tax was not enough to make up for it. He made cuts to education and some state services to make up for the lost revenue. The tax cut led to years of budget shortfalls. The worst was a $350 million budget shortfall in February 2017. From 2013 to 2017, 300,000 businesses were considered to be pass-through income entities and benefited from the tax exemption. The tax reform ""encouraged tens of thousands of Kansans to claim their wages and salaries as income from a business rather than from employment."""
"The economic growth that Brownback hoped for never happened. He argued that it was because of ""low wheat and oil prices and a fewer aircraft sales."" The state general fund debt load was $83 million in fiscal year 2010. By fiscal year 2017 the debt load sat at $179 million. In 2016, Governor Brownback earned the title of ""most unpopular governor in America"". Only 26 percent of Kansas voters approved of his job performance. 65 percent said they did not. In the summer of 2016, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded Kansas's credit rating. In February 2017, S&amp;P lowered it to AA-."
"In February 2017, a bi-partisan group wrote a bill that would repeal the pass-through income exemption, the ""most important provisions of Brownback's overhaul"", and raise taxes to make up for the budget shortfall. Brownback vetoed the bill but ""45 GOP legislators had voted in favor of the increase, while 40 voted to uphold the governor's veto."" On June 6, 2017 a group of Democrats and newly elected Republicans overrode Brownback's veto. They increased taxes to an amount that is close to what it was before 2013. Brownback's tax plan was described in a June 2017 article in ""The Atlantic"" as the United States' ""most aggressive experiment in conservative economic policy"". The tax cuts had made schools and infrastructure difficult to get funding in Kansas."
Transportation.
Highways.
"There are two interstate highways in Kansas. The first part of the interstate highway opened on Interstate 70 west of Topeka. It opened on November 14, 1956."
"Interstate 70 is an important east–west highway. People can go from Kansas City, Missouri to Denver, Colorado. Cities on this highway include Colby, Hays, Salina, Junction City, Topeka, Lawrence, Bonner Springs, and Kansas City."
"Interstate 35 is a major north–south highway from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to Des Moines, Iowa. Cities on this highway include Wichita, El Dorado, Emporia, Ottawa, and Kansas City (and suburbs)."
Airports.
"Kansas's only major commercial (Class C) airport is Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport. It is along US-54 on the western part of Wichita. Manhattan Regional Airport in Manhattan has flights every day to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. This would it the second-biggest commercial airport in Kansas. Most air travelers in northeastern Kansas fly out of Kansas City International Airport, which is in Platte County, Missouri. Some also use the Topeka Regional Airport in Topeka."
"In the state's southeastern part, people often use Tulsa International Airport in Tulsa, Oklahoma or Joplin Regional Airport in Joplin, Missouri. People in the far western part of the state often use the Denver International Airport. Connecting flights are also available from smaller Kansas airports in Dodge City, Garden City, Hays, Hutchinson, Liberal, or Salina."
Rail.
Passenger Rail.
"The ""Southwest Chief"" Amtrak route goes through the state on its route from Chicago to Los Angeles. Stops in Kansas include Lawrence, Topeka, Newton, Hutchinson, Dodge City, and Garden City. An Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach connects Newton and Wichita to the Heartland Flyer in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Amtrak may change the Southwest Chief route from using train service for the entire route. Plans call for shortening the route to Los Angeles to instead end in Albuquerque. Buses would replace the train on the route between Albuquerque and Dodge City, where train service east to Chicago would continue."
Freight Rail.
"Kansas has four Class I railroads, Amtrak, BNSF, Kansas City Southern, and Union Pacific, as well as many shortline railroads."
Law and government.

Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport
"Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is an airport near Washington, D.C.. It is in Arlington County, Virginia. It is the commercial airport closest to Washington, D.C. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) is in control of the airport. It is named after 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan."
"Flights into and out of DCA cannot be longer than . This rule is used to limit the number of aircraft over Washington. It causes most of the air traffic to be sent to the Washington Dulles International Airport which is larger and further from the city. There are some exceptions to this rule. In 2010, the airport served about 18.1 million passengers. Reagan National is a focus city for American Airlines. They are the airport's largest carrier. The American Airlines Shuttle has air shuttle service to LaGuardia Airport in New York City and Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts. Delta Air Lines' Delta Shuttle also has air shuttle service to LaGuardia. These shuttle flights leave Reagan International about once an hour. An exception to this rule permits 20 long-haul flights a day. Most are from the west coast: non-stops from Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Portland Oregon. However, San Juan Puerto Rico is also part of this group. These exemptions were created in 2003 and 2012."
History.
"Hoover Field, which opened in 1926, was the first major terminal in the Washington area and was located on a piece of land close to where the Pentagon stands today. The airport had one runway that crossed a local street, which meant that tarmac workers had to stop automobile traffic during take-offs and landings. The next year, Washington Airport, another privately operated field,was opened next to it. In 1930, the economic turmoil caused by the Great Depression caused the two terminals to join to form Washington-Hoover Airport. Washington-Hoover Airport's initial field was in a poor and undesirable location. On one side of the airport was U.S. Route 1, an important highway in the D.C. area. The highway had electrical wires running alongside it, meaning that it posed as a threat to planes that landed and took off from the field. Additionally, there was also a smokestack that was dangerously close and in the way of one of the runway. A dump was also very close to the airport."
"Thirty-seven studies done between 1926 and 1938 showed the need for a better airport. However, due to a law that did not allow the federal government to build airports, it could not be considered or planned for. On top of this, Congress refused to even attempt to make plans for a new airport. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, knowing this information, grew tired of waiting on Congress, and moved forward with attempting to create the new airport, which he could do on the technicality that he was allowed to spend money when Congress was not in session. He used that power to spend $15 million to construct a new airport that better served the nation's capital, and construction on Washington National Airport broke ground in 1938. Congress did not think that what FDR did was legal, but did not stop the construction from being built."
"The airport today sits south of Washington, D.C., parallel to U.S. Route 1. The eastern side of the airport had to be enlarged to make room for the runways, so developers filled in a small section of the Potomac River to make room for them. The western part of the airport was once part of a large Virginia plantation, known as . For many years the plantation house was near where the airport parking lot stands today, but in 1930, the house burned down. In 1998, efforts to preserve the site of where the house once stood were made by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, and a small exhibit of the house exists today in Terminal 1 of the airport."
"The airport opened on June 16, 1941. In 1945, Congress passed a law that said that the airport was in Virginia but under the control of the federal government."
"The April 1957 ""Official Airline Guide"" shows that the airport had 316 weekday departures."
"In 1977, the Washington Metro opened a station at the airport along the Blue and Yellow lines."
Expansion.
The location of the runways is limited by the location of the airport. It has not changed much over time. One of the few changes was made in 1956. The fourth runway was closed. It was an east-west runway. It is now used just for moving aircraft and for parking them. The terminal building was made larger in 1958. The North Terminal was added. The two buildings were connected in 1961. A United Airlines building was built in 1965. Facilties for American Airlines were built in 1968. A commuter terminal was built in 1970.
"Although the airport has been made larger, there have been efforts to limit this. Because of the use of jet aircraft and the amount of traffic, Congress passed the Washington Airport Act of 1950. This caused the opening of Dulles Airport in 1962. Problems with noise caused noise restrictions to be made. This happened before jet aircraft use began in 1966. The Federal Aviation Administration put restrictions on National and four other airports in 1969 to limit problems with high amounts of traffic."
Transfer of control and renaming.
"In 1984, Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole created a group to look into moving control of National and Dulles Airports from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to a local group. The selected group(s) could use the money the airports made to pay make them better. The group felt that it would be better for one agency to be in control of both airports. The other choice was to have Virginia control Dulles and the District of Columbia control National. In 1987, Congress gave control of the airport from the FAA to the new Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA). This groups choices were still under the control of a Congressional review panel. The constitutionality of the review panel was later challenged in the Supreme Court. The Court has twice said that it was not constitutional. Even after this, Congress still takes control of the airports."
"In 1998, some friends of Ronald Reagan wanted to name things in all 50 states after him. They wanted a law that would change the name of the airport to ""Ronald Reagan Airport"". Democratic Congressmen thought it would be better to change the name of the building of the Bureau of the Public Debt instead. They said that the airport was already named after George Washington. Congress chose to change the name of the airport to ""Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport"". Because of the length of the name, many people call it ""National Airport"". Congress did not give money to make new signs with the new names. Because of this, it took time for the name to be used commonly. The name of the airport's Metro station is still ""National Airport"". In early 2001, a letter signed by 24 members of Congress asked that WMATA change the name of the station. A policy from 1987 says that if a group wants to change the name of a station that they must pay the cost of changing the signs and maps. The price to make these changes was thought to be $400,000. Because of this, the name was not changed. This caused Republican Congressman Bob Barr of Georgia to say they would not give money to the agency unless the station was renamed. Congress ultimately voted to require the renaming on November 30. According to the General Manager at the time, Richard A. White, Metro paid to rename the station."
Accidents.
Air Florida Flight 90.
"On the afternoon of January 13, 1982, after some very cold weather and a morning of blizzard conditions, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed on take-off. It had been waiting forty-nine minutes on a taxiway and took off with ice and snow on the wings. The Boeing 737 aircraft could not gain altitude. Less than from the end of the runway, the airplane hit the 14th Street Bridge. It cut off the tops off vehicles and fell through the ice covering the Potomac River. The weather and traffic caused problems with helping the people on the plane. With the help of people in the cars, a United States Park Service police helicopter crew, and one of the plane's passengers who later died, five people on the plane were saved. The other 74 people on the plane died. Four people in the vehicles on the bridge also died."

"In an address to a branch of the Arab Ba’ath Party, Aflaq speaks of ""‘the Arab mission’"". This ‘Arab mission’ is to return the Arabs to the greatness they were in the past and to unite the Arab regions to form one nation, also known as pan-Arabism. He says: ""“The experience in which our struggle takes place is that of the Arab nation dismembered into different countries and statelets, artificial and counterfeit; we struggle until we can reunite these scattered members[…]”""""."" According to Aflaq, this mission can only be accomplished through revolution: ""“Our past was a revolution and we will never reach its level or meet with it except through revolution.”"""
Ba'athism in Syria.
The beginning of the Ba'ath party in Syria.
"In the year 1943, the Ba’ath Arab Socialist Party was founded in Syria by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar. The two met when they were studying in Paris from 1928 to 1934. The two were already nationalists before they went to study in France. However, it is during their stay in France that they learned about and adopted the ideas of socialism. They returned to Syria to work as teachers and in 1943 started the Ba’ath Arab Socialist Party. Syria became independent from France in 1946 and continued as a democracy. However, Syria still had problems within but also problematic relationships with the surrounding countries. The country was still in chaos and figuring itself out when the army decided to take matters into its own hands in 1949 by overthrowing the government. After this, a series of coups followed in quick succession. In 1958, Egypt and Syria formed a union to become the United Arab Republic. However, Syria decided to separate after 3 years in 1961, because Egypt was too dominant in the union. Throughout the years, Ba'athist ideas had been spreading in Syria and also within parts of the Syrian army. This resulted in a Ba'athist coup in 1963 by army officers. Among these officers was Hafez al-Assad who later in 1970 seized power in Syria."
Syria under the al-Assad reign.
"Hafez al-Assad and his son Basher al-Assad have ruled Syria under the Ba’ath party and their version of the Ba’ath ideology. Hafez al-Assad ruled over Syria from 1970 until his death in 2000. During his reign, many atrocities as well as assassinations took place against those who opposed him. After his death, his son Basher al-Assad succeeded him and to-date rules over Syria. Under his reign, the Syrian Civil War started."
Ba'athism in Iraq.
The beginning of the Ba'ath party in Iraq.
"After the Ba’ath party was established in 1943 in Syria, Ba’athism reached Iraq in the late 1940s and became well known among young university students. In 1951, Fu ‘ad al-Rikabi became the founder and first leader of the Iraqi Regional Branch. The Iraqi Regional Branch was an Iraqi version of the Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party. With time, more students became a member of the Iraqi Ba’ath party. By 1955, its members numbered 300. In 1956, Saddam Hussein became a member as well. On July 17, 1968, the party succeeded in overthrowing the government after a failed coup d'état in 1963, and began its thirty-five-year domination of Iraq."
Important events during the reign of the Ba'ath party.
"After the overthrow in 1968, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr was appointed as the new president of Iraq. During his reign, he nationalised the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), which stimulated the economic growth of the country. In July 1979, Saddam Hussein took over the presidentship of al-Bakr and started his twenty-four-year rulership. In 1980, the Iran-Iraq war emerged, which has seen eight years of severe violence and is notable for the use of chemical and biological warfare. In 1990, Iraq led the invasion of Kuwait, which led to its second major war, namely the Gulf war in 1991. In 2003, the reign of Saddam Hussein and the Ba'ath party came to an end when the United States led the invasion of Iraq, also known as the start of the Iraq war."
Post-Ba'ath era.
"In May 2003, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) recognized, through Resolution 1483, the military occupation of Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom. They ended the economic sanctions, which had been in place for thirteen years, and permitted humanitarian aid, reconstruction and the establishment of a new government. Despite the optimistic plans for the future, Iraq was close to collapse at the end of 2006, which was also caused by the execution of Saddam Hussein on December 30th. The loss of the then Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his party, who was at power since 2006, during the 2010 elections for a new assembly and government, and the departure of the US forces in 2011 contributed to a tense situation. In addition to the political tension, Iraq has also suffered a lot from Islamic extremist organizations such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS until today."
Denton Cooley
"Denton Arthur Cooley (August 22, 1920 – November 18, 2016) was an American heart surgeon. He was known for doing the first implantation of a complete artificial heart. Cooley was also the founder and surgeon in-chief of The Texas Heart Institute, chief of Cardiovascular Surgery at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, consultant in Cardiovascular Surgery at Texas Children's Hospital, and a clinical professor of Surgery at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston."
"He studied zoology in the University of Texas and graduated in 1941. He began his medical education at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He completed his medical degree and his surgical training at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, where he also completed his internship. At Johns Hopkins, he worked with Dr. Alfred Blalock and helped with the first Blue Baby procedure to treat a child's congenital heart defect."
"In 1946, Cooley served as chief of surgical services at the station hospital in Linz, Austria for the Army Medical Corps. He was discharged (released) in 1948 with the rank of captain. Then, he returned to Johns Hopkins to remain as an instructor in surgery. In 1950, he went to London to work with Lord Russell Brock."
"Cooley died at his home in Houston on November 18, 2016, aged 96."
Pizzicato Polka
"The Pizzicato Polka is a piece of orchestral music by Johann Strauss II. Strauss composed it with his brother Josef in 1869 for a trip to Imperial Russia. It was published in 1870. The polka was written for string orchestra and glockenspiel. It was hugely popular, especially in Italy, where it was included on every program Strauss played there. The piece consists of four melodies and the work is arranged in ternary form (A-B-A). The piece is scored for plucked strings."
Emeritus
"Emeritus is a title given to a professor, bishop or other person with an important office. The title says that these people, while still holding their title, no longer practice their function. Usually, this is done because of old age. Usually the ""emeritus"" is put after the official title of the person, as in ""Professor emeritus""."
"In the time of the Roman Empire, it was used for soldiers, to say that they no longer needed to serve in the army. That way, a Bishop emeritus no longer needs to take part in the celebration of the mass, but he is still able to perform confirmations or to ordain priests."
Mumford &amp; Sons
Mumford &amp; Sons are an English folk rock band from London.
"The band was formed in 2007 by band members Marcus Mumford, Ben Lovett, Winston Marshall and Ted Dwane. Lead vocalist Marcus Mumford organised the band and their performances and was one of the most visible members of the band because of this the band decided to use the name Mumford &amp; Sons."
"They released their debut studio album ""Sigh No More"" on 2 October 2009. They later released their second studio album ""Babel"" on 21 September 2012. ""Babel"" won a Grammy Award for ""Album of the Year"" at the 2013 Grammy Awards. They were also a part of the documentary ""Big Easy Express"" which won a Grammy Award for ""Best Long Form Music Video""."
"His son, Otto Wilhelm von Struve (1819–1905) succeeded him as director (1862–89) of the Pulkovo Observatory."
Mario Party (series)
"Mario Party is a series of video games made by Nintendo. The idea of each game is that Mario and his friends must travel across a game board and earn stars and coins. Each new game in the series contains new characters, playing boards, and mini-games. Every few turns, each character must participate in a mini-game. The winner generally gets 10 coins."
Helsinki
"Helsinki () is the capital city of Finland. Helsinki is the largest city in Finland. 604,380 (31.12.2012) people live in Helsinki, and 1,360,000 live in the Helsinki metropolitan area."
"Helsinki is in the south of Finland, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. The city is in the Uusimaa region. When one looks from Helsinki, Tallinn is on the opposite side of the sea, but it is too far away to see. A poetic name for Helsinki is ""the daughter of the Baltic Sea""."
History.
"In 1550, Swedish king Gustav Vasa commanded people to build a new city and move there. His idea was to build a new place to trade, which would be more popular than Tallinn. The idea did not work well, and many people returned from Helsinki to their homes. Later Sweden built the fortress Suomenlinna in Helsinki. After Russia had taken Finland from Sweden in several wars, they started developing Helsinki. Helsinki became the capital of autonomous province of Finland. When Finland became independent in 1917, Helsinki stayed as the capital city."
Geography.
"Helsinki spreads around several bays and over several islands. Some famous islands include Seurasaari, Lauttasaari and Korkeasaari - which is also the country's biggest zoo - as well as the fortress island of Suomenlinna (Sveaborg)."
"The metropolitan area of Greater Helsinki also includes two of Finland's biggest cities, Espoo to the west of Helsinki, and Vantaa to the north. These two cities, along with Helsinki itself and the small town of Kauniainen (which is in fact surrounded by Espoo), make up the Capital Region (""Pääkaupunkiseutu"" in Finnish or ""Huvudstadsregionen"" in Swedish). There are other towns nearby that are part of Greater Helsinki, including Järvenpää, Kerava, Tuusula, Nurmijärvi, Sipoo, Kirkkonummi, Mäntsälä and Vihti. They have become popular places for Helsinki commuters to live."
Transport.
The public transportation network in Helsinki and its area consists of
"Helsinki Airport is located in Vantaa about 20 kilometers north of Helsinki city center. The airport offers both domestic flights within Finland and international flights to Europe, Asia and North America."
"Helsinki offers several boat services to Tallinn and Stockholm every day, along with ferries to places including the island of Suomenlinna."
Jehovah's Witnesses
"Jehovah's Witnesses are a religious group with more than eight million members around the world. They believe God, who's name is Jehovah (Ps. 83:18), will end crime, violence, sickness and death by destroying all wickedness in the world. They say that God's Kingdom (mentioned (thy Kingdom come) in the Lord's prayer) will restore God's original purpose for the Earth: bringing about peace for all humans who live by Bible standards."
"Their beliefs are based solely upon the Bible. These beliefs were taught by Charles Taze Russell, a preacher who started a Bible study group in Pennsylvania in 1876. The goal of Russell and other Bible Students, as the group was then known, was to promote the teachings of Jesus Christ and to follow the practices of the first-century Christian congregation. Since Jesus is the Founder of Christianity, they view him as the founder of their organization.—Colossians 1:18-20. They later started publishing a religious magazine called ""The Watchtower""."
"Some of their beliefs, especially about who God is and what his plans are for humans and the earth, are different from what is taught in most Christian churches. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only 144,000 people will go to heavenRev 7:1-17,Rev 14:1 and that all the other people who obey God will live forever on a paradise Earth. They do not believe that God is a Trinity. They believe Jesus died on a pole (also called '[torture] stake') rather than a cross. God rejects worship that uses images or symbols, including the cross ""Idolatry"" Ex 20:4-6. They teach that when people die, they remain in the grave until God resurrects them after God's Kingdom, or government, is ruling over earth."
"Jehovah's Witnesses are best known for preaching their beliefs from door-to-door and in other public places, and offering their magazines, ""The Watchtower"" and ""Awake!"" They are also well known for refusing to join armies and refusing blood transfusions."
History.
"In 1870 a young clothing shop owner named Charles Taze Russell heard an Adventist preacher speak. The preacher said the Bible contained clues that showed God was about to set up a kingdom, or government, over earth. He said the kingdom, which is mentioned many times in the New Testament of the Bible, would be based in heaven, and it would completely change the way of life for everyone in the world. Russell studied that preacher's teachings and looked through the Bible, and ended up with some new beliefs."
Beginnings.
"Using various Bible verses and events from history, Russell decided that God would soon call a group of ""saints"" to heaven to be kings there. Other faithful Christians who had since died would also make up a total of 144,000 kings in heaven. Churches at the time taught that humans were still waiting for Jesus to return to earth in his Second Coming, but Russell believed that clues in the Bible showed Jesus returned in 1874. Russell believed part of God's plan was to start Armageddon, which he thought would be a complete breakdown of law and order on earth, when governments and people would fight among themselves. He believed that God would then end sickness and death and allow obedient Christians to live forever in perfect health."
"Russell believed it was very important that all Christians, including those who were attending churches, should learn those ""truths"". He believed these ""truths"" had been carefully hidden in the Bible for thousands of years. He started a publishing group called the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. He wrote several books, set up some Bible study classes for people to study his teachings, and started a magazine, ""Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence"", which taught that Christ was already present. He wrote that God would bring about all those events by 1914."
A new president.
"By the time Russell died in 1916, he had written 50,000 pages, with almost 20 million copies of his books printed and distributed around the world. Joseph Franklin Rutherford, one of his followers, took Russell's position as president of the Watch Tower Society."
"Rutherford wrote many books as well. He made some changes to Russell's teachings and required all the study groups, or congregations, around the world to agree to the teachings and rules set by the Watch Tower Society in New York. He told all members to no longer celebrate all holidays, singing at religious meetings was strictly prohibited and preaching from door to door about God's Kingdom and to distribute Watch Tower Society publications so more people would hear the message was mandatory. Many members did not agree with Rutherford's harsh changes, and some started their own groups. In 1931 Rutherford called his group ""Jehovah's Witnesses"" to tell it apart from the other groups. By the time Rutherford died in 1942, the religion had a worldwide membership of 115,000."

Pinocchio (2022 live-action movie)
"Pinnochio is a 2022 American musical fantasy film directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay by Zemeckis and Chris Weitz. The film, produced by Walt Disney Pictures, is a live-action adaptation of Walt Disney's 1940 animated film of the same name, which is itself based on the 1883 Italian book ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"", by Carlo Collodi. The film stars Tom Hanks, Cynthia Erivo, and Luke Evans with Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Keegan-Michael Key in voice roles."
"""Pinocchio"" was released on September 8, 2022, by Disney+. The film received mixed reviews from critics."
Plot.
"A hobo cricket named Jiminy Cricket enters the home of an elderly woodcarver named Geppetto, accompanied by his pet kitten Figaro and pet fish Cleo, and finds that he has completed work on a marionette puppet he names Pinocchio. When Geppetto decides to retire for the night, he makes a wish on a star. A few hours later, the star magically brings Pinocchio to life and he is soon visited by the Blue Fairy, who tells Pinocchio that if he acts brave, truthful and selfless, he can be a real boy and she also appoints Jiminy the responsibility of being Pinocchio's conscience to teach him right from wrong. When Geppetto awakens and finds Pinocchio alive, he is at first shocked, but becomes overjoyed."
"After a few days, Geppetto decides that Pinocchio should attend school and sends him there. However, Pinocchio is soon approached by a con-artist fox and cat named ""Honest"" John and Gideon as they convince him that he should live a life of fame in order to truly be a real boy, when they really want to sell him to the puppet master Stromboli in exchange for wealth. Jiminy, who finds Pinocchio with the help of a seagull named Sofia, convinces Pinocchio to continue going to school. Unfortunately Pinocchio is thrown out of school on account of being a puppet, so he decides to go to Stromboli's after all and Jiminy can't stop him when John places a glass jar over him."
"At Stromboli's theater, Pinocchio befriends one of Stromboli's employees Vitelli and her puppet Sabina. Pinocchio puts on a good show for the crowd as they throw their cash to him, but Stromboli locks Pinocchio in a bird cage to prevent him from ever leaving, wanting to exploit Pinocchio for all he's worth. Soon, Stromboli's coach ends up freeing Jiminy from the jar and when he enters the coach, he manages to help Pinocchio escape when Pinocchio has him reach the keys to the lock on the cage by telling lies since that makes his nose grow. Geppetto, Figaro and Cleo go out to look for Pinocchio when he fails to come home for dinner."
"Soon, Pinocchio is swiped up by a coach full of children driven by a charismatic Coachman, who is taking the kids to Pleasure Island, an isle where misbehavior is encouraged. When they reach the island, Pinocchio slowly gets disturbed by the amount of cruelty the kids commit, much to the bemusement of an unruly boy named Lampwick. When Jiminy, who got separated from Pinocchio again, makes it to the island, he soon finds out that the kids their get turned into donkeys and the Coachman sells them to the salt-mines with help from his fog-like henchmen. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick get transformed himself at a pool hall and he and Jiminy escape the island before the Coachman and his goons can get them, but not before Pinocchio gains a donkey's ears and tail."
"Pinocchio and Jiminy make it back to Geppetto's but find that he's not home because Sofia gave him a flyer of Pleasure Island to let him know where Pinocchio is and that he sold all of his clocks to buy a boat to go there. While trying to find Geppetto, Pinocchio reunites with Vitelli and Sabina, who tell him that Stromboli has been arrested and they have taken over his puppet show. They offer Pinocchio to join them, but Pinocchio declines, wanting to save his father, which makes his donkey parts disappear. Sofia pulls a rope for Pinocchio to hold out to the sea, where they soon find Geppetto in his boat. Just as they reunite, they are swallowed by a giant sea monster named Monstro. They take refuge in a giant boat in Monstro's stomach, and Pinocchio gets the idea to make him sneeze by starting a fire within him. The plan is successful, and Monstro sneezes them out, but he gives a chase that ends with him and the group crashing on dry land and rendering Geppetto unconscious."
"Pinocchio thinks Geppetto has died, and despairs before Geppetto comes to and soon tells Pinocchio that despite being a puppet, he has proven himself to be a true boy at heart for all that he's done and they depart for home as Pinocchio slowly transforms into a real boy. Jiminy then breaks the fourth wall before ending the film."

Biscotti
"Biscotti is an Italian type of almond biscuit. It originated from the Tuscan city of Prato. They are twice-baked, oblong-shaped, dry, crunchy, and may be dipped in a drink, traditionally Vin Santo."
Biscotti is also known as cantucci.
History.
Italy.
"Although commonly used to indicate the biscuits of Prato, ""biscotti di Prato"", in modern Italy and Argentina they are also known widely by the name ""cantuccini"". These names sound similar to other regional products of Italy. The term cantuccini is most commonly used today in Tuscany, but originally refers to variations or imitations which deviate from the traditional recipe in a few key points such as the use of yeasts, acids (to make them less dry) and flavourings. Rusks are larger, longer biscuits, rustic bread dough enriched with olive oil and anise seeds."
"The confusion on the name may have been born from the fact that on the old sign (still present) of ""Biscottificio Antonio Mattei,"" the leading manufacturer of biscuits of Prato, is written just below the name of the shop: ""Manufacturers of cantuccini,"" which at the time were one of the major products of the biscuits. The sign has remained unchanged, and after such a long time people are accustomed to associate the name ""cantuccini"" with the biscuits typical of Sardinia and Sicily."
Preparation.
"Biscotti is made with flour, sugar, eggs and almonds or pine nuts. Sometimes they have a layer of glaze, usually chocolate."
The Jaguars
"The Jaguars (ザ・ジャガーズ, ""Za jagāzu"") is a Japanese group sound band that was created in 1964 until 1971. The band sung many both Japanese and English music covers, manly The Rolling Stones, The Nashville Teens, Paul Revere And The Raiders, and other American and British band groups."
Overview.
"The predecessor of The Jaguars was active as an electric group at jazz cafes under the name of ""Yukio Miya and The Play Five"" in April 1964. In 1965, they began to appear regularly on electric programs such as the TV programs ""Beat No. 1"" and ""Young Pops Excite"", and the band's name recognition gradually increased. In May of the following year, Shin Okamoto, who was a 16 year old vocalist from Kanagawa at that time, reluctantly joined the group and they became popular in the magazines and songs. The Play Five was renamed to The Jaguars in June 1967 and made their record debut with ""Kimi Niaitai"" (Want To See You Again)."
"This debut songs was a big hit, and popular songs such as ""Dancing Lonely Night"" and ""Mademoiselle Bruce"" were skipped one after another. In March 1968, The Jaguars first and only appeared in many televisions shows and of course there was a movie called ""Make Way For The Jaguars"" (directed by Yôichi Maeda and produced by Shochiku), but at the end of the same month, the band leader Yukio Miya withdrew due to internal conflict with the music directors. After Yukio left the group, 19 year old Takeshi Hamano joined the alternative drums in April and Shin became the leader of the group at the age of 20. In June, they released a hit song ""The Legend of Xanadu"" and in September with ""Two People In The Starry Sky"", but in January 1969, ""Bruce for Lovers"" was a remarkably popular song like other GS songs. It has become a song that has been turned into a musical stage play."
"Around this time, the GS genre began to fade as disco and funky music became to flourish in Japan, and lead guitarist Hisayuki Okitsu left the group due to illness treatment, and in 1970, keyboardist Yasuji Sato and Takeshi Hamano also leaving, thus repeating member changes. After ""Someday Someone"" released in April 1970, they became active in nightclubs in Tokyo without a release song in 1971, but did not hold any dissolution concerts, and The Jaguars ended was in July 1971. After appearing in ""Goodbye Nikki Western Carnival"" in 1981, the band was reunited when ""Want To Meet You"" song was appointed as a commercial for Asahi Breweries, but in 2009, due to the death of Shin Okamoto, The band dissolved again soon after."
Vikram Bhatt
"Vikram Bhatt (born 27 January 1969 in Bombay) is an Indian film director, producer, screenwriter and actor. Formerly, he was the creative head of ASA Productions and Enterprises until 2014, when he resigned from the company."
"His directed his first film ""Jaanam"", which was produced by Mukesh Bhatt. His first four films did not fare well at the box office; his first successful directorial venture was ""Fareb"". Following this, he had multiple successful films such as ""Ghulam"", ""Kasoor"", ""Raaz"" and ""Awara Paagal Deewana"". After ""Awara Paagal Deewana"", he gave flops like ""Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage"", ""Deewane Huye Paagal"" and Ankahee. Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai was another flop although Bobby Deol's and Ameesha Patel's performances were well-received. In 2008, Bhatt came back with the horror genre and he delivered three films that were successful at the box office; these include ""1920,"" ""Shaapit,"" and ""Haunted – 3D"". In 2010, Bhatt introduced stereoscopic 3D for the first time in India with his film Haunted – 3D; the film was released in May 2011 and it then set the record of the highest grossing Hindi horror film of all time, making Rs. 270 million at the box office."
"In 2012, Bhatt's Raaz 3D recorded domestic box office collection of 729 million after the 3rd weekend and the overseas collection was at 46 million. Riding high with the success, Bhatt is writing another horror-thriller for Bipasha in the central role, with a more shocking image than Raaz 3. Following the success of Raaz 3, Vikram Bhatt's written Hindi horror movie which has been directed by debutant Bhushan Patel topped the first weekend collection chart at the box office and the approximate collection was Rs 124.3 million nett. The movie further collected approx Rs 37.5 million nett in the second Weekend, taking the total to Rs 228.6 million nett. The film has been declared a 'Hit'. Soon after, Bhatt signed a deal with Bhushan Kumar's T-Series to produce 5 films of sci-fi, thriller and horror genre. Two of the films will be directed by Bhatt himself."
"In early 2013, Bhatt announced his upcoming projects, Creature 3D, India's First 3D Monster Movie with Bipasha Basu in the lead role and 1920 London, third in the 1920 series. Vikram Bhatt will mark his foray into Marathi cinema with 'Ek Doosrey Ke Liye', which will be directed by Ashwini Kumar Patil."

Inspiration and references.
"Harriet Beecher Stowe was born in Connecticut. She was an abolitionist. Stowe wrote her novel because of the 1850 passage of the second Fugitive Slave Act. This law punished people who helped slaves run away. It also made the North stop and return the South's black runaways. Mrs. Edward Beecher wrote to Harriet (""Hattie""), ""If I could use a pen as you can, I would write something that will make this whole nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is."" At that time, Stowe was a wife with six children who sometimes wrote for magazines. Her son, Charles Stowe, said that his mother read this letter out loud to her children. When she finished the letter, she stood up, and with ""an expression on her face that stamped itself on the mind of her child"", she said, ""I ""will"" write something...I will if I live."" That is how ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" began."
"According to Stowe, she began thinking about ""Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly"" as she was in a church in February 1851. She had a vision of a Christian black man being beaten and praying for the people who were beating him as he died. She was also partly inspired to write her novel by the autobiography of Josiah Henson. Henson was a black man who had run away and helped many black slaves. She was also helped by the book ""American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses"" by Theodore Dwight Weld and the Grimké sisters. Stowe also said that she got lots of ideas for Uncle Tom's Cabin by talking to runaway slaves when she was living in Cincinnati, Ohio."
"In her book ""A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin"" (1853), Stowe wrote about the stories that inspired her when she was writing ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". However, later research showed that Stowe did not actually read many of the stories inside the book until after her novel was published."
Publication.
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" began in a series in an anti-slavery newspaper, ""The National Era"". ""The National Era"" had also printed other works Stowe had written. Because everybody liked the story so much, John P. Jewett of Boston asked Stowe to turn the serial into a book. Stowe was not sure if people would like to read the story as a book. However, she finally agreed. John Jewett, sure that the book would be popular, asked Hammatt Billings to engrave six pictures for the book. In March 20, 1852, the finished book came out. By June it was selling ten thousand copies a week. By October American sales alone were 150 thousand copies. In the first year it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold, and it was translated into many important languages."
Summary.
"Eliza's escape, Tom is sold."
"A Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby is afraid of losing his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife, Emily Shelby, are kind to their slaves, he decides to sell two of them: Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of his wife's maid Eliza. Emily Shelby is shocked and unhappy because she promised Eliza that she would not sell her son. George Shelby, her son, is unhappy because he admires Uncle Tom as his friend and Christian."
"When Eliza hears about Mr. Shelby's plans to sell her son, she decides to run away with her only son. She writes a letter saying sorry to Mrs. Shelby and runs away that night."
"Meanwhile, Uncle Tom is sold and put into a boat, which sails down the Mississippi River. There, he makes friends with a girl called Evangeline (""Eva""). When Eva falls into the water and he saves her, Eva's father, Augustine St. Clare, buys Tom. Eva and Tom become good friends because they both love Jesus very deeply."
"Eliza's family hunted, Tom's life with St. Clare."
"During Eliza's escape, she meets her husband, George Harris, who had run away before her. They decide to try to run away to Canada. However, they are hunted by a slave hunter named Tom Loker. Tom Loker finally traps Eliza and her family, so that George shoots Loker. Eliza is worried that Loker might die and go to hell. Because of this, she persuades her husband to take him to a Quaker town to get better. The gentle Quakers change Tom Loker greatly."
"In St. Clare's house, St. Clare argues with his sister, Miss Ophelia. She thinks that slavery is wrong, but is prejudiced against blacks. St. Clare buys Topsy, a black child, and challenges Miss Ophelia to educate her. Miss Ophelia tries, but fails."
"After Tom has lived with St. Clare for about two years, Eva becomes very sick. She has a vision of heaven before she dies. Because of her death, many people change. Miss Ophelia loses her prejudice of black people, Tospy decides to become ""good"", and St. Clare decides to free Tom."
Tom's life with Simon Legree.
"St. Clare, however, is hurt when he tries to stop a fight at a tavern and dies. Because of this, he cannot keep his promise to free Tom. His wife sells Tom to a plantation owner named Simon Legree. Legree takes Tom to Louisiana. There, he meets other slaves, including Emmeline (who Legree bought at the same time that he bought Tom). Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom disobeys his order to whip the other slaves. Legree beats him, and decides to destroy Tom's faith in God. However, Tom secretly continues to read the Bible and help the other slaves. At the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another black slave. Her two children had been sold, and she had killed her third child because she was afraid that her child would be sold, too."
"Loker has been changed because of the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have finally reached Canada and become free. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom feels so unhappy that he almost gives up, but he has two visions of Jesus and Eva. He decides to continue to be a Christian, even if he has to die. Cassy and Emmeline, with Tom’s encouragement, run away. They cleverly use Legree’s superstitious fears to help them. When Tom does not tell Legree where they are, Legree tells his men to beat him to death. Tom forgives the two men who beat him as he dies, and they feel sorry and become Christians. George Shelby comes just as Tom is dying to free him. He is very angry and sad. However, Tom, saying smilingly, “Who,—who,—who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” dies."
Important characters.
Uncle Tom.
"Uncle Tom, the title character of the story, is a patient, noble, unselfish black slave. Stowe wanted him to be a “noble hero”: in the book, he stands up for what he believes in. Even though they do not want to, even his enemies admire him."
"Recently, however, his name has also been used negatively. People often think of ""Uncle Tom"" as an old black man trying to make his masters happy, as people have criticized his quiet acceptance of slavery. However, others argue that this is not true. First of all, Uncle Tom is not really old - he is only eight years older than Mr. Shelby, which shows that he is probably around fifty. Also, Tom is not happy with slavery. His acceptance is not because of stupidity or because he likes slavery. It is because of his religious faith, which tells him to love everyone. Wherever Uncle Tom goes, he loves and spreads comfort and kindness. He helps slaves escape, such as Eliza, Emmeline and Cassy. He also refuses to beat other slaves. Because of this, he is beaten himself. Stowe was not trying to make Tom an example for ""blacks"" but for white ""and"" black people. She says that if white people were to be loving and unselfish like Uncle Tom, slavery would be impossible."
Eliza Harris.
"Eliza Harris is Mrs. Shelby's favorite maid, George Harris' wife, and Harry's mother. Eliza is a brave, intelligent, and very beautiful young slave. Eliza loves her son, Harry, very much. It is possible her love for him was even greater because she lost two of her first infant children. Her motherly love is shown when she bravely escapes with her son. Perhaps the most well-known part of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is the part where Eliza escapes on the Ohio River with Harry."
"This escape is said to have been inspired by a story heard in the Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati by John Rankin to Stowe's husband Calvin, a professor at the school. In Rankin's story, in February, 1838, a young slave woman had escaped across the frozen Ohio River to the town of Ripley, Ohio with her child in her arms and stayed at his house before she had gone further towards the north."
Eva.
"Eva ""Evangeline"" St. Clare is St. Clare and Marie's angelic daughter. She enters the story when Tom saves her from drowning when he was going to be sold. Eva asks her father to buy Tom. She says, ""I want to make him happy"". Through her, Tom becomes St. Clare's leading coachman and Eva's ""especial attendant (helper)...Tom had...orders to let everything else go, and attend to Miss Eva whenever she wanted him,—orders which our readers may fancy (imagine) were far from disagreeable to him."" She is very beautiful: ""Her form was the perfection of childish beauty...Her face was remarkable less for its perfect beauty of features than for a singular (strange) and dreamy earnestness (seriousness) of expression...all marked her out (made her different) from the other children, and made every one turn and look after her""."
"To Tom, she ""...seemed something almost divine; and whenever her golden head and deep blue eyes peered (looked) out upon him...he half believed that he saw one of the angels stepped out of his New Testament."" He says that ""She's got the Lord's mark in her forehead."" Eva is an almost perfect, Christ-like child. She is very sad about slavery. She does not see the difference between blacks and whites. She talks very much about love and forgiveness. Even Topsy is touched by her love. Eva becomes one of the most important people in Tom's life."
Ophelia St. Clare.
"Ophelia St. Clare is perhaps the most complicated female character in the novel. St. Clare calls her, ""...desperately ... good; it tires me to death to think of it."" She does not like slavery. However, she does not like to be touched or come close to any black person as a human being. When she first saw Eva ""...shaking hands and kissing"" with the blacks, she declared that it had ""...fairly turned her stomach (made her feel sick)."" She adds, ""I want to be kind to everybody, and I wouldn't have anything hurt; but as to kissing...How can she?"""
"She has a ""clear, strong, active mind"", and is very practical. However, she has a warm heart, which she shows in her love for St. Clare and Eva. Ophelia hates slavery, but has a deep prejudice against blacks. St. Clare, as a challenge to her, buys Topsy. He tells her to try educating her. At first she tries to teach and help Topsy simply because of duty. However, Stowe says that duty is not enough: there must be love. Eva's death changes Ophelia. When Topsy cries, """"She"" said she ""loved"" me...there an't (is not) ""nobody"" left now...!"" Ophelia gently says, as ""honest tears"" fell down her face, ""Topsy, you poor child...""I"" can love you, though I am not like that dear little child. I hope I've learnt something of the love of Christ from her. I can love you...and I'll try to help you to grow up a good Christian girl."" Stowe thought that there were many people like Miss Ophelia St. Clare, who did not like slavery but could not think of blacks as people. She wanted to write about such problems through Miss Ophelia."
Important themes.
"Michelle Ryan was revealed to have been cast as Jekyll's assistant, Katherine Reimer, in August 2006. Ryan believed herself to be too young for the part, though that aspect had already been written into the character. To prepare, she consulted the Royal College of Psychiatry. Ryan dyed her hair red for the role to help differentiate her from Tom Jackman's wife. Denis Lawson was cast as Peter Syme. The actor consulted his post-graduate son for information on Syme's job."
"Moffat initially doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for the role of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom ""Coupling"". Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned for the role of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers."
"Meera Syal was attracted to her role because Miranda was not a clichéd private detective and she thought the humour was ""fresh"". During the second filming block, Mark Gatiss briefly joined the cast, playing the small but important role of Robert Louis Stevenson in flashback scenes in episode five."
"Other roles included Paterson Joseph as Benjamin Maddox, Linda Marlowe as Ms Utterson and Al Hunter Ashton as Christopher."
Production.
"The series was filmed in two blocks of three episodes. The first three were directed by Douglas Mackinnon and the second three episodes by Matt Lipsey. It took an hour of make-up each day to turn Nesbitt into Hyde; a hairpiece lowered his hairline and prosthetics were added to his chin, nose and ear lobes. He also wore black contact lenses to make Hyde ""soulless"". The producers decided that Hyde's imminent arrival would be indicated by the flash of a black eye. The eye imagery evolved during filming, and did not appear in the script."
"Filming began in September 2006 with the zoo sequence from the second episode. Benjamin's team have set Tom up to force out Hyde by placing his son, Eddie, in the lion's den. Writing the sequence at a late stage in the production, Moffat wanted to compare Hyde's natural instinct to kill to that of a lion. This was shot on location at Heythrop Zoo, a private zoo in Chipping Norton run by Jim Clubb, whose firm Amazing Animals specialises in training animals for cinema and television. The Norman Foster-designed building in Chertsey, Surrey, which then housed the European Headquarters of video game designer and publisher Electronic Arts, was used as The Klein &amp; Utterson Institute. A large country estate near Henley-on-Thames and in Bognor Regis was used for some of the scenes. A disused Boys' school in Gloucestershire, and the Hammer House in Wardour Street, Soho were used in episode six. Filming concluded on 20 December 2006."
"The production team had twelve days to shoot each episode. Director Douglas Mackinnon says this was the biggest challenge of the project. The required amount of material was shot for most of the episodes. However, an extra twenty minutes of material was filmed for episode six. Director Matt Lipsey recalls that the team struggled to cut the extra material whilst maintaining the integrity of the episode. Lipsey credits Moffat for not ""being precious"" over his material during the editing process. His willingness to cut superfluous material meant that he was taken seriously when he argued for something to be retained."
The music was composed by Debbie Wiseman.

"James Jackson of ""The Times"" rated the first episode four out of five stars, calling Nesbitt's performance as Hyde ""as entertainingly [over the top] as a dozen ""Doctor Who"" villains, with a palpable sense of menace to boot"". The conspiracy plot is praised as a storyline that separates this series from other adaptations. ""The Daily Telegraph's"" Stephen Pile criticised the script for ""veering between Hammer horror and larky humour"". James Walton called the first episode a combination of ""a good yarn with several nicely thoughtful touches"". David Cornelius of ""DVDTalk"" said ""six episodes, 300 minutes, not a single one of them wasted. 'Jekyll' is this year's finest television event""."
"The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, commenting on the series being part of their 2008 line-up, said ""This classic horror tale has been given a modern make-over that will leave you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. James Nesbitt is outstanding as the new Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"". Nesbitt was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television for his roles. Paterson Joseph received a mention in the nominations for the 2008 Screen Nation awards."

"1985–1989: NES/Famicom, ""Super Mario Bros."", and ""The Legend of Zelda""."
"Nintendo released its first home video game console, the Family Computer (released in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System). While this happened, Miyamoto created two of the most famous games for the console and in the history of video games as a whole: ""Super Mario Bros."" (a sequel to ""Mario Bros."") and ""The Legend of Zelda"" (an entirely original title)."
"In both games, Miyamoto decided to focus more on gameplay than on high scores. This was different from most games at the time. ""Super Mario Bros."" was a linear game. The player moved the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. Miyamoto used nonlinear gameplay in ""The Legend of Zelda"". This requires the player to think their way through riddles and puzzles. The world was big and it seemed to never end. It had a lot of different choices and depth never seen before in a video game. With ""The Legend of Zelda"", Miyamoto wanted to make an in-game world that players could relate to. He said it was like a ""small garden that they can put inside their drawer."" He was influenced from his time as a boy around Kyoto. When he was a boy, he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves; each ""Zelda"" title has this feeling of exploration. ""When I was a child,"" Miyamoto said, ""I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to find it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, finding amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this."" He recreated his memories of becoming lost in the maze of sliding doors in his family home in ""Zelda""s maze-like dungeons. In February 1986, Nintendo released the game as the first game for the Nintendo Entertainment System's new Disk System."
"Miyamoto worked on different games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. These games included ""Ice Climber"", ""Kid Icarus"", ""Excitebike"", and ""Devil World"". He also worked on sequels to ""Super Mario Bros"" and ""The Legend of Zelda""."
Super Mario Bros. 3 was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development; the game took more than two years to make.
"1990–2000: SNES, Nintendo 64, ""Super Mario 64"", and ""Ocarina of Time""."
"A merger between Nintendo's different internal research and development teams led to the creation of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development (Nintendo EAD). Miyamoto was the head of it. Nintendo EAD had about fifteen months to develop ""F-Zero"", one of the launch titles for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Miyamoto worked on different games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. One of them was ""Star Fox"". For the game, programmer Jez San convinced Nintendo to make an upgrade for the Super Nintendo. This upgrade would allow it to be able to show three-dimensional graphics better. This upgrade was the Super FX chip. Using this new hardware, Miyamoto and Katsuya Eguchi designed the ""Star Fox"" game with an early use of three-dimensional graphics."
"Miyamoto produced two big ""Mario"" titles for the system. The first game was ""Super Mario World"". It was a launch title. It was included with Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles. It had an overworld as in ""Super Mario Bros."". It had a new character, Yoshi. Yoshi would go on to be in many other Nintendo games. The second ""Mario"" game for the system was ""Super Mario RPG"". It was different than most ""Mario"" games. Miyamoto led a team that was a partnership between Nintendo and Square Co.; it took almost a year to develop the graphics. The story takes place in a newly rendered Mushroom Kingdom based on the ""Super Mario Bros."" series."
"Shigeru Miyamoto helped Satoshi Tajiri. Miyamoto guided him during the creation of ""Pocket Monsters: Red and Green"" (released in English as ""Pokémon Red"" and ""Blue""), the first video games in the Pokémon series. He was also the producer for these games. Miyamoto worked on social gameplay ideas such as trading. Pokémon would become one of the most popular entertainment franchises in the world, spanning video games, anime, and other merchandise."
"Miyamoto made several games for the Nintendo 64. Most of these games were from his previous franchises. His first game on the Nintendo 64 was ""Super Mario 64"". He was the main director. In developing the game, he started with character design and the camera system. Miyamoto and the other designers were unsure of what the game should be like. It took months to decide on a good camera view and layout. The first idea used a fixed path. This would have been similar to an isometric-type game.They decided on a free-roaming 3D design. He changed the design of the Nintendo 64 controller to fit with that of ""Super Mario 64""."
"Using what he had learned about the Nintendo 64 from developing ""Super Mario 64"" and ""Star Fox 64"", Miyamoto produced his next game, '. He led a team of several directors. Individual parts of ""Ocarina of Time"" were developed by multiple directors—a new strategy for Nintendo EAD. However, when things progressed slower than expected, Miyamoto returned to the development team with a more central role. He was helped in public by interpreter Bill Trinen. The team was new to 3D games. However, assistant director Makoto Miyanaga remembers a feeling of ""passion for creating something new and never done before"". Miyamoto went on to produce a sequel to ""Ocarina of Time"", known as '."
"Miyamoto worked many ""Mario"" series spin-offs for the Nintendo 64. These included ""Mario Kart 64"" and ""Mario Party""."
"2000–2011: GameCube, Wii, and DS."
"Miyamoto produced many games for the GameCube. This included the launch title ""Luigi's Mansion"". The game was first shown at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technical demo. It was designed to show off the graphical power of the GameCube. Miyamoto made a short demo of the game concepts. Nintendo decided to make it a full game. ""Luigi's Mansion"" was later shown at E3 2001 with the GameCube console. Miyamoto made more ""Mario"" spinoffs in these years. He also produced the 3D game series ""Metroid Prime"". This was because the original designer Yokoi, a friend of Miyamoto's, died. In this time he developed ""Pikmin"" and its sequel ""Pikmin 2"". These games were based on his experiences gardening. He also worked on new games for the ""Star Fox"", ""Donkey Kong"", ""F-Zero"", and ""The Legend of Zelda"" series on the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance systems. With the help of Hideo Kojima, he helped the developers of """". He helped with many games on the Nintendo DS. The games included the remake of ""Super Mario 64"", ""Super Mario 64 DS"". It also included the new game ""Nintendogs"", a new franchise based on his own experiences with dogs."
"2011–present: Wii U, 3DS, and Switch."
"Miyamoto produced ""Super Mario 3D Land"" and """" for the 3DS, and ""Pikmin 3"" for the Wii U."
"After Nintendo president Satoru Iwata died in July 2015, Miyamoto was chosen to be an acting Representative Director, along with Genyo Takeda. He was no longer in this position in September 2015 when Tatsumi Kimishima became the company's president. He was also chosen to be in the position of ""Creative Fellow"" at the same time. He would give expert advice to Kimishima as a ""support network"" alongside Takeda."
"Miyamoto was a creative director on the 2017 game ""Super Mario Odyssey"". He was not one of its producers. He is credited as being a big influence on the game's development."
Development philosophy.
"Miyamoto and Nintendo do not use focus groups. Instead, Miyamoto figures out if a game is fun by playing it himself. He says that if he enjoys it, others will too. He uses how the ""Pokémon"" series was created as an example. He said ""And that's the point – Not to make something sell, something very popular, but to love something, and make something that we creators can love. It's the most important feeling we should have when we make games."""
Impact.
"""Time"" called Miyamoto ""the Spielberg of video games"" and ""the father of modern video games."" ""The Daily Telegraph"" says he is ""regarded by many as possibly the most important game designer of all time."" ""GameTrailers"" called him ""the most influential game creator in history."" Miyamoto has greatly influenced various things about video games in general. ""The Daily Telegraph"" credited him with creating ""some of the most innovative, ground breaking and successful work in his field."" Many of Miyamoto's works have started new video game concepts or changed existing ones. Miyamoto's games have received outstanding critical praise. Some are considered to be the best games of all time."
"Miyamoto's games have also sold very well. Some became the best-selling games on Nintendo consoles and of all time. As of 1999, his games had sold 250 million copies and grossed billions of dollars."

Commercial reception.

"Miyamoto's ""Mario"" series is the best-selling video game franchise of all time. It has sold over 400 million units. ""Super Mario Bros."" is the second best-selling video game of all time. ""Super Mario Bros."", ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", and ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" were, respectively, the three best-selling games for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

"In 1951, six countries made the ""European Coal and Steel Community"", a basic version of what the EU is now. These six then went further and in 1957 they made the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community. The UK and others decided not to join, and then when the UK changed its mind it was stopped from joining by French President Charles de Gaulle. When he was no longer President, the UK and others started to join. Today there are 27 members but the idea that more should join is not seen as a good one by everyone."
"Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Turkey and Iceland are ""candidate countries""; they are being considered for membership. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are expected to follow."
"However, since there have been many political problems happening in Turkey recently, especially with President Edrogan's arresting of tens of thousands of political rivals since the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016, it is unlikely that it would be allowed to part of the EU anytime soon because EU members believe that the current Turkish government is not respecting human rights, rule of law, or democracy."
Motto.
"United in diversity (or ""together with many types of people"" in Simple English), is the motto of the European Union."
The motto in other languages:
Brexit.
"On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum on whether it should stay in the EU or leave it. The majority [52% to 48%] favored leaving. Britain leaving the EU is commonly known as Brexit."
"The government of the UK invoked ""Article 50"" of the Treaty of European Union (the Treaty of Lisbon) on 29 March 2017. This began negotiations with fellow members of the EU on the terms of exit. The timetable for these negotiations is two years, which meant that the UK would remain a member of the EU until at least March 2019. However this deadline was later extended to October 31st 2019 at the request of the British Government. The United Kingdom left the European Union on the 31 of January 2020 at 23:00 (Greenwich Mean Time). Following the UK left from the European Union on January 31, the transition period expired on December 31, 2020 and ended on January 1, 2021."
Greece
"Greece ( or ), officially the Hellenic Republic ( ), (historically known as Hellas) (Greek: Ελλάς), is a country in Southeastern Europe. Its capital city is Athens."
"It borders Albania, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the east. The Aegean Sea is to the East and South of mainland Greece, the Ionian Sea is to the West. Both are part of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and have many islands. 80% of the country is mountainous, with Mount Olympus being the highest peak."
"Ancient Greece created democracy, philosophy, science and mathematics, drama and theater and the Olympic Games. This is why other languages use many Greek words."
"Greece is a parliamentary republic, in which the leader of the party with more seats in the parliament is the Prime Minister. The country has a President, but his powers are ceremonial. He is the head of state, not the head of government, much like how Kings and Queens operate in constitutional monarchies and is elected by Parliament and not the people. Its economy is the highest in the Balkans region, though facing financial difficulties due to a Greek government-debt crisis. The country was under occupation by the Ottoman Empire until 1821."
Greece is known for its rich history.
The Macedonia region in Greece was the ancient kingdom of Macedonia (sometimes called Macedon).
"It was the empire of Alexander the Great. Ancient Greece was made up of a number of city-states, each with its own constitution. Athens, Sparta and Corinth are examples of city-states."
"The official language spoken in Greece is Greek, spoken by 99% of the population and 90% of the population as well as the Republic of Cyprus. It identifies as Christian Orthodox. Many Greeks also understand English, French and German, which are taught in schools. Greece was a founding member of the United Nations, joined NATO in 1952, became a member of the European Union in 1981, and adopted the Euro in 2001. Due to the large tourism industry, powerful shipping sector, and its geostrategic importance, it is sometimes classified as a middle power."
History.
"Greece's history is one of the richest in the world. The Greeks were one of the most advanced civilizations. Greece is famous for its many philosophers, like Plato and Aristotle, and kings like Alexander the Great and Leonidas. Greece is said to be the ""birthplace of Democracy"", because city-states like Athens, now the capital of Greece, were the first to elect their leaders and not have kings. During the years of Alexander the Great, a huge Greek Macedonian empire was created that stretched from modern-day Greece to Egypt and Iran, until the borders of India. Because of the significant role that Greek culture played during that time, it is called the Hellenistic period (or ""Greek-dominated period""). During that time, the Greek language became the 'lingua franca' of the Middle East, which means the language that people who do not speak the same language use to communicate, like English is used today as an international language."
"Greece was then ruled by the Roman Empire, and many argue that Rome conquered Greece with its army, but Greece conquered Rome with its culture. The Roman Empire after the conquest of Greece became a civilization known as the Greco-Roman (or Greek-Roman) civilization. When the Roman Empire collapsed, the Greeks emerged as the ruling class of the Byzantine Empire, and the Greek language became the official language of the empire, which included all the territories around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. It was then occupied by the Ottoman Empire for a period of 400 years. Some areas of Greece, like the second-largest city in the country, Thessaloniki, were occupied for 500 years and became part of Greece in the early 20th century."
"The Greek War of Independence began in 1821 and Greece was an independent country (a republic) in 1828. In 1832 Greece was made a kingdom by the United Kingdom and Russia, under the German Wittelsbach dynasty."
"In 1912, Greece took part in the Balkan Wars, where it gained many of the territories that make up the country now, such as Greek Macedonia and the islands of the Aegean Sea. Greece fought in both World War I and World War II in the side of allies. During World War I, Greece was divided into two countries, the State of Thessaloniki in the north and the State of Athens in the south. Both countries claimed to be the legitimate government of Greece, but the State of Thessaloniki received support from the Allies. The country was reunited in 1917 when the King abdicated. In 1920 Greece expanded again and briefly reached its maximum size. The territories that the country had gained in Turkey were given back to Turkey in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, but Greece kept Western Thrace. The king returned in 1935, and Greece was under a fascist dictatorship from 1936 until 1941, friendly to the Allies when it was invaded by Nazi Germany."
"Greece’s Macedonia region is known for its rich history, The ancient kingdom of Macedonia (sometimes called Macedon) was Alexander the Great's empire."
"In 1940, Greece was invaded by Italy, but defeated the invasion. This was the first victory of an Allied country against an Axis power. After this, Hitler decided to attack Greece sooner than he had planned. Germany invaded on 6 April 1940 and captured Greece's second-largest city of Thessaloniki on 9 April, while Athens was captured on 27 April. Most fighting ended with the Battle of Crete. Greece suffered major damages in the war."
"Between 1946 and 1949, the Greeks fought a civil war. The fighting was between the communists and the people who supported the king, who also had support from the United Kingdom and the United States. The war left the country devastated and the people very poor."
"In 1967 the military took control of the country and restricted democracy. Free elections were then held again 7 years later, and the Greeks voted to send the king away and declared a republic in 1974. Greece became a member of the European Union in 1981. Greece had seen rapid growth in the 1990s, but some of the country's economic statistics were modified to appear more correct than they were, as the government had lied with the help of banks from the United States. In 2004, Greece hosted the Olympic Games for a second time. Since 2009, Greece has been in an economic crisis, which is also becoming a political crisis."
Politics.
"It is not a federal state like the United States, but a unitary state like the United Kingdom. It is ruled by a parliament, called the ""Hellenic Parliament"" (or ""Greek Parliament"" in Simple English), which has 300 members. It is a parliamentary republic, which means that, unlike in the United States, the President has very few powers. The person in charge of the government of Greece is the Prime Minister."
"Greece was a kingdom for most of its history as an independent nation. It officially became the ""Third Hellenic Republic"" (or ""The Third Republic of Greece"" in Simple English) in 1975, when the monarchy was abolished by a popular vote."
"Greece was under a military dictatorship between 1966 and 1975. Demonstrations by the students of the universities across Greece took place in 1973 but were suppressed by the regime, which forcibly stopped the protests. The dictatorship collapsed after the invasion of Cyprus and handed over power to Constantine Karamanlis."
"In 1967, Hideto joined the manga and backbone trio (with Yukihiro Kimura And The Backbones) and began his professional career as a singer. Also, with Kimura's instruction to ""sing rock"", sing ""Long Tall Sally"" by The Beatles from June of that year and then sing ""Out of Time"" and ""Tell Me"" by The Rolling Stones. (The fact that the manager of Penguin-do recommended that the LP of the live version of the Stones had a great influence on Hideto Noguchi's theatrical performance later), and the name of Hideto Noguchi in Kansai was given to know gradually."
"The intense staging became popular and the mobilization power increased when the spine appeared. Toshio Fukui, the leader of the GS Ox band, who saw the performance of ""Tel Me"" at the Jazz Cafe ""Number Ichiban"", said: ""Only our band and have the Binson resonance chamber in Japan! "" Noguchi joined the band in December 1967, but at the time he didn't know what Binson was. He made his debut as the vocalist of ""Ox"" in May 1968. His stage name is Hideto Noguchi, in honor of Meiji era bacteriologist Hideyo Noguchi. He made Top 10 and Top 20 hits like ""Girl Friend"", ""Dancing Seventeen"", ""Swan no Nami"" and ""I'm Burning"". The ""Girl Friend"", ""Swan no Nami"" and other two songs were composed by . At the beginning of her debut, Ai Akamatsu's popularity preceded him, but when he released his second single, ""Dancing Seventeen,"" it overwhelmingly separated him from the popularity poll, and the center of popularity shifted to Hideto Noguchi. In the mid to late GS boom, many dialogues between , and Hideto Noguchi were seen in magazines."
"Performances began at six venues across the country in September, causing a swoon on the stage at every venue, including the Tokyo Metropolitan Hibiya Public Hall on the first day, which the media hyped them as ""bands passing out."" Ox was called the ""GS Gosanke"" along with and . On May 23, 1970, the Ox held the ""Subtitle"" Second Anniversary Concert and ""Blow Off Elvis Presley"". It was a concert that also served as a new song announcement for me, but Ox at the time was still quite popular along side with the Tigers. The group was disbanded on May 31, 1971. In that same year, Hideto made his first solo debut with ""Masked"". After that, he released singles such as ""What Else Is There"" and ""Yozora no Fuseki"", and released the album ""Hidetokara You ni"" which contains his own ""Clown Who Forgot To Laugh"" line."
Solo debut.
"In 1975, he prepared to leave from the ""All Japan Kayo Championship"" and won 10 awards every weeks. Renamed to ""Hideto Maki"" after his teacher , he made his debut as an enka singer again with ""Yumeyo Mouichido"". This debut song became the first big hit as a solo singer and it broke again to rank 9th on the Oricon national chart and won several excellent newcomer awards. Also, despite being released in September, it is in the Oricon Annual Best 100, and was selected as a candidate song for the nomination at the end of the year. Many of the fans were middle and high school students who couldn't see the GS era in real time, and Maki himself was concerned that it would end with a transitory boom."
"As an aside, the kanji for ""ki"" with Hideto Maki was separated by Hiroshi Itsuki from the same office at the request of Yoko Yamaguchi. As a younger brother from the same office, he also participates in Itsuki's fan club event, and photos from that time are posted on Hideto Maki's website. In 1976, he won the Tokyo Shimbun Best Hit Award for ""Drowning in Love."" In that same year, he won the popular award, silver award, and other awards at the Iizuka Music Festival for her third single ""Somewhere in Tokyo"". The guest at that time was veteran female actress singer Hibari Misora, and Hideto said that he became more and more of Hibari's fan when she said, ""I know you."" At the time, master jazz pianist Yuzuru Sera said, ""Hideto is more suited to jazz than enka. I will teach you how to become a jazz singer."" Every time he met him, Masato Fujita, a master enka composer, would tell him ""because one day, I'll write a music note with Hideto Maki."""
"Fujita's perception changed completely with the ""flow"" sung by Hideto on his special show when he was Ox, and even after his re-debut, the paternal replacement for . He also appeared on love shows. It is a pity that the dream with both teachers did not come true. In 1978, with George Yanagi and Rainy Wood, he released his seventh single ""Cammon"" beyond the limits of record companies. It is not an enka song, but a rock style song. At the time, the song was played with a playful feeling, but as she was about to transform into a rock singer, Maki's fierce opposition returned to the enka line."
"Appeared at the New Years Rock Festival (International Theater) (moderated by Haruo Chikada). The festival is produced by . The turn came between the Downtown Boogie Woogie Band and Rainy Wood, and Maki also sang the song). As an enka singer, only Maki appears at this rock festival, but Yuya Uchida spoke directly to Maki and took notice. ""Ame no Tokyo"" is karaoke and wired, and it won the best-selling award. After that, he released ""Happy Thin Woman"" and ""Hotarugawa"" and it became a huge hit. It seems that the number of adult fans has increased around here, and there are many male fans who like ""I am a happy slim woman""."
Popularity and participation.
"Also, Yuya asked him to appear in the ""Carnival of the West"" which was revived when the Nippon Theater was demolished, but Maki himself said it would be strange to appear again because Ox had refused to appear in the ""Carnival of the West"" in the past. . . It is said that he refused the offer. In 1988, Taro Morimoto asked him to join The Tigers Memorial Club Band, where he was able to balance solo and GS singers for eight years. (It is the largest GS unit released at the Osaka Castle Hall / Yokohama Arena concert)."
"Upon entering Heisei, the song ""Genki no Hoshi"", which begins with the lyrics of ""Ace No. 4 from childhood"", became a hit song since ""Ame no Tokyo"" and is still played in the second match. of the Yomiuri Giants army. Sing the original song ""Thank You For Love"" on the 2010 project work album ""Shido We ga Hibi"". It is also a charity song for the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. On March 28, 2012, Sony Music released 21 songs by Hideto Maki and G ☆ B ""Euphoric Flame Song"" to mark the 45th anniversary of the singer's debut, but they are still selling steadily. In 2015, he celebrated the 40th anniversary of the name change to Hideto Maki, and on May 24, a limited edition of 120 people, ""Don't Forget Your Original Intent, Yukihiro Kimura and Backbone Live"" was made for the first time. in about 50 years (Kimura). Returning Yukihiro Live). The Ox's (ongoing) reunion is ""impossible""."
"However, in reality, the members except Ai Akamatsu and Yusuke Taura (Yûsuke Natsu) have met sporadically on the old-fashioned tune show, sometimes singing Ox-era songs in solo live performances. It's been 50 years since he started as a professional singer in 2017. 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Ox first debut."
"On September 9, 2018, due to fan enthusiasm, Yukihiro Kimura and Backbone Live were held in Osaka Moerado for the first time in 3 years and were sold out."
"In 2019, he will appear on ""Eternal Showa Hit Kayo On Stage"" in May and July. At the May Concert, youth songs will be played, which is also their starting point, and at the July concert, GS-era songs will be played at downtown. On May 5, 2020, Sony Music released a 5-CD-BOX set of 111 songs, including a new song for the first time in approximately 30 years, as a tribute to Kouki. (The first CD reprint of Hideto Noguchi's song, including hit songs from the Ox era, hit songs after being renamed Hideto Maki, and even ""Genki no Hoshi"")."

The show got number 1 on the Nielsen ratings from 1971 to 1976. It was the first television show to do this. The episode ""Sammy Visit's"" was number 13 on ""TV Guides 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time and ""TV Guides 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time had ""All in the Family"" as the fourth greatest show of all time. Bravo put Archie Bunker as the ""greatest character of all time."" ""All in the Family"" had seven spin-off shows made. That is the most spin-off shows from any show ever."
"The show ended on April 8, 1979 but the spin-off show called ""Archie Bunker's Place"" started on September 23, 1979 and carried on with Archie Bunker until 1984. 15 years later Norman Lear created ""704 Hauser"" which was about a new family living in Archie Bunker's house after he sold it. The show was ended early after five episodes were put on television."
Plot.
"""All in the Family"" is about a family who lives during the early 1970s in the suburbs of Queens, New York City. The sitcom's main character is a World War II veteran and blue-collar worker Archie Bunker. Archie Bunker is old, a bigot, and is not very smart. He gets mad at the changes he sees in the world and wants to go back to when life was more easier. Archie does not like the Democratic Party and is a Republican. He stereotypes every person he meets. His wife, Edith Bunker is a nice woman but she is not very smart. She has a very big family but her family does not like Archie Bunker. Archie and Edith have one child. They have a daughter named Gloria Stivic who is a feminist. Archie calls Gloria ""little girl"". Gloria is married to Michael Stivic who is unemployed and is of Polish descent. Archie calls Michael the ""Meathead"" because Michael has different ideas about politics then Archie. Michael and Gloria have a son together. Archie thinks that Michael is dead from his neck to his head. Archie does not like the Jeffersons who are the African American family that live next door to them. Archie argues with George Jefferson many times but George's wife is a friends with Edith. Her name is Louise Jefferson. George and Louise have a son named Lionel Jefferson who helps out Archie. The Jeffersons move away and into the city. Edith also has a cousin named Maude Findlay who takes care of the Bunkers when they get sick. Archie argues with Maude many times because they do not have the same opinions about politics. The characters who live around Archie and his family are meant to show the changing demographics in the world, which Archie does not like."
Early seasons of the show.
"During the show the family goes through different situations. Many of the most funny moments of the show are in the first season. Early in the show, Michael wrote an angry letter to President Richard Nixon and Archie wrote a letter to Richard Nixon about why he liked him. Archie and the Jeffersons argue over the color of God's skin because he does not think God is black. But Archie gets drunk and is locked in the basement and he thinks that God came to rescue him but it was just one of the Jeffersons. He is surprised that God is black and bows down to him. In many of the episodes Michael and Archie argue. One time Archie was nearly arrested for owning tear gas and another time he went missing. Archie and the people he works with go on strike and Archie does not have a job. But Edith gets a job instead because the family needs money. This makes Archie mad because he thinks that the husband should be working. There are also some flashback episodes. The first one is about the first time Archie and Michael meet. It is a very famous episode and Michael got the name ""meathead"" in it. In the third season the episode,""The Bunkers and the Swingers"" won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. The episode was about Edith an Archie not knowing that they agreed to change husbands and wives for a night with other people who do it as a job."
Later seasons of the show.
"Later on, Archie is in a broken elevator with a woman who Archie thought was crazy, an African American businessman and a Puerto Rican man and women who is about to give birth. In season eight of the show Gloria and Michael move out of the house and move into their own house to raise their son but the house is very close to Archie and Edith's house. Michael and Gloria start to argue many times and they think they might get divorced. Michael looks to Archie for help but it does not work very much. They do stayed married for the rest of the show. Archie's ideas about transgender people are put to test when he saved a transgender person's life not knowing that they were transgender. Many important and controversial things happen in season eight of the show. During the episode ""Edith's 50th Birthday"" a man who is dressed up as a police officer tried to rape Edith. Edith fights him off but has a very hard time telling Archie about it. Another time Archie and Michael are locked in Kelsey's Bar together and they argue but become very close and Archie finally tells Michael that he loves him. Later in the show Archie and Edith raise a young girl named Stephanie Mills who was abandoned by her father and her mother (Edith's cousin). Archie buys a bar with a friend and they own it. The story of ""All in the Family"" continued in ""Archie Bunker's Place"" and the house is the main place with a new family named the ""Cumberbatches"" in the spin-off show ""704 Hauser"" but the show was cancelled less than a month after it started."
Creating the show.
The first pilot episode.
"""All in the Family"" is based on the 1960s British sitcom television show ""Till Death Us Do Part"". Norman Lear said he read about the show in a ""Variety"" magazine. He thought the show was like the relationship that he had with his father. Norman Lear bought the rights to use ""Til Death Us Do Part"" and used the ideas of the show in ""All in the Family"". Norman Lear is the creator of ""All in the Family"". He would also add some of the things his father did into the show. CBS wanted to have the show but the show was going to be on ABC. There was two pilot episodes made. One was made on September 3, 1968 and called ""And Justice For All"". The pilot episodes had different actors and actresss for Michael (Tim McIntire) and Gloria Stivic (Kelly Jean Peters) and the house they lived in looked different. Archie and Edith were named ""Archie Justice"" and ""Edith Justice"" instead of Archie Bunker and Edith Bunker. Micheal was named “Dickie” for the first pilot. Lionel Jefferson was played by D'Urville Martin instead of Mike Evans. For the start of the episode, Archie and Edith were singing, ""Those were the Days"" but the song was longer and shots of where they lived were shown but not them. Also Edith played the piano faster in this pilot episode then the rest of the show. The camera showed the door mat which said ""Justice"" before the episode started. The pilot was taped with three cameras so the people watching could see the characters feelings about things. This would be used for the entire show. Most other sitcoms used one camera but ""All in the Family"" was the first and more sitcoms used three cameras after. The pilot talked about many important issues instead of just one. The characters talked about race, welfare, antisemitism, and even different types of sausage. The ending credits of the pilot episode is the kitchen room with the party decorations up. Edith and Archie are singing the same song from the beginning as the credits roll."
The second pilot episode.
"ABC did not like the first pilot because they did not think Archie and Edith were good together but ABC gave Lear the money to make a second pilot. The episode was made on February 10, 1969 in Los Angeles and it was called ""Those were Days"". The second pilot episode was almost the same as the first pilot episode but in this pilot Gloria was played by Candice Azzara and Chip Oliver played Richard. Richard was the name of Michael Stivic's character and was named ""Dickie"" in the first pilot episode. D'Urville Martin played Lionel Jefferson again. Another difference from the pilot episodes and the rest of the show is that Edith can be rude to Archie at times and calls Archie,""Mr. Religion."" For the start of this pilot episode, Edith and Archie are singing ""Those were the Days"" the same way it would be for the rest of the show. After Edith and Archie start to sing, shots of the neighborhood that they live in are shown but not Manhattan. The ending credits are Archie and Edith singing the same song but they are not shown. Instead the same shots from the opening song is shown but backwards. This was used for the rest of the show."
"The pilots both had the same story. Gloria and Richard are making a surprise anniversary party for Edith and Archie. Gloria does not want Richard to argue with Archie. Their friend, Lionel Jefferson was fixing the toilet for them. When Richard and Gloria leave Archie and Edith come home, Edith is surprised to see the party. But when Richard and Gloria come back, Richard and Archie start to argue about controversial ideas. Gloria tells Archie that she is going to leave because they keep arguing but she does not. Lionel comes back to the house and Archie tries to show Richard that he likes African-Americans but insults Jewish people instead. Lionel and Richard play a joke on Archie and try to make him think that he is Jewish. Edith opens a present from Archie but he did not make it. She is very happy but Archie is confused. The episodes end with Archie insulting Richard."
Making the rest of the show.
"This was the last pilot and it would be two years until the first episode of the ""All in the Family"" was made. Both of the pilot episodes were never put on television. ABC did not like the show because they thought it was too controversial and because another show, ""Turn-On"" was ended after one episode. They also thought that the people who watch ABC would not like Archie Bunker. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin took back the screenplay and thought about making a movie with ""All in the Family"" and not a show because Norman and Bud has made good movies. Norman Lear had a meeting with United Artists about making movies and Bud had a meeting with CBS. CBS thought about getting ""All in the Family"" back. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin agreed to make 13 episodes for the first season and CBS bought the show back."
"The show was filmed at CBS Television City in Hollywood from 1971 to 1975 and then was filmed at Metromedia Square also in Hollywood, from 1975 to 1979. Tandem Productions was the company that produced the show. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin created the company. Norman Lear wanted the show to be made in black and white but CBS would not let him. The furniture in the show did not have many colors in them this was because Norman Lear wanted the people watching the show to make it feel like they were looking at family photos. ""All in the Family"" was the first American sitcom to be recorded in front of a live audience. Each episode is 25 or 26 minutes long. CBS had a warning before each episode to warn the people watching that controversial topics would be talked about on the show, but they did it too make people laugh. CBS did this so people would know before the show started if they were going to be offended by what was on the show. Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers played Michael and Gloria instead and the first episode was put on television on January 12, 1971."
"""All in the Family"" was not famous in the first season. But the show started to become famous when CBS had reruns of the first season on television."
Setting and location.
"""All in the Family"" takes place Astoria which is a neighbourhood in the Queens, New York. Many episodes of the show take place at Archie and Edith's house. The address for the house Archie and his family is 704 Hauser but the address is not real. The house is real and is in Greendale also in New York. The Bunker's live near New York State Route 25A which is where Kelsey's Bar is and where ""Archie Bunker's Place"" is set. Many of the places mentioned in the show are real. Like the high school that Archie Bunker goes too is a real high school in Flushing, New York."
Cultural impact.
"Most sitcoms before ""All in the Family"" did not talk about controversial issues. ""All in the Family"" became very famous because it talked about controversial topics like race and sexuality but in a funny way. Many people liked the show because they thought the show was relatable for them because the show was about average people in the 1970s. Norman Lear used this when he made other shows like ""Sanford and Son"". ""All in the Family"" won many awards for it's success. The chairs that Archie Bunker and Edith sit in and the table that is in between the chairs are on display at the National Museum of American History. On the table is Archie's favorite beer and a bowl to stop his cigar when he is done smoking. The hat that Archie wears on the show is also at this museum."
Our local schools have adult education in the evening
Oh.
"uh, and I use their tools and, some of their guidance."
I'm an artist.
"Oh, okay."
And I'm very handy
"and, you know, if I touch it, it turns into something <laughter> us-, usually."
That's great.
"What, what type of art do you focus on?"
I have a Master's degree
"and, and my projects had to do with acrylic painting,"
but I'm really interested in the crafts.
Huh.
I make stain glass.
I've done some silver jewelry making
"and I kind of,"
"once I get you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else"
Yeah.
"Kind of jack of all trades, master of none."
"Yeah,"
"well no,"
"actually, I get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow,"
"you didn't buy it,"
you made it.
That's great!
"And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone"
so let's do something else.
Right.
"You want to, uh, explore a new field"
"or, or,"
"Well, yeah,"
"I, I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet"
"Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know."
Yeah.
That's true.
"And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem."
Exactly what happened to them.
I'm building my own house.
"Oh, that's nice."
"And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today"
"Oh, really."
Yeah.
Are you doing it yourself?
Yeah.
Wow.
I used to be a builder.
"Oh, that's nice."
And I retired about five years ago and  started college.
"Oh, I see."
Huh.
And now I'm a college educated builder
"There's still no work, you know."
Yeah.
"So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials"
so I did.
That's great.
"And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home."
is that so?
I didn't know that.
You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house
but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
Well that sounds kind of dumb.
"Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"He, he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books"
and then he just started doing it.
I don't know.
"He, well he did all the flooring himself."
"He put the whole, the whole floor in"
and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there.
"And then we were, put a, like a, not, not necessarily a garage, but just like a, off the side of that"
"after we had the house part made, we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less."
"It's not, you know, it's not enclosed."
"It's just somewhere to drive another car to, to park"
"and it's,"
"Do, do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground?"
"Uh, it's off the ground."
On the piers?
Uh-huh.
"It's on about uh, twenty-two inch piers, something like that."
"Did,"
You had those poured
So.
or you did them yourself?
"Uh, no,"
"those, those are,"
we did those ourselves
so.
You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete?
Yeah.
Huh.
"Exactly,"
"so. It's,"
"Well, the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of"
"Yeah,"
"and so my transportation costs have gone up by, uh, five times"
"Yeah,"
I understand that.
"We, we have a real similar situation."
"Ours, uh, have quintupled, at least."
So there is a real family budget.
"Yeah,"
"pretty much, um."
The problem is there never seems to be enough money.
"I have three children,"
"and it seems like the more money you make, the more money you have, the more things that they seem to need,"
"and, uh, of course, nothing ever goes down,"
"I mean, uh, I remember,"
I have five children total.
I have three left in the house.
Yeah.
"And I can remember years ago, when school would start,"
"and I'd go buy all five kids, you know, shoes,"
"and I could get out of the, out of the shoe store without spending more than thirty-five dollars."
"Nowadays, thirty-five dollars buys about one pair of shoes"
If you're lucky.
"yeah,"
"so I mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last, uh, I guess about the last ten years."
Exempt or nonexempt.
I'm exempt.
"Wow,"
must be nice.
"Part of the high price spread. Uh,"
"no,"
"well, we don't, we do,"
but we don't have a family budget.
We have the fixed things we have to pay.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I think that's probably a good thing.
It's probably the safest thing.
Yeah.
"I mean, it's to easy to get a quorum"
Yep
and simple majority won't do.
No.
"And even like, you know, two-thirds majority, I mean, it's"
"Yeah,"
"that's,"
"yeah,"
quorums are to easy to get.
Yep.
"And there's always that, that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason, you know."
"So it's, it's"
definitely
"but, uh, I don't know."
"I could, I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing."
Yeah.
Like Gives them a little too much power
Yeah
"I, I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that. Or arguing against that pretty vehemently."
"But, uh,"
"Plus, you know, you may be, you know, doing, you know, a, a guilty verdict"
"but it may not be, you know, it may be for technical reasons"
Yeah.
"About the only good thing I would say about that is it that it would, uh, hurry the process up a bit"
Yeah.
"but I mean even now we've got, I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that"
and  that's what the trial by jury.
"if you're cutting,"
are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for for set up?
"Uh, tools for set up and for measurement."
"Uh, you got to have a one tenth indicator,"
"it's a hundred dollars. Uh,"
"five tenths uh, usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each. Uh,"
Huh.
five tenths indicator at about a hundred dollars.
"You got to have, uh, six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars."
"You got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars. Uh,"
one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars.
A two to three for eighty dollars.
A three to four for eighty dollars.
So you've got thousands of dollars or so.
I mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools.
Real fast.
Yes.
"Real, real fast."
Edge finders and ...
"But I was thinking about though that, that when you actually get to the milling equipment though, when it starts turning ..."
"Well, I know,"
"because, okay."
Your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches.
Yeah.
You know.
"But you, when you, when you simply drilling a hole, I mean, a real simple thing, like gee,"
I need a hole there.
What size hole?
Yeah.
"As in metric size hole or a, or an American sized hole?"
Yeah.
"And, and what, but the thing is then you've got to with screws"
"and we have a lot of, uh,"
"the county I am, I'm in, the minorities are mostly Hispanic."
Yeah.
Probably quite a few black people up there
"and and,"
No
"We're from a county, we're from the county they marched in."
We're in Forsyth county
"Oh, is that right?"
"yes,"
"and we,"
"and there's very, very few blacks."
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, so, so that's, uh,"
"I, I hate to say, uh,"
"it's not a problem, uh, because I hate to feel like they are a problem, although they are."
Yeah
"but, you know, it, it's,"
"you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever,"
but then again.
"But it is a problem  Uh, especially in the inner schools, inner city."
"Yeah,"
"there is no denying that, that,"
"Sure, you know."
"Teachers, you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand, especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school."
"Well,"
and you can't put all the children in special education.
"That's right,"
you can't do that.
"Uh, and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know."
Right.
"See, I grew up in Nebraska"
"and, uh, but he's got, he's been put away for, uh, credit card fraud, I believe."
"Oh, gosh."
"Yeah,"
"Lyndon LaRouche, that's it."
Yeah.
"And, uh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"people will sit home and assume, oh, that guy would never get elected."
Uh-huh.
"Next thing you know, you've got him."
Right.
"If you don't go and vote, then, you know, very good chance that they, they will because a lot of the people like that, they'll strike a chord in something, you know, in some of the people, that so will say, look, you know, this guy's got everything together."
Yeah.
"You know, I like what he says,"
and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
"Right, yeah."
"And, uh, I think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because, because, um, the guy did get elected, correct?"
Yeah.
Right.
That's what I thought.
"Yeah,"
he sure did.
"And, uh, , but you know, they can always fool us, you know."
He might do a good job.
Yeah.
"I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long"
"Oh, yeah."
I think that discourages a lot of people.
"What we do, usually, is, uh, vote, uh, absenteeism"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, I know, here, you know, you don't have to have any reason,"
"That's, what, that's exactly what's happening in my family."
"Yeah,"
Is it really?
Yeah.
except that mine are a little bit older
"and, and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available,"
all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there.
Uh-huh.
You better make sure that you've got a scholarship.
That's right.
That's right.
"Well, that's what she said to us."
"She said, now, do you all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college?"
"And, and our answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college."
"And if he wants to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, you know."
And that was kind of our view on it.
"It just costs too much,"
"you just can't do it, you know."
"So, I don't know,"
"it's, it's,"
"I don't, uh,"
"it just amazing,"
"it amazes me how much the, the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years."
I just don't know how anybody's going to do it.
"And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them."
"Uh, I have a, an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be an allergist,"
"Oh, goodness."
"and I said, that's wonderful."
I applaud that.
"Let, me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"or I did, have a favorite channel that I usually tuned into for local news."
"I guess because you get use to, you like the anchors,"
Yeah.
and you feel comfortable with them
"and,"
"It is interesting though,"
it becomes a little of personality.
"In fact, the, the guy that was on, the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, oh, long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that. Twenty-one, twenty-three years ago or so, twenty-four, anyway long time ago"
Uh-huh.
"and, and shortly after I got, we got here fourteen years ago"
"and, uh, they had, they had fired him, uh, because he was too"
"anyway, didn't, he didn't have the personality, and wasn't drawing the crowds"
Uh-huh.
and that's interesting.
"That's, that's what the T V stations do."
they're trying to get ratings.
That's true.
"And I think, if we remember that, that they're out after the ratings."
Their job.
That's true.
So that really effects how they report the news.
"Well, it's like the, the Dale Hansen on channel eight is a, sometimes a little too cutesy"
"but, I wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes."
"Is he the sports,"
"Have you talked, have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes?"
"Yeah,"
"I guess it is time to close now, so I can run go help put the kids to bed."
"Okay,"
well good talking to you.
Yeah.
Goodnight.
Bye-bye.
"and could call them,"
you go to their office anytime.
"I had some instructors that, uh, would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends, when I was having trouble with something"
Huh.
"and,"
"Yeah,"
you won't get that at M I T or virtually or anything like that.
"No,"
"no,"
"and that,"
"And you you know, and you can't blame the professors either, because you look at their job description,"
No.
"you'd you know,"
teaching is third down on the list of importance things
"and,"
"Right,"
right.
"Publish first,"
and the
"yeah,"
"and, and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research, because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time."
Right.
"So I'd say go to a, go to a college that has teachers."
People who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job.
Yeah.
"But, oh, well"
"Yeah,"
"it's, there's a lot of factors that people don't ever, ever consider in, in their selection of a college"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, I don't know,"
"maybe, I wonder if, if they enter these conversations that people have been having, uh ..."
what kind of fishing do you enjoy?
Yeah.
"So now they're like marking, uh,"
"they're,"
"I don't know,"
"there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics"
"and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is."
Yeah.
So I guess that makes it easy to recycle
"and then they're, they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic"
so that that makes it easier I guess.
Uh-huh.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I'm, you know,"
"unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't,"
"they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that"
"or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, uh, garbage collection"
Right.
"and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that"
Where does your friend go to to recycle?
She lives in Garland
"and I'm not sure where, what she does."
"But she's, uh, oh she's very heavy in that"
and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
Uh-huh.
"Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house."
Yeah.
"Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing."
And she does make a lot of sense.
Yeah.
Just her whole house is like wow.
"I guess that's how it gets passed on. You know, when one person, you hear  from another person"
Yeah.
No.
"Actually I'm a spectator,"
"and I'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's, or my late husband's, interest in golf."
Uh-huh.
"My husband likes golf also,"
"he's, uh, I guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it"
"But he, he limits it pretty good."
"I, um, have tried to go out and play golf."
"He would love it if I would go out and play with him,"
"but I stand there and swing and swing,"
Uh-huh.
and I can't even hit the ball
I can't even play miniature golf well.
"Yeah,"
I don't either
"Well, there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not,"
but I am very good at watching it on television.
Right.
"And he was really, uh, enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments."
"He could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held, and what the nature of the hole was and,"
"Oh, so he's really into it."
"Oh, yeah,"
he was a good golfer.
Wow.
"And as, and did some, you know, instructions at the country club for a while."
Oh.
"But, uh, golf tended to be"
"I am not really deeply involved in any, following any of the sports."
Yeah.
"But golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers,"
and therefore I enjoyed following those particular players.
"Right,"
"So, I mean all kinds of resources and, you know, just there,"
Yeah.
"and I'd give anything to have that right now in my, in my regular"
"I mean you, you have everything given to you."
I don't see why people wouldn't want that.
"I don't know,"
"I,"
"but then, if I was young, I wouldn't see it."
"Uh-huh,"
"well that's, that's it"
"you, you don't have, uh,  you don't have the view."
"But you know, now that it's gone, I,"
Right.
"I graduated from Texas Tech, more than two years ago, I guarantee,"
Uh-huh.
"and, you know, I kind of look back at it sometimes,"
"well that was a lot of fun,"
"but, you know, I'm not sure that, that I took the greatest advantage of, you know, what, I went through there."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
I did a lot
and I experienced a lot
"and I, I feel like I got a good college education"
"but just when I got out I feel like I should have spent more time in the library,"
"I should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"the informal classes that you don't get credit for, you know ..."
"All right,"
"I guess our, we're in the process of a home repair right at this point"
"because we're, we're painting the outside of our house."
"I don't know,"
"Oh, for goodness sakes."
What do you do?
"Well, I work for the state as, as a grounds keeper."
"Uh-huh,"
"well, that's interesting."
"Um, so, at this time of the year are you doing much garden work?"
"No,"
"mostly snow removal, which we've had a lot of,"
"but, uh, I don't know,"
"I, I guess, uh, growing up on the farm and, and that, I, I've always had a big interest, uh."
Right.
"I have a, uh, when I have an area to do, I, I always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and, and everything."
Uh-huh.
"Well I love to work outside, really,"
and I enjoy flowers and stuff.
"I don't do a whole lot of it, um, at this exact point in my life, um, because I have two teenage boys,"
and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care
Okay.
"but I still take care of the, you know, flower beds and things like that."
"I was even planning to go out and to, uh, dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here, but, you know, were planted in the ground since last spring"
Uh-huh.
"and I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me,"
"and lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze down to about, oh, twenty-three degrees or something"
Uh-huh.
so the hibiscus plants no longer exist
"Oh, that's terrible."
Twenty-three
"And I really feel bad about it,"
"it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of, you know."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, they're all gone at this point."
"And if you're alienated,"
"I mean I see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems, that, you think this isn't sinking in."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I've seen more graduates from M I T"
"and that,"
Uh-huh.
"being,"
"I work in a, in a an Air Force laboratory"
"and so we've got a lot of, uh, M I T graduates that are in there"
and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that I think I've ever run into.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Even, even more so, uh, like, military academy grads are a strange lot, too,"
"I, I mean I have to confess to that."
"Yeah,"
"it's sort of a, a rare select environment."
"Yeah,"
"and they have their own quirks and tolerances and, you know, certain things that don't bother us at all, that would drive other people nuts"
Yeah.
and then certain things that
"ways, things we do,"
"the way we do it that drive other people nuts that,"
"Right,"
"right,"
sure.
"But, these M I T grads are off in their absolute own world."
"It, it's a,"
"I, I have more I have a lot of respect for M I T master's and doctorate, uh, degrees,"
Yeah.
It's a top rated institution
"and now I,"
"but they're undergrads are like,"
I saw it three times.
Did you.
"I can, I can tell you, oh, so much about that movie, just because it, it really rang, uh, rang a lot of my, uh, my personal background."
"I, I have a, a brother myself that's, that's older"
"and, uh, he's not, you know,"
"nothing, nothing, of course, serious is wrong with him"
"but, uh, but we have gone through these, these lapses of, of a relationship, somewhat, sometimes,"
Yes.
"and then, you know, uh, for, for, for no real, you know, direct reason, I guess, uh, we, we get into, uh, uh, a really good relationship for a while and then, you know, back and forth"
"so I, I was really able to, to relate to the, the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers."
That was neat.
Uh-huh.
"Well that's tremendous,"
"that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family."
"Yeah,"
a lot.
And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.
Uh-huh.
"No question,"
"he, the, he was, he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that."
He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things.
Uh-huh
"And, and, uh, it, it was like pulling teeth to go get him to, to see it"
"but, uh, oh boy. He was, uh, uh, he, he gave the, the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN."
"I mean he certainly didn't,"
"he only saw it one time,"
"and he didn't go back for more,"
"but, uh, he, he said he enjoyed it"
"and, and,"
Well he at least saw it one time
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
and I think that's wrong.
"I,"
I agree
"and, and, uh, I, I also think we extend too much help to other, uh, countries"
we need enough help here in this country.
That's right.
They're still people starving people here *They're There're
why should we help starving people somewhere else.
Yeah.
And I think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble.
Absolutely.
"Now I can't wait for, uh,"
"I, I could just picture what's going to happen here in the not to distant future."
"We keep hearing well, we're going to receive, uh, eight billion dollars from Japan for the, uh, uh-huh, the, the, the big, war over there in the Mideast."
The war.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, so many billions of dollars here and there and everything"
"and, uh, the next thing you know we'll be turning around just like we did to Poland"
"and say, well, just forget it."
Yeah.
And I think that's a mistake.
"Oh, definitely."
"Somewhere, you know, we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away."
"Well, another thing now they keep decontrolling different things."
"First, it was the airlines then it was banks and, and, uh, um, savings association, and whatnot."
We know what trouble they got into
Exactly.
"And the same with the airlines back in the days when they were, uh, controlled and, and, uh, Transcontinental or, um, um, Interstate, uh, Trucking."
"I mean, as soon as the federal government gave up control on all that, they just went to hell in a hand basket."
Yeah.
Prices went sky high.
"Then, in, in the case of airlines, of course, they became highly competitive"
"Yeah,"
that makes sense.
Um.
"Because you start prying in people's private lives, you ruin their lives as well as,"
That's right.
"And sometimes, you know, I don't even know how much of a difference it really makes, you know."
Yeah.
"I mean, I guess in some cases, sure we care about what they did in the past"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, sometimes, I don't know"
Uh-huh.
I think it gets in the way of the better judgment.
I mean just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician.
"I, I, I agree with that and, uh, and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's, you know, going to the public then, uh, then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's it.
"And, uh you when it becomes public, though, it becomes scandalous."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"The, that's, that's the thing that,"
"uh, things that you don't know uh, do, do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"People could say, oh, they do it,"
"so, I guess, you know,"
"but, as soon as things do get public uh, there, there is that terrible concern."
Uh-huh.
Um
"So, sometimes I ask myself, what are, uh, people doing that are in the media when somebody, you know, comes up to office,"
Uh-huh.
it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines.
"Yeah,"
"my brother-in-law teaches at, uh, Northern Illinois University"
"and they were in China, here a couple of years ago,"
"and he was over there at, uh, the University of Shah and, and teaching ..."
"So, uh, describe your family budget."
"Well, I've, uh, for a lot of years I, I've pretty much flied without one,"
"and, uh, just recently, uh, we, we set up a budget,"
"and, and we're trying to stick to it."
We just bought a new house.
"So we've got everything, you know, pretty much we know what our, uh, our fixed expenses are per month,"
"and then we've got some ones that are variable, that pretty much stay within a certain range,"
"and then, uh, then there's the ones that you never know anything about,"
"and that's, that's the food"
"Well, yeah,"
"and to some extent, utilities, I imagine."
"well, the utilities are pretty much,"
"you can pretty much figure what they're going to be,"
and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you.
"They have that to some extent here,"
but it's not quite as good.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, transportation expenses,"
I guess you own a car.
Yes
sir.
And you know how much you're going to drive every week?
"Well, I used to, um, I used to know, uh, fairly close to exactly how many miles I drove, because I, I was very convenient, I lived, uh, nine tenths of a mile from work."
Huh.
"So, so, it was, you know, two miles a day to and from work."
So it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot.
"But now I've just bought a new house,"
"and I'm a half hour,"
and he definitely has a very different slant on the news.
Uh-huh.
"He's very, very skeptical of the news media,"
and I will admit I'm reasonably skeptical also.
"But he's, I don't know, uh, he's much, much more so."
"It's sort of interesting though, because he does bring a, a much, um, different perspective with all the Gulf goings on, um."
"He was always speaking in terms of, you know, American imperialism reasserting itself."
"Um, I suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country."
Uh-huh
"Well I, I, uh, I like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize."
Uh-huh.
"True, um,"
"the,"
I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't.
"They, um, tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story."
Uh-huh.
They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time.
"Sort of like the, uh, what is that, A B C's NIGHTLINE."
Uh-huh.
"Well, I guess they only normally stick with just the one, um, story."
"But they, they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories."
"They don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in, in every little town."
"No,"
no.
It's very much national interest news.
Yeah.
"A lot of times they end up, um, with these panels of experts"
"and they go back and forth, where everyone's giving some opinions"
"and sometimes that,"
"I don't know the value of that, because I saw plenty of jokes and, and, um, oh, editorial cartoons about all the retired generals, making a living during the, the Gulf War."
I've been getting a kick out of those lately.
Uh-huh.
"But it, it's real,"
"the first one we saw, um, they were, it, it involved a tradition of when a person reaches seventy-five,"
"and I can't remember what day they call it,"
"but, but, uh, the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff"
"Oh, great."
"Anyway Anyway, it, it goes on, you know,"
"and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all,"
"and then when it comes time for him to throw her over, well, the, the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her."
Oh.
"And she said no,"
"you can't do, you know,"
"he ran her out, was running to in a wheelchair to hide her,"
"and she said, ""You can't do that."""
Huh.
"""This is tradition."
"This is what old people are supposed to be, thrown over the, the cliff."""
"And, uh, he said, ""I don't understand."""
"It's, it's real funny that they give the teenagers the, as the one that questions, uh, the, what's going on."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, in the end of, uh, the son-in-law, when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff, uh, the the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says, ""No, you can't do it,"" and then, and then, uh, ""Oh, well, we've got to do it. It's tradition,"""
"and the son was, you know, ""Why?"""
"And so, in, in the end he doesn't throw her over,"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, he doesn't."
"and, of course, the town thinks he's just terrible, because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it."
"And then we saw one where this, there was a teenage, when a teenage boy comes into his manhood,"
"they call it the night of the howling, or something like that,"
Uh-huh.
"and they all go out and howl, you know"
"And, and the son refused to do it."
"He, he did,"
he thought it was not ...
"If you had to do something like that, day after day."
No one would want the job
No.
Not really.
"Uh, and, you know, like I said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case."
"Well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,"
Oh yeah.
"I, I feel that everyone is, everyone is, uh, entitled to a trial by jury."
"That, that, that right"
"I mean, supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you."
"Well, I mean, were there witnesses?"
"In other words you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were."
Right.
Right.
"That you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case."
Yeah.
I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
Yeah.
"and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances"
"Well, I, I,"
"Okay, Mary."
Yes.
"Um, the, uh, the latest one I've seen, uh, had to do with a, uh, uh, the, uh, basically a manhunt, um,"
"and it was, uh, it was called MANHUNTER, actually."
"Uh, the, uh, the guy, uh, apparently had a, a, mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people. Uh, just, uh, kill them with, with as much blood and, and guts as possible."
"Oh, how awful"
"It was true, it was truly awful."
"It was not one that I picked,"
"but, uh, uh, it, it did show some, some, uh, some interesting things about the F B I"
"because they were the, the, uh, the characters trying, trying to get him were F B I people"
"and, uh, uh, of the, of the few good things that were in it, it did show, uh, a lot about the F B I. About the training, and, and how they go through training and how they try to, to develop, uh, uh, a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that."
"And it was, uh, uh, it was pretty telling about the, the, the F B I and their procedures."
Yes.
"Well, uh, take off is, uh, fun from El Paso because you normally,"
"the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain, the Rockies"
Yes.
and they're towering above you
and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again.
"Yeah,"
"we're kind of used to that here in Utah,"
"course, there are mountains,"
and I fly into Montana a lot
"and we have a,"
"the mountains are, are really, uh, high"
"and a lot of places we go in to, you just kind of, uh,"
"it's in the little valley,"
"but, I, uh, sure hope we,"
we really need the moisture.
"I hope we can get, uh, get some."
"There's supposed to be a storm,"
"but it split, went down through, uh, northern Arizona and southern Utah"
"and they're not predicting any for the next, uh, week anyway up here"
"so,"
"Well, I noticed on the weather map on, uh, cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way,"
"but I guess it didn't pan out, huh?"
"Yeah,"
"well, that's, that's what the,"
"above, uh,"
"some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana,"
"so that just left us,"
we got a high pressure system which been sitting in the
Huh.
"and, uh, we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had, uh, you know"
"Oh, boy."

"Liberator is an arcade game released by Atari, Inc. in 1982. It is based on the ""Atari Force"" comic book series published by DC Comics from 1982 to 1986. ""Liberator"" has been described as the opposite of ""Missile Command"", in that the player destroys cities from space instead of defending them from the ground. Only 762 arcade machines were ever made."
"The story ""Code Name: Liberator"" describes the premise of the arcade game in detail and was included as a special insert in two comic books cover dated January 1983. Characters and concepts from the comic exist throughout the game. In the opening screen of the arcade game, Commander Champion of the ""Atari Force"" asks the player to help free the galaxy from the evil Malaglon Army."
"The ""Liberator"" controls consist of a trackball, fire button, and shield button. The player controls a coordinated attack from four star ships at the corners of the screen. The primary target of the attack are enemy bases on a rotating planet in the center of the screen. The trackball is used to move a cross-shaped cursor. The fire button fires a missile at the cursor's location from the closest ship. The shield button is used to activate force fields around the ships. The shield can only take four hits each round, and the count is shared between all ships."
"At the beginning of each level, the player is flying through outer space and spaceships fly on screen from the left and right and leave in an arc. They try to ram into the player's ships. Shields do not work during this stage."
"After this stage, the player is taken to a view of a rotating planet. The most prominent enemies are red flashing missile bases. They shoot missiles, fireballs, and star balls at the player's ships. The enemy bases can also detach from the planet, turn into satellites, and orbit the planet while shooting missiles. Once all missile bases are destroyed, the player moves on to the next level. At higher levels, there is the white master base. It is very intelligent, and it can change the direction or speed of the planet rotation to avoid getting hit. At the end of each stage, the player is awarded a bonus ship for every 20,000 points."
"Missiles can be destroyed, although some split into four smaller particles when destroyed. Fireballs take four hits to destroy, but they slow down on each hit. Star balls also take four hits to destroy, but return to normal speed soon after being hit."
"Flying saucers sometimes appear from the planet. Flying saucers shoot a large, deadly laser which cannot be stopped."
"A level select menu allows the player to start at any third level (1, 4, 7... up to 22)."
"""Liberator"" was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2003 as part of ""Atari Anthology"", a collection of Atari arcade and 2600 games."

"Forget the Rules was an Australian short form episodic comedy-drama, which ran for two seasons from 2005 to 2007. It was the first scripted drama in the world to simultaneously broadcast over broadband, mobile phones and television. It employed the push model of crossmedia, and was one of the more successful models of an often failed interactive format that included audience input into the script and submitting visual elements as part of a tight weekly production cycle. It was conceived and piloted in Australia during 2004. In Canada, Season 1 has been broadcast on Movieola."
"Season 1 of Forget the Rules ran on Channel V (Foxtel), Hutchison 3G mobile phones and on the web, and consisted of nine minutes of drama produced every week featuring audience-driven story directions. Three-minute episodes were broadcast on Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday, starting October 10, 2005. Audiences voted on a choice of three possible story directions following the Wednesday episode. The 117 minutes of production (39 x 3min episodes) represents the equivalent of 5 x 30min episodes on free-to-air TV."
"Season 2 ran weekdays from November 12, 2007 to December 21, 2007. The series was distributed across Optus Television (Ovation Channel weekdays, The Music Factory weeknights) and Optus Zoo (mobile), as well as online through the show's website, YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace."
"The Season 1 scripts were written on Thursday based on the most popular audience vote. Pre-production and rehearsal on Friday. All nine minutes of the show was shot on Saturday and was broadcast each Monday-Wednesday throughout the 13-week season. Because of the requirement for rapid turnaround, stories were designed to be topical and responsive to genuine audience input, and was limited to an M rating. ""Forget the Rules"" was designed to appeal to story literate young audiences through interactivity. Jim Shomos, the creator and executive producer, was cited as saying young audiences need “more story per minute” and emphasised the importance of fast-paced stories with rapid developments, particularly for short form content:"

"Müngsten Bridge is the highest railway bridge in Germany. The bridge is high and spans the valley of the river Wupper, connecting the cities of Remscheid and Solingen. This stretch is part of the Wuppertal-Oberbarmen–Solingen railway. It is used exclusively by the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn line S 7. On 1 April 2013, the Müngsten Bridge was closed for extensive renovation work: it reopened on 27 July 2015, but a further lengthy closure for a comprehensive corrosion treatment is planned for 2018. During the works, the train from Solingen Hbf to Remscheid Hbf terminated at Solingen Mitte and a bus continued to Remscheid."
"Originally the bridge was named ""Kaiser-Wilhelm-Brücke"" (Emperor Wilhelm Bridge) to honour Emperor Wilhelm I. After the end of the monarchy the bridge was renamed after the nearby settlement of Müngsten, which is close to the city limits of Solingen, Remscheid and Wuppertal. Today, the settlement no longer exists, so Müngsten is simply a landmark."
"First drafts for a bridge connecting the two cities of Remscheid and Solingen go back as far as 1889. Preparatory work began in 1893, the bridge was finished in 1897."
"The six support columns have a maximum height of 69 meters (230 ft). In the middle of the structure, the main arc has a span of 170 meters (560 ft). The overall length of the structure is 465 meters (1,530 ft)."
"A total of 5,000 tons (4,900 LT; 5,500 ST) of steel were used in its construction. 950,000 rivets hold the structure together. During construction, a number of advanced building techniques were used."
"Anton von Rieppel (1852 – 31 January 1926), an architect and engineer, was in charge of the project. A memorial plaque at the foot of the bridge reminds one of his efforts."
"Originally, the bridge was planned to be single-track. However, high future traffic growth projections led to the redesign as a dual-track bridge.

The Prussian Parliament approved the 5 million Marks required to build the bridge in 1890.
"The first breaking of the earth was on 26 February 1894. A total of 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb) of dynamite and 1,600 kilograms (3,500 lb) of black powder were needed during construction."
"The bridge's official inauguration celebration took place on 15 July 1897. Emperor Wilhelm II did not attend the ceremony in person. Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia attended the festivities instead. Emperor Wilhelm II visited the bridge two years later, on 12 August 1899."

"Itbāy () or ʿAtbāy is a region of southeastern Egypt and northeastern Sudan. It is characterised by a chain of mountains, the Red Sea Hills, running north–south and parallel with the Red Sea. The hills separate the narrow coastal plain from the Eastern Desert."
"The Red Sea Hills are composed of the exposed Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary rock of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Although the rock itself is 550–900 million years old, the mountains were created by uplift when the Red Sea itself was formed in the Oligocene, only some 23–34 million years ago. The Red Sea Hills are thus part of the same formation as the Sarawat Mountains of Saudi Arabia and the mountains of the Sinai Peninsula. The Red Sea Hills rise almost to today, but in the past were much higher. The Oligocene uplift caused the rejuvenation of their streams and the increased erosion removed most of the limestone and sandstone to expose the basement layer."
"The Itbāy is arid, receiving less than of rainfall each year with high variability. The Barka River, the most significant of the few seasonal streams that flow into the Red Sea, rises in the Red Sea Hills of Sudan and empties into the sea at the Tokar Delta. In prehistorica times it was probably a permanent river."
"The Red Sea Hills are a source of porphyry, which was being mined as early as the fourth millennium BC."
"The Red Sea Hills are inhabited by the Beja people, who practice pastoralism and live mainly near the dry riverbeds, ""wādī""s, that flow seasonally into the sea and the Nile, where there is limited vegetation. In antiquity, the Beja were known as the Blemmyes and their presence in the hills is detected archaeologically by the presence of Eastern Desert Ware from the fourth century AD. The material culture of the hills places it firmly within ancient Egypt's sphere of influence. Extensive mining settlements have been found in the Wadi Allaqi and the Wadi Gabgaba. The early Blemmyes built platform tumuli (flat-topped burial mounds), and the appearance of cairns to mark burials in the late Middle Ages may be linked to Islamization."

= = = Itinerarium = = =
"An itinerarium (plural: itineraria) was an Ancient Roman road map in the form of a listing of cities, villages (""vici"") and other stops, with the intervening distances. One surviving example is the Peutinger Table (""Tabula Peutingeriana""); another is the Antonine Itinerary."
"The Romans and ancient travelers in general did not use maps. They may have existed as specialty items in some of the libraries, but they were hard to copy and were not in general use. On the Roman road system, however, the traveller needed some idea of where he or she was going, how to get there, and how long it would take. The ""itinerarium"" filled this need. In origin it was simply a list of cities along a road: ""at their most basic, ""itineraria"" involve the transposition of information given on milestones, which were an integral feature of the major Roman roads, to a written script."" It was only a short step from lists to a master list. To sort out the lists, the Romans drew diagrams of parallel lines showing the branches of the roads. Parts of these were copied and sold on the streets. The very best featured symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The maps did not represent landforms but they served the purpose of a simple schematic diagram for the user."
"The Roman government from time to time undertook to produce a master itinerary of all Roman roads. Julius Caesar and Mark Antony commissioned the first known such effort in 44 BC. Zenodoxus, Theodotus, and Polyclitus, three Greek geographers, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary. This task required over 25 years. The result was a stone engraved master ""itinerarium"" set up near the Pantheon, from which travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies."
"Archaeology has turned up some itinerary material in unexpected places. The Cups of Cadiz, four silver cups found by workmen excavating a foundation at Bracciano in 1852, are engraved with the names and distances of stations between Cadiz and Rome. The term itinerary changed meaning over the centuries. In the ""Itinerarium Burdigalense"" (Bordeaux Pilgrim, 333 AD), the itinerary is a description of what route to take to the Holy Land. The ""Itinerarium Alexandri"" is a list of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Today it means either a travel journal or a list of recommended stops."

"The ""Syöksy""-class motor torpedo boats () was a series of four British Thornycroft type motor torpedo boats of the Finnish Navy. The vessels were constructed in 1928 by the John Thornycroft & Co. shipyard in Woolton, UK. The vessels saw service in World War II. The Thornycroft type released its torpedoes by dropping them from rails in the aft. The ship then had to steer away from the torpedoes path, a manoeuvre that could be quite tricky in the close waters of the Gulf of Finland."
"In 1942, the vessels received individual identification symbols on their superstructures. ""Nuoli"" had the ace of hearts, ""Vinha"" the ace of clubs, ""Syöksy"" the ace of diamonds, and ""Raju"" the ace of spades."
"On 6 July 1941 ""Syöksy"" and ""Vinha"" sortied to intercept a convoy of three sailing ships headed for Hanko. In heavy seas the torpedoes did not function reliably and the boats could not hit their targets. Instead ""Syöksy"" dashed past the lead ship and dropped its depth charges in front of it which exploded and sank the sailing ship. Both Finnish motor torpedo boats escaped unharmed before escorting Soviet ships could respond."
"On the night of 19 and 20 July 1941 Finnish motor torpedo boats were patrolling of the coast of Estonia when a Soviet destroyer opened fire on them. ""Vinha"" was damaged and unable to move but Finns were able to tow it to safety while ""Syöksy"" made repeated torpedo runs towards the destroyer drawing its fire and distracting it."
"On 1 September 1941 ""Syöksy"" and ""Vinha"" were patrolling south of the Beryozovye Islands when they came across a pair of Soviet freighters. ""Syöksy"" torpedoed and sank the lead merchant (SS ""Meero"", 1,866 tons)."
"On 22 September 1941 ""Syöksy"" sank the Soviet minehunter ""T-41"" (""Kirov"") east of Gogland while it was patrolling near the island with ""Vinha""."
"On 1 October 1941 ""Nuoli"" participated in the sinking of a Soviet minehunter, though it was a torpedo from ""Sisu"" that sank the target."
"""Syöksy"", ""Vinha"" and , as well as a minelaying KM boat participated in the attack on the harbour of Lavansaari on 18 November 1942. ""Syöksy"" managed to torpedo the (1,760 tons), which sank."

"Microsoft Network Monitor is a deprecated packet analyzer. It enables capturing, viewing, and analyzing network data and deciphering network protocols. It can be used to troubleshoot network problems and applications on the network. Microsoft Network Monitor 1.0 (codenamed ""Bloodhound"") was originally designed and developed by Raymond Patch, a transport protocol and network adapter device driver engineer on the Microsoft LAN Manager development team."
Network Monitor was replaced by Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA was discontinued in 2019).
"The LAN Manager development team had one shared hardware-based analyzer at the time. Netmon was conceived when the hardware analyzer was taken during a test to reproduce a networking bug, and the first Windows prototype was coded over the Christmas holiday. The first 4 bytes of the Netmon capture file format were used to validate the file. The values were 'RTSS' for Ray, Tom, Steve, and Steve - the first four members of the team. The code was originally written for OS/2 and had no user interface; a symbol was placed in the device driver where the packet buffers were kept so received data could be dumped in hex from within the kernel debugger."
"Netmon caused a bit of a stir for Microsoft IT since networks and e-mail were not encrypted at the time. Only a few software engineers had access to hardware analyzers due to their cost, but with Netmon many engineers around the company had access to network traffic for free. At the request of Microsoft IT, two simple identification features were added - a non-cryptographic password and an identification protocol named the Bloodhound-Oriented Network Entity (BONE) (created and named by Raymond Patch as a play on the codename ""Bloodhound"")."

The Chebyshev linkage is a mechanical linkage that converts rotational motion to approximate straight-line motion.
"It was invented by the nineteenth-century mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, who studied theoretical problems in kinematic mechanisms. One of the problems was the construction of a linkage that converts a rotary motion into an approximate straight-line motion. This was also studied by James Watt in his improvements to the steam engine."
"The straight-line linkage confines the point ""P"" – the midpoint on the link ""L"" – on a straight line at the two extremes and at the center of travel. (""L"", ""L"", ""L"", and ""L"" are as shown in the illustration.) Between those points, point ""P"" deviates slightly from a perfect straight line. The proportions between the links are"
"Point P is in the middle of ""L"". This relationship assures that the link ""L"" lies vertically when it is at one of the extremes of its travel."
The lengths are related mathematically as follows:
"It can be shown that if the base proportions described above are taken as lengths, then for all cases,"
"and this contributes to the perceived straight-line motion of point ""P""."
"The motion of the linkage can be constrained to an input angle that may be changed through velocities, forces, etc. The input angles can be either link ""L"" with the horizontal or link ""L"" with the horizontal. Regardless of the input angle, it is possible to compute the motion of two end-points for link ""L"" that we will name A and B, and the middle point P."
"while the motion of point B will be computed with the other angle,"
"And ultimately, we will write the output angle in terms of the input angle,"
"Consequently, we can write the motion of point P, using the two points defined above and the definition of the middle point."

= = = International Workers' Olympiads = = =
"International Workers' Olympiads were an international sporting event arranged between 1925 and 1937 by Socialist Workers' Sport International (SASI). It was an organisation supported by social democratic parties and International Federation of Trade Unions. Workers' Olympiads were an alternate event for the Olympic Games. The participants were members of various labor sports associations and came mostly from Europe. Nowadays the CSIT World Sports Games are the successor sports events of the International Workers' Olympiads. The ""World Sports Games"" is the main highlight and a new Brand of the CSIT. It is a unique major sports event for thousands of workers and amateurs every two years. The CSIT (International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation) is an international Multi-Sports Organization."
"The Workers' Olympiads were created as a counterweight for the Olympic Games, which were criticized for being confined for the upper social classes and privileged people. The international workers' sports movement did not believe that the true Olympic spirit could be achieved in an Olympic movement dominated by the aristocratic leadership. Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, had always opposed women's participation and supported the cultural superiority of white Europeans over other races. His followers, Henri de Baillet-Latour and Avery Brundage, were openly anti-semitic and both collaborated with the Nazis. On the contrary, the Workers' Olympiads opposed all kinds of chauvinism, sexism, racism and social exclusiveness. The Olympic Games were based in rivalry between the nations, but the Workers' Olympiads stressed internationalism, friendship, solidarity and peace."
"The Lucerne Sport International (later known as Socialist Workers' Sport International) was established in Lucerne, Switzerland in 1920. The first unofficial Workers' Olympiads were held a year later in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The IOC had banned the losing side of the World War I from the 1920 Summer Olympics (Germany even from the 1924 games), but the Workers's Olympiads were open for the ""enemy"" side as well. The number of participating countries was thirteen. The first official Worker's Olympiads were the 1925 winter games in the German town of Schreiberhau, which today is a part of Poland. They were followed by the first Summer Olympiads in Frankfurt am Main."
"National flags were not used, but a red flag of international workers' movement. The best athletes were awarded with diplomas, they did not receive medals like in the Olympic Games. The visiting athletes stayed mostly at private accommodation of local families."
"International Workers' Olympiads were more than just a games for the top athletes. The festival was based on a mass participation, it did not restrict entry on the grounds of sporting ability. 1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad in Vienna was the largest event with the participation of 100,000 athletes from 26 countries. The Vienna Workers' Olympiad attracted some 250,000 spectators. It was much bigger event than the 1932 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles, both in number of participants as well as spectators. Praterstadion (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion) was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for the 1931 Olympiad. The last Workers' Olympiad at Antwerp in 1937 was a joint event with the Red Sport International organized Spartakiads."

The ship has four holds, 17 hatches and is equipped with a discharge boom that can swing 105 degrees to either side of the ship and discharges 3,810 tonnes per hour."
"The ship was constructed by Collingwood Shipyards at their yard in Collingwood, Ontario with the yard number 189. ""Algorail"" was launched on 13 December 1967, christened on 1 April 1968 and completed that month. The second freighter of the name was registered at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario for Algoma Central.

Hovey was one of a group of Boston businessmen who had provided most of the funding for the American Anti-Slavery Society in the years prior to the American Civil War.
"During and after the war the Hovey fund helped to sustain the Anti-Slavery Society as fund-raising became more difficult and the cost of publishing abolitionist newspapers increased sharply. After slavery in the U.S. was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, the fund's continued support assisted the Anti-Slavery Society's campaign for the political rights of the newly freed slaves, playing a crucial role in the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment and Fifteenth Amendments, which secured citizenship and voting rights for African Americans."
"A controversy over the fund developed after the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified. Hovey's will stipulated that if slavery was abolished before the fund's money was exhausted, the remainder was to be channeled to other specified reform movements, including the women's rights movement. Despite the fact that the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in 1865, Phillips declared that slavery would not truly be abolished until African Americans secured the right to vote, and he continued to channel much of the fund's money to that cause."

In relation to the political arena, UN Women reported that a 2012 study made by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) ranked Uruguay as being ""103rd out of 189 countries in terms of representation of women in Parliament"". Uruguay low ranking is partly due to its low political participation of women: only 16% of members of Parliament are women as of 2014."

"The great dodecahemicosacron is the dual of the great dodecahemicosahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra. It appears visually indistinct from the small dodecahemicosacron."
"Since the hemipolyhedra have faces passing through the center, the dual figures have corresponding vertices at infinity; properly, on the real projective plane at infinity. In Magnus Wenninger's ""Dual Models"", they are represented with intersecting prisms, each extending in both directions to the same vertex at infinity, in order to maintain symmetry. In practice the model prisms are cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker. Wenninger suggested these figures are members of a new class of stellation figures, called ""stellation to infinity"".

"Pagri or Phari (; ) is a town in Yadong County in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China near the border with Bhutan. the town had a population of 2,121. It is one of the highest towns in the world, being about above sea-level at the head of the Chumbi Valley."
"Thomas Manning, the first Englishman to reach Lhasa, visited Pagri from 21September until 5November 1811 and had this to say about his room in the town: ""Dirt, dirt, grease, smoke. Misery, but good mutton."" Pagri was of some military importance in the early 20th century when it was occupied by the British Tibet Expedition under Francis Younghusband in 1904. The Pagri Fortress (""Dzong"") was located here and was important for the government as it stood between Tibet and Bhutan. Pagri was a staging area en route to Gyantse and ultimately Lhasa."
"During the summer of 1912, the 13th Dalai Lama met Agvan Dorzhiev at Phari Dzong and then accompanied him to the Samding Monastery, before returning to Lhasa after his exile in India."
"Thubten Ngodup, the current Nechung Oracle, was born in Phari in 1957."
"The houses are mostly made of Tibetan traditional stone and wood. The Pagri Valley lies in an alpine steppe zone on the south side, with an average annual temperature , and an extreme maximum temperature of . Annual precipitation is about , snow and ice melt forming rich water resources, shrubs and meadows development, a good place for the development of animal husbandry. Pagri is rich in minerals, wild animals, plants, and tourism resources. It is also a trading centre but due to geographical location is prone to natural disasters. Summer flash floods, mudslides, winter avalanches, snowstorms, etc. are common, and poor facilities makes it vulnerable to disaster. During the rainy season, water levels rise causing serious flooding, reducing soil quality and arable land every year, damaging the ecological environment and a threat to the inhabitants of Pagri. To the northeast of Pagri is Mount Jomolhari."
"Owing to its extreme altitude, Pagri has an alpine climate (Köppen ""ETH"") that is too cold to permit the growth of trees, even though the altitude is still marginally too low for the formation of permafrost.

= = = Great icosihemidodecahedron = = =
"In geometry, the great icosihemidodecahedron (or great icosahemidodecahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
It is a hemipolyhedron with 6 decagrammic faces passing through the model center.
"Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the great icosidodecahedron (having the triangular faces in common), and with the great dodecahemidodecahedron (having the decagrammic faces in common)."
"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, the ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

"Rainulf II, called Trincanocte, was the fourth Count of Aversa (1045–1048), the cousin of his immediate predecessor Asclettin and nephew of Rainulf Drengot, the founder of their family's fortunes in the Mezzogiorno. There was a succession crisis after the premature death of Asclettin and Guaimar IV of Salerno, as suzerain of Aversa, tried to impose his candidate on the Normans, but they elected Trincanocte and he prevailed in getting Guaimar's recognition too. In 1047, he was present at a council with Pandulf IV of Capua and Guaimar, where the former was returned to his princely position and the latter's great domain was broken up. The feudal titles of Rainulf and Drogo of Hauteville, count of Apulia, were confirmed by the Emperor Henry III and they were made his direct vassals. Within a year, Trincanocte died and was succeeded by his infant son Herman under the regency of his cousin Richard, whom he had originally spurned, believing him to be a dangerous rival. Soon, Herman was displaced (or worse) and Richard was count."

"Todd Nauck is an American comic book artist and writer. Nauck is most notable for his work on ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,"" ""Young Justice"" and his own creation, ""Wildguard""."
"Nauck's first assignment from Marvel Comics was writing, penciling and inking ""Mutant Mishaps"", a story that was published on the back cover of ""What The--?!"" #21 (September 1992). He subsequently wrote and illustrated the ""Mutant Mishaps"" story that appeared in ""What The--?"" #25 (Summer 1993)."
"In early 1994, Todd was hired by Rob Liefeld's Extreme Studios of Image Comics when a friend from art school showed his ""WildGuard"" work to Dan Fraga at a comic book convention, who in turn showed it to Liefeld, which led to Nauck's first Image work. Nauck went on to draw such series as ""Badrock and Co."", ""New Men"", ""New Force"", ""Supreme"", ""Youngblood"" and ""Team Youngblood"". By 1997, Nauck began work with DC Comics. After drawing several ""Legion of Superheroes"" stories, he helped launch the ""Young Justice"" series with writer Peter David. Nauck drew 53 issues of the 55 issue run of the series, including three double-sized issues and a portion of the ""Young Justice/Spyboy"" crossover mini-series."
"Nauck published his creator-owned series, ""Wildguard"", with Image Comics. The series was patterned after a reality television show competition, in which various wannabe superheroes competed for a spot on a new superhero team, and judged by a panel of judges, as on the television series ""American Idol""."
"Nauck's other work includes ""Teen Titans"" (Volume 3) #32-33, ""Teen Titans Go!"", ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man"" #11-13 and 17-23, ""American Dream"" #1-5, S""pider-Man: the Clone Saga"" #1-6, ""Amazing Spider-Man"" #628 and the covers for ""X-Campus"" #1-4."

= = = Sideritis = = =
"Sideritis (Gr: σιδηρίτις), also known as ironwort, mountain tea and shepherd's tea, is a genus of flowering plants well known for their use as herbal medicine, commonly as an herbal tea. They are abundant in Mediterranean regions, the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula and Macaronesia, but can also be found in Central Europe and temperate Asia."
"In Greek ""sideritis"" can be literally translated as ""he who is made of iron"". The plant was known to ancient Greeks, specifically Pedanius Dioscorides and Theophrastus. Although Dioscorides describes three species, only one (probably ""S. scordioides"") is thought to belong to ""Sideritis"". In ancient times ""sideritis"" was a generic reference for plants capable of healing wounds caused by iron weapons during battles. However, others hold that the name stems from the shape of the sepal, which resembles the tip of a spear."
"In 2002, molecular phylogenetic research found ""Sideritis"" and five other genera to be embedded in ""Stachys"". Further studies will be needed before ""Stachys"", ""Sideritis"", and their closest relatives can be revised."
"Some schemes recognize and categorize up to 319 distinct species, subspecies, ecotypes, forms or cultivars, including:"
"Botanists have encountered difficulties in naming and classifying the varieties of ""Sideritis"" due to their subtle differences. One particularly confusing case is that of ""S. angustifolia"" Lagasca and ""S. tragoriganum"" Lagasca."
"The genus is composed of short (8–50 cm), xerophytic subshrubs or herbs, annual or perennial, that grow at high altitudes (usually over 1000 m) with little or no soil, often on the surface of rocks."
"It is pubescent, either villous or coated by a fine, woolly layer of microscopic intertwined hairs."
"""Sideritis"" inflorescence is verticillaster."
"Very popular in Greece, Turkey, Albania, Kosovo, Bulgaria and North Macedonia, ""Sideritis scardica"" is used as a herb either for the preparation of herbal teas, or for its aromatic properties in local cuisines. The herbal tea is commonly prepared by decoction, by boiling the stems, leaves and flowers in a pot of water, then often serving with honey and lemon."
"Ironwort has been traditionally used to aid digestion, strengthen the immune system and suppress common cold, the flu and other viruses, allergies and shortness of breath, sinus congestion, even pain and mild anxiety."
"Scientists have suggested that the popular pronouncement of ironwort as panacea may have some basis in fact. Studies indicate a positive effect on many common ailments. Ironwort is known scientifically to be anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant. Active elements include diterpenoid and flavonoids. Significant research has been done on ironwort confirming its popular use to prevent colds, flu, and allergies. Most of this research has taken place in universities in the Netherlands and in Greece, Turkey, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Albania, where the plant is indigenous."
"""Sideritis raeseri"" is the most commonly cultivated ""Sideritis"" in Bulgaria, Greece, Albania and North Macedonia, where advanced hybrids also exist. Planting is recommended during two periods (October–November or February–March in the Northern hemisphere) and gathering in July, when in full bloom. The plant is typically dried before usage."

"Hubert Max Lanier (August 18, 1915 – January 30, 2007) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who spent most of his career with the St. Louis Cardinals. He led the National League in earned run average in 1943, and was the winning pitcher of the clinching game in the 1944 World Series against the crosstown St. Louis Browns. His son Hal became a major league infielder and manager."
"Born in Denton, North Carolina, Lanier was one of a handful of players who remained active during the World War II years. A naturally right-handed player, he had become a left-handed pitcher only because he twice broke his right arm in childhood. After signing with the Cardinals in 1937, he reached the major leagues in 1938. He had arguably his best season in 1943, compiling a 15–7 record with a league-best 1.90 ERA. In 1944 he won a career-high 17 games, and was the winner of the final game of the World Series against the crosstown Browns. He was named an NL All-Star in both 1943 and 1944."
"Lanier, along with a dozen other major leaguers, defected to the Mexican League in 1946 after being offered a salary nearly double what he was making with the Cardinals. Disappointed by poor playing conditions and allegedly broken contract promises, he tried to return to the Cardinals in 1948, but was barred by an order from commissioner Happy Chandler, imposing a five-year suspension on all players who had jumped to the Mexican League. In response, Lanier and teammate Fred Martin, as well as Danny Gardella of the New York Giants, sued Major League Baseball in federal court, challenging baseball's reserve clause as a violation of U.S. antitrust law (preceding the similar suit by Curt Flood some 25 years later). Chandler reinstated Lanier and the other players in June 1949. Lanier immediately held out for more money than he was being paid at the time of his leaving for Mexico, but eventually signed a contract paying him the same amount as in 1946."
"Lanier rejoined the Cardinals in 1949. After winning a total of 101 games for the club, he ended his career with the New York Giants (1952–53) and the Browns (1953)."
"Over fourteen seasons, Lanier posted a 108–82 record with 821 strikeouts and a 3.01 ERA in 1619 innings pitched, including 21 shutouts and 91 complete games."

"National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a poverty alleviation project implemented by Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. This scheme is focused on promoting self-employment and organization of rural poor. The basic idea behind this programme is to organize the poor into SHG (Self Help Groups) groups and make them capable for self-employment. In 1999 after restructuring Integrated Rural Development Programme(IRDP), Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) launched Swarnajayanti Grameen Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY) to focus on promoting self-employment among rural poor. SGSY is now remodeled to form NRLM thereby plugging the shortfalls of SGSY programme. This scheme was launched in 2011 with a budget of $5.1 billion and is one of the flagship programmes of Ministry of Rural Development. This is one of the world's largest initiatives to improve the livelihood of poor. This programme is supported by the World Bank with a credit of $1 Billion. The scheme was succeeded by Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana on 25 September 2015."
The basic idea behind this scheme was to form SHG groups and help them to start some entrepreneurial activities but later SHG group failed.
"The core belief of National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is that the poor have innate capabilities and a strong desire to come out of poverty. They are entrepreneurial, an essential coping mechanism to survive under conditions of poverty. The challenge is to unleash their capabilities to generate meaningful livelihoods and enable them to come out of poverty."
"""To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self- employment and skilled wage employment opportunities resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong and sustainable grassroots institutions of the poor."""
The core values which guide all the activities under NRLM are as follows:
"In order to build, support and sustain livelihood of the poor, NRLM will harness their capability and complement them with capacities (information, knowledge, skill, tools, finance and collectivization), so that the poor can deal with the external world. NRLM works on three pillars – enhancing and expanding existing livelihoods options of the poor; building skills for the job market outside; and nurturing self-employed and entrepreneurs."

"The report Environmental Risks and Challenges of Anthropogenic Metals Flows and Cycles was the third of six scientific assessments on global metals to be published by the International Resource Panel (IRP) of the United Nations Environment Programme. The IRP provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including:"
"Metals and their compounds have been used for millennia because of their unique properties. They are used in highly valued products of modern technology, furthermore, they plan an essential role in renewable energy technologies. After having analyzed issues of metal stocks in society and recycling rates and recycling conditions and opportunities in the previous two reports on metals, Metal Stocks in Society report and Recycling Rates of Metals report, the International Resource Panel decides to address the environmental and energy issues related to the use and the production of metals. In this report, an assessment is made of literature on metal flows and cycles in nature and in society, the way they are connected, and the potential impacted related to them. The four areas of focus are 1) Local impacts of mining, 2) life cycle energy use, 3) non-metal sources, and 4) the need for a final sink. Furthermore, the author point out that a sustainable metals management cannot be defined in isolation, because a global issue like this is linked to many other issues at the global level: population and welfare increase, the concurrent expected rise in demand for food, water, and energy, the availability of metals and other non-renewable materials, the shift to a renewable energy system, dietary choices, etc. Therefore it should be part of an overall effort to steer society towards a more sustainable development."
"The production of different metals has different potentials to impact the environment. The report gives reasons to why metals can become relatively more important from an environmental impact point of view. First of all, the demand for most metals is rising rapidly and this trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Secondly, a shift towards a renewable energy system implies that the material, especially metal, intensity of energy production will increase substantially. Thirdly, in the future, the energy intensity of production of metals is expected to increase due to the use of lesser grade of ores."
"A cake was made which was called Soddag Valloo or Dumb Cake, because it was made and eaten in silence.

The cake was divided up and eaten in silence and, still without speaking, all who had eaten it went to bed, walking backwards, expecting and hoping to see their future husband in a dream or vision. The future husband was expected to appear in the dream and offer a drink of water."
"Other means of divination was to steal a salt herring from a neighbour, roast it over the fire, eat it in silence and retire to bed; or to hold a mouthful of water in your mouth and a pinch of salt in each hand as you listen to a neighbour's conversation, whereupon the first name mentioned would be that of your future spouse."

"The Coleophoridae are a family of small moths, belonging to the huge superfamily Gelechioidea. Collectively known as case-bearers, casebearing moths or case moths, this family is represented on all continents, but the majority are found in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. They are most common in the Palearctic, and rare in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Australia; consequently, they probably originated (like most or all other Gelechioidea families) in northern Eurasia. They are relatively common in houses, they seek out moist areas to rest and procreate."
"These ""micromoths"" are generally of slender build, and like in many of their relatives, the margins of their wings usually consist of a ""fringe"" of hairs. The tiny caterpillar larvae initially feed internally on the leaves, flowers, or seeds of their host plants. When they emerge to feed externally, they usually construct a protective silken case, discarded and built anew as they grow and molt. The common names of the Coleophoridae refer to this habit."
"The bagworm moths (Psychidae), which also belong to the primitive Ditrysia (although to superfamily Tineoidea, not Gelechioidea), build similar cases as larvae. As opposed to these, though, the case-bearer females leave their cases to pupate and have normally developed wings as adults, instead of being neotenous as female bagworms usually are."
"About 95% of the over 1,000 described species have been placed in the ""wastebin genus"" ""Coleophora"". Many proposals have been made to split smaller genera from ""Coleophora"", but few have been accepted, due to the uncertainties about which species are closest to the type species of ""Coleophora"" – ""C. anatipennella"" – and thus would remain in the genus."
"Regarding the family's circumscription versus other Gelechioidea, it is by now far less disputed than usual for this superfamily. The Blastobasidae, Momphidae (mompha moths), Pterolonchidae, and Symmocidae have formerly been included in the Coleophoridae as subfamilies, but are more often considered separate families today. With the internal relationships of Coleophoridae genera (as far as they are widely accepted) and species essentially unresolved due to the classification problems mentioned above, no subfamilies or tribes are accepted in the family for the time being."
Genera of case-bearers at least provisionally accepted by recent authors include:

"He also was a cum laude honor roll student, played basketball and ran track. His basketball teammates included Calbert Cheaney, an All-American at Indiana, Walter McCarty, who played at Kentucky, and Chris Lowery who played at Southern Illinois and is now an assistant coach at Kansas State University."
"Hardy accepted a football scholarship from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. As a redshirt freshman, he was third on the team with 67 tackles. As a sophomore, he started all 11 games and ranked fourth on the team with 78 tackles."
"As a junior, he registered 80 tackles. During his time at Illinois, the Fighting Illini had a number of outstanding linebackers. In the 1994 season, the four linebackers in coach Lou Tepper's 3–4 defense were Hardy, fellow Butkus Award winner Dana Howard, future NFL player John Holecek, and Simeon Rice. Because of this, Hardy was often overlooked as a linebacker. At his position, he was not prolific in accumulating tackles like Howard, or in quarterback sacks as was Rice, who as a ""rush linebacker"" played on the line of scrimmage like a defensive end."
"Hardy was recognized as being among the very best linebackers in college football as a senior, winning the Dick Butkus Award and receiving consensus first-team All-American honors. He started every game at ""drop"" linebacker, finishing with 105 tackles (second on the team), 11 sacks, 15 tackles for loss, 5 forced fumbles and 3 interceptions (tied for the team lead). He had 18 tackles against Michigan State University and 3 sacks against Indiana University."
"Hardy finished his career ranked ninth on the Illinois All-time list with 330 tackles, fourth in sacks with 18, and fourth in tackles for loss with 38. He was a business major and was initiated as a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity."
"Hardy was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the second overall choice in the 1996 NFL Draft, signing a six-year $14.8 million contract with a six million dollar signing bonus. Hardy's fellow linebacker at Illinois, Rice, was selected with the third overall choice. Hardy became the first defensive rookie in franchise history to start on opening day, going on to start 15 games. He recorded 130 tackles (second on the team), 5.5 sacks (third in the NFL among rookies), 7 quarterback hurries, 2 interceptions (tied for the team lead), 7 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and was named to the NFL All-Rookie team."
"In 1997, he was limited with injuries, starting 11 out of 13 games at strongside linebacker. He tallied 73 tackles (3 for loss), 2.5 sacks and 5 quarterback hurries. He suffered a sprained left medial collateral ligament against the Dallas Cowboys, missing 3 contests and seeing limited action in several games the remainder of the season because of the injury. He was able to start the wild card playoff game against the Denver Broncos, collecting 8 tackles."
"In 1998, with the signing of free agent Bryce Paup, he was moved to weakside linebacker and started all 16 games. He had a franchise record 186 tackles, while also making 1.5 sacks, 10 quarterback hurries, 2 interceptions, 7 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery."
"In 1999, Hardy led all AFC linebackers with 10.5 sacks and led the team with 153 tackles. He also had 7 tackles for loss, 24 quarterback hurries, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery, helping the Jaguars achieve a 14-win season. Hardy was selected to the Pro Bowl as well as named to the AP All-Pro first team."
"In 2000, he registered 149 tackles (led the team), 3 sacks, 16 quarterback pressures, 6 tackles for loss, one interception, 5 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries."
"In 2001, he was moved back to strongside linebacker, but injured his knee in the ninth game of the season. At the time he had 98 tackles (second on the team), 5 1/2 sacks (tied for third on the team), 9 quarterback pressures, one interception and 4 passes defensed. It would be his last game with the Jaguars, who eventually moved him to the injured reserve list, due to needing a microfracture surgery which was thought to be career threatening, because in those days not many players fully recovered from this medical procedure. He left as the franchise's All-time tackles leader, after playing six seasons, which included four trips to the NFL playoffs."
"The Dallas Cowboys gambled that he could return from the complex surgery and signed him on April 14, 2002, as an unrestricted free agent, counting $2.5 million in his first year and structuring the rest of the $23 million contract with a $5.025 million option in the second year."
"Hardy recovered from his injury and played for the Cowboys in the 2002 NFL season, finishing the season ranked third on the team in both total (114) and solo tackles(73), while making 2 sacks, 18 quarterback pressures, 8 tackles for loss, 10 passes defensed and 3 forced fumbles. He played outside linebacker, lining up as a defensive end in some passing downs. Because of salary cap issues, he was released on February 27, 2003, in order to avoid a $5.025 million option bonus if the Cowboys retained him."
"On March 6, 2003, he signed a four-year, $14 million USD contract with the Cincinnati Bengals as an unrestricted free agent, to be the Bengals new middle linebacker, after playing outside linebacker in his previous seasons. Hardy was an integral part of the Bengals' defense, starting all 16 games, leading the team in defensive snaps played (1,030 of 1,038 for 99.2%) and was second on the team in tackles (91)."
"In 2004, he was moved to strongside linebacker after the signing of free agent Nate Webster, starting 14 games and making 84 tackles. The Bengals terminated Hardy's contract in a salary-cap move on May 3, 2005."
"Hardy finished his career with 742 tackles (563 solo), 36 sacks, 43.5 tackles for loss, 11 forced fumbles, seven fumble recoveries, 45 pass deflections, five interceptions for 59 yards, and one touchdown in 134 games."

"During the event's ""Taboo Tuesday"" years, it was the first regularly-scheduled pay-per-view held by the company on a Tuesday since 1991's This Tuesday in Texas, the first regularly-scheduled non-Sunday pay-per-view since the 1994 Survivor Series, and the first non-Sunday pay-per-view of any kind since in 1996. The inaugural event was held in October, and the 2005 event was pushed back to early November. By 2006 the show was moved to a more traditional Sunday night slot—alleviating problems with the taping schedule of ""SmackDown!"" (usually held on Tuesdays)—and renamed Cyber Sunday."
"The most distinctive feature of Cyber Sunday was the ability for fans to vote on certain aspects of every match. The voting typically began in the middle of an episode of ""Raw"" a few weeks beforehand and ended during the pay-per-view, often moments before the match was slated to begin. Because of this, Cyber Sunday was billed as an ""interactive pay-per-view"". For the first four events, voting was made online through WWE.com, with the official tag line for the PPV being """"Log On. Take Over."""" In 2008 however, this was replaced by votes through text messaging but this was only available to United States mobile carriers. However, the match between The Undertaker and The Big Show was made universal, as fans were allowed to vote for the match stipulation on WWE.com."

"Upon opening, the mall had five anchor stores: G. Fox & Co., Jordan Marsh, Lechmere, Filene's, and J. C. Penney. Due to underperformance, the Filene's store closed in 1989 and was replaced with Steinbach, which relocated from South Hills Mall next door. Sears also announced plans to relocate from South Hills Plaza at the same time. Steinbach closed in 1995 and became Dick's Sporting Goods and DSW Shoe Warehouse the same year. Filene's returned to the mall in the early 1990s by taking over the defunct G. Fox chain, while Sears ultimately opened at the mall after Jordan Marsh was vacated.

leads to the perturbation of both the linear dispersion relation of photons and constant dispersion of charge waves by the avoided crossing between the two dispersion lines of polaritons.
Similarly to the acoustic and the optical phonons and far from the resonance one branch is photon-like while the other charge wave-like.
Mathematically the Hopfield dielectric for the one mode of excitation is equivalent to the Trojan wave packet in the harmonic
approximation. The Hopfield model of the dielectric predicts the existence of eternal trapped frozen photons similar to
the Hawking radiation inside the matter with
the density proportional to the strength of the matter-field coupling.
The Hamiltonian of the quantized Lorentz dielectric consisting of formula_1 harmonic oscillators interacting with the
quantum electromagnetic field can be written in the dipole approximation as:
and defining projections of oscillator charge waves onto the electromagnetic field
polarization directions
after dropping the longitudinal contributions not interacting with the electromagnetic field one may obtain the Hopfield Hamiltonian
Because the interaction is not
mixing polarizations this can be transformed to the normal form with the eigen-frequencies of two polaritonic branches:

In December 1992, Yilan County Government established the Museum Preparatory and Planning Committee and the official name of the museum was chosen to be Lanyang Museum. The museum location was chosen to be near Wushi Harbor area in Toucheng Township. In September 1994, the Yilan County Government appointed National Museum of Natural Science and Building and Planning Research Foundation of National Taiwan University to form the planning team to implement Lanyang Museum Overall Development and Planning Research which was completed in 1995. In March 1999, the Lanyang Museum Preparatory Office was established. Artech architecture was awarded the design and construction for the museum in April 2000."

= = = Word superiority effect = = =
"In cognitive psychology, the word superiority effect (WSE) refers to the phenomenon that people have better recognition of letters presented within words as compared to isolated letters and to letters presented within nonword (orthographically illegal, unpronounceable letter array) strings. Studies have also found a WSE when letter identification within words is compared to letter identification within pseudowords (e.g. ""WOSK"") and pseudohomophones (e.g. ""WERK"")."
"The effect was first described by Cattell (1886), and important contributions came from Reicher (1969) and Wheeler (1970). Cattell first wrote, ""I find it takes about twice as long to read...words which have no connexion as words which make sentences, and letters which have no connexions as letters which make words. When the words make sentences and the letters words, not only do the processes of seeing and naming overlap, but by one mental effort the subject can recognize a whole group of words or letters""."
"G. Reicher and D. Wheeler developed the basic experimental paradigm to study the WSE, referred to as the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm. In this paradigm, an observer is presented with a word or nonword string that is followed by a mask (brief stimulus to measure effects on behavior) . The observer is then asked to name one of the letters from the cued position in that word or string making the test a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC). For example, for the letter R in the word ""card"", an observer might be asked to choose between the letter R and T, and will usually be more efficient in doing so than if they are asked to make the same choice with the string of letters such as ""cqrd"". Each possible completion with the two possible letters in the word condition produce a word."
The WSE has since been exhaustively studied in the context of cognitive processes involved during reading. Large amounts of research have also been done to try to model the effect using connectionist networks.
"The WSE has traditionally been tested using a tachistoscope, as the durations of the letter string presentations need to be carefully controlled. Recently, stimulus presentation software has allowed much simpler manipulation of presentation durations using computers. The WSE has also been described without a tachistoscope."
"A string of letters, usually four or five, is flashed for several milliseconds onto a screen. Readers are then asked to choose which of two letters had been in the flashed string. For example, if ""WOSK"" had been flashed, a reader might have to decide whether ""K"" or ""H"" had been in ""WOSK"". A WSE arises when subjects choose the correct letter more consistently when letter strings are real words rather than nonwords (e.g. ""WKRG"") or single letters."
"The existence of a WSE generally implies that there is some type of access or encoding advantage that words have in the mind that pseudowords or single letters do not have. Various studies have proposed that the distinction is a result of pronounceability differences (nonwords are not pronounceable and therefore are not as easily remembered), frequency (real words are more frequently encountered and used), meaningfulness (real words have semantic value and therefore are better retained in memory), orthographic regularity (real words follow familiar spelling conventions and are therefore better retained in memory), or neighborhood density (real words tend to share more letters with other words than nonwords and therefore have more activation in the mind)."
"Other studies have proposed that the WSE is heavily affected or even induced by experimental factors, such as the type of masking used after the presentation of the word, or the duration of the masks."
= = = Clustered web hosting = = =
"Clustered hosting is a type of web hosting that spreads the load of hosting across multiple physical machines, or node, increasing availability and decreasing the chances of one service (e.g., FTP or email) affecting another (e.g., MySQL). Many large websites run on clustered hosting solutions, for example, large discussion forums will tend to run using multiple front-end webservers with multiple back-end database servers."
"Typically, most hosting infrastructures are based on the paradigm of using a single physical machine to host multiple hosted services, including web, database, email, FTP and others. A single physical machine is not only a single point of failure, but also has finite capacity for traffic, that in practice can be troublesome for a busy website or for a website that is experiencing transient bursts in traffic."
"By clustering services across multiple hardware machines and using load balancing, single points of failure can be eliminated, increasing availability of a website and other web services beyond that of ordinary single server hosting. A single server can require periodic reboots for software upgrades and the like, whereas in a clustered platform you can stagger the restarts such that the service is still available whilst still upgrading all necessary machines in the cluster."
"Clustered hosting is similar to cloud hosting, in that the resources of many machines are available for a website to utilize on demand, making scalability a large advantage to a clustered hosting solution."

"Well-known attendees and speakers included Governor General Michaëlle Jean, Stephen Lewis (the United Nations special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa), Bill and Melinda Gates (for the Gates Foundation), Richard Gere, Alicia Keys, and Bill Clinton."
"Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who decided not to attend the conference, was criticized by Conference co-chairman Dr. Mark Wainberg in his speech, saying, ""We are dismayed that the prime minister of Canada, Mr. Stephen Harper, is not here this evening...The role of prime minister includes the responsibility to show leadership on the world stage. Your absence sends the message that you do not consider HIV/AIDS as a critical priority, and clearly all of us here disagree with you"". Canadian Minister of Health Tony Clement attended in Harper's place. Harper's absence from the conference is the second time the Canadian head of government has decided not to attend the conference. In 1996, former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien did not attend the conference."
"A second controversy, that followed Mr. Stephen Harper's choice to not attend, was the fact that 151 delegates who were in attendance refused to return to their home countries – instead opting to seek asylum in Canada. This development seriously hurt the credibility of the conference and many suggested that the Prime Minister's office may have been justified in its decision to not have Mr. Harper in attendance."

SR 107 was created during the 1964 highway renumbering as the successor to a branch of Primary State Highway 9 (PSH 9), established earlier in 1937."
"SR 107 begins at an intersection with US 101 in rural Grays Harbor County between Cosmopolis and Raymond. The highway travels north along the Little North River and east along the Chehalis River through the communities of Preachers Slough and Melbourne. SR 107 turns north in South Montesano and crosses the Chehalis River into the city of Montesano before the designation ends at a diamond interchange with US 12, while the roadway continues north as Main Street into the city."
"Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 2,300 and 5,800 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Montesano area."

"The Burgess Model I, also known as the ""Burgess I-Scout"" and the ""Coast Defense Hydroaeroplane"", was a United States reconnaissance seaplane built for the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps in 1913. It was of conventional Wright Model B design but with an engine mounted amidships in an enclosed fuselage, driving by chains two large pusher propellers mounted on the interplane struts. The undercarriage consisted of twin pontoons. The single example built, S.C. No. 17, was delivered to the Army in January 1913 at the Burgess Company and Curtis factory in Massachusetts, then transported to Florida to complete the training of two officers. After the assignment, it was disassembled and moved to the Philippines in September 1913, where it was in and out of service several times before crashing into the sea near Corregidor on January 12, 1915. It is notable as the first U.S. Army aircraft to conduct two-way radio communication with the ground in December 1914."
"The Burgess Model I was placed into service as Signal Corps Number 17 (S.C. No. 17) in January 1913 to complete the training of Lieutenants Loren H. Call and Eric L. Ellington at Palm Beach, Florida. Following this assignment it was disassembled and shipped by sea to the Philippine Aviation School near Manila, arriving in the first week of September. When it was uncrated for assembly, it was found to have been damaged so severely in transit that both its upper and lower wings needed replacing. 2d Lt. Herbert A. Dargue, a Coast Artillery officer trained as a pilot at the Philippine Aviation School, was detailed October 18 to fly the plane, based on the beach at San Jose on the south side of Corregidor in Manila Bay. After it was placed back into service in November 1913, it was found that center-of-gravity problems with its front-and-back seating arrangement and heavy pontoons made it incapable of taking off with two persons aboard. Dargue continued one-man operations and with a Coast Artillery officer devised a primitive method of signaling with small parachutes and a Very pistol to indicate misses."
"S.C. 17 was reconditioned by January 1914 with lighter pontoons that permitted two-man operation. Its hangar was supplied with a cement floor and a marine railway built down to the water to assist in launching the aircraft. The S.C. No. 17 participated in maneuvers with ground troops in February but was damaged during landing on February 20, and was out of service for a month. Between April 28 and May 15 it resumed adjusting fire for the Coast Artillery before going into storage for the rainy season."
"When he resumed flying activity in the fall of 1914, Dargue began testing a small radio transmitter-receiver built by a local unit, and was damaged again in October experimenting with antenna location. Ultimately a wire antenna was paid out behind the aircraft in flight from a reel. Further problems of engine noise, ignition interference, burnout of the signal detector by proximity of the transmitter, and loss of calibration from engine vibration were all overcome. On December 1, 1914, Dargue and 1st Lt. Joseph O. Mauborgne, the Signal Corps officer in charge of the Fort Mills radio station, began a series seven test flights of the radio. During the third, on December 11, the first two-way telegraphy communication with the ground was performed, at a range of for communication with the ground and for the return signal to the airplane, flying at an altitude of , the first radio signal received by an airplane. On the last flight, December 16, using a switch designed to alternate between receiving and transmitting modes, Mauborgne conducted the first airborne ""conversation"" with the ground."
"On January 12, 1915, Dargue and an enlisted spotter encountered strong winds over San Jose Bay. Dargue lost control attempting to avoid the cliffs on Corregidor, but was able to recover sufficiently to crash-land the plane tail first in the bay, causing a total loss. Because S.C. No. 17 was the only aircraft left in the Philippines, the Philippine Aviation School was closed and Dargue transferred back to San Diego, California."

= = = Chester Weir = = =
"Chester Weir is a weir which crosses the River Dee at Chester, Cheshire, England, slightly upstream from the Old Dee Bridge (). The weir and the associated salmon leap are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building."
"This was originally the site of a causeway across the River Dee. The weir was built in sandstone in 1093 for Hugh Lupus, 1st Earl of Chester, for the Benedictine Abbey of St Werburgh (now Chester Cathedral). It was designed to provide a head of water for the medieval mills on the river. The mills were demolished during the 20th century and the weir was restored to serve the Chester City Council's hydro-electric power station, which operated from 1913 to 1939 on the site of the former mills."
The weir continues to provide three essential roles in maintaining the very substantial water abstractions from the River Dee. It prevents tidal water ingress up-river for all but the highest tides; it provides the water head for an abstraction immediately behind the weir and it holds back what is a long linear lake which enables that largest abstraction to be taken at Huntington for the United Utilities supply to the Wirral and surrounding areas.
"The weir can be navigated by crossing over the top during high spring tides. On the city-side of the weir is the United Kingdom's only example of a weirgate, a low height single lock gate that can be opened to provide extra draft once the water levels on each side of the weir have equalised. This allows carefully planned passage from the non-tidal River Dee, via the short tidal estuary section, onto the Dee Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal (originally the Chester Canal) at certain times of year."
"United Utilities are due to vacate the turbine building by 2013, allowing installation of a new hydro electric generating plant."

"In 1958, Anna Jurin accepts a job as a housekeeper of Saint Ange, a rusty and isolated orphanage located in the French Alps and owned by Madam Francard. The last batch of children have been sent elsewhere shortly after the mysterious death of a boy in the bathroom, which tarnishes the orphanage's reputation and threatens its closure. Other than Anna, the orphanage is now populated by only two people: the long-time cook Helenka and an adult orphan, Judith, who suffers from a mental disability and claims that there are other, unseen, children in the location."
"Throughout her stay, Anna experiences apparent supernatural phenomena. However, Helenka dismisses her worries as mere hallucinations, especially after she learns that Anna is pregnant due to a gang rape, a fact that she tries to hide at first. Anna learns that Judith is one of the many sent to Saint Ange in 1946 as a war orphan of World War II; because of shortages of supplies and logistics, Judith is the only survivor."
"Despite this explanation, Anna suspects that the orphanage deliberately killed and hid the children. She gains the trust of Judith by befriending and calming her when her kittens are apparently drowned by Helenka, enough for her to disclose that the children inhabit an area somewhere behind a mirror in bathroom, revealed to be an abandoned dormitory. Helenka tries to prevent them from heading to the area, but Judith knocks her unconscious. The two women proceed to the dormitory and find remains of toys and rotten food. Judith realizes that the children had really died and begs Anna to stop searching, but the latter insists on continuing and boards an elevator heading to the underground. Anna arrives at a sterile, hospital-like structure with clean white walls and brightly lit lamps. She is confronted by the children who rise from a series of murky baths, who surround her. Anna goes into a sudden labor and is helped to deliver the baby by the children."
"Sometime later, Francard and her assistant search for Anna in the underground, which is now damp, dark, and rust-walled. They find Anna and her baby on the floor, both dead. Deciding to leave them there, the two head upstairs to leave the premises alongside Helenka and Judith; it is implied that Anna has been hallucinating the phenomena due to the stress, as she is revealed to be the true culprit for the drowning of the kittens. However, before they leave, Judith throws away her medication, as Anna advised her earlier, and peeks into Anna's former bedroom, where she sees her and her baby, now as spirits of Saint Ange, alongside the dead children. Francard comes back for Judith and the film ends as the room is seen empty."

= = = Chintila = = =
"Chintila (; 606 – 20 December 639) was a Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 636. He succeeded Sisenand in a time of weakness and reigned until his death."
"He was elected and confirmed by a convention of bishops and nobles in accordance with the 75th canon of the Fourth Council of Toledo. With his election, nothing changed and instability reigned. He never solved the many problems that plagued his time in office and, as the chroniclers of the age report, this included rebellions in Septimania and Gallaecia. In the three years of his reign, he permitted the bishops wide authority and they acted as monarchs ""de facto"", if not ""de jure""."
"He dedicated his time to councils, the Fifth Council of Toledo in June 636 and the Sixth Council of Toledo in June 638. These meetings covered many topics and legislated many new regulations."
"The king had to be chosen from among the nobility; never a ""tonsurado"" (cleric), member of the servile classes (peasants), or foreigners. They dictated the penalties for insurrection and determined that property acquired justly by the king could not be confiscated by his successor. Finally, they outlawed non-Catholics within the frontiers of the kingdom, which resulted in many forced conversions."
Chintila died in 639 or 640 of natural causes and was followed by his son Tulga.
= = = List of Stargate Atlantis episodes = = =
"""Stargate Atlantis"" is a Canadian-American science fiction television series created by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper as a spin off from its sister show, ""Stargate SG-1"". The series resumes the story of the ""Lost City"" and ""New Order"" episodes of ""SG-1"", where a military team led by Colonel (now Brigadier General) Jack O'Neill, Dr. Daniel Jackson, Major (now Lt. Colonel) Samantha Carter and the Jaffa Teal'c, use an ancient alien artifact called the Stargate to travel to different planets to explore and find new technology. The series pilot ""Rising"" takes place in the year 2004 after the events of ""Lost City"" and ""New Order"", when they finally find the lost city of the Ancients."
"""Stargate Atlantis"" premiered on July 16, 2004 on the channel Sci Fi Channel. The Sci Fi Channel would air all the five seasons made for the series. Since the American broadcast splits each season to allow the production to catch up, the British and Canadian channels Sky One and The Movie Network aired the second part of some seasons before their American counterpart. ""Stargate Atlantis""<nowiki>'</nowiki> finale episode premiered in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on January 9, 2009. The series finale was also the series' 100th episode. All five seasons of ""Stargate Atlantis"" are available on DVD. A direct-to-DVD film tentatively titled ""Stargate: Extinction"" was planned, but was later shelved."
"The cast of the first season consisted of Joe Flanigan starring as Maj. John Sheppard, David Hewlett as Dr. Rodney McKay, Rachel Luttrell as Teyla Emmagan, Torri Higginson as Elizabeth Weir and Rainbow Sun Francks as First Lt. Aiden Ford. Aiden Ford was reduced to recurring character in season two and was replaced by Jason Momoa as the extraterrestrial human Ronon Dex in episode three of season two. Francks continued to have a recurring role in season 2, until his character's death (although this was not confirmed). After Torri Higginson's departure as a main character from ""Stargate Atlantis"" after Season 3, she was replaced by Amanda Tapping's Carter from the sister show. Paul McGillion, Robert Picardo and Jewel Staite were also main characters. McGillion became a main character in season two until season three as Carson Beckett, Picardo replaced Tapping as a main character as the new leader of the Atlantis expedition as Richard Woolsey for season five, and Staite portrayed Jennifer Keller as a main character in season five."

"Episodes in bold are continuous episodes, where the story spans over 2 or more episodes."
"The series picks up the story arc from ""Stargate SG-1""'s ""Lost City"", where people from all around the world come together to form an expedition and discover the wonders of Atlantis. Discovering that they have been cut off from Earth, they must fend for themselves, and discover a powerful new enemy bent on human subjugation."
"The story continues when the Daedalus arrives and renews the expedition's connection to Earth. This takes place alongside the Ori story arc in SG-1, and the Wraith become an even larger threat in the Pegasus Galaxy. But what they deal with in their second year might be more than they can handle, and Dr. Carson Beckett's retrovirus is more trouble than it's worth."
"This season concentrates on more character driven stories. Along with new insight on the characters, the expedition discovers a new threat, one that could be the precursor to the Replicators. Some important characters leave the series in this season, and the fate of Atlantis once again is in the hands of the humans from Earth."
"Amanda Tapping (Col. Samantha Carter) joined the cast as a regular for 14 episodes, Jewel Staite (Dr. Jennifer Keller) became a recurring character for eight episodes, while regular cast member Torri Higginson (Dr. Weir) became a recurring cast member for four episodes. The season started September 28, 2007, airing on the SCI FI channel in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the season premiered on Tuesday, October 9, 2007 on Sky One."
"After being a regular character in season four, Amanda Tapping (Colonel Samantha Carter) became a guest star in several episodes. Robert Picardo (Richard Woolsey) joined the cast as a permanent character as Woolsey assumes command of Atlantis. Actress Jewel Staite (Dr. Jennifer Keller) was promoted from a recurring character to a permanent cast member. Michael Shanks (Dr. Daniel Jackson) and Paul McGillion (Dr. Carson Beckett) appeared as guest stars in this season, with McGillion appearing in five episodes. Actress Torri Higginson had stated that she would not be reprising her role as Dr. Elizabeth Weir in the fifth season. Rainbow Sun Francks as Aiden Ford was given a brief cameo appearance in ""Search and Rescue"". This was the last season of Stargate Atlantis."
"After the August 20, 2008 announcement that Season 5 of Atlantis would be its last, it was announced the following day that the series would be continued with at least one direct-to-DVD movie. More movies were expected to follow in the ""Atlantis"" series if the first movie had been successful. However, this first project (entitled """") was put on hold and eventually got shelved permanently in 2011."
"Stargate Atlantis Fan's Choice is a Special Edition Blu-ray, released on August 9, 2009, which contained two episodes voted for by fans. The episodes chosen were the first, ""Rising"", and last, ""Enemy at the Gate"", episodes of the series. The cover artwork was also submitted by fans, with the eventual winner being William Johnson of New York City."

Untersee (German: lower lake) may refer to:
= = = Gnadensee = = =
"The Gnadensee is part of Lower Lake Constance (), the western part of the lake."
The Gnadensee lies between Allensbach in the north and the island of Reichenau in the south. In the west it extends to the Mettnau peninsula (Radolfzell) and its eastern end borders on the Wollmatinger Ried Nature Reserve and the Reichenaudamm with its prominent avenue of poplars. The extremely small part in the northwest is called the Markelfinger Winkel. Together with the latter it has an area of 13 square kilometres. It reaches a maximum depth of 19 metres.
"The name of the Gnadensee probably dates to the period when the local judiciary was based on the island of Reichenau. If an accused person was found guilty and sentenced to death, the execution could not take place on the island. It had to be carried out on the mainland as the whole island was holy ground. As a result, the convict was taken by boat to the mainland in the direction of present-day Allensbach, in order that the sentence could be carried out. If the local ruler, the abbot, wanted to reprieve the criminal, he had a bell rung before the boat reached the far shore. This was a signal to the executioner on the mainland that the convict had received a pardon or ""Gnade"" (""mercy"" or ""grace"" in German)."
"Another explanation is that the name Gnadensee is derived from Mary, Mother of God, the ""Lady of our Grace"", and is an ellipsis of the word ""Gnaden[frau]see"" (""Lady of Grace Lake""), as the monastery in Mittelzell was dedicated to Saint Mary."

"The lake is fed by numerous small mountain streams in summer, but only one stream flows out of it into the Salzach. In winter the lake completely freezes and is used for winter sports. In summer the lake is used for pleasure boating (boats powered by combustion engines are not allowed except for the ferries that cross the width of the lake from Zell to Thumersbach, so electrically powered boats can be rented instead). The water is very clear and suitable for swimming or diving, but can be chilly."
"The southern end of the lake, near Schüttdorf, is shallower and mostly filled with water weed, making it unsuitable for boating or swimming."

TMORA was incorporated as a nonprofit in 2002, and opened at its present location in 2005. The museum shows 8-10 exhibitions per year, and hosts over 50 annual events ranging from notable lecturers to classical concerts to theatrical readings. TMORA is open daily, located between Downtown Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Saint Paul Airport."
"Raymond and Susan Johnson held the first retail exhibition of Russian Realist Art in North America in 1991. The largest collectors of Soviet-era paintings outside the former USSR, the Johnsons showed their work privately until envisioning a public museum in 2002. It commenced exhibition activities open to the public in 2002, initially in loaned space in a corporate office park located in Bloomington, Minnesota. The organization initially showcased Russian Realist-style paintings from the late 19th century as well as from the Soviet era (1917–1991). Ray Johnson was appointed an Honorary Consul for the Russian Federation in 2003, and in recognition of their respective contributions ""to international cultural diversity and education,"" both Johnson (2005) and TMORA's first Director Bradford Shinkle (2009) were awarded Russia's Order of Friendship Medal, the highest civilian honor accorded to non-Russian citizens."
"In 2005, TMORA acquired and thoroughly remodeled the former Mayflower Church in south Minneapolis, a 75-year-old building that previously served as a Congregational church and funeral home. The building received special recognition for adaptive reuse from the Minnesota Heritage Preservation Commission, and opened to the public in 2007. TMORA now operates a state-of-the-art exhibition facility that includes of display galleries and administrative offices."
"The renovated gallery space has been host to over 70 exhibitions from Masterpieces of Soviet Era Painting, to historical topics like World War I and the Siege of Leningrad and Russian art forms such as Faberge, Lacquer Boxes, Nesting Dolls, and Ornaments. TMORA also presents shows by living artists, such as Leon Hushcha (a Minnesotan artist of Ukrainian descent) and Canadian-Armenian artist Garen Bedrossian."

Artemis replaces Athena as the Earth guardian deity and takes over the Sanctuary, turning Athena's Saints into her servants."
"Upon invading the Sanctuary, the Bronze Saints learn that Athena was banished by Artemis and decide to fight the moon goddess in order to rescue their true goddess and free the Earth from Artemis's ominous control."
"The movie focuses mostly on Seiya and Athena, as the other Bronze Saints are not seen as much; they only appear during their respective fights with the other Angels, and briefly towards the end. However, Eagle Marin also appears, as Ophiuchus Shaina, Unicorn Jabu, and Hydra Ichi do, though the latter three are just cameos."

= = = BBC Regional Programme = = =
"The BBC Regional Programme was a UK radio broadcasting service which was on the air from 9 March 1930 – when it replaced a number of earlier BBC local stations – until 1 September 1939, when it was subsumed into the BBC Home Service, two days before the outbreak of World War II."
"When the British Broadcasting Company first began transmissions on 14 November 1922 from station 2LO in the Strand, Westminster, London, which it had inherited from the Marconi Company (one of the six commercial companies which created the BBC), the technology did not yet exist either for national coverage or for joint programming between transmitters. Whilst it was possible to combine large numbers of trunk telephone lines to link transmitters for individual programmes, the process was expensive and not encouraged by the General Post Office as it tied up large parts of the telephone network. The stations that followed the establishment of 2LO in London were therefore autonomously programmed using local talent and facilities."
"By May 1923, simultaneous broadcasting was technically possible, at least between main transmitters and relay stations, but the quality was not felt to be high enough to provide a national service or regular simultaneous broadcasts."
"In 1924, it was felt that technical standards had improved enough for London to start to provide the majority of the output, cutting the local stations back to providing items of local interest."
Each of these stations broadcast at approximately 1 kW.
Each of these stations broadcast at approximately 120 W
"On 21 August 1927, the BBC opened a high-power mediumwave transmitter, 5GB, at its Daventry site, to replace the existing local stations in the English Midlands. That allowed the experimental longwave transmitter 5XX to provide a service – which eventually came to be called the BBC National Programme – programmed from London and available to the majority of the population."
"By combining the resources of the local stations into one regional station in each area, with a basic sustaining service from London, the BBC hoped to increase programme quality whilst also centralising the management of the radio service. This was known as ""The Regional Scheme""."
The local transmitters were gradually either converted to a regional service relay or closed entirely and replaced by high power regional broadcasts. Some local studios were retained to provide for programming from specific areas within each region. Most transmitters also carried the BBC National Programme on a local frequency to supplement the longwave broadcasts from 5XX; initially these were on three separate frequencies and programming included some local variations. As the regional network expanded these transmissions were fully synchronized with those from Brookmans Park.
A relay station for Brookmans Park on 1402 kHz was due to open at Acle near Norwich in 1940. Construction was postponed by the outbreak of war. The station was never completed and was replaced by one at Postwick.
"Upon the outbreak of World War II, the BBC closed the Regional and National Programmes and replaced them with a single channel known as the BBC Home Service. The transmitter network was synchronized on 668 and 767 kHz in order to use the other frequencies for propaganda broadcasts in foreign languages. Each transmitter group would be turned off during an air raid to prevent their signals being used as navigational beacons and listeners were required to retune to a low-powered single-frequency network on 1474 kHz."
"On 29 July 1945, within 12 weeks of VE Day, the BBC reactivated the Regional Programme, but kept the name ""BBC Home Service"". The National Programme was also reopened under a new name as the BBC Light Programme."
"Both the National Programme and the Regional Programme provided a mixed mainstream radio service. Whilst the two services provided different programming, allowing listeners a choice, they were not streamed to appeal to different audiences, rather, they were intended to offer a choice of programming to a single audience. While using the same transmitters, the National Programme broadcast significantly more speech and classical music than its successor, the Light Programme. Similarly, the Regional Programme broadcast much more light and dance music than its successor, the Home Service."

"Thomas Baxendale, of Brockton, Massachusetts, and his wife Esther Minerva purchased Amrita Island in 1893. The couple then began to build a residence on the island, including a mansion named ""Island Haven,"" along with a stone bridge; four other homes named Stonehenge, Sorrento, Castle le Mere, and Guardian; three bathing pavilions; a gazebo; a cottage; and a mausoleum that would eventually house the Baxendales and several of their beloved animals."
"The island is well known for its ties to animal welfare advocacy. Baxendale was an advocate for animal welfare, and during his time on Amrita Island, he hosted lectures on animal advocacy and donated funds to the local Animal Rescue League. Upon Esther Baxendale's death in 1927, Harvard University was given Amrita Island in the Baxendales' will. In turn, Harvard University donated the island's 21 acres to the Animal Rescue League of Boston. On a mainland parcel of land adjacent to the Island, until 2007, the Animal Rescue League operated ""a summer camp for inner city children between the ages of seven and fourteen...where they learned animal care, dog obedience, pet shows, nature study, and woodworking."""
= = = Harold Bernard St. John = = =
"Sir Harold Bernard St. John, KA (16 August 1931 – 29 February 2004) was a Barbadian politician who served as the third Prime Minister of Barbados from 1985 to 1986. He was leader of the Barbados Labour Party from 1970 to 1971 and again from 1985 to 1987. He was widely known as Bree."
"St. John was born in the Parish of Christ Church and attended the Christ Church Foundation School. He was professionally trained as a lawyer at the University College London. In 1959, before the island became independent from the United Kingdom, St. John joined the Barbados Labour Party, and after independence in 1966, he was elected to the Barbados House of Assembly. He served as a member of the Upper Chamber between 1971 and 1976 as a member of the Opposition party."
"St. John left the Upper House when he was re-elected to the House of Assembly in 1976, when his party under J.M.G. Adams won the election. He served in numerous cabinet positions in the 1970s including deputy prime minister, minister of trade and industry, and minister of tourism where he did his most influential work in developing the tourism industry in Barbados. When Adams died in 1985, St. John became Prime Minister. The following year he was defeated in the elections by Errol Barrow and the Democratic Labour Party."
"In 1994 when the BLP regained power, he did not return to the Cabinet and served instead as a backbencher under Owen Arthur. That same year St. John was conferred the highest honour in Barbados; he was made a Knight of St. Andrew (KA) of the Order of Barbados."
"In 2004, Bernard St. John died of cancer in Bridgetown. He left his widow Lady Stella (née Hope) and three children: Bryte, Charmaine and Nicole."
= = = Autos sacramentales = = =
"Autos sacramentales (Spanish ""auto"", ""act"" or ""ordinance""; ""sacramental"", ""sacramental, pertaining to a sacrament"") are a form of dramatic literature which is unique to Spain, though in some respects similar in character to the old Morality plays of England."
"The ""auto sacramental"" may be defined as a dramatic representation of the mystery of the Eucharist. At least this is the definition that would apply to the ""auto"" of the time of Calderón. It does not so well fit, however, those of the preceding century, many of which were sacramental in character only because they were presented during the feast of Corpus Christi. They are usually allegorical, the characters representing, for example, Faith, Hope, Air, Sin, Death, etc. There were some indeed, in which not a single human character appeared, but personifications of the Virtues, the Vices, the Elements, etc."
"The ""auto sacramental"" was always presented in the streets in connection with the celebration of the feast of Corpus Christi. It was preceded by a solemn procession through the principal streets of the city, the houses along the route being decorated in honor of the occasion. In the procession appeared the priests bearing the Host under a splendid canopy, followed by a devout throng, in which, in Madrid, often appeared the king and his court without distinction of rank, and last of all, in beautiful cars, came the actors from the public theatres who were to take part in the performance. The procession usually halted before the house of some dignitary while the priests performed certain religious ceremonies, the multitude kneeling meanwhile as if in church. At the conclusion of these, the auto was given. These performances, and the procession as well, were given with much splendor and at great expense, being limited only by the resources of the particular town in which they took place."
"Religious exhibitions were popular with the public in Spain as early as the 13th century. These typically consisted of simple dialogue, presented at Christmas, Carnival, Good Friday, or Easter during religious festivals. As time progressed, the celebration of the feast day of Corpus Christi became larger and with that came the desire for drama surrounding the feast day and honoring the Eucharist became apparent. The first ""autos"" were derived from religious material that already existed, but by the beginning of the 16th century, the first true ""auto"" ""sacramental"", meaning the theme of the play was the mystery of the Eucharist, was presented. It was ""El Auto de San Martin"", by Gil Vicente."
"During the 16th and 17th centuries these ""autos"" continued to appear, being gradually improved and elaborated until brought to their highest state of development by Calderón. He has left about seventy ""autos"", the best known of which are ""The Divine Orpheus"", a work of considerable poetic merit, ""The Devotion to the Mass"", and ""The Captivity of the Ark"". His ""autos"" were the most popular and were the only autos performed in Madrid from 1647 to 1681. These ""autos sacramentales"" produced a great effect on the people. From time immemorial, allegory of every kind had powerfully appealed to them, and these autos took a strong hold on the popular favor, coming as they did during religious festivals, with their music and their splendor, coupled with the fact that they were given at public expense and with the sanction of the Catholic church."
"Citing disrespect of the Eucharist, Charles III declared the presentation and performance of autos prohibited by royal decree in 1765."
"Gil Vicente [c.1465 – 1536/1537]: wrote in Portuguese and Spanish; considered joint-father of Spanish Drama with Juan de la Encina; wrote very early ""autos"""
"Juan de la Encina [1468 – 1529]: considered joint-father of Spanish Drama with Gil Vicente; in 1496 published book called ""Cancionero"" of eight églogas, the precursor for the ""auto"" ""sacramental""."
"Juan de Timoneda [c.1520 – 1583]: wrote six ""autos"", including ""La Oveja Perdida""; author of the only ""autos"" written in Catalan."
Lope de Vega [1562 –1635]: wrote around 400 autos; 42 surviving text including “The Harvest” and “The Wolf Turned Shepherd”
"José de Valdivielso [1565 – 1638]: author of the book ""Doce autos sacramentales y"" ""dos comedias divinas"", published in 1622; precursor of Calderón de la Barca in the use of allegory."
"Pedro Calderón de la Barca [1600 – 1681]: considered most prolific of the writers of ""autos""; two well-known autos are ""La cena del rey Baltaza,"" or ""Belshazzar's Feast"" and ""El gran teatro del Mundo"", or ""The Great Theater of the World"""
"One of Calderón's ""autos"" that is a popular English translation is ""Belshazzar's"" ""Feast"". It relates directly to the Eucharist, sacrilegious behavior, and punishment exacted on Belshazzar for his sinful behavior."
"Belshazzar – based off Biblical character, but allegorical for humanity"
"Daniel – Biblical historic character, allegoric personification of Wisdom and God's Judgement"
Idolatry – second wife of Belshazzar
Vanity – first wife of Belshazzar
Death – allegoric personification of death; carries out judgement; key player/most important
"Thought – sometimes Belshazzar's inner thoughts, sometimes general Human Thought"
"Lee Edgerton was named EISL Most Valuable Player for the 1998 season. Ed Carmean was honored with the EISL's first Sportsmanship Award, presented to the player who ""displays gentlemanly play and the ability to treat players, fans and officials with genuine respect and kindness."" Huntsville Fire players named to the 1998 EISL All-League Team included midfielder Lee Edgerton and defender Ed Carmean. Players named to the EISL All-League Third Team included defender Carlton Williams. Players receiving All-League Honorable Mentions included defender Abraham Francois and midfielder Jamie Harding."
"After the season, in late September 1998, the team fired its five-person staff, including head coach Scott Cooper and general manager Jim Krause, citing ""significant"" financial losses. Team president Bryan Dresden said he would not move or fold the team but that additional local investors were required for the team to continue. This became moot when the EISL itself folded in late December 1998."
= = = Clouds of Sils Maria = = =
"Clouds of Sils Maria (known simply as Sils Maria in some territories) is a 2014 drama film written and directed by Olivier Assayas, and starring Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, and Chloë Grace Moretz. The film is a French-German-Swiss co-production. Principal photography took place from August to October 2013, with most of the filming taking place in Sils Maria, Switzerland. The film follows an established middle-aged actress (Binoche) who is cast as the older lover in a romantic lesbian drama opposite an upstart young starlet (Moretz). She is overcome with personal insecurities and professional jealousies—all while sexual tension simmers between her and her personal assistant (Stewart). The screenplay was written with Binoche in mind and incorporates elements from her life into the plot."
"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival on 23 May 2014, and also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and New York Film Festival. The film received positive reviews, with critics lauding the work as psychologically complex and praising the lead actresses' performances. It won the Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film in December 2014, and received six César Award nominations. Stewart received the César Award for Best Supporting Actress in February 2015."
"Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) is an international film star and stage actress. She travels with a loyal young American assistant, Valentine (Kristen Stewart). Twenty years earlier, Maria got her big break when she was cast and successfully performed as a young girl ""Sigrid"" in both the play and film versions of """" by Wilhelm Melchior, a Swiss playwright who is now elderly. The play centers on the tempestuous relationship between Sigrid and ""Helena,"" a vulnerable older woman. Helena commits suicide after Sigrid takes advantage of her, and dumps her."
"While traveling to Zurich to accept an award on behalf of Wilhelm, and planning to visit him at home the following day at his house in Sils Maria – a remote settlement in the Alps – Maria learns of his death. His widow Rosa later confides that Wilhelm had ended his life and had been terminally ill. During the awards ceremony, Maria is approached by Klaus Diesterweg, a popular theater director. He wants to persuade her to appear on stage in ""Maloja Snake"" again, but this time in the role of Helena, the older woman."
"Maria is torn and reluctantly accepts. To prepare for the role, she accepts Rosa's offer to stay at the Melchiors' house in Sils Maria. Rosa is leaving to escape her memories of Wilhelm. Maria's discussions with Valentine and their read-throughs of the play's scenes evoke uncertainty about the nature of their relationship. A young American actress, 19-year-old Jo-Ann Ellis (Chloë Grace Moretz), has been chosen to interpret the role of Sigrid. Researching her on Google and the internet, Valentine tells Maria, who is out of touch with social media, that Ellis has been involved in numerous scandals."
"Questions soon multiply regarding aging, time, culture and the blurring line between the Sigrid/Helena and the Valentine/Maria relationships. Maria and Jo-Ann finally meet, but their relationship is complicated. Jo-Ann appears to be implicated in the attempted suicide of the wife of her new (and married) boyfriend."
"During their time at Sils Maria, Maria and Valentine spend much of their days hiking in the Alps. On one such final outing, they hike to the Maloja Pass – to observe a fascinating early morning cloud phenomenon that appears low in the pass (the ""Maloja Snake"" of the play's title, but also the ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" in the film's title). Valentine suggests that Helena may not commit suicide but simply walk away to start a new life. Maria protests that Helena walks into the mountains never to return and must therefore be dead. After suggesting that their approaches to the play are too different for her (Valentine) to be a useful assistant, a disconsolate Valentine disappears without explanation, never to reappear."
"A few weeks later, a young filmmaker who has previously sent a script to Maria visits her by appointment five minutes before the curtain rises on the opening night of ""Maloja Snake"" in London. Maria seems preoccupied, so near to curtain rise, and dismisses his suggested ideas about the proposed film role he is offering her as ""too abstract for me"". When she says the role he has written is too young for her and would suit Jo-Ann better, he suggests that the character is ageless and that he does not relate to his era with its internet scandals and trashy values. Clearly he admires her and her work. Maria does not give him a reply as to whether she will take part in the film. Then she is on stage, smoking and waiting for Sigrid."
"Principal photography of ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" began on 22 August 2013 and ended on 4 October. The film was shot on location in the titular village of Sils Maria, Switzerland as well as Zurich; Leipzig, Germany; and South Tyrol, Italy."
"In an interview, Olivier Assayas said that all the film's interiors were shot in Germany. The production moved to Sils Maria to film the hiking scenes, and moved again to film the scenes in and around the chalet in South Tyrol."
"The Chanel company debuted in film financing with this production. In addition it supplied the actresses with clothes, jewelry, accessories, and makeup, and the brand was scripted in as a provider of the same to Maria. Chanel provided some of the budget to allow Olivier Assayas to fulfill his dream of shooting a film on 35-mm film instead of digitally."
"Assayas has described the fictional play ""Maloja Snake"" as a ""condensed, brutalized version"" of ""The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,"" a play by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (it was later adapted as a film of the same name)."
"The American title of the film is ""Clouds of Sils Maria."" In France the film was released as ""Sils Maria,"" Assayas' original name."
The first trailer for the film was released on 22 May 2014. Another international trailer followed on 7 July.
The film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival on 23 May 2014. It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and New York Film Festival.
"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to positive reviews."
"Robbie Collin of ""The Daily Telegraph"" stated, ""This is a complex, bewitching and melancholy drama, another fearlessly intelligent film from Assayas."" He said, ""Binoche plays the role with elegance and melancholic wit – her character slips between fiction and fact in a way that recalls her role in Abbas Kiarostami's ""Certified Copy."" But it's Stewart who really shines here. Valentine is probably her best role to date: she's sharp and subtle, knowable and then suddenly distant, and a late, surprising twist is handled with a brilliant lightness of touch."""
"Peter Debruge of ""Variety"" said it was Assayas' ""daring rejoinder, a multi-layered, femme-driven meta-fiction that pushes all involved—including next-gen starlets Kristen Stewart and Chloë Grace Moretz — to new heights."" Matt Risley of ""Total Film"" called it ""an elegant, intelligent drama, enlivened by strong performances by Binoche, Moretz and especially Stewart, for whom this will surely usher in a new dawn."""
"Stephanie Zacharek of ""The Village Voice"" wrote: ""But the movie's true center, the meteorological phenomenon that makes it so pleasurable to watch, is the half-prickly, half-affectionate interplay between Binoche and Stewart."" Ben Sachs of ""Chicago Reader"" wrote: ""This recalls Ingmar Bergman's chamber dramas in the intensity and psychological complexity of the central relationship, yet the filmmaking is breathtakingly fluid, evoking a sense of romantic abandon."""
"However, Kyle Smith of the ""New York Post"" writes: ""A backstage drama that has all the sizzle of a glass of water resting on the windowsill, [...] ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" mistakes lack of dramatic imagination for smoldering subtlety."" Richard Brody from ""The New Yorker"" writes: ""Clouds of Sils Maria, as the title suggests, is a sort of travelogue, a commercial for European cultural tourism, and, as such, it's the perfect image of the very system that created it. There's almost no independent filmmaking in France, and there isn't supposed to be. If there were, it would stand as a threat to the system that, by way of training, enticements, and restrictions, is the source of the comforts that the movie depicts and that the movie reflects. The mediocrity is stifling."""
"The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a ""Certified Fresh"" score of 90% based on 169 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Bolstered by a trio of powerful performances from its talented leads, ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" is an absorbing, richly detailed drama with impressive depth and intelligence."" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted mean score of 78 out of 100, based on 41 reviews from film critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews""."
"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" opened in France on 20 August 2014 in 150 theaters for a $3,663 per theater average and a box office total of $549,426 as of 24 August 2014. The film expanded to 195 theaters in its second week of release, and the box office increased to an estimated $1,150,090."
"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" opened in the United States on 10 April 2015 in three theaters and grossed $69,729 on its opening weekend for an average of $23,243 per. As of 4 June 2015, the film has grossed an estimated $1,743,577 after expanding theaters."
"The film won the Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film in December 2014. The film received six César Award nominations including best film, best director, best actress, best original screenplay, and best cinematography, while Stewart won for best supporting actress, becoming the first American actress to win a César and the second American actor to win after Adrien Brody in 2003."

"Until 2001, the Bundesliga was directly under the control German football's governing body the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (DFB or German Football Association). This changed with the formation of the Deutsche Fußball-Liga (DFL or German Football League) when the Bundesligen came under the auspices of this new body. The DFL, while remaining subordinate to the DFB, manages Germany's professional leagues and is responsible for the issuing of licences to clubs, general fiscal oversight of the Bundesligen, and marketing rights for the two upper leagues."
"Since the launch of the Bundesliga on 24 August 1963 fifty-five clubs have played in the league ranks. To help celebrate the 40th anniversary of the league, two clubs with distinguished Bundesliga histories met in a game on 24 August 2003: Hamburger SV, once known as the ""dinosaur"" for being the only club which has played in every season of the league's existence until relegation in 2018, and Bayern Munich, the most successful side in German football, which had just won their seventeenth Bundesliga title."
"In 2005, German football was once again overshadowed by the discovery of a match-fixing scandal involving second division referee Robert Hoyzer, who confessed to fixing and betting on matches in the 2. Bundesliga, the DFB-Pokal (German Cup), and the Regionalliga (III). The games included a DFB-Pokal first-round match between regional side Paderborn and Bundesliga heavyweights Hamburg on 21 August 2004. Hamburg lost (2–4) through penalties and a red-card charged to the side and was eliminated from the lucrative competition."
"Hoyzer was banned for life and received a 29-month prison sentence. He soon implicated other officials, players, and a group of Croatian-based gamblers, leading to an ongoing investigation. To this point, at the end of 2005, it appears that the scandal did not directly involve the Bundesliga and was confined to lower divisions:"
"Despite the scandal, the Bundesliga continues to set new attendance records. In the Bundesliga's 43rd season, total attendance was about 12.41 million in 306 games for an average of 40,572 per game, a 6.9% increase over the preceding year, making the 2005–06 season the 5th consecutive record attendance year. After a decrease in 2006–07 and a slight recovery in 2007–08, new records were set in 2008–09, with 12.82 million total attendance and a per-game average of 41,904. The 2008–09 figure makes the Bundesliga the best-attended national football league in the world by per-game attendance. It is also third in per-game attendance among major professional sports leagues in the world, slightly ahead of the Australian Football League (Australian rules) and well behind the second-ranked Indian Premier League (Twenty20 cricket) and top-ranked NFL (American football) in the United States. Top drawing clubs based on average attendance included: Borussia Dortmund 72,850; FC Bayern Munich 67,214; FC Schalke 04 61,177; and Hamburger SV 53,298. Interest in the league was piqued by the 2006 FIFA World Cup hosted in Germany. An ambitious program of stadium upgrades was undertaken in preparation for the tournament."
"The 2. Bundesliga saw an enormous increase in popularity in 2006–07, drawing about 4.67 million spectators for an average of 15,253. This not only smashed the league's previous attendance record, but also marked an increase of more than 20% over the 2005–06 season. The league saw another huge increase in popularity in 2007–08, drawing 5.55 million spectators for an average of 18,140, an increase of almost 19% over the previous season, which briefly made the 2. Bundesliga the most-attended second-level professional sports league in the world on a per-game basis. However, the league would lose almost all of these gains in 2008–09, with total attendance of 4.76 million and an average of 15,550. Although the Second Bundesliga is now second in attendance to England's Football League Championship among second-level professional sports leagues, it still draws more spectators per game than the top leagues in such established footballing nations as Turkey, Russia, and Portugal."
"Starting with the 2008–09 season, a new third-level league, the 3. Liga, was launched, slotting between the 2. Bundesliga and the Regionalliga in the league pyramid. Unlike the Bundesligen, the 3. Liga is operated directly by the DFB. At the same time, the Regionalliga went from two divisions to three."
"One of the problems currently facing the league is in the performance and fate of clubs from the former East Germany, which are finding it difficult to compete with the wealthy, established western sides. One-time GDR clubs are unable to attract lucrative sponsorships, cannot afford the salaries needed to hold on to their ""homegrown"" talent, and find themselves playing in crumbling or primitive stadium facilities. Of the 36 clubs in the top two levels of the league system in the 2011–12 season, five are from the former East Germany, an increase of two from 2010–11. However, as in the previous two seasons, none will be in the First Bundesliga. The five former Eastern clubs in the 2. Bundesliga are Energie Cottbus, who last appeared in the First Bundesliga in 2008–09; Union Berlin, from the former East Berlin, who have been in the 2. Bundesliga since being promoted as champions of the inaugural season of the 3. Liga; Erzgebirge Aue, present since the 2010–11 season; Hansa Rostock, who immediately returned from a one-season stint in the 3. Liga; and Dynamo Dresden, making their first appearance at the second level in five years. Four other eastern clubs are playing in the 2011–12 3. Liga—Carl Zeiss Jena, Chemnitz, Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and the Potsdam club Babelsberg."
"In preparations for the 2006 World Cup, the DFB attempted to fairly balance the number of venues between the eastern and western halves of the country. However, the organization had to face up to the reality of there not being enough suitable facilities in the old DDR –not limited to stadiums, but including hotels, restaurants and other visitor needs, and transportation infrastructure–, with the result that the east finds itself underrepresented. Only one of the 2006 venues was in the former East Germany (in Leipzig). Similarly, only one of the nine venues for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, also held in Germany, was in the former East Germany (in Dresden). The situation fits into the broader context of the effects of German reunification on East Germany and the resentment that many Ossis feel for their western cousins."
"RB Leipzig is one notable club that produced a major resurgence of football in the former East Germany. This club saw several successive promotions in a short period of time and gained promotion to the Bundesliga for the 2016–17 season. The club's success has been controversial. RB Leipzig was founded by initiative of drink company Red Bull GmbH, whose involvement in the club has sparked new discussions about commercialism in professional football."
"The 2012–13 season saw FC Bayern Munich become the first club ever to achieve the treble by winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, and European Cup."
"Bayern Munich made German football history even further by earning a record fourth consecutive Bundesliga title in 2016, and eventually became the first German club to attain more than four championships in succession by winning their fifth and sixth titles in 2017 and 2018 respectively for the club's 27th league title and their 28th nationally, both new records."
"Meanwhile, after 55 seasons, Hamburger SV was relegated from the Bundesliga to the 2. Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history. During the 2017–18 season, a final day win over Gladbach was not enough to escape the drop as Wolfsburg won against Cologne. Hamburg had to endure a disastrous season under various managers after surviving two playouts in the preceding four seasons."

"Mona Mahmudnizhad (, September 10, 1965 – June 18, 1983) was an Iranian Baháʼí who, in 1983 (together with nine other Baháʼí women) was sentenced to death and hanged in Shiraz, Iran. She was accused of being a member of the Baháʼí Faith."
"The official charges ranged from ""misleading children and youth"", to being a ""Zionist"" (because the Baháʼí World Centre is located in Israel)."
The non profit Mona Foundation focusing on girl's education was named after her in 2001.
"Mahmudnizhad was born on September 10, 1965, to Yad'u'llah and Farkhundeh Mahmudnizhad (who had left their home in Iran to teach their religion in Yemen)."
"In 1969 the government of Yemen expelled all foreigners and the Mahmudnizhad family returned to Iran. They spent two years in Isfahan, six months in Kermanshah and three years in Tabriz before finally settling in Shiraz in 1974. During this time her father repaired small appliances for work and served the Baháʼí community as part of various Baháʼí administrative bodies."
"While Baháʼís regularly faced persecution in Iran, the Islamic Revolution of 1979 reinforced this further. At 7:30pm on October 23, 1982, four armed Revolutionary Guards, sent by the public prosecutor of Shiraz, entered the Mahmudnizhad household and ransacked the home in search of Baháʼí material. They then took Mona and her father into custody. The two were blindfolded and taken to Seppah prison in Shiraz, where they were placed in separate quarters; Mahmudnizhad was detained in Seppah prison for a total of 38 days."
"On November 29, 1982, she and five other Baháʼí women were transferred from Seppah prison to Adelabad prison (also in Shiraz). After some time in Abelabad, she was transferred to the Islamic Revolutionary Court where she was interrogated and placed back in prison."
"A few days later, she was once again interrogated in front of an Islamic Revolutionary judge. After these series of interrogations, which involved physical torture by being whipped on the soles of her feet with a cable, Mahmudnizhad was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. At the time of her sentencing, President of the United States Ronald Reagan, made a plea for clemency; despite this, the sentence of the 10 women was carried out on the night of June 18, 1983, at a nearby polo field."
The other women who were hanged with Mahmudnizhad were:
"In September 2007, the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center published a case study on the subject."
"Mahmudnizhad's story is the subject of several art works. Music artist Doug Cameron recreated Mahmudnizhad's story in a music video, ""Mona with the Children"", which made the pop charts in Canada (#14 for the week of October 19, 1985). The video was distributed throughout the music scene and was effective in bringing the persecution of Baháʼís in Iran to international public attention."
"A play based on Mahmudnizhad's story titled ""A Dress for Mona"" has been produced and in 2008 Jack Lenz produced a film called ""Mona's Dream"". Her pictures are also featured in Mithaq Kazimi's Quenching The Light video."

After World War I it became part of the British mandate territory of Tanganyika. The British administration continued to reserve and exploit forests.
"Today, the population of the Usambara Mountains region has one of the highest growth rates (about 4% compared to the Tanzanian national average of 2.1%), a staggering amount of poverty, and highest densities of people in all of Tanzania. Most of the inhabitants are subsistence farmers who rely heavily on the forests around them for timber, medicinal plants, clearing for agriculture, and fuel wood."
"70% of the original forest cover of the West and East Usambaras has been lost. Its ecosystems were significantly disrupted by foreign-controlled logging companies which carried out large-scale deforestation from the 1950s onwards. A sawmill at Tanga processed East Usambara timber, and its output was increased in the 1970s with Finnish development funding. Major land and forest degradation remains a pressing issue."
"There are still many places that attract visitors looking for experiences beyond developed tourist resorts.

"The New York Peace Society was the first peace society to be established in the United States. It has had several different incarnations, as it has merged into other organizations or dissolved and then been re-created."
"David Low Dodge founded the society in 1815, soon after the end of the War of 1812. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as Gibraltar and Malta, describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on Christian grounds."
"In 1828, the society merged with others in New Hampshire, Maine, and Massachusetts to form the American Peace Society."
"The society was re-formed as an independent organization in 1837. Until 1844, it sought to prevent war against Mexico by advocating negotiation. It then dissolved. An attempt was made to re-create it, but this was short-lived."
"The society was founded anew for the final time in 1906, in the context of the Philippine–American War, the rapid expansion of American influence and military usage abroad and the rise of the Anti-Imperialist League. It was organized by Oscar Straus and Charles Levermore with the support of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie."
"The society was involved in a ""National Arbitration and Peace Conference"" in 1907. During the First World War, the society helped to organize the League to Enforce Peace in opposition to American involvement."
"In 1940, the society merged into the Quaker World Alliance for International Friendship through Religion."
= = = National Awami Party (Wali) = = =
The Wali Khan faction of the National Awami Party was formed after the 1967 split in the original NAP between Maulana Bhashani and Khan Wali Khan. The Wali Khan faction was later named National Awami Party (NAP) after the separation of East Pakistan.
"The NAP was banned twice during its eight-year-long existence, the first time under Yahya Khans government in 1971 and the second time in 1975 by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government. It was then resurrected under the name National Democratic Party, from which in turn was formed the Awami National Party."
"The Party represented left wing views in Pakistan and its core politics was based on the disbanding of the One Unit, restoration of adult franchise (1967–1970), land reforms, protection of tenants' rights, redistribution of wealth through nationalisation, Pakistan becoming a confederacy as well as the holding of fair elections, protection of an independent judiciary and freedom of the press. It contested the 1970 election, winning the second largest number of seats in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the largest in Baluchistan, and a handful of seats in East Pakistan's provincial assembly. It failed to win any seats in Punjab and Sindh."
"After the division of Pakistan in 1971, NAP formed coalition governments in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan on the basis of winning majority of seats in the two provinces. Arbab Sikandar Khan was appointed Governor of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Ghaus Bux Bizenjo Governor of Balochistan. Sardar Akhtar Mengal was elected the first Chief Minister of Balochistan and the NAP supported Mufti Mahmud of the JUI as Chief Minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The party was disbanded in 1975 amidst a government crackdown. It was resurrected in 1976 under the National Democratic Party under Sherbaz Mazari but split in 1979 following disagreements amongst the left wing of the party against the leadership."
"A brief attempt was made to resurrect the Party by Ajmal Khattak under the name National Awami Party of Pakistan in 2000, however the party was routed in the 2002 election and much of its leadership merged back with the ANP."
"On 30 November 1967 the NAP split between Maulana Bhashani and Khan Wali Khan, ostensibly because Bhashani sided with China while Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, along with Khan Abdul Wali Khan, sided with the USSR in the Sino-Soviet split."
"Following the split, the leftist members of the NAP, many of whom were active in a Kissan (peasant) Committee, decided to follow the Wali Khan faction. Soon after, the leadership of the Wali Khan faction, being landlords, decided not to allow members of the NAP to also be members of the Kissan Committee. The leftists, led by Afzal Bangash, then decided to leave the NAP and establish the Mazdoor Kisan Party."
"The NAP party leadership struggling with a rivalry between Mahmud Ali Kasuri and Mahmudul Haq Usmani for the Presidency. Ultimately the leadership backed Abdul Wali Khan as a compromise candidate. The National Council of the Party met on 30 June and 1 July 1968 at Royal Hotel, Peshawar, with Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, President of East Pakistan NAP chairing the first session. Abdul Wali Khan was unanimously elected as President of the party."
Office Bearers
"The National Awami Party was a socialist political party that advocated greater provincial autonomy and the Theory of Four Nationalities. The theory advocated by senior NAP leader Bizenjo stated Pakistan was composed of four distinct ""nations"", the Pukhtun, Baloch, Sindhi and Western Punjabi."
"The party contested the 1970 elections from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Balochistan, Sindh and East Pakistan. It did not field any candidates in the Punjab, Nationally it fielded 16 candidates from K-P, three of whom got elected, securing 18.4% of the vote, in Balochistan three out of four candidates were elected but it failed to win any seats from Sindh."
"In 1971, in an attempt to avert a possible showdown between the Military and the people of East Pakistan, on March 23, 1971, Khan, along with other Pakistani politicians, jointly met Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. They offered support to Mujeeb in the formation of a government, but it was already too late to break the impasse as Yahya Khan had already decided on a full scale military crackdown. Pakistan's increasing vulnerability and widespread international outrage against the military crackdown eventually created a situation that led to war between Pakistan and India. This war proved disastrous and culminated in Pakistan's armed forces being defeated in East Pakistan and the creation of the new state of Bangladesh. Shocked by the defeat, Yahya Khan resigned from office and the military. Under General Gul Hassan Khan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was brought back from America and appointed President."
"During the martial law crackdown against East Pakistan, the National Awami Party under Wali Khan was one of a handful of parties that protested the military operation. In one case, Khan helped a senior East Pakistani diplomat's son escape to Afghanistan from possible internment in West Pakistan. The military government, in retaliation against the protests, banned the party and launched mass arrests of party activists."
"In 1972, as the opposition leader, Wali Khan was contacted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who wanted to lift martial law and set up a new constitution. Wali Khan's negotiations with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto led to the NAP signing of an agreement with the government in 1972, called the Tripartite Agreement. The agreement led to the lifting of martial law and removal of the ban on the National Awami Party. This led to the formation of National Awami Party coalition provincial governments in the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan. Despite the initial positive start, the agreement rapidly began to unravel due to the growing animosity between Khan and Bhutto."
"In 1972, Wali Khan was elected as Parliamentary leader of the opposition, the NAP made several initiatives to broaden its support across the country. It dropped its demand to rename the then North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) as Pakhtunistan, declared Urdu as the provincial language of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and espoused federalism with greater autonomy for the provinces. Senior party leader Ghaus Bux Bizenjo advocated that Pakistan consisted of four nationalities and their empowerment equally would prevent the breakup of Pakistan."
"Campbell claimed he had been unfairly beaten and took the matter of his eligibility to stand as a candidate to court. However his protest came to nothing, and Fitzgerald was declared the first Superintendent of the Canterbury Province."
"Campbell's handling of land issues resulted in Governor of New Zealand George Grey receiving a large number of complaints about Campbell, as well as voluminous correspondence from him about colonists and run-holders. Campbell did not acknowledge James FitzGerald as superintendent and, despite repeated requests, refused to provide FitzGerald a return of revenue from land leases. Gerald Hensley points out that Campbell was """"maintaining with a splendid inconsistency that he had not received the Governor's dispatch instructing him to do so, even while quoting parts of it in his long and argumentative letters."""" During late 1853 there was a heated exchange of letters between the two men, into which Governor Grey was copied."
"On 5 October 1853 Alfred Domett, who was at that time Civil Secretary for central government, told Campbell that he was relieved of his commissionerships and that he was to hand over his records to William Guise Brittan, who had been appointed in his place (Brittan was already Commissioner within the Canterbury Block so this effectively amalgamated the two Canterbury Land Offices). Campbell was instead appointed as """"Registrar of Deeds for the Provence of Canterbury"""", replacing Brittan in this role."
"On 11 November 1853 the Canterbury Provincial Council, apparently unaware that Campbell had already been removed from the land commissionerships (probably because Campbell took no action to relinquish office while he appealed to the Governor), adopted the following resolution agreeing to ask the Governor of New Zealand to remove Campbell from office:""""This Council, having taken into account the various papers upon their table in reference to the proceedings of the Commissioner of Crown Lands: resolve; That the Commissioner of Crown Lands, having as it appears to this Council, acted in disregard of the law, and having refused to afford this Council any information on the affairs of his office, and having otherwise shown himself wholly incompetent to the discharge of the duties thereof, an address be presented from this Council to His Excellency the Governor, praying His Excellency to be pleased to remove Colonel Campbell from the office of Commissioner of Crown Lands."""""
"On 23 November 1853 the Canterbury Provincial Council discussed Campbell's appointment as Registrar of Deeds. John Hall stated Campbell was """"even less qualified to be Registrar of Deeds, an office which particularly required to be filled by a person of business habits."""" The Council then adopted the following resolutions asking Governor Grey to remove Campbell as Registrar of Deeds and to combine registration of deeds with that of births, deaths and marriages in the same office under the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court:""""1. That this Council has learned with great surprise and regret that Lieutenant Colonel Campbell, after having been removed from the office of Commissioner of Crown Lands, has been appointed as Registrar of Deeds for this Province. 2. That, considering how largely the interest of individuals may be affected by the Acts of the Registrar, and the extensive evil which may result from incompetence or mal-administration: this Council are of opinion that that office ought to be entrusted only to some person possessing the fullest confidence of the public. 3. The Council are of opinion that the office of Registrar of Deeds is one which ought, if possible, be filled by a person having a legal education, and that for the purposes of economy its duties might for the present be most conveniently performed by the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court.."""""
"Campbell refused to register any land deeds and, when the Provincial Council complained, Campbell """"denounced them as calumniators and prepared to sue the Superintendent and executive on an extraordinary variety of grounds ranging from usurpation to illegal absence from the province... [and] that the whole provincial establishment was illegal"""""
"In December 1854 (after George Grey had completed his first term as Governor of New Zealand) the central Government finally agreed to the removal of Campbell from office. The grounds for his removal were """"general unfitness for the duties of his office, willful and continued neglect of duty and a determined spirit of opposition and resistance to the Provincial Government, and disrespect towards its executive officers."""" Superintendent James FitzGerald appointed lawyer and court registrar Christopher Alderson Calvert as Registrar of Deeds in place of Campbell."
"Campbell went on to sue Superintendent of the Province of Canterbury James FitzGerald for libel on the grounds that he had been defamed in FitzGerald's letter to Governor of New Zealand George Grey while seeking Campbell's removal from office. Fitzgerald's letter to the Governor said """"I request the removal of an officer who has been condemned by the united voice of the public as wholly unfit to be entrusted with any public office whatever"""". Campbell initially won the case but the verdict was overturned on appeal on the basis that FitzGerald's letter to the Governor was privileged, that Campbell had not proven that FitzGerald acted in malice, and that Campbell had misstated the alleged libel."
"After removal as Land Commissioner Campbell is reported to have lived at Isabella (AKA Isabel) Lodge, an """"elegant and commodious house"""" located on Isabel Farm on Ferry Road, Christchurch, the property of Alexander 'Russian' Sherwood Jackson and his wife Isabella Mary Jackson."
"Campbell died in Christchurch aged 71, on 7 July 1858. The cause of death was stated as apoplexy He is buried with his wife at Barbadoes Street Cemetery Christchurch. Obituaries appeared in several papers."

"The Agreement among the People's Republic of Angola, the Republic of Cuba, and the Republic of South Africa (also known as the Tripartite Accord, Three Powers Accord or New York Accords) granted independence to Namibia from South Africa and ended the direct involvement of foreign troops in the Angolan Civil War. The accords were signed on 22 December 1988 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City by the Foreign Ministers of People's Republic of Angola (Afonso Van-Dunem), Republic of Cuba (Isidoro Malmierca Peoli) and Republic of South Africa (Roelof F. Botha)."
"In 1981 Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs for newly elected United States President Ronald Reagan, had developed a linkage policy. It tied apartheid South Africa's agreement to relinquish control of Namibia, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, and to retreat from Angola, to Cuba's withdrawing its troops from Angola. On 10 September 1986 Cuban president Fidel Castro accepted Crocker's proposal in principle. The South African government also accepted the principle of linkage; it proposed the concept at the UN 7th Plenary Meeting on 20 September 1986 (the Question of Namibia)."
"The concept was strongly rejected by a Cuban-backed majority, with representatives strongly stating their opposition to the effect of, ""... The UN... Calls upon South Africa to desist from linking the independence of Namibia to irrelevant and extraneous issues such as the presence of Cuban troops in Angola as such linkage is incompatible with the relevant United Nations resolutions, particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1978);..."""
The Angolan and United States governments started bilateral talks in June 1987 while the civil war continued. There is disagreement amongst historians on how the various parties agreed to come to the table:
"In the words of Chester Crocker, ""Watching South Africa and Cuba at the table was like watching two scorpions in a bottle."""
"After refusing direct talks with Cuba, the US agreed to include a Cuban delegation in the negotiations, who joined on January 28, 1988. The three parties held a round of negotiations on March 9 in London. The South African government joined negotiations in Cairo on 3 May expecting UN Security Resolution 435 to be modified. Defence Minister Magnus Malan and President P.W. Botha asserted that South Africa would withdraw from Angola only ""if Russia and its proxies did the same."" They did not mention withdrawing from Namibia. On 16 March 1988, the South African ""Business Day"" reported that Pretoria was ""offering to withdraw into Namibia – not from Namibia – in return for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. The implication is that South Africa has no real intention of giving up the territory any time soon."" However the UN plenary meeting of 1986 indicates that the South Africans were linking Namibian independence with Cuban withdrawal. The Cuban negotiator, Jorge Risquet, announced that Cuba would stay in Angola until the end of apartheid, probably also as a negotiation ploy. (Apartheid did not end until more than 4 years after Cuba left Angola)."
"The Cubans suggested that the U.S. was worried whether the Cuban forces would stop their advance at the Namibian border. Jorge Risquet, head of the Cuban delegation, rejected the South African demands, noting that ""South Africa must face the fact that it will not obtain at the negotiating table what it could not achieve on the battlefield."""
"According to the book ""32 Battalion"" by Piet Nortje, during this campaign South Africa introduced its new secret weapons, the G5 and G6 howitzer guns. The cannons can fire a projectile over with a high degree of accuracy. The guns were used to halt the Cuban advance to the south and raised the specter of yet another unaffordable arms escalation between two medium-sized military powers. The South Africans assert that the new weapon raised Cuba's fear of more casualties in a war where Cuban fatalities had outnumbered South African fatalities by a factor 10. Conversely, the Cuban air force held air superiority, as was demonstrated by the bombing of the strategic Calueque complex, and the overflights in 1988 of Cuban Mig-23's of Namibian airspace. According to David Albright, South Africa believed that the discovery of preparations for a nuclear weapon test at the Vastrap facility created an urgency amongst the superpowers to find a solution."
"The negotiations reached a deadlock that was broken by the South African negotiator, Pik Botha, who convinced Jorge Riquet that, in the words of Botha ""...We can both be losers and we can both be winners..."" Pik Botha offered a compromise that would appear to be palatable to both sides while emphasising that the alternative would be detrimental to both sides."
"While the hostilities in Angola continued, the parties met in June and August in New York City and Geneva. Finally all approved an outline agreement of ""Principles for a Peaceful Settlement in South Western Africa"" on 20 July. During the negotiations, the South Africans were asked to release imprisoned ANC activist Nelson Mandela as a sign of goodwill, which was denied. A ceasefire was finally agreed upon on August 8, 1988. Mandela remained in prison until 2 February 1990, when South Africa lifted the ban on activities of the ANC African National Congress."
"The negotiations were finalised in New York with Angola, Cuba and South Africa signing the accord on 22 December 1988. It provided for the retreat of South African forces from Angola, which had already taken place by 30 August; the withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia; and Namibia's independence and the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola within 30 months."
"The agreement followed the American linkage proposal which had also been pushed by South African on numerous occasions in 1984 and in 1986 (the UN plenary meeting). Namibia was to gain independence on terms that South Africa had set out, including multi-party democracy, a capitalist free-market economy, and a transition period."
"The South African Army left Angola by 30 August 1988, before the conditions for Cuba's withdrawal had been agreed. Cuban troops began withdrawing on 10 January 1989, and the withdrawal was finalised in stages one month early on 25 May 1991."
"The Angolan government offered an amnesty to UNITA troops under the premise that UNITA would be integrated into the MPLA under a one-party state economy. That concept was rejected by UNITA. The situation in the country was anything but settled, and civil war continued for more than a decade."
"According to ""Presidents of Foreign Policy"" by Edward R. Drachman and Alan Shank, a series of meetings and accords between UNITA and the MPLA, brokered by various African leaders, failed horribly. UNITA was insulted by MPLA's insistence on a premise of a one-party state. A combination of MPLA dismay of intervention from the USA (backing UNITA and forcing a shift in power) led to the MPLA dropping the one-party state and opening the door to a multi-party democracy, with the inclusion of UNITA as a competing party. After some 18 years of war, that was a tremendous breakthrough."
"The elections were declared ""generally"" free and fair by the UN, with the MPLA gaining just under 50% of the vote. However UNITA, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said that the election had been neither free nor fair. Following the Halloween Massacre, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi directed UNITA forces to take up arms again against the MPLA. However, the US now opposed UNITA, instead pressuring Savimbi to accept the election results. The war ended after Savimbi's death, in 2002."
"In preparation for independence, free elections in Namibia were held in November 1989, with SWAPO taking 57% of the vote. Namibia gained independence in March 1990. SWAPO was originally a Marxist party that intended to install a one-party state. The South African government rejected that premise until the fall of the Soviet Union and SWAPO assured that it would support a multi-party democracy with a capitalist, free market economy."
South Africa held onto Namibia's economic port of Walvis Bay for an additional 18 months until it was assured that SWAPO would respect the newly-founded constitution and the principle of a multi-party democracy.

= = = Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial = = =
"The Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial is a memorial in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States that commemorates those American nurses who died in the Spanish–American War in 1898. The rough-hewn, grey granite memorial was erected by the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses on May 2, 1905. It stands in the southwestern corner of Section 21, where the first Spanish–American War nurses are buried."
"The memorial should not be confused with the Nurses Memorial. This tall marble figure of a nurse in a nurse's uniform and cape was erected in 1938. It also stands in Section 21, a short distance away. It is screened from the northern part of Section 21 by a copse of trees."
"The Spanish–American War was a ten-week conflict that occurred in the spring and summer of 1898. Cuba had been waging a war of independence against Spain since 1895, an effort largely supported by the United States (which had extensive economic interests on the island). To ensure the safety of American citizens and property in Cuba, the United States sent the battleship to Havana in late January 1898. The ""Maine"" exploded and was destroyed with large loss of life on February 15. American newspapers whipped up war fever, and held Spain responsible for the ship's destruction. The United States Congress enacted a joint resolution demanding independence for Cuba, and President William McKinley signed it into law on April 20. In response, Spain severed diplomatic relations on April 21. The same day, the United States Navy began a blockade of Cuba. Spain declared war on April 23. On April 25, Congress declared that a state of war between the U.S. and Spain had existed since April 21."
"The Spanish–American War began on April 25, 1898, and ended on August 12, 1898. Cuban and Spanish dead vastly outnumbered American deaths. While 2,910 American military personnel died during the war, just 345 were combat deaths. The rest died of disease. The U.S. military barred women from serving in any capacity prior to the war. Although the Army had 791 nurses, they were all male, and far too few to provide the medical care needed. Soldiers resisted being transferred from combat units into the nursing corps, and few volunteers signed up for medical duty. Congress quickly authorized the military to hire female nurses—but on contract, not as military personnel. The army reached out specifically to the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), a patriotic society, to recruit women nurses. Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee, one of the medical doctors practicing in the United States, was asked to lead the DAR's recruitment effort. Of the 1,563 nurses recruited for the new Nurse Corps, most served in hospitals in the United States. Only 76 were sent to Cuba, 30 to the Philippines, nine to Puerto Rico, six to Honolulu, and eight served aboard the hospital ship . It was the first time in American history where nurses were fully accepted in military hospitals."
"Although no nurses were killed in combat, 140 died of typhoid and 13 from other diseases. (One of the 13 died of yellow fever after being experimented upon by the army.) Since nearly all the nurses died in the United States, most were sent home to their families for burial. A handful died overseas, and were buried there. On July 8, 1898, Congress enacted legislation authorizing the repatriation of American dead, and appropriating funds for this purpose. Additional legislation was enacted on February 9, 1900; May 26, 1900; and June 6, 1900. Many of the dead were buried at Arlington National Cemetery, either because their families desired it or the remains could not be identified."
"The first Spanish–American War nurse to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery was Anna H. Campos, who died in Cuba on September 2, 1899. Her remains were repatriated about May 1900. By February 1901, the military had repatriated a few of the bodies of nurses who had died overseas. For families which wished it, or where remains went unclaimed or unidentified, the bodies were buried at Arlington. These nurses were buried in what is now Section 21. Over time, more military nurses were buried next to them, creating a ""nurses' section"". The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps had control of Arlington National Cemetery at the time. In late 1906, Brigadier General Charles F. Humphrey, Sr., Quartermaster General, gave permission for any Army nurse who wished to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery with military honors."
"In June 1899, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee co-founded the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses to (among other things) commemorate the service of contract nurses during the Spanish–American War and serve as an advocate for nurses within the U.S. military. At the founding convention on August 7, 1899, Order members agreed to sponsor a $10,000 ""Nurses' Monument"" ($ in dollars) to military nurses at Arlington National Cemetery. Order dues were 25 cents ($ in dollars), and the organization proposed that any dues money left over after the organization's expenses were paid should go toward the monument. By October 1, an additional $158.75 ($ in dollars) in contributions had been raised."
"Approval for the memorial was not quickly forthcoming. A memorial committee was established by the Order of Spanish War Nurses, chaired by Miss Esther Hasson of New York. But by November 1901, the Secretary of War Elihu Root had not yet given approval for the memorial. Fundraising, too, was going slowly, and only $265.63 ($ in dollars) was in the order's memorial fund. The order received word that the Army had set aside a site near the western corner of what is now Section 21 for the memorial in late 1902. But this decision was not a formal one. In the late summer of 1903, however, Dr. McGee received assurance from Secretary of War Root and Quartermaster General Humphrey that the order could erect a memorial in Section 21. However, General Humphrey requested that order erect a simple, artistic monument rather than anything elaborate."
"At the order's annual meeting on August 22, 1903, the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses debated the nature of the memorial they wished to erect. The original intent of the order was to honor all trained nurses, untrained ""immune"" nurses, Catholic sisters, male contract nurses, and any enlisted hospital corpsmen buried in the section. But none of these were actually buried at Arlington in the section assigned for the memorial. In fact, by July 1903, only two immune nurses and two soldiers were buried in Section 21. President McGee said members had expressed their disinclination to commemorate all nurses from all wars buried at Arlington, and the order was barred from erecting a memorial to itself. McGee proposed that the memorial honor all female nurses from the Spanish–American War (whom she called ""our comrades""), or just trained female nurses. She asked the delegates to consider the issue, and make an explicit choice when it voted the following day."
"Later that day, the Committee on Monument issued its report to the membership Committee chair Esther Hasson noted that several designs had been submitted, including one from Tiffany & Co. (although the process for requesting designs was not reported in the media). The cost of the more elaborate memorials was in the $3,000 range ($ in dollars). However, Hasson said, Quartermaster General Humphreys had indicated in July 1903 that the Army's preference was for a simple stone memorial with an inscription, a design which would cost less than $1,000 ($ in dollars). The committee noted that this eliminated any memorial incorporating a bronze tablet, bas-relief figures, or elaborate carving. The committee noted that its preference was for a simple monument approximate in size and cost to that suggested by the Army. The Monument committee submitted a resolution proposing that the monument fund be raised to $3,000 ($ in dollars); that a committee of three be appointed by the chair to produce a monument acceptable to the committee and the Secretary of War as quickly as possible; and that this monument be dedicated to ""deceased army nurses in the National Cemetery at Arlington, Virginia"". The motion passed. The chair immediately appointed Miss Amanda J. Armistead, Miss Isabelle J. Walton, Miss Edith H. Rutley to the Special Committee on Monument."
"On August 23, the Special Committee on Monument made a verbal report to the order (the contents of which were not revealed in the media), which was followed by vigorous discussion. But the members voted to delay action until next annual meeting in September 1904."
"By November 1903, the memorial fund stood at only $346.66 ($ in dollars)."
"The 1904 annual meeting of the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses was scheduled for early September at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. However, at the request of Dr. McGee, the meeting was postponed until November 7, 1904 (although the meeting location was not altered). When the order met in St. Louis, the membership voted unanimous to erect a nurses' memorial with all due speed. But no design for the monument was chosen. The total cost of the memorial was also not reported, but Dr. McGee requested that each member donate $2 ($ in dollars) to bring monument fund to amount needed. By November 1, 1904, just $187 ($ in dollars) had been raised, bringing the monument fund to $546.84 ($ in dollars)."
"By mid-December 1904, the Special Monument Committee of the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses had yet to choose a design, even though many members favored the figure of a nurse."
"Time began to press on the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses. More than six years had elapsed since the monument was first proposed, and donations were only trickling in. Eighteen months had passed since the Secretary of War gave his consent to erect a monument, and there seemed little reason to believe that more time would allow the order to construct a grander memorial. In early 1905, the order contracted with Barclay Bros., a granite company in Barre, Vermont, to produce the memorial."
"The dedication for the Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial was set for 3:00 P.M. on May 2, 1905. The Order of Spanish–American War Nurses established a dedication committee to plan the memorial's unveiling. The committee had great difficulty in getting speakers to commit to the ceremony, and in setting a program. They were successful, however, in persuading Colonel Charles P. Morton, commander of the 7th Cavalry at Fort Myer, to provide a military band."
"The dedication ceremony was not elaborate, but it was symbolic. A temporary pole made of bamboo from the Philippines was erected next to the memorial, and palm branches from Cuba and Puerto Rico were bunched about its base. At the top of the pole was a laurel wreath festooned with red, white, and blue ribbons. Around the foot of the monument, more palm branches were spread. An honor guard of 25 veterans from the Washington, D.C., chapter of the Spanish War Veterans stood around the memorial."
"Dignitaries at the event included Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee (who presided over the ceremony); M. Emmett Urell, Colonel, USA (ret.), past commander of the Grand Army of the Republic; Dr. Clifford Cox, commander, Spanish–American War Veterans; Mrs. Emily N.R. McClean, president, Daughters of the American Revolution; surviving Civil War nurses from Washington, D.C. (all members of the National Association of Army Nurses of the Civil War); Colonel Morton and several U.S. Army and U.S. Navy officers; and a representative from the Embassy of Japan. A marquee was erected near the memorial site to shelter them."
"The dedication ceremony was simple. Father Thomas McGuigan of St. Patrick's Catholic Church provided an invocation. Dr. McGee spoke briefly, followed by Dr. Cox. A poem by Rudyard Kipling was read, and then 15-year-old Klotho McGee (Dr. McGee's daughter) unveiled the monument as the 7th Cavalry Band played ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". Mrs. McLean delivered a lengthy address as the highlight of the ceremony. An Army chaplain gave a benediction, and a bugler from Fort Myer played ""Taps""."
"The Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial is located along the southwestern edge of Section 21 in Arlington National Cemetery. Porter Avenue runs southeast-to-northwest in front of the memorial, while Lawton Avenue is a short distance to the north. Porter and Lawton Avenues meet McPherson Avenue near where the memorial lies. The Battle of the Bulge Memorial is a few feet away to the northwest."
The party's provincial governments faced attacks from leftists and Maoists who advocated armed conflict to take land from landlords and feudals. These attacks were allegedly on the behest of leftists within the Pakistan People's Party.
"On March 23, 1973, the Federal Security Force, a paramilitary force under the alleged orders of Bhutto, attacked a public opposition rally at the Liaquat Bagh in the town of Rawalpindi and killed a dozen people; many more were wounded by their automatic gunfire. Wali Khan narrowly escaped a bullet during the attack. Public anger amongst ethnic Pashtuns ran high, as almost all the dead and most of the wounded were from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and were mostly members of the National Awami Party. The enraged party workers and followers wanted to parade the dead bodies on the streets in Peshawar and other cities of the province, and provoke a full scale confrontation. Wali Khan rejected this notion and held back his infuriated party cadres, escorting the dead bodies to Peshawar; he had them buried quietly with their bereaved families."
Following the massacre the Federal Security Force launched a crackdown against the party that led to many senior leaders including Ajmal Khattak to flee into exile to Kabul.
"The Balochistan government immediately faced multiple crise,s the first of which was when the Balochistan police department, mostly officered by people from Punjab or Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. As there was a provision that employees in the federating provinces would return to their province of origin after the dissolution of the One Unit. Most of the officers insisted on leaving. Despite this fact, Sardar Ataullah Mengal as chief minister, moved a resolution in the Balochistan Assembly to do away with the domicile as a qualification and suggested that those who had spent several generations in the province should be treated as locals. It was later on alleged that the officers were incited to leave through the efforts of PPP supporters and the then Chief Minister of Punjab Ghulam Mustafa Khar."
Unable to exercise any effective authority Ataullah Mengal turned to the Baloch Student Organization to assist in security.
The policing crisis also gave way to a subsequent intra-tribal conflict. The Baloch nationalists declared that it was fomented by the then Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan but without evidence to prove the statements issued.
"However, the final straw was the discovery of arms in the Iraqi embassy in Islamabad and Nawab Akbar Bugti's declaration of the London Plan, that alleged that NAP-led governments in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was seceding to gain independence from Pakistan. Hence, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government, fresh from the humiliation of 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War used the pretext of arms shipment from Iraq to dismember Pakistan and dismissed the Balochistan provincial government in 1973, in protest against the decision the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government resigned in protest. Ataullah Mengal and his colleagues, including Ghaus Bux Bizenjo and Khair Bakhsh Marri were arrested along with other NAP leaders."
"In the face of an increasingly strong national campaign led by the NAP against the government, Bhutto banned NAP on February 8, 1975 after the murder of his close colleague Hayat Khan Sherpao, throwing thousands of its workers and much of its leadership, including party President Khan Abdul Wali Khan, in jail for alleged anti-state activities."
"Invoking the 1st amendment of the 1973 constitution the government charged Wali Khan and his colleagues under the Hyderabad Conspiracy Case in 1976, although they were acquitted of the charge of the murder of PPP stalwart Hayat Khan Sherpao, the decision to ban the NAP was upheld by the courts. In addition to Khan Abdul Wali Khan, the case also implicated two governors, two chief ministers, scores of national and provincial parliamentarians, Khan Amirzadah Khan, Syed Kaswar Gardezi, Habib Jalib (Urdu revolutionary poet) and Mir Gul Khan Nasir (Balochi Revolutionary Poet/Leader) and even some of Bhutto’s former colleagues, many of whom were later re-elected and became federal or provincial ministers."
"With the NAP leadership largely imprisoned, a new political party was formed on the wreckage of the NAP in 1976 by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. Named National Democratic Party (NDP), it was headed by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The Hyderabad case was withdrawn after General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq imposed martial law in July 1977. Wali Khan left party affairs to Sher Baz Mazari after his release from jail in 1979. The party faced a split at that time between far left elements led by Khair Bakhsh Marri advocating outright separation and armed struggle and those advocating political struggle led by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The split ended the alliance between Pashtun Nationalists and Baloch Nationalists that Wali Khan had formed in 1969 and led to the formation of the Pakistan National Party."
Sherbaz Khan Mazari led the NDP into joining the Movement for Restoration of Democracy. The alliance with former rivals the PPP did not go down well with Ghaffar Khan who encouraged by Governor Fazle Haq warned Ghaffar Khan of what would happen if the PPP returned to power.
This move led to a split between Mazari and Wali Khan which were aggravated after Wali Khan in a statement rejected the 1973 constitution and Wali Khan's election as NDP President.
The NDP was merged with other nationalist parties from Balochistan and Sindh in 1986 in Karachi to launch a new political party named Awami National Party with Wali Khan as its president and Rasul Bux Palejo as its general-secretary.

"Mihailo Marković, PhD (; 24 February 1923 – 7 February 2010) was a Serbian philosopher who gained prominence in the 1960s and 1970s as a proponent of the Praxis School, a Marxist humanist movement that originated in Yugoslavia."
"A co-author of the SANU Memorandum, Marković was a prominent supporter of Slobodan Milošević in the late 1980s and 1990s."
"Marković was born in Belgrade, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He became a member of the youth organization of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in 1940, and in 1944 he became a member of the KPJ itself. As a partisan he actively participated in the struggle for liberation of Yugoslavia during World War II."
"Marković took a doctorate in philosophy first at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy in 1955, and then another in 1956 at University College London. There he studied logic under A. J. Ayer, and wrote his thesis on ""The Concept of Logic"". In 1963 he became a full professor of philosophy at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, and the dean of the faculty in the period 1966–1967. From 1960 to 1962 he was the president of the Yugoslav Society of Philosophy. In the 1970s, he taught at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was a director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade. He also taught for many years at the University of Pennsylvania, first as a frequent visiting professor from 1972 to 1980 and then as an adjunct professor from 1981 to 1993. Marković was a co-Chairman of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (1975–1985). He has been a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1963 and a full member since 1983."
"In his honour, a collection of articles entitled ""Philosophy and Society"" was published in Belgrade in 1987."
"After the Resolution of the Informbiro condemning the Yugoslav communist regime, Marković took part in a fierce debate against Stalinist dogmatism, becoming one of the fiercest critics of the Stalinist philosophical theses. His ""Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR"", published in 1952, was the first major attack on the Stalinist philosophy in Yugoslavia."
"In the 1960s Marković became a major proponent of the Praxis School of Marxist interpretation, which emphasized the writings of young Marx, and their dialectical and humanist aspects in particular. He also actively contributed to the international journal ""Praxis"". Due to his critical observations, together with seven other professors from the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade, Marković was suspended in January 1975, and finally lost his job in January 1981. After that, Marković worked in the Institute of Social Research until his retirement in 1986."
"As a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in 1986, Marković, together with Vasilije Krestić and others, wrote the SANU Memorandum, a document that has formulated the central tenets of Serbian nationalism. While the document has been viewed in some neighbouring former Yugoslav republics as a preparation for full-scale Greater Serbian expansionism, many Serbs considered it a realistic depiction of the Serbian position within Yugoslav federation."
"Marković was vice-president of the Slobodan Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia from 1990 to 1992, as well as its one time chief ideologue. At other times, he was a vocal critic of the official SPS party line. In November 1995 he was released from all duties in the party."
= = = Small rhombihexahedron = = =
"In geometry, the small rhombihexahedron (or small rhombicube) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It has 18 faces (12 squares and 6 octagons), 48 edges, and 24 vertices. Its vertex figure is an antiparallelogram."
This polyhedron shares the vertex arrangement with the stellated truncated hexahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the convex rhombicuboctahedron (having 12 square faces in common) and with the small cubicuboctahedron (having the octagonal faces in common).
It may be constructed as the exclusive or (blend) of three octagonal prisms.
= = = Small cubicuboctahedron = = =
"In geometry, the small cubicuboctahedron is a uniform star polyhedron, indexed as U. It has 20 faces (8 triangles, 6 squares, and 6 octagons), 48 edges, and 24 vertices. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
"The cubicuboctahedron is a faceting of the rhombicuboctahedron. Its name comes from that the square faces lying on the planes corresponding to the rhombic dodecahedron, has been replaced by six octagonal faces parallel to the square faces of the cube."
"It shares its vertex arrangement with the stellated truncated hexahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the rhombicuboctahedron (having the triangular faces and 6 square faces in common), and with the small rhombihexahedron (having the octagonal faces in common)."
"As the Euler characteristic suggests, the small cubicuboctahedron is a toroidal polyhedron of genus 3 (topologically it is a surface of genus 3), and thus can be interpreted as a (polyhedral) immersion of a genus 3 polyhedral surface, in the complement of its 24 vertices, into 3-space. (A neighborhood of any vertex is topologically a cone on a figure-8, which cannot occur in an immersion. Note that the Richter reference overlooks this fact.) The underlying polyhedron (ignoring self-intersections) defines a uniform tiling of this surface, and so the small cubicuboctahedron is a uniform polyhedron. In the language of abstract polytopes, the small cubicuboctahedron is a ""faithful realization"" of this abstract toroidal polyhedron, meaning that it is a nondegenerate polyhedron and that they have the same symmetry group. In fact, every automorphism of the abstract genus 3 surface with this tiling is realized by an isometry of Euclidean space."
"Higher genus surfaces (genus 2 or greater) admit a metric of negative constant curvature (by the uniformization theorem), and the universal cover of the resulting Riemann surface is the hyperbolic plane. The corresponding tiling of the hyperbolic plane has vertex figure 3.8.4.8 (triangle, octagon, square, octagon). If the surface is given the appropriate metric of curvature = −1, the covering map is a local isometry and thus the ""abstract"" vertex figure is the same. This tiling may be denoted by the Wythoff symbol 3 4 | 4, and is depicted on the right."
"Alternatively and more subtly, by chopping up each square face into 2 triangles and each octagonal face into 6 triangles, the small cubicuboctahedron can be interpreted as a non-regular ""coloring"" of the combinatorially ""regular"" (not just ""uniform"") tiling of the genus 3 surface by 56 equilateral triangles, meeting at 24 vertices, each with degree 7. This regular tiling is significant as it is a tiling of the Klein quartic, the genus 3 surface with the most symmetric metric (automorphisms of this tiling equal isometries of the surface), and the orientation-preseserving automorphism group of this surface is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2,7), equivalently GL(3,2) (the order 168 group of all orientation-preserving isometries). Note that the small cubicuboctahedron is ""not"" a realization of this abstract polyhedron, as it only has 24 orientation-preserving symmetries (not every abstract automorphism is realized by a Euclidean isometry) – the isometries of the small cubicuboctahedron preserve not only the triangular tiling, but also the coloring, and hence are a proper subgroup of the full isometry group."
"The corresponding tiling of the hyperbolic plane (the universal covering) is the order-7 triangular tiling. The automorphism group of the Klein quartic can be augmented (by a symmetry which is not realized by a symmetry of the polyhedron, namely ""exchanging the two endpoints of the edges that bisect the squares and octahedra) to yield the Mathieu group M."

= = = Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao = = =
"Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao, billed as the Fight of the Century or the Battle for Greatness, was a professional boxing match between undefeated five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. and eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao. It took place on May 2, 2015, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mayweather Jr. won the contest by unanimous decision, with two judges scoring it 116–112 and the other 118–110. Although the fight was considered to be one of the most anticipated sporting events in history, it was largely considered a letdown by critics and audiences alike upon its broadcast."
"Despite predictions that Mayweather–Pacquiao would be the highest-grossing fight in history as early as 2009, disagreements between the two professional boxers' camps on terms for the fight prevented the bout from coming to fruition until 2015. The failure to arrange the Mayweather–Pacquiao fight was named the 2010 ""Event of the Year"" by ""The Ring"". Serious negotiations were kickstarted in 2014 by an unlikely source: a Hollywood waiter and part-time actor, Gabriel Salvador, made a key introduction between Pacquiao's trainer and confidant Freddie Roach and CBS President Les Moonves, who both worked to facilitate the match. By 2015, negotiations for the fight had been finalized, with all of the major issues that prevented the fight from happening in the past resolved, including purse split, drug testing and location."
"The fight was televised through a pay-per-view (PPV) jointly produced by HBO and Showtime, the respective rightsholders of Pacquiao and Mayweather. In the Philippines, the fight was also broadcast in simulcast across three of the country's major broadcast television networks. The fight was expected to be the most lucrative in the history of professional boxing: with an initial estimate of 4.4 million purchases, the PPV alone broke revenue records in the United States (U.S.) with $410 million in revenue, making it the highest-grossing PPV in history, surpassing Mayweather–Álvarez in 2013. By September 2015, the figure had been amended to 4.6 million. The broadcast of the fight in the Philippines was watched by nearly half the country's households. Due to the record high price of the PPV, the fight was also widely broadcast through unauthorized online streams on services such as Periscope."
"Despite the large amount of hype that surrounded it, critics felt that the bout itself was disappointing, primarily citing Mayweather's defense-oriented strategy in the ring and Pacquiao's difficulty in landing punches on Mayweather. This had led to some critics re-labelling the fight 'Better Never Than Late' rather than 'Fight of the Century'. It was later revealed following the event that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury to his right shoulder while training and that while it had healed in time for the fight, he re-injured it during the fourth round. Further controversy emerged when it was revealed that prior to the fight, Mayweather had been administered IV fluids cleared by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) through a retroactive ""therapeutic use exemption""—an exemption, however, not authorized by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC)."
"When the fight was announced, Mayweather was 38 years old and still undefeated, with a perfect professional record of 47 wins and no losses. On June 6, 2008, six months after defeating Ricky Hatton by a tenth-round technical knockout, Mayweather announced his retirement from boxing. At the time, plans were in motion for a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya, which was going to take place September 20, 2008. ""This decision was not an easy one for me to make as boxing is all I have done since I was a child,"" Mayweather said. ""However, these past few years have been extremely difficult for me to find the desire and joy to continue in the sport."" At the time, 31-year-old Mayweather registered 39 wins and no losses in his historic career. At the time of his retirement, ""The Ring"" had Mayweather ranked as the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the world, with Manny Pacquiao at No. 2."
"During Mayweather's brief retirement, Pacquiao earned superstar status in much of the Western world with his eighth-round technical knockout victory over Oscar De La Hoya, for which he moved up from lightweight to welterweight (135 pounds to 147 pounds)."
"On May 2, 2009, the day of Pacquiao's fight against Ricky Hatton, Mayweather announced that he was coming out of retirement and would fight Juan Manuel Márquez, ""The Ring"" lightweight champion and No. 2 pound-for-pound fighter, on July 18, 2009, in a welterweight non-title fight. Márquez had previously fought Pacquiao in two controversial outings: they fought to a 12-round draw on May 8, 2004, and Pacquiao was awarded a 12-round split decision win on March 15, 2008. Mayweather played down Pacquiao's newfound stardom at his press conference, stating: ""If he wins tonight, don't be all shocked ... Cause guess what? I beat (Hatton) when he was undefeated. Pacquiao beat Oscar, it don't matter. Going down to 147 pounds was too much for (De La Hoya), he was dead after the first round. ... When you talk boxing, you talk Floyd Mayweather."""
"Pacquiao would go on to defeat Hatton by a second-round knockout to win ""The Ring"" junior welterweight title. The win made him the second boxer in history to win titles in six weight divisions, the first being Oscar De La Hoya."
"Mayweather vs. Márquez was postponed until September 19, 2009, due to a rib injury suffered by Mayweather. Despite being out of the ring for 21 months, Mayweather looked as sharp as ever and dominated the fight, winning by a lopsided 12-round unanimous decision. After the bout, Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe stated that a fight with Pacquiao was the ""next obvious choice from a marketing standpoint."""
"On November 14, 2009, Pacquiao stopped Puerto Rican star Miguel Cotto in round 12 to win the WBO welterweight title. Pacquiao's victory sparked a media frenzy and fans were quick to demand a fight between the two of them, despite the fact that the actual fight itself had not officially been made yet and would not take place until 2015."
"On December 5, 2009, ESPN reported that Pacquiao signed a contract to fight Mayweather on March 13, 2010. Shortly afterward, Pacquiao denied ever signing a contract to fight Mayweather, telling ""FanHouse"", ""There are still some things that need to be negotiated."" On December 11,"
"Golden Boy Promotions sent an eight-page contract to Top Rank, proposing a 50–50 financial split for a fight to take place on March 13, 2010. The contract was very detailed, including such matters as who would weigh-in first (Pacquiao), who would enter the ring first (Pacquiao) and who would be introduced first (Mayweather). The contract included an HBO PPV showing at a cost of $59.95. Billing was to be ""Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, presented by Top Rank, Golden Boy Promotions, Mayweather Promotions and M-P Promotions in association with [approved sponsors and the site]."" Also included in the contract was Olympic-style drug testing. Venues for the fight being discussed were Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and the Superdome in New Orleans."
"In a video titled ""Boxing Legend Freddie Roach Updates Us On Pacquiao"" uploaded to YouTube on December 11, 2009, Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, revealed the first hint about Mayweather's request for Olympic-style drug testing, telling roving reporter Elie Seckbach, ""I hear negotiations are a little shady. (Richard) Schaefer and them are unhappy about something. They want Olympic-style drug testing. I said, 'Yeah, no problem.' I said, 'Whatever you want.' Since we accepted that, now they're running scared again."""
"On December 13, 2009, Pacquiao's adviser, Michael Koncz, said Mayweather's request for Olympic-style drug testing was a laughing matter and they had no concerns whatsoever about it. ""Our reaction is, 'So what?' We know Manny doesn't take any illegal drugs or anything. And none of this is getting under Manny's skin or anything. I'm here with Manny, and to him, it's like a joke. It's a laughing matter,"" said Koncz."
"After reports had surfaced that both parties had agreed to all terms, Golden Boy Promotions released a press release on December 22, 2009, revealing that Pacquiao was unwilling to comply with the Olympic-style drug testing requested by Team Mayweather. The following day, Bob Arum, Top Rank founder and CEO, declared the fight was off and Pacquiao would be facing a different opponent. ""We appeased Mayweather by agreeing to a urine analysis at any time, and blood testing before the press conference and after the fight. Mayweather pressed for blood testing even up to the weigh-in. He knew that Manny gets freaked out when his blood gets taken and feels that it weakens him. This is just harassment and, to me, just signaled that he didn't want the fight,"" Arum told David Mayo of the ""Grand Rapids Press""."
"Not long after declaring that the fight was off, Arum had a change of heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it deadline to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to three tests: one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and immediately after the fight. ""Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested ... It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures ... The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous,"" Arum explained. Freddie Roach told Lance Pugmire of the ""Los Angeles Times"" on December 22, 2009, that he would prefer for Pacquiao to give his final blood sample a week before the bout and no later than 72 hours before."
"On December 28, 2009, video from an episode of HBO's ""Pacquiao–Hatton: 24/7"" surfaced on the internet showing Pacquiao giving blood in the weeks leading up to his May 2, 2009, bout with Ricky Hatton. Documents confirmed that the video was recorded on April 8, 2009, 24 days prior to the fight and past the 30-day cut-off date that Pacquiao had demanded for a Mayweather fight. Pacquiao filed suit in U.S. District Court in Nevada on December 30, 2009, against Floyd Mayweather Jr., Floyd Mayweather Sr., Roger Mayweather, Mayweather Promotions and Golden Boy Promotions executives Oscar De La Hoya and Richard Schaefer, alleging that they made false and defamatory statements accusing him of taking performance-enhancing drugs."
"Both sides agreed to enter into mediation on January 7, 2010, in hopes of coming to an agreement on the blood testing issue. Retired federal judge Daniel Weinstein, who successfully resolved a prior dispute between Top Rank and Golden Boy Promotions, would again act as mediator. Two days later, after hours of negotiating during mediation, Arum declared that the fight was officially off after Mayweather refused to agree to a 24-day cut-off date. Mayweather revealed that he offered a 14-day cut-off date to Team Pacquiao, but it was rejected."
"Leonard Ellerbe declared on January 18, that random blood and urine testing will be implemented in all of Mayweather's future fights, regardless of the opponent. On February 13, in an exclusive interview with David Mayo of The ""Grand Rapids Press"", Mayweather said, ""I gave him [Pacquiao] a chance, up to 14 days out. But my new terms are all the way up to the fight. They can come get us whenever, all the way up to the fight, random drug test. That's what it is."""
"After the failed negotiations, both boxers moved on to other fights. On March 13, 2010, Pacquiao defeated Joshua Clottey via unanimous decision and on May 1, 2010, Mayweather beat Shane Mosley by a unanimous decision."
"On May 13, 2010, Bob Arum announced that he had penciled in November 13, 2010, as the date of Pacquiao's next fight, possibly against Mayweather. Pacquiao was quoted by the ""Manila Bulletin"" on May 20, as saying, ""As long as they're not getting a large amount of blood, I am willing to give out blood as close to two weeks before the fight."" On the same day, Mayweather revealed that he would be taking off the rest of 2010 and possibly 2011."
"Arum declared on June 30, 2010, that there were no longer any issues and the decision was up to Mayweather. ""That's all been resolved,"" Arum stated to Kevin Iole of ""Yahoo Sports"" regarding the dispute over random blood and urine drug testing. Arum would also tell the ""Las Vegas Review-Journal"", ""There's no longer any issues...The question is whether Mayweather is willing to fight this year."" He would reiterate that comment to the ""Manila Bulletin"", stating, ""It's now up to Mayweather if he wants to fight."""

= = = Armand Mattelart = = =
"Armand Mattelart (born January 8, 1936) is a Belgian sociologist and well known as a Leftist French scholar. His work deals with media, culture and communication, specially in their historical and international dimensions."
"After finishing his undergraduate studies Mattelart joined a community of secular monks in Brittany for one year, but went on to study Law and Political Science at the Catholic University of Louvain. Afterwards he studied demography at the Institute of Demographic Studies in Paris (founded by the influential left intellectual Alfred Sauvy, who in 1952 coined the term Third World). Upon finishing his studies he was appointed as an expert on the politics of population by the Vatican, and in 1962 was sent to the Universidad Católica de Chile. While in Chile he married Michèle Mattelart."
"While in Chile Mattelart was appointed to confront from a catholic spiritual perspective the strategic models for family planning which were at the time being pushed by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Alianza para el Progreso (Alliance for Progress—a US official aid program). The US family planning model aimed to limit the natality to ""improve the lives of the inhabitants of the continent"" and of course in conflict with the Catholic teachings. The revolutionary transformations in Latin America post-1960 require that the Church enter the ideological fray and develop communication strategies applied to ""ideological, political and social struggles"" to create ideological and political alternatives to atheist communism or the ""protestant North American imperialism""."
"While always based at the Catholic Univ. of Chile, Mattelart underwent a transformation in his thoughts and beliefs. He initiated a collaboration with the Centro de Estudios de la Realidad Nacional (CEREN) (Center for the Study of the National Reality), founded in 1968 under the auspices of the Catholic Univ. Jacques Chonchol was CEREN's director (also an important ideolog with MAPU—a left offshoot of the Christian Democrats which was also part of the Unidad Popular government). CEREN's first research conducted by Armando Mattelart, Michèle Mattelart, Mabel Paccini, et al., had to do with a structural left analysis of the liberal press, the ""celebrity"" publications, the pseudo-amorous magazines. Mattelart primarily studied El Mercurio, the principal liberal newspaper. This was the starting-point of his lifelong involvement with the history of communications."
"The Cuadernos de la Realidad Nacional (Notebooks of the National Reality), CEREN's publication, became the principal ideological generators and emitters during the social democratic government of Salvador Allende (1970–1973). The journal was similar to the French post-structuralist model, and it was primarily aimed to analyze the political economy of the mass media. Under this rubric, Mattelart and Ariel Dorfman published in 1971 the famous pamphlet: ""Para leer al Pato Donald, manual de descolonización antinorteamericana"" (""How to read ""Donald Duck"", a manual for American de-colonization""), where they provided a Marxist structural analysis of global forms of American consumer capitalism. The pamphlet denounces ""Yankee media penetration"" through an assessment of Disney as global ideological conveyor of American liberal - and increasingly neoliberal - values. The book analyzed the celebrated family of ducks and presented them as nasty agents of the North American cultural imperialism. This book enjoyed great publicity and it became one of the best-selling books in Latin America during the 1970s, largely because of American-centered interventions in Latin America and repeated efforts by American political, economic, and paramilitary assets to undermine the democratically elected government in Chile."
"After the Chilean coup of 1973, Mattelart returned to France where (at age 37) he had to restart his academic career—he became a visiting scholar at the University of Paris VIII Saint-Denis. He later became a full professor of Science of Information and Communication—a topic on which he later became a theoretician. In 1974, he worked on ""La Espiral"", a film justifying the Chilean route to socialism. Between 1983 and 1997 he has been Professor of Information and Communication Sciences at the University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany, and in the postgraduate program at Paris III (Nouvelle Sorbonne) -Rennes 2. Between 1997-2004, he has been Professor at the Université of Paris VIII. Since September 2004, he is Professor Emeritus."

It was published in September 2007 in the United Kingdom by Picador and in October 2007 in the United States by W. W. Norton and Company. The book, a result of cycling 14,000 miles around France coupled with four years of research, is an in-depth examination of French national identity as seen through the diverse cultures and languages contained within the country."
"Writing for ""The Guardian"", historian Andrew Hussey described it as an ""elegant, entertaining and occasionally brilliant overview of France past and present"", noting that despite Robb's academic background in French literature, it is written in the style of an accomplished novelist, and lamented that the ""discovery"" of this element of French history was identified by an English writer, and was yet to be ""discovered"" by the French themselves. In the ""Boston Globe"", Richard Eder suggested that the time spent on the bicycle provided Robb with a fresh approach to telling the history of France, but the four years he spent in the library meant there was a ""conscientious pursuit"" of detail within the book, covering such a wide variety of topics such as road building, touring, postcards, seaside development, spas, cave exploration, marsh reclamation, and the mountaineering vogue, which weighed the book down and detracted from the core themes."
"On April 28, 2008, the book was awarded the £10,000 Ondaatje Prize by the Royal Society of Literature in London. It also won the 2007 Duff Cooper Prize, earning Robb £5,000."

= = = California State Water Project = = =
"The California State Water Project, commonly known as the SWP, is a state water management project in the U.S. state of California under the supervision of the California Department of Water Resources. The SWP is one of the largest public water and power utilities in the world, providing drinking water for more than 23 million people and generating an average of 6,500 GWh of hydroelectricity annually. However, as it is the largest single consumer of power in the state itself, it has a net usage of 5,100 GWh."
"The SWP collects water from rivers in Northern California and redistributes it to the water-scarce but populous south through a network of aqueducts, pumping stations and power plants. About 70% of the water provided by the project is used for urban areas and industry in Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area, and 30% is used for irrigation in the Central Valley. To reach Southern California, the water must be pumped over the Tehachapi Mountains, with at the Edmonston Pumping Plant alone, the highest single water lift in the world. The SWP shares many facilities with the federal Central Valley Project (CVP), which primarily serves agricultural users. Water can be interchanged between SWP and CVP canals as needed to meet peak requirements for project constituents. The SWP provides estimated annual benefits of $400 billion to California's economy."
"Since its inception in 1960, the SWP has required the construction of 21 dams and more than of canals, pipelines and tunnels, although these constitute only a fraction of the facilities originally proposed. As a result, the project has only delivered an average of annually, as compared to total entitlements of . Environmental concerns caused by the dry-season removal of water from the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, a sensitive estuary region, have often led to further reductions in water delivery. Work continues today to expand the SWP's water delivery capacity while finding solutions for the environmental impacts of water diversion."
"The original purpose of the project was to provide water for arid Southern California, whose local water resources and share of the Colorado River were insufficient to sustain the region's growth. The SWP was rooted in two proposals. The United Western Investigation of 1951, a study by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, assessed the feasibility of interbasin water transfers in the Western United States. In California, this plan contemplated the construction of dams on rivers draining to California's North Coast – the wild and undammed Klamath, Eel, Mad and Smith River systems – and tunnels to carry the impounded water to the Sacramento River system, where it could be diverted southwards. In the same year, State Engineer A.D. Edmonston proposed the Feather River Project, which proposed the damming of the Feather River, a tributary of the Sacramento River, for the same purpose. The Feather River was much more accessible than the North Coast rivers, but did not have nearly as much water. Under both of the plans, a series of canals and pumps would carry the water south through the Central Valley to the foot of the Tehachapi Mountains, where it would pass through the Tehachapi Tunnel to reach Southern California."
"Calls for a comprehensive statewide water management system (complementing the extensive, but primarily irrigation-based Central Valley Project) led to the creation of the California Department of Water Resources in 1956. The following year, the preliminary studies were compiled into the extensive California Water Plan, or Bulletin No. 3. The project was intended for ""the control, protection, conservation, distribution, and utilization of the waters of California, to meet present and future needs for all beneficial uses and purposes in all areas of the state to the maximum feasible extent."" California governor Pat Brown would later say it was to ""correct an accident of people and geography""."
"The diversion of the North Coast rivers was abandoned in the plan's early stages after strong opposition from locals and concerns about the potential impact on the salmon in North Coast rivers. The California Water Plan would have to go ahead with the development of the Feather River alone, as proposed by Edmonston. The Burns-Porter Act of 1959 provided $1.75 billion of initial funding through a bond measure. Construction on Stage I of the project, which would deliver the first of water, began in 1960. Northern Californians opposed the measure as a boondoggle and an attempt to steal their water resources. In fact, the city of Los Angeles – which was to be one of the principal beneficiaries – also opposed the project; locals saw it as a ploy by politicians in the other Colorado River basin states to get Los Angeles to relinquish its share of the Colorado River. Historians largely attribute the success of the Burns-Porter Act and the State Water Project to major agribusiness lobbying, particularly by J.G. Boswell II of the J.G. Boswell cotton company. The bond was passed on an extremely narrow margin of 174,000 out of 5.8 million ballots cast."
"In 1961, ground was broken on Oroville Dam, and in 1963, work began on the California Aqueduct and San Luis Reservoir. The first deliveries to the Bay Area were made in 1962, and water reached the San Joaquin Valley by 1968. Due to concerns over the fault-ridden geography of the Tehachapi Mountains, the tunnel plan was scrapped; the water would have to be pumped over the mountains' crest. In 1973, the pumps and the East and West branches of the aqueduct were completed, and the first water was delivered to Southern California. A Peripheral Canal, which would have carried SWP water around the vulnerable and ecologically sensitive Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, was rejected in 1982 due to environmental concerns. The Coastal Branch, which delivers water to coastal central California, was completed in 1997."
"The Feather River, a tributary of the Sacramento River, provides the primary watershed for the State Water Project. Runoff from the Feather River headwaters is captured in Antelope, Frenchman, and Davis reservoirs, which impound tributaries of the North and Middle forks of the Feather River. Collectively referred to as the Upper Feather River Lakes, these three reservoirs provide a combined storage capacity of about ."
"Water released from the Upper Feather River system flows into Lake Oroville, which is formed by the Oroville Dam several miles above the city of Oroville. At , Oroville is the tallest dam in the United States; by volume it is the largest dam in California. Authorized by an emergency flood control measure in 1957, Oroville Dam was built between 1961 and 1967 with the reservoir filling for the first time in 1968."
"Lake Oroville has a capacity to store approximately of water which accounts for 61 percent of the SWP's total system storage capacity, and is the single most important reservoir of the project."
"Water stored in Lake Oroville is released through the 819 MW Edward Hyatt pumped-storage powerplant and two other hydroelectric plants downstream of Oroville Dam, which together make up the Oroville-Thermalito Complex. The Thermalito Forebay and Afterbay support the 120 MW Thermalito Pumping-Generating Plant, and the Thermalito Diversion Dam supports a smaller 3.3 MW powerplant. The entire system generates approximately 2.2 billion kilowatt hours per year, making up about a third of the total power generated by SWP facilities."
"From Oroville, a regulated water flow travels down the Feather and Sacramento Rivers to the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. North of Rio Vista, about per year is pumped into the North Bay Aqueduct, completed in 1988. The aqueduct delivers water to clients in Napa and Solano counties."
"The vast majority of the SWP water is drawn through the Delta's complex estuary system into the Clifton Court Forebay, located northwest of Tracy on the southern end of the Delta. Here, the Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant lifts water into the California Aqueduct. Completed in 1963, the eleven pump units can lift up to of water – upgraded in 1986 from its original capacity of across seven units."
"From here the water flows briefly south along the California Aqueduct to the Bethany Reservoir. The South Bay Pumping Plant supplies the South Bay Aqueduct, which has delivered water west to Alameda County since 1962 and Santa Clara County since 1965. The aqueduct carries a maximum of per year. Up to of this water can be stored in Lake Del Valle, an offstream reservoir located near Livermore."
"South of the Bay Area diversions, the bulk of the SWP water – ranging from per year – travels south along the western flank of the San Joaquin Valley through the California Aqueduct. The main section of the aqueduct stretches for ; it is composed mainly of concrete-lined canals but also includes of tunnels, of pipelines and of siphons. The aqueduct reaches a maximum width of and a maximum depth of ; some parts of the channel are capable of delivering more than . The section of the aqueduct that runs through the San Joaquin Valley includes multiple turnouts where water is released to irrigate roughly of land on the west side of the valley."
"The aqueduct enters the O'Neill Forebay reservoir west of Volta, where water can be pumped into a giant offstream storage facility, San Luis Reservoir, formed by the nearby B.F. Sisk Dam. San Luis Reservoir is shared by the SWP and the federal Central Valley Project; here water can be switched between the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal to cope with fluctuating demands. The SWP has a 50 percent share of the of storage available in San Luis Reservoir."
"South of the San Luis Reservoir complex, the aqueduct steadily gains elevation through a series of massive pumping plants. Dos Amigos Pumping Plant is located shortly south of San Luis, lifting the water . Near Kettleman City, the Coastal Branch splits off from the main California Aqueduct. Buena Vista, Teerink and Chrisman Pumping Plants are located on the main aqueduct near the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley near Bakersfield. The aqueduct then reaches A.D. Edmonston Pumping Plant, which lifts the water over the Tehachapi Mountains that separate the San Joaquin Valley from Southern California. It is the highest pump-lift in the SWP, with a capacity of across fourteen units. Initial construction of Edmonston was completed in 1974, with the last three units installed in the 1980s."
"Once reaching the crest of the Tehachapis, the aqueduct runs through a series of tunnels to the Tehachapi Afterbay, where its flow is partitioned between West and East Branches."
"The Coastal Branch diverts about per year from the California Aqueduct to parts of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties. The aqueduct stretches for , and is mostly made up of buried pipeline. Pumping plants at Las Perillas, Badger Hill, Devil's Den, Bluestone, and Polonio Pass serve to lift the water over the California Coast Ranges. Once over the crest of the mountains, the water is reregulated in a series of small reservoirs numbered Tanks 1 through 5. The Coastal Branch was completed in 1994 following a severe drought that led to calls for importation of SWP water."
"Through a pipeline known as the Central Coast Water Authority extension, completed in 1997, the Coastal Branch supplies water to Lake Cachuma, a reservoir on the Santa Ynez River."
"From the terminus of the main California Aqueduct at Tehachapi Afterbay, the West Branch carries water to a second reservoir, Quail Lake, via the Oso Pumping Plant. The water then runs south by gravity to the 78 MW William E. Warne Powerplant, located on the Pyramid Lake reservoir. The West Branch delivered about per year for the period 1995–2010."
"From Pyramid Lake, water is released through the Angeles Tunnel to the Castaic Power Plant on Elderberry Forebay and the Castaic Lake reservoir located north of Santa Clarita. Castaic Power Plant is a pumped-storage hydroelectric plant capable of producing 1,247 MW on peak demand. Together, Pyramid and Castaic Lakes form the primary storage for West Branch water delivered to Southern California. Water is supplied to municipalities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties."
"The East Branch takes water from Tehachapi Afterbay along the north side of the San Gabriel Mountains and San Bernardino Mountains to the Silverwood Lake reservoir, which can hold . From here it passes through a tunnel under the San Bernardino Mountains to the Devil Canyon Powerplant, the largest ""recovery plant"", or aqueduct power plant, of the SWP system. The water then flows through the Santa Ana Tunnel to Lake Perris, which can store up to ."
"Water deliveries through the East Branch averaged per year from 1995 through 2012. The East Branch principally provides water for cities and farms in the Inland Empire, Orange County, and other areas south of Los Angeles. Through Lake Perris, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California receives a large portion of its water from the SWP. Water is also supplied to the San Diego Aqueduct through a connection from Perris to Lake Skinner, further south."
"The original 1957 California Water Plan included provisions for dams on the Klamath, Eel, Mad and Smith Rivers of California's North Coast. Fed by prolific rainfall in the western Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains, these rivers discharge more than to the Pacific each year, more than that of the entire Sacramento River system. The plan was basically a variation of a contemporary Bureau of Reclamation project, the Klamath Diversion."
"A series of dams in these watersheds would shunt water through interbasin transfers into the Klamath River system. The centerpiece of the project would be a reservoir on the Klamath River – the largest man-made lake in California – from where the water would flow through the Trinity Tunnel into the Sacramento River, and thence to the canals and pump systems of the SWP. This would have provided between of water each year for the SWP. The diversion of the North Coast rivers, however were dropped from the initial SWP program."
"In the mid-1960s, devastating flooding brought renewed interest in damming the North Coast rivers. The Department of Water Resources formed the State-Federal Interagency Task Force with the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers to develop plans for developing the rivers in the name of flood control – which would, incidentally, provide a way to divert some of their water into the SWP system. Although most of the proposed projects met their demise over political squabbles, one that persisted was the Dos Rios Project on the Eel River system, which would have involved constructing a gigantic dam on the Middle Fork of the Eel River, diverting water through the Grindstone Tunnel into the Sacramento Valley. Supporters of this project cited the disastrous Christmas flood of 1964 and the flood control benefits Dos Rios would provide to the Eel River basin."
"The Klamath and Dos Rios diversions were heavily opposed by local towns and Native American tribes, whose land would have been flooded under the reservoirs. Fishermen expressed concerns over the impact of the dams on the salmon runs of North Coast rivers, especially the Klamath – the largest Pacific coast salmon river south of the Columbia River. The project would have eliminated 98 percent of the salmon spawning grounds on the Klamath. California Governor Ronald Reagan refused to approve the Dos Rios project, citing economic insensibility and fraudulent claims made by project proponents. The flood control benefits, for example, were largely exaggerated; the Dos Rios dam would have reduced the record Eel River flood crest of 1964 by only had it been in place."
= = = Assyrians in Iran = = =
"Assyrians in Iran, Iranian Assyrians or Persian Assyrians (), (), are an ethnic and linguistic minority in present-day Iran. The Assyrians of Iran speak Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, a neo-Aramaic language descended from Classical Syriac and elements of Akkadian, and are Eastern Rite Christians belonging mostly to the Assyrian Church of the East and also to the Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Pentecostal Church, Chaldean Catholic Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church."
"They share a common history and ethnic identity, rooted in shared linguistic, cultural and religious traditions, with Assyrians in Iraq, Assyrians in Turkey and Assyrians in Syria, as well as with the Assyrian diaspora."
"The Assyrian community in Iran numbered approximately 200,000 prior to the Islamic Revolution of 1979. However, after the revolution many Assyrians left the country, primarily for the United States; the 1996 Iranian census counted only 32,000 Assyrians. Current estimates of the Assyrian population in Iran range from 32,000 () to 50,000 ()."
"The Iranian capital, Tehran, is home to the majority of Iranian Assyrians; however, approximately 15,000 Assyrians reside in northern Iran, in Urmia and various Assyrian villages in the surrounding area."
"The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, ratified in 1979, recognizes Assyrians as a religious minority and ethnic minority and reserves for them one seat in the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the Iranian parliament. , the seat was occupied by Yonathan Betkolia, who was elected in 2000 and reelected in the 2004 legislative election."
"Today, scholars estimate that there are only around 5,000 Assyrians left in the historical center of the city of Urmia."
"The Assyrian presence in Iran goes back 4,000 years to ancient times, and Assyria was involved in the history of Ancient Iran even before the arrival of the modern Iranian peoples to the region circa 1000 BC. During the Old Assyrian Empire (c.2025-1750 BC) and Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1020 BC) the Assyrians ruled over parts of ""Pre-Iranic"" northern and western Iran. The Neo-Assyrian Empire (911-605 BC) saw Assyria conquer the Iranic Persians, Medes and Parthians into their empire, together with the ancient ""pre-Iranic"" Elamites, Kassites, Manneans and Gutians, and also the Iranic Cimmerians of Asia Minor and Scythians of the Caucasus. The home of the Assyrians in Iran has traditionally been along the western shore of Lake Urmia from the Salmas area to the Urmia plain."
"After the fall of Assyria between 612 and 599 BC, after decades of civil war, followed by an attack by an alliance of former subject peoples; the Medes, Persians, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Scythians and Cimmerians, its people became an integral part of the Achaemenid Empire (as did Assyria itself), holding important military, civic and economic positions, and the Achaemenid Persians, having spent centuries under Assyrian domination, were greatly influenced by Assyrian Art and Architecture, modelled their empire upon Assyrian lines, and saw themselves as the successors of the great Assyrian kings. Assyrians are still attested as being extant in the north west of the region during the Parthian Empire (160 BC-223 AD) and Sassanid Empire (224-650 AD), and throughout the Middle Ages, where the Bukhtishu family of physicians were held in great regard by the Persian kings."
"There were about 200,000 Assyrians in Iran at the time of the 1976 census. Many emigrated after the revolution in 1979, but at least 50,000 were estimated to be still in Iran in 1987."
"In 1900, Assyrians numbered over 76,000 in northwestern Iran, constituting over a quarter of the Azerbaijan province's population and were the largest non-Muslim majority in Urmia. Of the 300 villages around Urmia, 60 were exclusively Assyrians and 60 were mixed villages with Assyrian, Armenian, and Azeri communities. Nevertheless, there were over 115 documented Assyrian villages to the west of Lake Urmia prior to 1918."
"During the Assyrian Genocide, which took place in World War I, the Ottoman Army together with allied Kurdish, Azeri and Arab militias along the Iranian-Turkish and Iranian-Iraqi border carried out religiously and ethnically motivated massacres and deportations on unarmed Assyrian civilians (and Armenians) both in the mountains and on the rich plains, resulting in the death of at least 300,000 Assyrians. In 1914 alone, they attacked dozens of villages and drove off all the inhabitants of the district of Gawar. The Assyrians defended themselves and for a time successfully repelled further attacks under the leadership of Agha Petros, seizing control of much of the Urmia region and defeating Ottoman forces and their Kurdish, Arab and Azeri allies in the process. However lack of ammunition and supplies, due mainly to the withdrawal of Russia from the war, and the collapse of allied Armenian forces led to their downfall. Massively outnumbered, surrounded, undersupplied and cut off, the Assyrians suffered terrible massacres."
"By the summer of 1918 almost all surviving Assyrians had fled to Tehran or to existing Assyrian communities or refugee camps in Iraq such as Baqubah. Local Kurds, Arabs and Azeris took the opportunity of the last phases of World War I to rob Assyrian homes, murder civilians and leave those remaining destitute. The critical murder that sowed panic in the Assyrian community came when Kurdish militias, under Agha Ismail Simko, assassinated the Patriarch, Mar Benyamin Shimon XIX, on March 3, 1918, under the pretext of inviting him to negotiations, although the Assyrian leader Malik Khoshaba exacted revenge upon Simko by attacking and sacking his citadel, forcing the Kurdish leader to flee for his life."
"Most Assyrians in Iran are followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, with a minority of 3,900 following the Chaldean Catholic Church. Some also follow Protestant denominations such as the Assyrian Evangelical Church, Assyrian Pentecostal Church and possibly Russian Orthodoxy due to a Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Urmia during the 1900s."

= = = Doctor of Professional Studies = = =
"The Doctor of Professional Studies (or sometimes awarded as Doctorate in Professional Practice) (most commonly DProf, but also available as ProfD and DPS) is a doctoral degree for experienced professionals who wish to undertake a programme that is applied in nature and of practical value to their career. The DProf is based on applied research of real world problems. The DProf has been available to graduate students in the United Kingdom since the 1980s. The first Doctor of Professional Studies program was started in 1972 at Pace University. Although some consider the Doctor of Professional Studies to have similar academic standards and regulations as the PhD, it has a more practical focus."
"The first professional doctoral program was established in 1972 by Pace University in the State of New York in the United States. Other universities (see #List of Schools Offering Doctor of Professional Studies Degrees) around the world now offer the professional doctoral degree. Doctoral studies researchers, Gill and Hoppe, have reported rapid growth in professional doctoral degree programs outside of the United States."
"In the United Kingdom, professional doctoral degrees became established in the 1980s, when it was recognized that high-level programs were needed that were designed for experienced professional practitioners rather than for academic researchers. Many professional doctoral degrees in the United Kingdom are profession-specific and contain a mix of taught modules, research and a dissertation. Several universities that offer professional doctoral degree programs in the United Kingdom allow students to study part-time. In 2005, Powell and Long found that most professional doctoral degrees awarded in the UK were in the fields of engineering, educational and clinical psychology. They found that professional doctoral degrees in business and nursing were also emerging at that time. In 2010, Brown and Cooke reported an ""explosion"" of professional doctorate programs in fields such as the arts, architecture and computer science. In 2016, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) released a comprehensive study of professional doctorates which found substantial growth in these programs. Since 2012, the UK Council for Graduate Education (UKCGE) has sponsored a bi-annual conference devoted to the study of professional doctoral education and related programs."
"In the United States, the DPS was once considered by the United States Department of Education and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to be a research doctorate equivalent to the Ph.D. Along with the Doctor of Education, the Doctor of Social Science, the Doctor of Applied Science, and the Doctor of Library Science, the NSF no longer includes the DPS in its periodic Survey of Earned Doctorates (SEP) report, a statistical report on the number and range of research doctorates awarded in the United States. [See: https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/ and https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sed/2012/start.cfm, Appendix Table a1]. The DPS was dropped from the report in 2005. In New York State, the Doctor of Professional Studies is an official degree title applicable to doctoral programs with a professional focus in a variety of disciplines."
"In a 2002 report, the Australian Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST), states ""Doctoral education in Australia is currently under pressure to become more industry focused."" Citing this report, Fink suggests ""professional doctorates may be able to fulfill [the need to make doctoral education more industry focused] by developing and sustaining close collaboration between universities and industry. The Professional Doctorate (ProfDoc) can be seen as an alternative to the PhD because it can provide an opportunity for the business professional to gain a doctoral qualification, albeit in a different mode."""
"In some respects the DProf is closer to the PhD than the longer-established modular doctorates, although it has important differences. While PhD theses typically make an original contribution to knowledge, the DProf is more concerned with making a significant contribution to practice: it requires high-level practical action, resulting for instance in significant change or development in an organization or community of practice. At some institutions, the DProf project is not a purely academic study and may not have to be a research project in the conventional sense. But, the dissertation must make a substantial contribution to the field and be reflective of advanced thinking. In this regard, the effort require to complete a Doctor of Professional Studies degree is at least equivalent to that required for a PhD."
"Specific degree characteristics vary by country and institution. In 2011, the UK's Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education published an overview of degree characteristics for all doctoral level degrees."

"Fremantle entered the Confederacy through the Mexican town of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, on 2 April on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS ""Immortalité"" to avoid being in violation of the Union blockade, and crossed the Rio Grande into Brownsville, Texas. Within three hours of his arrival in the Confederacy, Fremantle encountered 'frontier justice' for the first time, finding the body of a renegade, known as Montgomery, half-buried and stripped of flesh at the roadside. Spending almost two weeks in Brownsville, with occasional visits across the border to Matamoros and the village of Bagdad, Fremantle became acquainted with General Hamilton P. Bee and several merchants and diplomats who were facilitating the trade of cotton across the border with Mexico. Part of the reasoning for Fremantle's tenure in Brownsville may have been that he wished to meet General John B. Magruder, for whom he had a letter of introduction. However, Magruder was delayed, and Fremantle left Brownsville on 13 April in a carriage in the company of some of his merchant friends. Their driver and his assistant, Mr Sargeant and Judge Hyde, are particularly memorable figures from Fremantle's diary, in no small part due to Fremantle's astonishment that a member of the justiciary should be working on a stagecoach. Later, General Longstreet would recall meeting the same two men during his own service in Texas."
"After finally meeting with General Magruder shortly after leaving Brownsville, Fremantle continued his journey across the Texan desert, dutifully recording in his diary his observations about the taste of polecat, the snuff habits of Texan women, and allusions to the coarse language of his drivers and travelling companions. He finally arrived in San Antonio, Texas, on 24 April, where he sold most of his luggage, and from there travelled to Houston, Texas, where he arrived on 30 April. Here, he dined with General William Read Scurry, and observed that those Confederate officers he encountered were extremely complimentary about Great Britain and the Queen, even proposing toasts to her health and to the Empire. Fremantle now proceeded with haste across the remaining Texan countryside, as rumours concerning the fate of Alexandria, Louisiana began to reach him. Furthermore, the continuing siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, was another source of anxiety, as the capture of the city would make passage across the Mississippi River practically impossible."
"Setting off for Galveston, Texas, on 2 May, Fremantle found himself meeting Sam Houston, the father of Texan independence, though he found the elder statesman to be vain and egotistical, as well as bitter and uncouth in his mannerisms. This occurred less than three months before Houston's death, presumably making Fremantle one of the last foreign visitors to meet the general. The English observer finally left Texas on 8 May, arriving in Shreveport, Louisiana, and partaking of the hospitality of General Edmund Kirby Smith and his wife."
"On the advice of General Kirby Smith, Fremantle made his way to Monroe, Louisiana, to attempt to cross the river from there due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of Alexandria. By the morning of 10 May, the day Fremantle's stagecoach arrived at its destination, travellers began to report that the city had fallen. In Monroe itself, Fremantle learned of the Confederate victory at Chancellorsville, although the news was accepted by locals without excitement. The wounding of Stonewall Jackson, however, caused some distress. The high expectations of Southerners, and their contempt for their enemies, would be among the few major points of criticism made by Fremantle. After considerable anxiety on board a steamer on the Mississippi, Fremantle finally crossed the river and arrived in Natchez, Mississippi, on 15 May."
"From Natchez, Fremantle travelled to Jackson, which he reached on 18 May. As the city had been evacuated and attacked only a few days earlier, Fremantle was treated with some suspicion by soldiers and locals, who expressed scepticism that an English officer should be travelling alone through the South. One local, the gun-toting Mr Smythe, even went so far as to threaten the foreign visitor with execution should he be unable to prove his identity and credentials. Upon 'examination' by a mob in a hotel, Fremantle finally convinced a Confederate cavalry officer and an Irish doctor of his legitimacy, and was spirited away to meet General Joseph E. Johnston, who accepted the peculiar traveller into his company. Fremantle remained near Johnston for several days, learning of the death of General Jackson from his Chancellorsville wound."
"Fremantle's next stop was at Mobile, Alabama, which he reached on 25 May after an eventful journey by train, in which a railway engineer shot a passenger. After inspecting the defences of the city with General Dabney H. Maury, Fremantle briefly visited Montgomery, the former capital of the Confederate States, before arriving in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on 28 May. Here, Fremantle met yet more prominent figures, including Generals William J. Hardee and Leonidas Polk, and Clement Vallandigham, the leader of the Copperheads. Later, Fremantle also encountered Braxton Bragg, who supplied the Englishman with letters of introduction and passes, allowing him to travel to Shelbyville, which he reached the following day. Fremantle remained here until 5 June, inspecting troops in the company of General Hardee, his fellow Englishman Colonel George St. Leger Grenfell and the Irish-born General Patrick Cleburne. He also witnessed the baptism of General Bragg, and a small skirmish between Federal and Confederate forces outside the town, before leaving for Charleston the following day."
"Increasingly, Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle became possessed of a desire to get to the Confederate capital, Richmond, and from there attempt to locate the Army of Northern Virginia, with whom he intended to journey for a while. From Tennessee, he travelled through Augusta and Atlanta, before arriving in Charleston, South Carolina, the birthplace of the war, on 8 June. The English tourist was keen to inspect the defences of the city, and remained there until 15 June, inspecting Fort Sumter and visiting Morris Island in the company of General Roswell S. Ripley, commander of South Carolina's First Military District. During this stay, Fremantle also met General PGT Beauregard, and a member of Captain Raphael Semmes' crew from the CSS ""Sumter"", whom Fremantle had first met in Gibraltar in 1862."
"En route to Richmond, Fremantle passed through Wilmington, North Carolina, and Petersburg, Virginia, before arriving in the Confederate capital two days after leaving Charleston. On the day of his arrival, he was granted a meeting with Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin. During the audience, Benjamin assured Fremantle that British diplomatic recognition of the C.S.A. would terminate the war without more bloodshed, though the British officer was concerned about a possible Union invasion of Canada. Benjamin also complained to his guest about revelations about his gambling habits made by the former correspondent of ""The Times"", William Howard Russell. Benjamin then took Fremantle to see President Jefferson Davis, with whom he spoke for an hour. From Fremantle's account, it is possible to conclude that the Confederate leaders may have been trying to impress their British visitor on the matter of diplomatic intervention, without real consideration of his lack of power to do so."
"Intent on finding Lee's army at the earliest opportunity, Fremantle visited the Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon on 18 June, where he was furnished with letters of introduction to Generals Lee and Longstreet. Leaving Richmond two days later, Fremantle came upon the division of General William Dorsey Pender on 21 June, and reached Lee's headquarters at Berryville a day later."
"Here, Fremantle met the individuals who would be his companions for the next two weeks. Among them were Francis Lawley, the ""Times"" correspondent who had replaced Russell, Captain Fitzgerald Ross, an Austrian cavalry officer, and Captain Justus Scheibert, a Prussian army engineer who had been sent to inspect Confederate fortifications by his government. The accounts of these four men present the most enlightening accounts written by foreigners of the Campaign and Battle of Gettysburg."
"Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle introduced himself to General Longstreet on 27 June, a crucial meeting since it allowed Fremantle to observe the advance through Maryland and Pennsylvania in close quarters to the General and his staff. As well as the other foreign observers, Fremantle also became well acquainted with some of Longstreet's staff officers, including Gilbert Moxley Sorrel, Thomas Goree, and the medical staff, Doctors Cullen and Maury. As a neutral observer, Fremantle was allowed to enter the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, which was off-limits to most soldiers and officers on the orders of General Lee."
"On 30 June, Fremantle met the famous commander of the Army of Northern Virginia for the first time, and learned from Longstreet that General George Meade had replaced Joseph Hooker as commander of the Army of the Potomac. In the camp, Fremantle spoke to the staff officers about the likelihood of battle in the near future. The next day, the sound of artillery fire alerted the English visitor that the two armies had indeed met each other. According to Fremantle's diary, a spy, presumably Henry Thomas Harrison, informed the company that there was a significant concentration of Union troops around Gettysburg. Whilst talking to Union prisoners, Fremantle met General Ambrose Powell Hill, who complained of being ill. Later in the evening, when the Union forces had reformed on Cemetery Ridge, Fremantle climbed a tree to observe the last of the fighting, before consulting with Longstreet again about the following day's action."
"On 2 July, the four foreign observers returned to the battlefield at 5 am, in time to witness a meeting between Generals Lee, Longstreet, Hill, John Bell Hood and Henry Heth. Once more, Fremantle climbed his tree to see what was happening, this time in the company of Captain Scheibert. After touring the Confederate lines, Fremantle returned to that position at about 2 pm on the advice of General Longstreet, but was frustrated that the attack did not take place until well after 4 pm. For the first time, the Englishman heard the 'Rebel Yell', as well as a Confederate band playing polkas and waltzes above the din of battle. That evening, news reached the observers of the wounding of General Hood, as well as the death of General William Barksdale."
"On the morning of 3 July, Captain Ross and Colonel Fremantle made an inspection of the town of Gettysburg itself, intending to get to the cupola of the seminary, which had been used by General John Buford as a vantage point two days earlier. The commencement of the Union bombardment stopped the two observers, and so they returned to Longstreet's headquarters early in the afternoon. Fremantle alone found the General sitting on a small fence. Thinking that the battle was just getting under way, Fremantle commented to Longstreet that he 'wouldn't have missed this for anything'. Longstreet wryly pointed out to his guest that the attack had already happened, and had been repulsed. Longstreet asked if Fremantle had anything to drink, at which the Englishman made a gift to the general of his silver hip flask."
"Coming upon Lee, Fremantle found him rallying the defeated troops, reassuring them and trying to rally them ahead of an anticipated Union counterattack. The Union counterattack did not come, however, and Fremantle retreated along with the rest of the Confederate Army on the night of 4 July. As the army fell back into Maryland, Fremantle met Jeb Stuart, the cavalry commander whose absence during the preceding battle cost Lee valuable intelligence. On 7 July, Fremantle took his leave of Longstreet and his staff, intending to cross the Union lines and make his way to New York City. A parting remark made by Major Latrobe did little to reassure him: 'You may take your oath he'll be caught for a spy'. Longstreet was more confident of Fremantle's abilities, informing his aide that, since Fremantle had managed to travel across lawless areas of Texas, crossing the Union lines would cause him little difficulty."
"Two days later, in Hagerstown, Fremantle left Lawley and Ross, and made his way towards the Union Army. Despite initial suspicion, Fremantle convinced General Benjamin Franklin Kelley that he was no spy, even showing the officer a pass from General Lee verifying Fremantle's neutral status."
"His passage having been secured, Fremantle arrived by train in New York City on the night of 12 July, booking into the Fifth Avenue Hotel."
"The following day, Fremantle went out for a walk along Broadway. Upon his return to the hotel, he found that shopkeepers were closing their shutters early, and then noticed that several buildings were ablaze. Fire engines were present, but the crowd was not permitting them to be used. Increasingly alarmed, Fremantle saw a black youth pursued by the mob, eventually finding refuge with a company of soldiers, to the disgust of the massed protestors. Bewildered, the Englishman asked a bystander why the crowds were so vehement in their hatred of blacks. In response, he was told that they were 'the innocent cause of all these troubles'."
"In fact, the New York City draft riots ( 13–16 July 1863), the most violent insurrection in the history of the US had begun, and were eventually to evolve into an anti-black pogrom. A day later, Fremantle noted that the activities of the mob were worsening, with battles between police and rioters now taking place in the streets. An English captain reported that the mob had forced their way onto his ship and beaten his black crew members, forcing a French warship to threaten violence against any attacks against foreign vessels."
"On 15 July, amidst the violence and terror gripping large parts of the city, Fremantle boarded the SS ""China"", and began his voyage back to Britain."
"Upon returning to England, the young Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle found himself being questioned by friends and colleagues on the truth of the situation in the Confederate States, as only Union newspapers were readily available in England. Suitably encouraged, Fremantle wrote a book on his experiences in America, ""Three Months in the Southern States"", based on the diary which he kept throughout his sojourn in the South. Published in 1864, the book was well-received both in Great Britain and in the Union, and it was even printed in Mobile by S.H. Goetzel & Co., being eagerly read even by the beleaguered Southerners, who wanted to see how their struggle was being reported by a foreign visitor."
"Fremantle married shortly after his return to Great Britain, and served with his regiment until 1880, when he was placed on half pay after 28 years of service without seeing any active duty. The following year, however, he was promoted to the rank of major general and assigned as aide-de-camp to Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, commander-in-chief of the British Army."
"The United Kingdom was upset by the disasters suffered by the Anglo-Egyptian forces contending with the Mahdist army in the Sudan (Battle of El Obeid; 1st Battle of El Teb). Fremantle was sent to the Sudan, temporarily serving as garrison commander at the port of Suakin."
Fremantle followed General Graham in his inland raid when he intended to crush the Mahdist Osman Digna. Fremantle was in command of the Brigade of Guards and as such took part in the harsh Battle of Tamai.
"After the fall of Khartoum and the departure of the British from the Sudan, Fremantle stayed for a brief time in Cairo, then returned to England in 1886, serving in the War Office as Deputy Adjutant-General for Militia, Yeomanry and volunteers. In February 1893 he became Commander-in-Chief, Scotland, a post he held for less than a year."
"He ended his career on a high note by being appointed to the office of Governor of Malta in January 1894. During his time on the island, Fremantle became a popular governor, presiding over political decisions such as the matter of mixed and non-Catholic marriages, and the issue of the payment of reparations to the Maltese ecclesiastical authorities from the Napoleonic Wars. In 1897, Fremantle renamed the line of fortifications that was under construction the Victoria Lines to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In November 1898, he hosted a visit to the island by the German Emperor, Kaiser William II, who arrived in Valletta on board his personal yacht, the ""Hohenzollern"", upon which Governor Fremantle joined the Kaiser for dinner."
"In 1899, after his term in office ended, Lieutenant-General Arthur Fremantle returned to England. Fremantle was appointed a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John on 7 March 1900."
"A member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, General Fremantle died at the age of 65 in the Squadron's headquarters in Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight from complications of asthma on 25 September 1901. On the centenary of his funeral, a ceremony marking the restoration of his grave in Woodvale Cemetery, near Brighton, was conducted by his descendants and by Civil War re-enactors from the United States."
"Although the book was a best-seller at the time, the ultimate failure of the Confederacy to win its independence led to a sharp decrease in Britain in the appetite for Civil War diaries after 1865, including Fremantle's diary. In 1952, however, historian Walter Lord published a revised edition of ""Three Months in the Southern States"", retitled ""The Fremantle Diary"", which featured an introduction by the editor and detailed references."
"Part of the reason for the enduring fame of Fremantle compared to his fellow observers may be his role in Civil War literature and film, thanks to the success of Michael Shaara's historical novel, ""The Killer Angels"". The novel, published in 1974, deals with the events of the Battle of Gettysburg and the effects of the engagement on some of the main protagonists, including Generals Longstreet and Lee, as well as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and General John Buford. Shaara's primary source material for researching the novel included the diaries, letters and correspondence of figures who were either involved in or present at the Battle."
"In the 1993 film adaptation of Shaara's novel, retitled ""Gettysburg"", Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle is portrayed by James Lancaster. His character changes little from the book, once again engaging in important discussions with General Longstreet and his officers on the Confederacy's relations with the United Kingdom. However his appearance is substantially different from reality: in the movie he is shown in a scarlet British uniform sipping tea from a china cup, whereas, being in an unofficial capacity, he was dressed in a ""gray shooting-jacket"" and had been living rough like many others in the country."
"Since 1993, Fremantle has been portrayed in historical re-enactments in the United States by Roger Hughes, who also led the efforts to have Fremantle's grave in Brighton restored in 2001. Hughes maintains a website providing considerable information on Fremantle, his family, his travels and Civil War re-enactments."
