We will go round this way or round that way?
Cor look at that bas oh no it's fine
She ain't got that problem yet.
You wait till
No.
She's probably saying oh this is so boring this conversation but when she gets to our age that'll be the same.
Well  well she'll just she'll just go silver.
She was silver when she was little so  I suppose she'll go back to silver.
Anything else you want to look at Dinda?

Hello love.
We'll grab this casserole because  erm
Hopefully I won't

What's that?
I have never been in there.
You was.
"Me and, you and I was in there on  don't know when, years ago."
Dianne told me the score so  anyway you're like a friend  can go with you.
You're driving.
Ah?
"So in a way, like someone can go with you and all if you want."
Can they?
"Well, look!"
I don't think so Helen.
"I mean, they've dropped that wee girl on her own."
"No, well because I've seen it before."
You think I would do it.
"That wee girl over there, she's riding it."
"They must take two like, you know, that one round the bend there they have bars on."
"Well, well there's arm one you go for, you'll have to."
I don't see how you would learn very much.
No .
"Your first couple of lessons are half an hour take you driving anyway, and by the time you get up there you'd drive onto them."
.
"And, if you haven't been in a car before the driver drives, so you can give me what you owe."
.
Which one's Paul's ?
What?
Ooh!
"Right, we're going in there."
This is good!
Good !
It's Sly.
It is.
Sly?
Regulars .
They can count.
Yeah.
No they can probably see down the end and they
"Well these lights used to be quite easy, didn't mind being stopped by them."
Now you're petrified of being stopped by any of them cos you know it's
Yeah.
really long wait.
When are they gonna bring those towers down?
Don't know.
Which way would they tumble them?
"I don't think they're in any rush to develop now, are they cos this housing business is so poor."
whoever's got the land has decided
are they boarded off.
You can't go up there any more?
No.
That is so naff isn't it?
Putting your scarf across the car like that.
I know.
What's it say.
Crystal Palace.
Least it says Crystal Palace.
Right.
"Who shall we, who shall we get"
What?
as a replacement for somebody.
Who is there?
Who would you like?
If we had all the money.
Buy Ian Wright back I suppose.
No.
I'd sell Bright.
"Here, that one?"
Yeah.
There's lizards on all of them.
They get in your bed don't they?
Ooh.
Never got one in mine.
Lizards
When we went down the south of France we saw lizards like that on the walls.
They moved ever so quick
Yeah these do.
Yeah.
This is Tony's cellar.
Oh.
"No it's, it's literally chopped out of rock."
You can see all the steps are all
Yeah.
stone.
It's all chopped  it's like a cave.
"You go down and then  you walk along here, right to the end  right round, sort of round the bend there"
Yeah.
and there's a well.
He's got a well.
"And this is really deep ain't it Tone, this bit?"
That's about forty foot down
This is about forty foot down and then it drops again
Oh.
"into a well, where he gets his all, his fresh water from it."
"There's a li he puts a light on and it lights it up down the , a long way down."
But it never ever alters.
"You can draw water out, you can put water in, and the level never ever changes."
Wonderful water.
"It's really nice, ain't it Tone?"
Right.
But they're Portakabins?
"Yeah, rather than caravans."
Yeah.
Now I don't think they sound very   to suit our needs.
Well you have to furnish them as well don't you?
Well that's it.
"And there's all separate, two pound a table  from fifty pence to one pound fifty for a chair."
There's no toilet in them
And you probably have to hire them by the week do you?
Er minimum of four weeks.
Yeah.
And how do you move them around?
"Well they would move them round  this fella himself, but it's gonna be a hell of a lot of money to get them to do that."
Mm that's what I would have thought.
Plus there's no toilet.
Exactly.
But he has a separate toilet.
Well that's all gonna be extra as well.
Mm.
And erm
So how much you talking about?
For a twelve foot one
Well you're talking
twenty two pounds?
Yeah.
So you're talking about eighty eight quid?
Yeah.
It would be cheaper to get David .
Yeah well I've spoke to David .
He's quite willing to take the caravan out there.
Erm  and then you've got the toilet on there.
No.
Definitely?
Well I'll have to check it out first.
"Why don't you just go in, sign on and then go out again?"
I know it sounds quite tempting.
Oh excuse me.
"Oh you're a fat bastard  oh you're a fat bastard  oh you're a fat bastard, oh you fat bastard"
"It's just play playing it without using, without strumming the strings."
Can you do it?
Can you do it?
The left hand   have you got a minute?
Which hand's left and which hand's right?
That's right.
That's right.

But like I  fits in quite well.

Well he'll be pissed off  all over it with football boots on.
How soon?

She wouldn't leave by there
No
No
"Well she don't want to leave, I think it's a silly thing to leave it"

"he said we see, I we're gonna have them"
"We see , we see, have them"
You can't take your money with you.
You can't
"But it's something, something in you, you have to rush don't they?"
Why won't they wait?
Why should they?
Why should they?
"No, why should they?"
I have
Take the rest of it
pleasure spending
"No why, they've got lives of their own"
Well
"let them live it, don't want saving for the children, no, they don't want nothing"
Well
They've had far more than what we've ever had
"Yes, you're right there, yes"

"Yes, yes"
"This  very busy road, isn't it?"
I suppose so.

So does the other way.
Yeah.
Because of mum.

Suddenly it clears  this bit.
What you're memory?
No this road.
"Oh, this road."
Why?
Dunno some go off that way
"I mean, let, some people go up go off where?"
Where is it leading to?
Don't know.
I don't really know.
"What's all this, why does Meltis always have that stand of eighty, eighty years?"
Good.
it needs is it needs us to have an input with their project manager to evaluate them.
That's right.
A and the forms as it stands picks up most of the points that we've just raised.
Does it have a box for us to put our costs in?
Oh yeah.
It starts off with that.
Thank god for that
"Th they're, they're, they're not our costs Terry."
They're his costs.
Yeah.
Mm.
I mean we charge him.
Correct.
He's the one that
No.
But
Correct.
Why?
"And we can tell him how, how much we're gonna charge him but it's up to him or whatever."
"I mean quite clearly with something like this, when we start using it, it's gonna throw up all sorts of"
Yeah.
problems.
Mm.
"We have, we have had that form kicking around for quite a long time and it's never really been"
Right.
It's easier for
Well now is the time for everyone to be aware of it.
That's right.
We're now proceeding
Brendan and Joyce did a twenty five page memo.
Mm.

Dad had said he'd pay for it on Access.
Think you'd give him the money.

"That must of been where, that must be where we got ."
We've got the fifty pound computer.
We didn't have to pay for that.
Who's done that?
"No one,I can keep that,."
What?
We bought  a fifty pound computer and said to Kevin you can keep it.
.
Yeah and I paid ten pounds.
I put that down on his Christmas list.
"I'll draw it in a suit, clothes."
"Yeah, but you won't be getting much  because you've had lots."

Where are they going to?
"I don't know, they're loa , looks like they're loading them in, they're putting them in the gar the school."
Has that school closed now?
I think perhaps it has.
I went there for a week.
"Yeah, I think it's closed."
Didn't I?
"I was in the fourth year, the top year ."
"Were they nice to you there, the teachers?"
I mean there weren't very many teachers anyway were there?
How many were there?
Dunno.
Three or four.
Four?
Three or four?
Don't know.
Can't remember.
on the computer most of the time.
And I took part in some of their tests.
I got better results than some of the actual  fifteen year olds.
That'll be quite good about your maths test won't it?
"Cos you'll be, you're doing it again with, like that aren't you?"
Your maths
you're taking class nine
Yeah.
you could get better than them.
Yeah.
"Virtually every year the eighth, eighth year always does get better than the ninth year."
Look  that house is really old.
Look it's got the plaque on it.

Are you gonna go in to erm  Walton End or are you
Yes.

Don't back up will you else you'll slice my head off.
Well what's so funny about mum having her head sliced off?
He just did.
. He just backed up.
He did?
Perhaps he used his wing mirror.
Like I do.
That's a quite nice little  place there.
And you don't pay over the odds prices because it's not an expensive place to  have your shop.
Oh.
That's good.
You go to these big stores and they pay so much in heating and lighting and staff .
This er pavement's quite nice  .
Isn't it attractively done?
Done like parquet.
Don't know who's paying for it all  whether  council is  or what?
So do you want to go over there first?
It's up to you.
What do you want to do?
I don't mind a bit.
"Well we've got fifteen minutes, well thirteen minutes."
Beautiful cakes.
Fruit crumble.
"all the, read all the instructions."
The same with the video camera.
You haven't even watched the tape
When have had an opportunity to watch the tape?
"Oh, you must have been able to squeeze half an hour some time or other."
"Anyway, I'm going to get ready or we'll never get the shopping done before you go to work."
Anyway
"Right, I'm ready."
Have you locked the back door?
I thought we were walking.
Are we not?
Ok.
Pardon?
I thought we were walking
"Well, do you want to walk or do you want to go in the car?"
Well I have to go to the paper shop
Well I'll drop you at the paper shop while I go round
"Oh, that's a good idea  I hope we can get out at the ."
"Have you stuck a poster , you haven't, in the back window"
"No, I haven't"
I think more people see the back coming up that way than they do the front window
Yes
but I'll stick one in the back as well
Hope I've got my glasses with me or I can't see the prices.
"Oh, I haven't got my purse."
Oh brilliant.
Is that a squashed ball in the road?
That means I haven't got a key to get back in the house .
If you just stop here I'll run over the road.
Give me the key please.
Thanks.
Oh
Yellow flag coming out of his aerial.
Oh where would you prefer your ae aerial?
Would you like it there  up there or at the back?
Up there's alright.
"I like it the way the ones that you can  close each time, now I'm sure my aerial will last longer."
Cos you can
What do you mean close.
Well it compacts.
Oh yeah.
"The ones that stick out all the time, they  I suppose that is good."
"If you have one that doesn't compact, you you're best to have one in the middle cos it's less likely to get pranged there isn't it?"
Yeah.
Here like walkers by can bend it and  Oh look.
Here's my next one.
Six.
I've let six go now.
You must have let someone go before now.
"I didn't, no I haven't."
No.
Haven't had the opportunity to.
What is this lady dressed up like?
What has she got on  ?
What has she got on her hair?
Weird.
Bunch of wool .
She'll be thinking where's that wool?
Oh it's on my head.
Look at those tiny rugby posts.
"Yeah, I don't know why they do that, I was gonna ask that, why they chop those off, look like they've been vandalized don't they?"
Yeah.
It's only for junior rugby though.
They haven't replaced that garage have they?
So you got .
"Oh no you do , you  no, no!"
Well yes.
"Well  no, no, no."
You play    four on the team  the four on the team play a go right?
"Then, whichever played a one  that game  go away again."
Yeah.
So you've got the same ?
!
"Yes, alright then."
"Then you play, you play yo you play four singles  four singles, four singles and two doubles."
I was thinking you played .
"I mean they go away, I mean  the six always played at the back."
but everybody else is.
"Brian was saying, he said  you going in with your   he said and we'll lose that , he said he should play his best bloody"
Well yeah.
six you've got!
But darts don't work like that .
If you're going to win you gotta play you're best six .
That's right.
That's right.
"You've got to, but  then again, you know"
Unless you're not bothered.
"Unless, unless, unless, unless you won and then you get best ."
"Well no, you ge if you won and give the rest a game."
See we're not bothered.
"We're, we're, I mean we're not  we're not that bothered  really  ."
"Yeah, but no  could we?"
I mean
"Well we could, we could help you"
"I mean we want, we want  well, to tell you truth, we shall won on that, we won on that occasion."
"I put on, I put on my best two doubles haven't I?"
Mm.
And she said that everything was mouldy  in er  you know the  even the curtains were mildew!
And how did she put salt round?
Because this is a hell of a lot damper today  than what it was when I had the salt about you.
you  but er  some people
Course not!
Yes.
Well I'd never heard of salt being put down before!
"But she  yes, she told me that in all, in the shop."
In the reception.
"She said, put it"
"Yeah, well"
down.
"yeah, these might tell you but  I always heard that salt was damp!"
Yeah but it attracts the
The
water in
the
"the air, into the salt!"
"and of course, once it's in the salt, it's steams!"
Well it's only now it feels like this!
It was not like this when we were down here washing it.
Well that's common sense when you think about it isn't it?
"You put, you put a drop of water on it  you put er  a bowl of salt  and  that will go down  eventually!"
Mm.
If the air is damp.
It's collected the water .
"Once that's damp, that's rising the steam!"
So how else do you keep it dry?
"She said, straight to me now!"
"I said that caravan is soaking wet, I said!"
The mattresses!
And that's how you know whether you're  or not.
But you've also got your option of calories.
Right?
Which you are allowed
"Yeah, we could have done without all this bloody hassle down there."
Yeah.
You know?
Do the whole bloody place up.
Mm.
Mind you the firm that was in there Blue Bag I mean they abused the bloody place they did.
Aye.
They knocked it about something terrible.
Yeah.
"So I mean  sooner or later  would have been had to  to do, do up you know?"
Mm.
"And these people decide whether they want the place, and the ideal place for them."
Whether they want so
Er fourteen to twenty one.
That's what it is.
It's fourteen to twenty one.
What's that.
Mm.
Eh?
Opt er optional calories  .
"Well there ain't much that'd be fourteen to twenty, twenty calories is there?"
No.
You've got fourteen er fourteen options.
You need to be a mathematician to sort this bugger out.
You don't really
Thing is to do .
it's quite easy actually.
"This is a job if I don't lose it, feeding my dog beans one at a time."
fewer localities now.
This will be shorter.
I think we can easily put erm pits for daily life or how to be environmental.
And then
Oh a few tips.
Oh
With respect I really think it ought to be recycling and nothing else.
Mm.
"Well I just find these, I mean we had quite a few  now"
Cos recycling sort of comes into the tips for daily life as well though doesn't it.
It's part of it.
Like protecting  people don't just save bottles they save their glass jars
seem to be patronizing people when really you just want to give information.
as well.
People don't always think of.
Yeah.
"Re-using things, re-using things is almost the same  as recycling isn't it?"
Re-use?
Yes.
Yeah!
I suppose it's I mean
Well it is really isn't it?
re-using is better than recycling.
Yeah.
Erm.
So.
Erm I take
So it
"Reduce or re-use, recycling?"
Has anybody got a con
punchlines are much better than sort of er  .
Because people'll read those.
Closed!
Well
"Yeah but I'm, I I know I don't"
Well some of them certainly
And they closed one the other week that's flooded now
will definitely
so that's
Yeah.
I don't think that this
"They, they won't they they wouldn't"
can't rescind that!
they wouldn't bring
But I
money on the mining
And that goes for a lot of businesses!
"I mean, there's enough coal  in the United Kingdom to last for another two hundred years!"
Yeah!
"And that could possibly be the only, and ah  I mean it's it's a"
Ah but
"it's a dirty fuel to use at the moment but they're all, there are means being developed even now on"
Well I've no doubt in twenty
I mean
years time the tories will re-open them
much  it's it's far
at at great cost to us!
Ah but you see
Nothing to stop them!
that  it's
Well
very short sighted to get rid of that now!
"I mean, we're buying coal which is subsidised abroad  so therefore it's cheaper for us to buy it  and bring it in, but what happens when all, all our home supplies have dried up"
I know  I know
Cos a lot of stuff isn't in.
They could be put a manager in and   the benefits.
I suppose they would.
Mm.
Perhaps they do.
And then there's staff there to run it.
I dunno.
"Well the man with the bike, that's his business."
"And the ma and the people then with clothes last year, who were they now?"
To the shop?
Was M was Mark's caravan warm?
"Well he didn't have a fire on, nothing."
He was just lying there watching telly and reading the paper and
Did he have a paper?
Mm.
"Should have brought it back, did you?"
No.
He bought the Saturday one that's got the week  part in it.
Why didn't he come over and fetch the car then?
"Because he said there's no point, I don't want it."
"Well I've got to take his over now, he'll have to bring me back."
Yeah.
"What I was going to tell him, if he was to come over, take my car there  when I'd have taken this car over, I would have had a car to come back."
Well that's what he said.
He said you'd better keep the car there in case his won't be ready or something.
Mm.
Lot of kids about though.
In another couple of weeks  spring then.
Would if the weather would take up.
But still they book regardless of weather don't they?
Mm.
Mm.
I mean you can't compare it can you?
And the bedrooms!
"You can't compare it, it's the rolls royce of caravans."
"That's, that Darren said oh aye, he's the one, he's in the maroon one he said."
He's in the rolls royce.
Top of the range he said.
Beautiful thing.
Good god there's a mirror in the sitting room as big as that wall.
You'll see it when you go over there.
Beautiful thing.
"Yes,"
And I said I've bought a box of matches for him to go down and light this fire  thinking you know he might need two or three matches at a time.
But er  well I gave him a box of matches to go with him and I thought oh well  he'll have plenty of matches then.
"And I took them in, he says  what do you buy them for?"
He said.
I've got loads of matches.
In this caravan everything's electronic.
"Fridge, light switches ooh  beautiful thing it is."
Ten times the price of ours I expect.
"A caravan is a caravan after all, isn't it?"
But for what we want it for  ours is good enough.
Good enough.
That's what I'm saying perhaps  they must let it out though.
If we were having
Why's Malcolm got it?
"if we were having a caravan like that, I'd be too frightened to let it."
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't
Well there we are.
let it.
There we are.
I couldn't afford to pay for it then could I?
It hasn't actually happened.
Yes.
"You're, you're implementing a procedure here that doesn't exist, is what Jim's saying."
You're implementing a procedure
Within B E S.
which says you're gonna do this
Right?
Sorry.
Sorry.
No.
It doesn't say that.
This procedure should say you do this.
That's what we're doing at the moment.
Right.
he's quite right in saying
book is an instruction.
Yeah.
And Jim's
"quite right in saying, it does not happen."
But it's not the first time that a procedure's
Finished.
come out early.
So you've implemented a procedure for wh which you haven't set up you haven't even looked at the resource information
but can be briefed
We are introducing a procedure.
Yes.
And in order to c come in and say
like that?
No.
why don't you do this?
"And I could say well I, I've never done this."
"I can't do this, and Q S is not geared up to do it."
"It'll be awkward getting cars in and out, when you know, with one more to be out and, all these cars in road, like, but."
That's the only difficulty.
"You'll probably end up say, leaving one on road all night."
Yeah.
"Don't hurt  I mean,"
"Oh, not leaving one on bloody road"
"Well, we could put 'em at night time, it's just through time, if one backs in, comes in behind other."
Yeah.
"It's a one way street and all ain't it, that makes it worse."
Why does it make it worse?
"Well, we don't have to have a problem, do we?"
"No, but I mean."
"It's like barbed wire, I mean that's, Sasha come in 'ere."
"What backs onto that bungalow, Karen."
Another 'ouse.
Another 'ouse.
Another 'ouse.
"Er, I told you what backs onto it, you know the right small on , what you were going to see that time, but on the side."
Yeah.
"We went to see that,"
Oh.
That's what backs onto it.
Oh.
"well, at least they won't be looking int' bungalow will they, with it all being down,"
No.
and that.
"Yeah, that's straight behind it."
Oh.
"Not like them, I mean, they can see straight into our"
"I'm not sure, but I think it was Mr  that had that bungalow built."
You know Mr
Yeah.
that's alright.
Yeah.
Plus.
"I wish I was doing more hours, though really, cos like, I got to take the whole day for it,"
Yeah
I might as well
"might as well be there, till later, yeah, I know what you mean."
"I mean, just for three hours."
Do they give you anything to eat there?
No.
"they don't seem to give you any, you seem to have as much tea and coffee as you want, or soda water."
Lemonade.
Lemonade.
Or lemonade
Really?
"It's all on draught so er, they have stocks and that."
"But I mean, my dad always invites his staff to have a drink at the end of the evening and I mean, most of them have already been bought a drink during the course of the evening, anyway, so they're entitled to it."
"But erm,."
"So er, I think, I think like, it depends who you're working with as well."
"Think like, some of them, take"
Yeah.
sort of
"Yeah, there."
"What ones can I take then, Rebecca?"
"Oh,well, let me have a look."
"I don't think you'll find anything in that, you can have that."
What's it for?
"They call it word book, and every week,"
Yeah.
"it's a scrapbook, some, some of them went, what do you mean a scrapbook, and he was really offended."
Really?
"No, not a scrapbook ."
Ooh hell!
No not really
Er
just a bit of cheese  and a bit of  pate.
"You know it seems it awful really that two of those places were   aren't they?all these, all the forest"
Oh God!
fern and
Thanks er
"I mean if somebody did grow a tree  I mean, it must be harder in that kind of area but  but wi with the right will for people  to plant a tree and grow it  it's just as easy"
Ahhh.
as chopping it down!
"Well, you know, I mean with"
Up.
correct management they should be able to  profit from the forests  you know a as well replenish them.
"And so unfortunately, it's the short term that's all they think about!"
"Ah,it's not."
At the end of the day it's just greed and profit to gain
If you want a decent tree to grow
and sod tomorrow!
If you want decent trees it takes a long time to grow them!
"Well the hardwoods, yeah."
"Yeah,"
Mm.
I mean they don't grow overnight do
Yeah.
"But even so, I mean  even that can be managed."
Course it can.
At the moment they just
What is this Ken?
That's  German smoked.
You don't have to light it!
It's rather nice that!
"But she said they tell you that and she said they tell you, it's on computer she said, but animals do go in the vans."
"Well I can tell you one thing, animals will not go into ours."
And I tell you she's got a different contract with me altogether.
"You read our contract didn't you, last night?"
It's there in black and white.
"Mm I know, that's what she said."
I don't how she knows.
"If I, if if I found out there was animals in our caravan, I'd take them to town."
But how do you know if you're not there every second?
"You  you for one, like her, when you went to the caravan, you'd smell it like that."
Oh I .
But you'd smell it wouldn't you?
Mm.
And they know this.
"Cos there are dogs there, great big ones."
Yeah.
Mm big white ones.
"That   that man yesterday, he paid six thousand pound for his caravan."
He s he said that on the tape.
Mhm.
I listened to the tape with her last night.
He paid six thousand pound.
We paid fourteen thousand seven hundred for ours.
Mm.
"He hasn't got, ours is a gold golden olympic."
He's not having the rent we're having.
No.
He's got a .
He hasn't got a brand new caravan.
But he nearly gave six thousand pound for it.
That's what they said though.
Yeah I know.
So you're saying it's better on the streets than at home?
Yeah.
Is it worse
You're giving up before you've even tried!
Do you think you should try?
What is the point in trying?
Because you might find out it works and then you wouldn't have
But my mother wouldn't care about me!
How do you know that?
How can you be so sure?
Cos she beats me up!
Fine!
Can't say anything to that!
Well that could just be a sort of way of life.
"I mean, when people get beaten up when they're younger it me"
"this is true, I saw it on a T V programme"
Carry on.
they can erm  it can affect them in their later life and they hit out at people to show their affection.
Mm!
Don't believe that!
She never said a nice word to me in my life!
Haven't you got any other relatives where you could go?
"No, I wouldn't go near them!"
They're all snotty nosed little
Mm.
Don't you
But not
think you're being a little thoroughly class conscious?
No.
"I think you've got some, some attitude problems!"
"They don't care about me , so why should I care about them!"
"Yes, I think you've got a serious attitude problem!"
Probably doesn't matter does it?
No I would have thought
The other thing might be to ring up  Borough Council  cos they've got offices in Caernarvon.
"Suppose that  that place  they might, there might be a er a parish hall there or something"
That pub would be alright wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"Okay, or"
"That would be twenty five pound a day as well, or fifty pound a day as well ."
Anyway it's a thought.
I mean if we have to
er obviously what you're saying with  it's already in use and we can't have it?
Yeah.
It's not erm  it's no good just saying oh we can have three days out of the week anyway.
No.
"You know, it's gotta be Monday to Friday or none at all hasn't it?"
Mm.
Well if it was four days it would be alright but
Mm.
anyway
Okay so they're a few options to try as regards the coding
Alright and if we can't find anyway where we'll have to   out and come back here.
Yeah.
problem as well.
"I think we, we should find somewhere."
Yeah.
Really.
Erm so that's a few options as regards the coding.
Now
Right
The interviewing  and the briefing session I think we'll probably get away with in  Debbie  's
"Yeah we're not going to, I mean we're only going to  we're, we're"
Well it's not a sort of formal interview
"And walked round  ah so they er  got a, sort of court bailiff involved."
"For sixty two pound, it must of cost them more than that!"
Cost a lot of money I would of thought.
They obviously don't like him do they?
No  well  erm  it's a big firm so
Perhaps it's
what they did in  is er  .
Yeah but he's got his self a bad name now isn't he?
Yeah.
"It made me laugh when your mum kept on about him last night, about having all his hampers stolen."
Yeah.
Twenty two grand!
Ridiculous innit?
The blokes on the make isn't he?
Yeah.
You see he's  and then he had the cheek to charge me for insurance!
Well I expect him to pay the insurance.
Who did pay the insurance?
"did, but I  gonna give it back."
"Well I should think so,gonna get twenty two grand out of it!"
"Cos he'd have taken them to court and said well he didn't even pay it, I did!"
Well actually they erm  I think the  maximum they'll pay out is eighteen thousand.
Yeah but I don't think that's gonna be such an easy case to .
"Well, I don't."
You know it looks to me
They said they'd got it.
"they think that it's all cut and dry, well  they haven't got the  then people will come round and investigate yet!"
No.
Mum that'll come out on the tape!
Well I can't stop it cos the kettle's boiling!
Don't be silly!
Mum is there any shandy please?
Oh Sari .
Yes I spoke to her .
"Yes, she's definitely going isn't she?"
"Mm, mm."
"Any, anybody else."
Anybody else thinking of going?
Any other offers?
"Cos, cos you're going by car are you or?"
"I'll, I'll drive yeah, so there are three seats spare in my car, vehicle."
So that you  Plymouth .
"Instead of writing a check, send the cheque ."
If you can stand the strain of the noise and diesel engine all that way.
.
All the girls in the back.
"You can get there, you can get there, perhaps, if you can get there"
I've got a seat in the back mate.
"You can get there on motorway, erm, all the way practically, can't you?"
.
Mm.
You can get there on motorway all the way.
"I ha I haven't looked at the round there, yeah, I'm, I'm sure it's not too bad really, you know, you know ."
M four .
Right is there anybody else cos we have got forms haven't we?.
.
"It's not that long if that's the case then, er, not that long a journey either."
No.
It's motorway all the way.
"Erm, anybody else interested for it, you said not didn't you."
It's not to late to book I think it says something about surcharge after sixth of March or something on the form doesn't it?
We'll make it  .
I don't think she was in  no.
.
Yeah.
The first book on the left there Dave by the big fat volume that's called
"To, to the left of your, your omnibus."
That's it.
Ta.
Where?
Wha what do we want a project engineer to do?
I want him to do an M S two or three .
What do we want him to do?
Come on.
.
Manage that project.
Through from conception to completion.
Un unfortunately it raises the question of the project coordinator whose role
Mm.
Mm.
talk to you about you know ne next week
Mm.
because it's all rolled into the same thing.
Right.
I say it's
Shall we leave it till then?
responsibility.
Right.
"Let, let us leave it till then because I mean otherwise we're gonna get bogged down in this and whe when we really are briefing procedures."
Yeah.
But you've raised a very valid point and it's one that we need to see through to the end.
I can s I can see
The role o of
I can see what you're driving at.
the role of a project engineer is defined in Q S P six.
Which Roger hasn't seen yet
And I said
Didn't bother with them.
See they're alright.
"I said then  well I said from the time now, I said  there is nobody I said, can sleep on those mattresses."
"No she said, it does take a while for caravans to dry out."
Well  say what you were saying
So in other words  you don't go to the caravan.
". Let it be their responsibility, they put them in there."
"Well Mark's going in at his own risk, see?"
They sold them to you complete.
So?
So they're yours.
What's the good of a bed  a bed without a mattress?
I'm talking about the mattresses.
What are you talking about?
The caravan!
Well I thought you was talking about mattresses airing in front of the fire.
Well that subject's gone!
Oh well
"I'm saying  that  Park, what the woman said that she went down to check the vans  last summer"
Mm.
end of last summer.
long time since then .
And to see that the salt was there and the mattresses were up and that was great.
And she went down to check in the winter time and she said your van was really dry.
Oh.
Well it all depends how she checked.
perhaps.
Well then they then they went and put the mattresses back  in their places.
Now the mattresses are soaking.
Mm.
And I said there's nobody can go and sleep on those mattresses.
Mm.
"kingpin fairy, she sat on someone's head and she had this massive gown all over her, and that was really visual."
Erm
Yeah.
"he we wanted to her get off he just ran up to this erm, ladder and she just grabbed onto him, he just pulled it away."
Is that ?
Yeah.
"It's really hard, yeah."
You cannot visualize something taking place.
It's really wordy isn't it?
It's really sort of.
"And also, I mean, so many of the, the jokes just are  very"
quick jokes.
Yeah.
"They're based on maybe one word in a sentence but if you miss that, you've missed it."
And that doesn't really matter in the theatre because you carry on
Yeah.
"along by the visual gags, so neither of them when"
Yeah.
"you're reading it, you feel you've got to  you've got to follow the  follow the script."
"And the other thing about visual things, let's, let's say  there is a reference to somebody having piles, but they make it a visual gag"
Yeah.
Yeah.
whereas on the page it is  you know
Yeah.
schoolboy humour.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
"Erm  I mean, nevertheless, obviously it's just somebody on the  scene is a bit"
and that free way of talking  about pain.
And wrote it like that and published it like that.
I shall mar all of that he has made and foraged.
This way!
This way!
Why?
Who am I then my love?
Who am I?
"I'll tell you, since you know about yourself."
Did you know ?
Yes she belongs to time not long past.
The good honest  that kept your master's worship house when he requires .
Will you please go out?
Since  translated so that I'll be the Captain.
By your needs such as those .
With the amount of my money all this must  .
.
"Okay, we'll sto stop there."
Now  even in that had a fairly dry reading through.
"Are there any things you want to add to that list, just looking at that?"
"Di different language and er, and what's going on."
Yeah.
In  I think  the people were speaking faster.
Alright.
"You, looking through it and almost laughing at the ."
Right.
"I think that  almost , we've got another  aspect of  erm   comedy, comedy  it's really on the basis of arguments, fighting  complication between people."
"Which, as you quite rightly say  you really need to hear, hear the voices going on."
and I'll get some people
"along the middle in a moment and, and do it."
"Any, any other things?"
Did anybody snigger on anything
No.
in those thirty lines?
Oh dear god    Those chrysanthemums done well.
"They have, yes  they're er  they're good value those a pot, I mean  but  they're reasonably  when did you get it?"
It must be about three weeks ago.
Can't think what it was for now.
I think it was one of those impromptu ones.
I know  it wasn't my birthday you just came in with it didn't you ?
It's  birthday.
I mean the only trouble is they're no use afterwards are they?
Must have had a brainstorm
I said they're no use afterwards are they?
I don't  I don't know.
Because they're forced I reckon.
Oh.
I think they'll grow if you put them in the garden  eventually.
Well
"Well I mean they won't flower again, that's for certain you see and it's it's gotta be"
"No, well not this year anyway, they  they could"
Oh right.
"Have you got, oh ta look  take this as well."
Yes I'm taking it.
Oh.
I'm going to have a go at this   today.
"They've dried out a bit, been too tacky to do anything with."
"Bye bye chaps, don't let them out."
No  see you then.
Did they try and drag you up the farm yesterday?
"Well he's, he actually was off the lead and he went straight through right to the other gate"
Oh and you kept them off the road did you?
You didn't just er
Oh yes well the gate was open so
and I always do
so she went into the second field
Yes.
And then we paid for a winter clean.
And it's filthy!
Mm.
I had to go down there twice
To get it done!
Okay?
Because the windows were filthy!
"Twice, that we argued  ."
"Well, well  you came here didn't you when the curtains hadn't been"
Jump down then Phillip!
"And when I spoke to Mr , I said well  if I was renting a caravan and went to see it and it was dirty like that, I wouldn't want to take it on!"
"And, I said surely you have somebody who goes round and checks them before they're let?"
"No, he said!"
"So what they do is, apparently they wait for somebody to complain"
Yeah.
and then they look at the caravan!
Do they?
That's somebody who comes up to rent it!
So I said and in that case then  probably  you move them into another caravan?
"Oh no, we clean it and  they go into it!"
"I said, you mean to say people wait around while you clean the caravan?"
I don't believe it!
"You're alright , you're alright for your holiday, find a caravan dirty, you've gotta complain before it gets cleaned!"
Ha!
People will !
They can complain to the Tourist Board.
to be done when he was he.
Should be bloody licensed!
You can did you say?
You can.
You can't!
They're cutting back on education.
"Oh, you're telling me"
They're making it so only the rich can be educated.
"Yeah, trying to turn it back into"
at the end of the day.
"I mean, our Colin's there waiting for a grant and what's happening."
Sweet nothing.
"Now we're, it were in bloody paper last  on Thursday, they don't get nothing when they're on holiday."
"No, they don't,"
"I mean, how the hell they supposed at eighteen year old without a job."
Mm.
"If they have a job, they don't get no grants."
"And how can you have, hold a  a job down"
I don't think
And do education at same time.
"I'm not sure, but  I think I don't got my family allowance until I were eighteen, I think, I think they used to give us"
let me keep our Karen's
Oh.
"So I've got a form to fill in, actually."
"It should have gone back last week, and I"
It'll all stop when she gets her grant through.
Don't knock me.
She said not necessarily.
"I think it will stop them  thought shit I'm not bloody going to declare it,"
Yeah.
"She applied for a grant, and in, er in career, it says like,"
Sasha
"you'll, like you you"
"No, you'll rip it."
"Left home, you know, we are, like, say our Karen to leave home."
Aye.
Yeah.
.
No that's him
You've been in it!
that's him  on the phone
So have I!
he was saying all the sort say at work you know that they   they don't know and they start on about er
You have been a  .
"you ruin your chances so  about three times a week the  comes in to arrange my poll tax and all this  and they get going you know well why should a bloke that  having a big house and he only pays the same rate as them  so I said, well it's like this as far I'm concerned I said  you know  no bloke  works perhaps twice as many hours as you do  he chooses"
haven't you?
Yeah  yeah.
"When I said, I think that's wrong!"
Yeah.
"The only time you don't pay a self-employed stamp  is if you  your business  earns,yo you can actually get away it, if you've lost money on your own business  on paper  or if you've  earned"
Well we have!
Why have you got it?
"Yeah tha that's what I'm saying, I ain't got to."
You haven't got to pay it?
No
What about that last lot?
"Ah that's , what they've said once you've paid it, you can't get it back, and if you don't pay it they can't insist you pay it."
Well you haven't paid it.
No I paid the last one though.
Well you can't stop paying it now.
So you haven't gotta pay that one more .
"No , I can't afford to."
Ooh good!
Good good good.
"That's it, why should you have to keep"
Yeah.
paying for them all year long?
Ah but perhaps Ken's the same as you then?
Cos I shouldn't think he's made any profit.
"they've not, yeah, they've not phoned her up for God knows how long."
Irene's been doing it.
"Cos Irene says give me a ring I says no, I says that's it, I said I've already made the arrangement once and it backfired I says so I'm not doing it no more."
"I says when I'm not feeling well or slept in I says I'm gonna phone police station, I'm gonna go from there, see what they say."
Let them find somebody.
I says I'm not messing about no more.
Do you know everybody's had flu and God knows what and I can't catch it.
"I thought I had it again other day, I felt bleeding awful."
I had that at Christmas which made me bad all over Christmas  right ?
"And everybody , I says marvellous cos I can have some time off,, it's not fair."
"I'm not having that, that's cheating."
"If they can have some time off I can have some time off, fair's fair."
"It dries right quick, it just takes that chill off"
"Kath you've got alarms all over the bleeding place, what are you up to?"
I ain't done nowt.
You div!

It's rubbish.
It's never worked proper
Yeah.
"it sort of played about two or three minutes of music and then it went crrrkkkkkk for a few minutes, that's why I kept hitting it."
"And then music, if you hit it, music come back on."
Oh well
Stupid it were.
"Have to have a proper look later, I can't find it."
Ah found one.
"I says I can't find them, I found them."
Here we are

"And also you see right from, right from pregnancy"
Well they get it free don't they?
At the moment.

That's right.
falling for a baby and then saying
No no

Well that makes me ill now.
"It didn't used to but when I, I, I, I feel like going up to these girls and saying for god's sake take that thing out of your mouth."
That's right.
When they're pregnant or they've got a little baby.
It's horrible.
I mean
But you know you can't tell people.
"This friend of ours who lost his wife last year, well we've got another friend who was very fond of her  she also smokes  we just happened to me we didn't say"
No.

Absolutely.

You have a lot of nicknames in the factory?
"Er  well er the just these two people that retired there, er they used to come  this man in a car from , that was their lift to their work."
And it was the days of the C B

"at each other, no?"
"Well not in our department anyway, I don't know, I can't speak for anybody else."
"Aha, right."
Although I've worked in nearly all the departments you don't really get to know the people that well.
Mhm.

So it will take a moment for him to be bought up.
There are apparently further charges to be put to him your worship  the charge of theft  and we charge him with handling stolen property.
He's only charged with one offence of criminal deception at the moment.
Right..

"and I see, when he sees me park there, flash me, I just follow on, you know"
So I
"what he can do is have something when he gets up, rather than the old"
something sort of
"Yeah well, I don't, I don't get a dinner before I go up to bed."
Well what you got then?
I don't know I think it's Wednesday week
"Well before I go to bed I have baked beans on toast or something like that you know, it's, it's not"

No
in fact you had too much you see
No I don't think so
cos you lost none have you?
Yes
Right I I that's fine yes I'll
You see it makes it easier for us as well because it means that if you do if you are there we can leave you in charge for ten minutes while
Presumably Mark will run?
Yeah I would think so.
I'll tell him to give you a ring if it's
Yeah right I'll put him down with a question mark.
Oh it's nice to see people to see a good list of people who are going.
And I could put myself down as  in case I get there for a day or two.
And for candidates erm yeah I'll I'll stand I'll have to bite the boys again.
Yeah.
Talking of standing did did we ever make any progress on Fishergate?
We haven't got anybody.
John hasn't come back to us.
No.
Erm John  said he informed me he he'd stand for Monk again and he I told him to write write a .
John  's Monk.
Presumably in the selection ballot we don't have to
I think we do have
We can have su suggested
But we don't
wards.
But we don't definitely have to sign people.
Er so you were Clifton.
Which is erm Bill
That's Clifton.
That's Clifton.
I I'm certainly interested I'm quite interested in Bishop Hill unless anybody else wants it.
Erm again I mean I'm happy to give that if there's someone actually living in Bishop who wants it but erm I've got erm some someone who lives there wanted me to stand in.
Good reason to er.
Do you have any
Not at this time.
I guess I can stand somewhere.
It is.
"See a few of them, you know right at beginning where it shows you preface?"
Yeah.
"That's where it's jumped, not on the film itself."
"Yeah you know why, it's, it's because of cont continuous rewinding."
You always get damage at front of tape.
Best thing to do is just cut it off.
Ah we will do later cos
Well or yeah.
he uses  cuts it all off and gets rid of it.
"Yeah it's erm  any damage on tape, nine out of ten times i is the first foot  it's because when they wind them back i it, it's a jag"
tight innit?
complete jag all the time when they wind them back.
Yeah.
Aye well that doesn't bother us.
No.
Ta-ta.
Ta-ta love.
"shorts and  so I thought right, clean or mucky, you're in the wash."
"So , thought I'll get them all washed and put back in bedroom before he notices they're missing."
So that's what I did.
"Now what we're on about   yeah as I were on about, that er  what I do is, with days like this, cos you can never guarantee  if they're gonna be dry, wet or what, so I watch to see if it rains, if it don't  they're virtually dry when I fetch them in."
So that's what I've been doing.
I don't know whose T-shirt's whose.
That one's mine.
So that's what I've been doing.
"I fetch them all in, stick them on clothes horse, they're all round fire while I'm on lollipop and then nip to shop and when I come in within half an hour they were bone dry."
Easy.
That's one way to do it innit?
Fetch them in at half past three.
But if they're dry I just fold them up and put them away anyway.
I'm just transferring socks.
Yeah.
ten p or twenty p.
"Oh that that would be a different ball game, selling it in places wouldn't it?"
Oh yeah.
Ho how many
"That's our, I mean, you know you can go round in newsagents or doctor's surgery and dump them."
But to actually say right can you s can you collect the money for us!
Well one could put a  box next to it.
"Well in some places, yeah ."
"Yeah but I mean, mm."
a copy's a lot.
"It is, yeah."
Well although
I mean it I'm not suggesting that isn't cheap but erm  to produce at five p a copy
Oh yeah.
thousand it's gonna cost what's it gonna cost?
Er.
What's five thousands?
Five thousands.
Fifty pounds.
Mm.
Mm.
"I mean I'm, I'm, I'm only going on the fact that I I tend to do everything on the cheap so I tend to get  if I can find somebody who does photocopying I can  do it then we'll do it."
"For me to produce that'll cost me  basically  my time and my  my you know I, say my laser copies' paid for by my business  erm"
copies.
"So I mean if I, if I produced for instance si five or six masters  and then people can go and do copies here and there that's actually not a bad way of doing it."
"And that'll be, I've got about a ream of, well it's only about a ream  paper."
Just pr producing new copies as you need them rather than produce five thousand and I think we we have sort of hundreds to throw away in the end.
But I  it to to er  recycling.
Yeah.
Well I'll get in touch with this  East Herts guy to get all his information.
Good.
Yeah within the nearest place with  a biggish
With a  yeah.
football team possibly yeah.
Anyway
Right.
Right so er
I think that's everything.
Yeah.
"So if I get it laid out again then, you know"
"Yeah fine erm but as I say it's just sort of you know kind of minor layout changes, that's all I was suggesting"
Yeah.
"so you know at a pinch you could probably run it like that and I don't suppose anybody would notice the difference but, you know, just in terms of you know making things look attractive"
Right.
"erm  so  you know but you may find if you give, print off a few and give them to a few people over the weekend"
Mm.
you may find that some additional changes occur to you
Mm.
which you might want to incorporate anyway so you may not want to print off another version anyway
Yeah.
so er
"Erm oh yeah the other thing was  it's two sided at the moment, is that"
Mm.
best or do you think
Erm generally speaking the consensus is it helps if it's sort of on one side
Oh right.
but how you do your original is up to you I mean it's just what we ask for from reprographics and you know they do single sided
Okay yeah.
"double sided, collated, stapled"
"different coloured paper and all, you know, all this sort of thing"
Yeah.
"so er erm  er  so that's  no, is there anything else we need to worry about  with regard to that?"
Er no I don't think so.
Pretty good!
So all that row then was for absolutely nothing at all wasn't it really?
Eh?
All that
And I used my old pass to go on stage anyhow so
Have you got to pass for the stage then?
Yeah.
I used an
What
old one.
"So  those but Fantasia passes are very similar, I just turned mine  turned mine round she saw it and went  she showed me a blank yellow so I didn't  thought it perhaps a different pass but it wasn't  just turned it round on her."
"I bet your  friends a will be  sick then, won't they?"
"I just think that when you're up there it's like the stage is a huge platform going out into the crowd, a long one!"
And there must have been about ten thousand there last time.
They had one of those gyroscopes you can go in  and you can spin round.
Oh yeah!
"They had one of those in there  but I didn't have a go on it though, it was about three quid to go on!"
Those lasers  lasers that   the .
Velcro walls?
"No, they didn't have that there."
"A huge octopus,octopus  -ish, had these massive  tentacles that's going right the way across the ceiling!"
Video screens.
Very good!
They're all gonna be pissed on Friday cos we got in for nothing!
Why is your voice so quiet?
Cos  the washing machine out there  it's .
What sort of smoke  from the machine?
Hiss!
Oh it's ?
No !
What hissing?
Proper smoke machine.
"But the people who  Q T S course, have got a lot of work."
Have they?
"Mm, much more than me."
I'm glad I'm not doing that.
Really?
Loads of assignments have been set already.
"They're really quite heavily bogged down, and they were to do them all, er one day at school."
"Really, bloody hell."
Yeah the teachers seem to do nothing do they?
Really?
"I mean, Ann finished lectures, Ann's finished lectures yesterday, she's a secondary teacher and she doesn't have a lecture again until after Christmas."
Really?
"And she's got another two weeks off now, until she goes into schools and then she's in the schools full-time, but even so, she won't have, she didn't have exams."
"She had exams last January, didn't she, and she hasn't had exams since last January, she won't have until next  during June."
Really?
"And like, she has, like, although she's doing secondary teaching, she has it easier than anybody."
Mm.
"At this stage, anyway."
"I mean, it'll probably get harder."
"I wouldn't mind doing that, if there was, if I could do secondary teaching."
Really?
Mm.
"But I wouldn't wanna do primary or junior, just"
"Well do, would you be, is it T T S, secondary, T T S, weren't it?"
"No, but"
primary
"Well, in T T S"
T T S they can't do secondary.
Only do primary and junior.
"Oh, no in, in our college they're doing secondary."
"Cos I asked them about it, and they said  I'd much rather be doing that."
"Mm, yeah I would really."
. Punch and Judy show.
Magic  and juggling with ka plate spinning.
Er Playbus painting competition.
"Raffle, refreshments, tombola  and various merchandise stalls so I suppose  that's us."
Quite
Mm.
Do they do fire eating act or
We can contortionism or   my legs up behind my neck.
An alternative might be to just to ask whether some of our membership forms could be  put out so that
Well I think they're more interested in the five pounds!
Yeah alright well.
Yeah.
I mean to make a contribution.
No to be honest because that that's what Greenpeace do isn't it?
Don't you belong?
Yeah  start the Harlow one up
Yeah.
the whole of their effort really is devoted to
Yeah they don't do it.
"They're actually, they just do fund raising to their local groups and everything else is obviously sort of controlled by central office or"
That's right everything is central.
Ac action is central  or something.
Yeah but I mean
So they're probably just gonna have their  you know  merchandise and a few people sort of
It's difficult really because I mean we're sort of striving for the same sort of things
I know.
Yeah.
aren't we.
It's er  you don't want to be seen to be erm
Who's it actually run by?
competing with each other in any way.
Well.
Okay.
"Don't know what, don't know what they'll make of all that gobbledegook.   bye bye love."
Have a good weekend.
See you soon .
See you next week.
"This is the wrong side, they must have rewound it without meaning to."
Well you're supposed to use side A
it won't tape it doesn't matter .
"But it does to them, because they've got side A and side B on every tape."
Yeah.
"And if they haven't got  side  side one tape two following  I mean side two side, tape two side A following tape one side B, it puts them out a bit I should think  are you going up the dog path?"
"Yeah, come on ."
"When, when did you get all this stock of perfume?"
"Erm, four years ago, three or four years ago  ."
.
"He went out on Christmas Eve, to find you present"
"That's right, I remember that ."
"and he got this job lot of  perfume, and he said oh I can shot these out over the next few years, I said, oh if you really want to ."
Where does he keep them?
"I've no idea, in fact last year, did he give you some last year?"
"I can't remember ,"
"Yes, he did ."
"he said alright, I, I, I was in trouble because I forgot where I hid them."
A miniature one.
I had to look in the top of his wardrobe.
You'll have to look somewhere.
"Take it all away, he probably gave it to girls at work as well or something."
Yes.
"Well no, cos it would be too late after Christmas wouldn't it?"
"Probably, no he doesn't give presents ."
"Oh he does, he gives er his secretary and switch board girl a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine and  but I do all the Christmas cards"
"Yeah, I know you do"
Yeah.
"You paying me in 'and, and Dennis is paying me in 'and and I'll a er, thousand pound a week, the way that  I keep getting these job offers."
Back-handers.
Anticipation obligations.
The only trouble is they're only offers.
"What's happening down here, then, didn't you hear no more about when you finish then, down here at"
No.
"Only some bad  things, what I've supposed to have done, or what I'm not supposed to have done."
But
Who cares over it.
"some money out of it, I took him to court."
proven.
Oh.
But you can't do it without money.
"No, that legal aid don't go far"
"Legal aid, won't enter enter entertain it."
Not for owt like that.
"No, I'm afraid"
"You see, 'cos you weren't actually employed, you see, 'cos you say,"
No.
"you couldn't really take him to a tribunal could you, 'cos ya"
"No, I weren't employed."
any money to take him to a tribunal.
"Well, I made my, I made it plain that er, at the training centre, you know, I says, I says to em, I said er, in my opinion, I says, he doesn't want, he don't want to kn , he he don't want to know."
"Oy, you."
"He says any anything what goes wrong, he says, you automatically get blamed for."
I told you.
"He says, well, it's your job not to let it go wrong, I said, I didn't let it go wrong."
"I said, but other people let it go wrong and they got away with it."
Look what I found.
I've just called for her money.
Corrinne's money.
Yeah.
Go on then.
"Why people think it's noisy for us on a double main road, but it ain't really."
"Well, you get used it in don't ya."
"When our Norma come and stop here, she she was,"
Used to sleep
I don't know how you sleep all night with all that traffic going up and down.
No.
But we never hear it.
You don't hear it.
"No, we didn't."
"I remember one  first night we stopped there, buses were coming at crack of dawn,"
Yeah.
"it must have been about four or five o'clock in morning, and now we never hear any traffic."
No.
No.
Perhaps you get used to.
Yeah.
"But we don't hear many people, on a road like that."
No.
"I were thinking about that bungalow, and, well actually it's as far from  our road, nearly as far from our road to there, as what is it from bungalow window to road."
Where to  yeah.
it really is
"Know, thinking about people walking back as far as t' shopping my point."
"There nowt much difference in, from t' garden"
"I think the only trouble over there, is your to gonna have people parking in front of ya gate, like when they go to the chip shop."
They won't
Yeah.
"They won't 'cos 'cos er, I'm afraid if they do, I shall be out straight away at 'em."
"Well, it's only a matter of parking at, parking your own car as well"
"I'll clamp the bugger, I'll buy a wheel clamp and wheel clamp it."
Park here at your risk.
I ended up paying for him.
"She's not bothered, she never goes near him."
Never goes near him.
She never goes near him.
She's frightened to death of 'im
isn't it.
I know.
But I don't think Geoff would be very pleased.
"Well, if you say to him, that just say that  and that, that's you know, oh, just say something like, just say something like  I can't keep up with him Dennis, he's throwing loads of dust about, just say to him,think about selling, to you want to buy him back or, you know."
"Well, they won't, I don't think they'd have him back."
No and that's  a
"I don't think, I don't think sell him."
Has he got to wait.
A.
I don't think you'd get what you paid for him.
"Probably not, but I mean, cage is worth a hundred and fifty quid."
That's what Russell paid for the cage.
"Oh, look."
Mm
"Oh, look."
What.
"Look,"
"that he's into,"
"Well, I mean, he's no problem to me."
I'm not bothered about him.
"You know, I'd rather keep him than sell him, but"
"It's like everything else, you've always summat else to bloody feed."
Mm.
"By the way, when we had that pair, that were driving me mad, and then that one died, when we were in bungalow."
"Other one would learnt how to open a crack, and it were in that cage, and it could hear birds outside."
"Anyway in the end we let er Kenny's grandad have 'im, I mean, 'cos they got me mum's bird."
"They've got two of his own, he ended up with four birds."
Ours is gonna us about a thousand pound for insurance.
Oh.
"Well, a thousand pounds not a lot, Karen, but er  it all depends what the, what what you gonna be insured for?"
It's not.
"I mean, even that, you're gonna you you gonna be insured for breaking in and break-ins and"
"Yeah, I think it's everything."
I think it's
"That's what I mean, so what you're actually getting for your, thousand pound isn't a lot of money."
No.
"I think it's covered for like, like you say, like for some reason, say you had a fire, and you had to stop work."
Yeah.
I think it's covered for that.
"Covered for personal injury, er, covered for hundred thousand, for like, that's what trailers,they've got  trailers in."
It's covered for everything.
"I mean, you imagine somebody breaking in and setting fire to a trailer."
"I mean, it's a lot of money when you think Norma's paying nine hundred pound just for her car."
For that Cabriolet.
"To me, you think phew a thousand pound, but cer I mean, it's it ain't really very much, no."
It's a high insurance for a car.
What for car?
yeah.
Right
"What how how comes that, then?"
"Because, well, Cabriolet's are classed as dangerous, aren't they, because they're  soft roofed."
"Oh, aye."
It's not got no
"Aye, this"
"Yeah,she's only been driving a year, two years."
"Soft top, yeah."
Yeah.
"Well, I mean, look at our Connie's."
Yeah.
I didn't know women were allowed to go.
"and er just at the very end all you could see was her  and your man, the hologram  and he'd just been killed about five minutes earlier."
So he could have saved himself but he didn't want to.
The hologram?
Aye.
And did he not save himself then?
No.
Did he die?
But then how can  go on.
Cos he's still he's still a hologram.
Hologram.
So that's how he died then?
Aye.
Well it's funny
Remember he tried to stab his wife
I cried my eyes out at that!
at the very start of last night there was this guy water skiing
"big massive fat woman right, and she was just walking about this conference, you know where she's not supposed to be, and all these shoulders  stab her right?"
And then
Shoulders?
"Soldiers, right, stab her and they're all dying and then you see the head like  it's just all dressed up in these things and it's Arnie underneath it  and he takes the head off"
and it closes up again and he goes  chew this or something  blows up and then Arnie gets
"No there's a scene in Terminator, he's like wood and metal, in this new Terminator"
Yeah
it is absolutely brilliant the way they do it.
What was that what was that

So.
So that was to say that we'd w
Yeah.
withdrawn D two point three.
Yeah.
And now you've reused it somewhere else?
And erm and subsequently we've actually withdrawn
Withdrawn
this particular D two stroke three.
So if you look in your manual you've now onl only got one D two stroke
Yeah.
three
"Rather than two D one, right."
"A a a and the, and the, and the D seven bit is, is in a different section?"
Is covered by part D two stroke one.
Right.
Thank you Dennis.
You're a
good lad.
Right.
Could I just quickly look through here?
"I, I did have a go through this core brief to see if there were any things that I should have picked out."
"There there is a good section, there's a good section on pensions"
by the way because our staff will be concerned about pension proposals after privatization.
Is it?
It's section one point five.
If you view files three to five.
The main message I would give is that
"the Board has responded to the government with regard to the pensions issue, and suggested a number of improvements to the government's proposals."
"Yeah but I mean it depends what sort of bloke he is, and I mean if he is like that"
He  you know what a big head he is.
Yeah but I mean you don't know what he's like to his kids do you?
Well she said he he's done nothing but bully them.
Well then the kid's right ain't he?
"Well  you heard what he said he wants his children to have a good education and he pushes them  all the time, they've gotta  if they do anything"
Yeah.

Oh yeah.
but you heard what Ashley said about swimming.
Made them  yeah.
"Well, to me if a child has got a   by all means encourage along  but you shouldn't push them into anything cos  later on in life they get a bloody complex about everything  you know if they"
I don't know.
if they've got a job or something they're frightened they're not gonna do well and
"Where do you draw the line between  you know, not sort erm  encouraging and not"
Well I do it all look at  it's the way you say it.
"Well that's what I'm saying, so perhaps the kid was right in what he said."
Well yeah but I wouldn't
Been a bastard to him well
Well would you like your son to say  I think
Well no but I don't to think I am like that with Jonathan.
Well no.
Well I don't like
But he's always been like that with them kids you know yourself  if they do anything it's gotta be done
"Well you know how he is, if you say too much to him, don't do that, don't shout at me!"
He soons  starts squawking and  wiping his eye and stamping about the place  but if he's like that  all the while to them  so what is .

"You see even from Leeds North West  the outside party job and the P T pay monthly, so it's important that the client knows what he's gonna be facing."
But what we do is we estimate three months
Mm.
and divide by three.
Yeah.
"Then you get an average,"
Not bad.
"you know, and that's, that's the way"
What's that mean?
Mm?
No.
I think's it's quite generous
Don't be mean .
actually.
Next one Den.
Well.
There aren't any more.
Ther there have been quite a few that have come out recently which I haven't briefed.
Some of them are fairly minor and it's  to read them.
"Others which are perhaps a little bit of er a change from what we've been used to doing,"
Mm.
are currently being revised yet again.
So I'll pick them up at the next brief.
Right.
I think an hour of this is about enough isn't it?
Den that was great.
I mean I know there's been a lot of debate and I know that er you may feel it's been a bit of a waste of time
but  the fact that there's been so much debate
"If, if, if you say, Mary had a little lamb"
Mary had a
"I think they were frightening years ago when they, when we were kids so they're frightening places."
"Well we had no, we had no erm  nothing to stop the pain."
No.
"We had no injections, we were just put in a chair and, and it cost"
That's right
two guineas for every filling
"I know, it's a lot of money."
I mean
"Yeah, week's wages yeah."
"But we, he didn't get more than two or three guineas a week did he when we were first"
"That's right, yeah yes"
"Then we get, I know  our dentist was very good, we've always said that if we had a good dentist and a good doctors we're on our holidays, and we have, we've been lucky wherever we've been"
Mm.
Mm.
"we've had good dentists, good doctors."
Oh it pays you to get a sympathetic one and one that's er not on the
But this one is lovely.
"This one's  young and he's so gentle, you know he"
Yes.
Oh they're marvellous.
"I think that's what Tony's harking back to, the old style when you went and they were a bit er callous."
"Yes indeed well,young, how old is he?"
Twenty  five?
"He's only in his twenties, yeah he ought not, no it wouldn't be would it?"
No.
"Twenty years ago they were, they were alright weren't they?"
What am I thinking about?
No I'm thinking about
"Well you know the first time I went was  oh I dunno, before the war you know when I was about four or five and I went to get one out  I mean my parents"
"but it was terrible I was screaming, I was terrified and, and, and I can still see the place you know, there's something very foreboding about the, the place and the chair was like a"

Hello baby we weren't long were we?
"Haven't seen Dan in there for a long time, I thought he'd left Lionel and gone off to get a  a highly lucrative job somewhere  You don't somehow expect to see a, a young man with a university degree working in your local green grocer do you?"
"Mm, what's his degree in?"
"I haven't asked him, I didn't like to."
"They must have been high up in the tree,leaves."
Yeah.
I just saw somebody put it on them on the .
I used to be quite good at
and I'll ask again on Tuesday when I ring.
It's supposed to be very good for you.
"I used to be very good at this, I use to  ."
So did I
"Yes, you did, yes."
We'll put it on the list and I'll try on Tuesday for you.
.
So that's all I've got with me after I've been to .
"Well, you've  anyway, so."
"If they're more than eighty, I, I can't have it anyway."
So you want to keep
"Yo-yo,."
Oh .
"I'm all ready if I got my handbag, but when I start walking because of the cars being broken into I don't carry a handbag, you see, I just carry money in my pocket."
"Oh, there's a lot had their cars broken into ."
"I've had mine done twice, mine done twice, mm, the police were up the other day lying in ambush, and I'd spotted them and phoned the local police station and said there's men lurking in the bushes of  are they policemen?, she said yes madam, they're policemen."
"I don't, I thought they looked to they looked to clean and, and well groomed"
Yeah.
"to be erm, sort of scroungers."
"Right, it doesn't pay to leave your handbag in the car."
No way.
Certainly doesn't.
It isn't the money because the insurance company pay me back the money
"Yeah, yeah."
"the car insurance mends my windows, but it's, it's your bank books, and your credit cards"
I know.
and your driving licence
I know.
"your insurance, all those little things you know, and you don't"
East end then.
Oh he's got a nice shirt on.
"in a pub he was, got drunk and for a twenty pound bet shaved off all his hair."
I still owe him the money.
But he is stupid cos he went hitchhiking once and left a day early to avoid traffic.
"Here, do you know what I fancy?"
I fancy an icecream.
She said well I'll go and get you one.
"He said no, you know what your memory's like, you're bound to forget."
"She said no I won't, what do you fancy?"
"He said well  I fancy  vanilla and strawberry icecream with chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce, crushed nuts and a flake."
"She said right, vanilla and strawberry icecream, chocolate sauce, crushed nuts."
"said right, I shall be back in five minutes."
Two hours later she come back with a ham sandwich.
He said you silly cow!
You forgot the mustard.
East end.
This week on handy hints we are talking fishing.
I once went for a job as a fisherman.
"The boss said Connolly you've got the job, you start on Monday."
"I said that sounds alright, could I have a sub?"
He said no you're on a fishing boat like everybody else.
Well one of the greatest qualities a fisherman can have is of course patience.
And you can spend the whole day without a bite.
"As for me, I always take my packed lunch."
And pot noodles is one of my favourite dishes.
No.
I don't think  that the pub is open  the cafs aren't open  the amusements aren't open.
The bar's open.
No.
All locked up and in darkness.
?
Erm minus infinity.
"So, it's minus infinity or plus infinity."
When X is very large or very very small.
at minus a million.
Erm
What would that approximate to?
A million plus six.
No
"Do you  enter a big competition, and you could win a million pounds plus six."
"Compared to the million pounds nobody bothers much about the six, so"
Just a
"when it gets very large, Y is roughly equal to X squared."
"So if you know the graph of Y equals X squared which unfortunately I can't draw tonight it's  draw it for you, could draw it from the inside  keep telling everyone else."
Right.
"Now, there's a Y equals X squared."
Yeah.
"So around here, round this bit,there won't be any difference."
Hmm.
"Around  six plus six, let's say plus six in there."
"For, for some length, that'll be sort of almost flat, won't it?"
I mean
Mm.
"till we get to X equals a one and it starts making a bit of difference, so it'll probably go like this."
"Okay, so a lot of it, that's a very important, those are sort of very important parts of the graph."
Tend to
Mm.
get neglected.
People say oh I'll take it from minus five to plus five.
Right?
If we had something like Y equals erm X minus ten.
Right.
"Times  X minus erm or times ten minus X  like that, okay."
You know what you're getting because we've had it before.
"So then I got back on to Gwyllam  and said that if we provided our own caravan, would you  someone there be willing to do the  from site to site and he said that wouldn't be a problem."
Right.
But he doesn't know any details.
Okay.
Er you know I mean just like we don't.
We don't know dates or anything yet do we?
No.
So I think we've developed in that direction that I can go ahead as soon as I've got some dates and book it properly with Mr .
I think that's probably the best.
And just let these do the transporting because this  this fella honest to god he was doing me head in.
"Erm  saying oh one left, we've got a contract with the B B C you know, isn't it."
Oh and if he said it once well he said it half a dozen times  trying to impress me.
So let's stick to Mr .
We know where we are with him.
"Oh right, yes well I'm quite happy with that."
Right.
Er so the only other thing are the automatic counters then isn't it?
Mm.
Yeah.
"And we, we've got to wait for erm  Mel  to be in tomorrow."
Haven't we?
Yeah.
And we're obviously going to ask him to
"He, he"
to go ahead with it.
"looks after, I, I'm not sure exactly what he does, but he does sort of look after  the Welsh Office's own traffic counting programme."
Mm.
They have a sort of programme of their own  on er doing counts on roads.
I mean  a and most of it's done through the county councils.
"So we'll have certain sites that are counted and they have the, the equipment."
"Er when we last did the work there in nineteen eighty nine he'd, he'd provided  Gwyneth with three machines which they moved round and put on different places for us."
But it's still cheaper than a pub.
"Yeah, yeah."
So we'll have  a couple of drinks and that's it for tonight.
Mhm.
"Jane said that last week, cos I thought it was a disco, cos when it first described it me, it was real crap, and there was this colour guy and his friend, and all they wanted to play was  black, they looked like they got no bones when they were dancing."
"You know like, dislocated themselves."
It's really
"Really, oh no."
"And in fact, all they played all night."
"The funny thing was, I find this really amusing, the bloke who was running the disco, he was putting loads of records on, then going dancing."
"Really, excellent."
How was he doing that?
"Yeah, he really did, and the record would end, and then he'd plonk back."
So they were just playing the music that they liked.
It was only those two dancing all night.
"Oh, what."
"That's what made it so obvious, because it was, he would put the records on, and then come out and start dancing, and I thought I'm not going that  No, they played that,sh what's it, shake, shake, shake the room,"
bought that.
"Oh, she didn't, oh remember the other day,Take That."
I didn't ask.
Oh.
I didn't even  supposed
Would it?
"She said, yeah."
"ought to see  lounge, she's got Take That disco, and Take That"
"Oh, Jesus, she's driving us up the wall."
She's trying to go out and get tickets to see 'em.
Is she?
She's got tickets.
"That's the trouble, but we got a note through the door this morning from our friend Kerry."
Don't buy the Take That tickets.
"I'll explain later,and she's  last night ."
That's three sixty five please
Two four five  sixty five
Thank you
Thank you  Thank you.
You haven't given me the bits missing from the Mirror.
Well that's erm
Well I'm sorry but my Daily Mirror was dev delivered this morning without the television supplement and without the comic and I want them
the actual page?
The whole supplement that come on Saturdays
That part
That part wasn't in?
This part was not in.
"And there's usually a free comic as well, and that wasn't in either."
And that's the second time in the past four weeks that those pieces have been missing from it
Well
"No, I don't need the whole paper."
I've got the rest of it.
I canna gi' you one under there though
"Well you're going to have to because when I pay for a paper, I want it to be complete, so I want that piece and I want th that piece, no wait a minute, where is it?"
Which is the television?
Where does this start?
That's forty change.
Thanks a lot.
There we are.
"Right, so I've got the two pieces that are missing from my paper"
"Well, I've already paid for mine so I'm going to get"
"Well, you'll just have to tell them that it's missing but when I've paid for a newspaper I expect to get all the pieces that I've paid for and I've already paid for mine, so this I'll take."
Thank you
Hello
Hello
Hello
raises a lot of money through sponsorship  few people committing money every month.
"What we did before, was we did counting in flows and circulating."
"I think what we would do  supposing we didn't, supposing we just had  heavy vehicles and light vehicles?"
That's gonna make things a lot easier isn't it?
"Yeah well we, for Queensferry we just had  three classes."
"Motorbikes, cars, light goods  H G V including two three and four axle and buses  for the, for the whole count, now for the samples  Rob didn't even want it classified."
It was just a vehicle regardless  of what it was.
Yeah.
I suppose we could do a classified count  er on the A four eight seven sort of a bit away if we wanted a proper classified count couldn't we?
Yeah.
"Separate, on another day."
Yeah.
Or we could just use whatever we get at the interview side.
Erm  perhaps the thing to do is to look at  how it varied in nineteen eighty six.
Did you get that report out?
Yes you did.
How it varied between the two sides.
There's three thousand one hundred there.
Mhm.
That's two way.
On a twelve hour day.
"So assu you're talking about, well supposing that 's grown, it may be four thousand, so you're talking about two thousand tr vehicles in the interview direction  over twelve hours."
So you're gonna want to interview  forty percent right?
How many do you think you'll need?
"Do you think you'll need  if you have t a team of four on, is that a half team or a six team?"
A half.
A four.
We did have  we worked a six team but it's not as easy to work out.
I'm only thinking that  you've got somebody counting?
Yeah.
There's one person counting?
Two.
Two people counting.
Who's A T S?
Tyres and .
"You don't owe them nothing do you, I hope?"
"Nothing to do with A T S, don't like them."
Precisely for that reason I should think!
"Well wha what he said was  he went up there  there's erm  could they  put on the front wheels  to the back  and the back wheels to the front  didn't say anything  the bloke said, well we can't charge you."
Oh.
And the bloke said well we can't charge you for that.
So this is isn't what it's all about?
"Well, that's how it all come  see he owes them a hundred and seven pound  and er"
when he asked them change the tyres over they wouldn't do it.
Oh.
Yeah but they said we can't charge you for it  he said we sell a new tube or sell you a new tyre he said  we can charge you  but we can't charge you labour.
That's ridiculous innit?
"Yeah, so he said well  charge me for wheel balancing then or something  no he said, we can't do that."
He's just being awkward by the sound of it.
So he said will you do it for nothing?
And he said it's not a charity case!
Could you pay him to do it?
He says no.
Said fair enough  he said and with that I come out the garage.
"Well why don't he use that bloke at St. Johns, who you use?"
He does now.
So erm  he's phoned up me   your money  cos he said they daren't put me in court you see.
Well that's a ridiculous  thing to do!
"Well they say they're gonna put you into court, you get it paid don't you, before anything goes further?"
Yeah  yeah well you see what he said was  he could not see how they could warrant   him  that sixty odd come as interest   justify doing it.
It will all depend how long has he owed them it.
Possibly about a year I think.
Cor!
My God!
"So he said, I'm not having that!"
"Right, does Saria had a form, she must cos you said she's booked, Peter have you g , Peter you've got forms have you?"
"Don't think she has got a form, no, Alma have you got any spare forms for that."
"No, I think I've distributed them all, didn't I?"
Mm.
We could get one from British Section couldn't we?
"You think, I thought you said she's booked, she hasn't booked."
"Oh no, she's definitely wants to go, but she hasn't actually filled out the form ."
"Well, she's, she's going to it ."
"Erm, yeah I think she said she'd get one directly."
Erm.
"I think er, I guess that any individual members would get them in their, erm journal."
Yes.
"I might, I might, yes, we, I, well, I'll, looks like it ."
"I'm an individual member, perhaps I've done, got round to opening the  ."
"I'm not sure, I'm not sure, they, they have been there  ."
That's possible .
.
Quite happy you know telephone them to send on
"Ah, right, well, we'll just check, yeah."
"Cos that's  when, when, when we get to that nearer the date, we could, we could just, you know, when you're confirmed that you've been booked and you're definitely going, erm we could look at the finances and see how much we could afford to, to give, erm, something to each person to help with,eit either with the accommodation or, or the transport."
Mm.
"Cos the accommodation is quite a bit, isn't it?"
"It's fifty , sixty or more, probably more this time."
No .
Seventy six pounds .
It's seventy six pounds .
Mm.
More of sixty five last year.
"Mm, yes."
Erm.
"That's nice, I'm, it's very good that people are going anyway, it's got"
That's for the whole weekend
But er I don't think we need to go to that er length with you.
"I've still got those erm, you know, the little purple tablets?"
Yeah.
"That dissolve in water,"
"Yeah, to soak them."
Mm.
"You could, you could go back on the Permitabs if you want."
"It's not desperately moist, although certainly one of them is cracking quite a bit, and if that helps to dry it up and make it more comfortable then it's worth giving them a soak ten minutes a day."
Mm.
"If you want to try those, you dissolve one in four litres of water which is er which is a little, just short"
just short of a gallo yeah you need a bowl.
"Yeah, but then you get the right concentration."
"If you use too high a concentration, it irritates and it stains even more than the dilute stuff does."
But that may be worth a go if you've got some Permitabs left.
Mm.
But I think we'll use some Dermavate Have you got plenty of Dipabase
Yeah.
Good.
"A big tub, yeah?"
Mm.
That's fine.
"Is it alright to put that on, you know, when it's broken?"
The skin
"Yes, you've got, you've got to be a bit careful with broken skin because if you put things directly on it, they tend to irritate."
"It won't do the skin any harm particularly, but it can smart."
And
Mhm.
that might be one good reason for using the er the soaks.
"The other think I'd recommend, is, using a fine pair scissors, is take off the scaly bits, the bits that stick out, cos they're the bits that catch"
Mm.
and hurt and
Yeah.
Yes.
Bring that ball here!
You got no bloody chance!
"But as I say, people believe everything, it's gospel!"
And you never hear the Labour party criticising.
"You know, but they should be  criticised out of hand what's going on in this country but they bloody don't!"
Well when when  if if the Labour party criticised  and they do criticise
"Oh they criticise Ken, yeah."
"The only time that you will hear about it is whe , if you have the television on  and you see it happening on the parliament  and on your papers."
Well you read your paper don't you?
And we get a middle of the road one which is the Observer
We we'll watch
"which is, they get some  they do some pretty good"
"But how often do the  I mean, they  they don't give you  they don't give you every detail that's gone on all week!"
Oh no they're  or there's certain ar
they only pick
a certain subject or
Yes.
whatever that's been thrashed.
"As you say , we'll see."
Well  he's gone on  seven days of the week  complaining about so and so  we'll just narrow that down to one article about his  his complaint that they may just make a little note  he's complained seven times about this!
So you see a little article
That's right.
he's not complaining!
"Yeah, but I mean basic things Ken, we'll take for example"
the low wages
Yeah.
"we, we haven't got one now, they got one in Germany, they got one in France  I in"
Yes.
Italy.
Well yes.
"Oh there we go, that was mistake number one  George dear have you read the er holiday page at all?"
"Inflammable, ain't it."
"Anyway, er, the bloke who managed to get him insurance, this this, the premises are insured with him,"
Yeah.
"so I thought, well, if he's already got, er, part of his insurance without having"
"Yeah, because he was in, paper, waste paper, and the fire insurance on that must have been colossal."
That's where  cardboard and paper.
Yeah.
"Sasha come in here, shut door."
He's not coming in.
"But er, I can't understand why, because I mean, let's face it,he he's only using fibre-glass and they're not that flammable"
"No, what they're saying is."
"Not the flammable, it's the er indemnity, nobody can breathing it in who's in"
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"They're frightened like, in years to come, like, they're gonna try and make a claim against them 'cos their er, been on the chest, is summat like that."
Yeah.
"I, it's health and safety, yeah."
er.
"Through the health and safety, but."
Eighty four we had this extension put up.
Yeah.
Sasha come in here.
"But, after saying that,"
There's a draught in
"what you gotta do, is make up your mind, what chemicals you're gonna use"
Yeah.
and then find out all about
What ya got?
Don't know.
"them particular chemicals and then submit it to the, the insurance company, what them's the only chemicals you use, and the company said this and that."
they told him that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I was to show him what to do and I made sure that all .
On the first day I made sur I stayed with that man all day.
As I said I stayed with that man all day.
Although I wouldn't t in interfere with  show him how to do the job and  er I would make sure he understood the job.
If he asked me such and such I'd say now this is how you do it.
"If he said to me, after I'd shown him, that he understood it, I would say alright, show me how you do it."
And then that way the man learnt.
Mm.
The man himself learnt.
"And usually the man telling me he understood if eventually when he starts the job, he hasn't understood at all, he's just saying so, but I wanted to prove to the man himself that he could do it and prove to myself that he could do it."
So I was in a safe  and so was the man.
But
So you were given the responsibility then to train people up?
given the first in this .
Now then that were left on the
Did erm do you still keep up your union er membership right away when you were
"Oh yes, oh yes."
"Aye, yes ."
"In fact I were shop steward in the, in the building trade, I was a shop steward in the building trade."
Mm what did you go on to do after that?
After the business folded?
Was there anything like erm redundancy money or anything like that payed at that time when the place
Er
folded?
And can you remember what year it was?
Oh it's about
Just roughly.
"fifty, fifty seven I think."
It was somewhere thereabout.
Mhm.
And they didn't have all this er legislation about redundancy money or anything then?
No no.
They had a working committee didn't they and a sub
It's East Herts isn't it?
I think.
Was it East Herts?
"East Herts, yeah."
Yeah East Herts.
Environmental sub committee?
Yeah.
He sits on it.
"Well he had this environment mental officer, they they in inaugurated him  then at this meeting  meeting when  erm  the thing you handed over"
Charter.
The environment charter.
Why's it a sub committee?
What happened to the  proper committee as well.
Yeah.
reports then back to the proper actual coun the er
The work's  committee
district council meeting.
"Well I know at district  council there was two environmental groups, was it the officers group and the  members group."
Oh.
I wonder which group
Herts county council.
Cos when I was on the Hertfordshire Environmental  of the group which has folded
"I've got all this money in the Abbey National and there's no, no group any more, I think I'll have to keep"
Keep quiet.
I'll have to send it off to .
But anyway it transpired that there were two groups sort of working towards the same end and nobody could work out what sort of erm role each played and it was terrible.
Because you knew that they both had to agree before anything was done.
Oh.
I suppose that was one way of nothing being done.
"Yes, they didn't communicate."
The officers group and the members group that was right.
I know they don't like it
"No, er, no especially with a band saw, cos"
Oh hello
"Hello Margaret, well"
"twenty years ago and, and, and they really had to"
and the whole band saw gotta to be resharpened he said and they go to a place in
Most of them don't do their own now do they?
No
"We used to have a shop you know, a saw doctor shop"
I
"when I had the time, did them all tension and set, you know, but erm, as you say now, they probably cost you about fifty pound a go every time they go away"
Yeah it's a
I don't fancy doing by hand
"Well, even that little one of mine"
"No I mean even with a hand saw, you know, I've done it before"
"You had to wait, wait about twenty eight before you went on top I believe I don't know"
"Yes, yes, oh yes"
"and er all his brothers ev , every one of them went, they served their time and"
"and er, it was er, the others were by having the lads and getting the trees down, er the extra wood that they got out of the er, out of the tree"
"they lost so many with, with the thickness of the blade"
"Oh I see, yes, yes, yeah, yeah"
"that's right, yeah"
I think
"bloody hell, that must of been hard work that, they must of been at it all day"
"Yeah, yeah"
"How did they keep, how did they stop the flaming thing from snaking them all, you know?"
I don't know
It must of had a good iron in it.
"Must of had terrific arms on them, oh dear me"
Yeah and I used to see them many a times in
"and what they'd leave them to what, then to, to dry wouldn't they at least?"
"Oh I, yeah"
"Like, I really felt abused."
I mean at the time
Ya.
"I felt sorry for him but  I must admit when I got home and the following morning, and since then I've felt quite angry about it."
That's
The next
isn't it?
the next time you see the girls in the choir
I'll bet they'll turn round and say
"Well I, er, he ca , he was, he was then"
be careful of whatever his name is.
he was then saying erm  now what about a concert this Friday?
"Erm, there's such and such going on."
"And there's one er  a week on Saturday, you know, let's go to both of those and I said erm  I'm away those weekends."
"I said, I'm going away this weekend, I'm going away next weekend"
"Yeah, let's not."
and he said erm  have you got your diary with you?
And I said no.
"And he said, hadn't you better check?"
"And then he said, I don't mean to put pressure on, but I want to get to know you, we've got so much in common and erm  I want to take you out for dinner, not just go to the concert, but, we don't get to know each other that way."
"I'll come down to Richmond and take you out for dinner, how does that sound?"
"I said, I'll see you at choir."
But we don't get to see each other at the choir
"erm, because you don't stay back for a drink afterwards because you're going to Strawberry Hill."
"I know it'll be easier when you're in Fulham, blah, blah, blah, but erm  pressure!"
Pressure.
Pressure.
Pressure.
Crowding me in.
And then he said
"Then it's , it's better to have a two-timer from"
then he said I'm lonely.
"Having came to the  he was hungry, so he was glad to be h hired by a local farmer as a swine herd."
"Even the pods he was giving to the pigs, he would have liked to have eaten himself."
"He decided to go home, and offer to be a servant instead of a son."
"But his father was overjoyed to see him, and at once threw a party."
His elder brother coming home from the fields and hearing dancing enquired what was going on.
"When he heard the explanation, and that even the best calf had been killed, the fatted calf had been killed, to help the party he was furious."
And that is understandable.
"At this point, we are then asked to consider, does the elder brother become the family black sheep, is there a sort of change of position."
I don't know what
I wouldn't think so.
No.
a brother.
The story makes its point to the finish.
Mm.
Mm.
"So th they,yo yo you couldn't see a situation where the person who er was previously in disgrace, was no longer in disgrace, and the one, the the the brother, then showing je jealousy, was himself in disgrace."
Sounds like fiction.
Sounds like fiction.
"No, it's just the father's attitude that changed, not the way that"
Mm.
Mm.
"Well, he, he was repentant, he was only repentant because he was hungry."
"Yes, yes, yeah, yeah."
"Can you stop being a black sheep then, did did did he stop being a black sheep when he came back."
"Was that the end of the story, as Trevor was saying."
"Well, he certainly gave the father the opportunity to say, I told you so."
Mm.
Mm.
"Done, Yeah"
Mm.
Or he could say I was one
"I was one of the black sheep, but I'm no longer."
Playing with me knobs.
Look hang on I've got one queu are you all right there Rachael?
Hello.
"Do you get fed up with people saying, Are you really like that one in Coronation Street?"
No I don't actually cos I'm  nothing like her .
Erm
You look similar.
Well that's er that's a insult.
It's not.
It is.
Yeah.
I thought when we did we did that programme out to lunch in the summer and you came along and we talked all about buses and er your organization and I I I was very nice to you actually.
You were very pleasant.
"And didn't say you know, It's flipping these tour buses in York that cos all the other people trouble because you can't get anywhere they clog the roads up."
Well that's really not our problem I mean that's to do with the deregularization of er bus companies allowing any anybody to start up a bus company.
Oh that's a bit political Rachael isn't it a bit political I wasn't expecting that
featured the last er three years some of the  other companies have only been here since last year and the year before so I mean we're a national tour operator
experienced in running open topped tours around cities.
Could you hang on just a minute don't go away just stay there hold on.
Ah Rita.
Yes James.
Good.
Sorry about that
Still here.
What?
I said I'm still here.
You had to go off and make his nosh didn't you?
No I didn't he's in the kitchen being a very very domesticated husby and he's making own nosh.
He's not is he?
Yeah he is oh heck I've got to get the news in haven't I that worries me.
Well don't worry if you ask him nicely he might even make you a bacon sandwich.
Would he?
"Yeah, right."
"Right, is there anything else?"
"So, yeah there is."
Erm  things like whether I'm using my car and stuff I suppose I need to speak to Mike about?
I haven't done anything about that.
Right.
Erm
erm statutory undertakers?
Bus companies
Yes we'll need to write to all those and  we'll need to write  we need to write to the police
Yeah.
on  in two guises don't we?
Partly because we're doing a survey but partly to warn  partly because of the emergency services aspect.
Yeah.
"So we need to write to the police to er  I suppose the thing to do is we write in a general way to the, the Chief Constable, North Wales police"
Yeah.
which is I think in Colwyn Bay
Yeah it is.
"and  but when it comes to actually organising the police control of the survey sites, we, we speak to the erm  traffic inspector at wherever it is."
I'm not sure
Right so who did you say in Colwyn Bay?
What what
Just write to the Chief Constable.
I think we need to write three letters.
"One to the police, one to the ambulance, one to the fire brigade  just saying  we're proposing to do them."
Obviously that'll have to be when we've fixed the sites
Yeah.
and the dates are on.
Yeah we'll do this
But that's normal.
"general letter to the police saying that we're intending to do these surveys, just putting them in the picture and put a note in that erm  once, you know, dates and whatever, you know, we'll give you further details as and when we know"
"Well I wouldn't, I don't think I'd worry about writing to them until we've got the dates."
You will
the reason why we're the reason why we're doing this now is is to
Right.
try and achieve that objective.
Mm.
Not t to drop it straight on them but to say.
"look, this is one we're introducing this is the way we in in intend to use it."
Mm.
"I mean there might be the odd situation, the big job, where the Q S would need to go and"
Right.
get involved in the measures on some of your work.
Well he doesn't.
That's what I'm saying.
He hasn't done yet.
"You can't have that, he doesn't."
Have a word with Dave  and ask him himself
Dave Dave was a party to this s
"D Dave, Dave wrote this"
procedure.
did the change.
Well you may be certain he didn't consult with me.
Yeah.
And that's the point I'm making.
Mm.
"These procedures should be manag you know part of management consultation, not part of the  Dave writes it, if he like says, well that's what we'll do for B E S, and then, and then I'm told, oh, that's what we do for B E S, I tell staff, and that causes a great deal of unrest in staff."
Hey Jim why?
Why
back on him?
Jim.
Cos I haven't had an opportunity to do it to
"Why should B E S be a different, a different situation from bridges or works?"
"Well in, in theory certainly probably there is no reason for it, but in practice, it hasn't happened yet this is the point."
But he's such a dork I'm taking him off it.
And they're letting him keep linear.
Cos linear is just consignment stock and you know  job there.
"Sally  the lass who's taken over the buying for precision bearings, is a great lass got on great with her, and Richard."
"And they want to come and see the factory, they want to go to  yeah, it fell down cos Richard was too busy at the end of last year, fine get that sorted and i Sally was dropped in the crap by  right at the end of last year, came on  five sets of bearings, I could've done 'em in two weeks."
"I said I'll get you in two weeks, wallop wallop  It's alright,to do it, they have 'em back in a month."
"We're alright you know, they only way you'll get the business, he's like that, he talks like that, is if you can you know offer a big price saving."
That I'm afraid that's one thing you can't do
Alright.
even if it means that this year Yeah yeah.
Er
From my own point of view I want the business but bearing in mind what's happening I'm asking you before I do anything.
Erm I
Should I let the dust settle first?
Yes.
So I'll leave it.
E you either either leave it or
"If I quote three or four quid underneath, he'll consider it and we may get an order in a few months time when the schedule runs out."
Do you want me just to leave it?
"I think what you could sensibly say, to them, is, Look, I gather you've had supply problems with"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos I was there when it happened.
And s n a look you won't have supply problems with us.
Mhm.
"And you could say, look what we've done with ."
Yeah
Competitors of yours.
Yeah.
"Competitors of yours, wanted bearings in a week, we got 'em bearings in a"
The problem the problem is that's happened with the design people.
Yeah?
"turn that handle, see you later then"
"No I want a pound, lends us a pound Jo"
No
Yeah
No
Yeah
I haven't got a pound on me
Show us  can you lend us a pound?
No
Please
No
Please
"I haven't got any money Neil, I just told you"
Ah?

It's not mine either
Just give me your change then
I haven't got any change
"Well, how, your coppers, you must have a pound tucked away somewhere mum, mum"
"Have a game of something Neil, then you won't have to go into town will you?"
Not staying here with you  just because you're bored I ain't
I'm not bored
Eh?
Shut up parrot

Oh wowee
I didn't have to help you
"No you didn't, but you did"
er how often has it not
"You won't get any money, go away"
I only want one pound
Why?
It's been at the Playhouse in past years though.
"Oh, well maybe."
"No, it wasn't, wasn't at  last year was it?"
Was it?
Well last year I did it at Latton Bush .
"Well what, what's the date?."
The seventh.
The seventh of March.
"Erm, so that's going to be before our next meeting isn't it?"
"So erm, if anybody wants to help contact me  ."
"Yes, what time, how much is, how much the day is it all day?"
I haven't any details either than what she said .
No .
"Erm, shall we erm see, what shall we do about this, it's Saturday the seventh of March, on a Saturday"
As I say I'll take a stall and I'll be there all day if anyone can help me.
"Right , well perhaps I, perhaps people could as actually come and speak to me afterwards, if they, if they think they could help at all, that's International Women's Day and all the local organisations have been asked to take part"
"Certainly , it's, it's for your ."
It was quite good last year.
"Yes, and we could sell our products and that's sort of thing."
"Yeah our things ,."
And that's a good way of advertising our .
"Mm, right, we've got a list, ah, you probably know, there's a list, a list isn't there, of, of sort of sale products, have you had that at all?, thing that came with us, with your, with ."
No .
"Yes I got it, but you may not of had it."
"I will pass it on, I will pass it on to you."
"We, we sell quite a lot of Amnesty products, a lot, a lot of clothing in every"
on tonight.
Yeah.
"Tee-shirts and er sweat shirts and all sorts of things so we can take them along, so that's, that's Saturday the m , seventh of March, if you think you can help at all see Avriel afterwards."
have you got a date?
"Yeah, got a couple."
"Anything you  we got some of those things, tell me, I'll bring it along  ."
"I told her off for not let not telling us she was ill and she said no, no I'm fine."
She's got her friend Sandy staying with her
When's Gareth back?
"He was he was in the house, I didn't speak to him though."
I just spoke to Shirley.
"Erm, Sandy's staying with her for a few days."
What else did she say?
Did you say about us going down or not?
"No, I didn't mention it, at the moment."
She's got Sandy staying now
"I asked her about the letter and she said she couldn't remember anything about it but she filled in something when they came back from Belfast and she said open it, so I opened it and it's one of these things er if you book to go to Dublin before May the whatever, the end of May, then if you went again in the Autumn, you you get er fifty pounds worth of vouchers or something, you go half price."
It's one of those con things like they tried
"Well,"
"Yes,wh why, I mean why would she go to Dublin"
Dublin
before.
What else?
And why Dublin when i when they were
When they crossed from
when they crossed from Northern Ireland?
I don't know.
Cos they're trying to sell things all the time.
"Anyway, she doesn't want it."
Martin still hasn't got his erm invalidity pension sorted out but he's managing alright at the moment.
He's filled in all the things.
I forgot er I haven't watched the television at all and I forgot to record what d'you call that thing? with the devil in it?
Well it was half way through when I came in
I forgot to I know I forgot to record it for you.
I think I'll go to bed early tonight
Does that rain mean it's off the coast or it's in our area?
And was that minus one just the Western side or us as well?
We'll get to know better with the local news after this
Let's hope he gets off the floor.
"walking across roads a risk, ain't it."
Yeah.
It's ju just if you've got the nerve to do it.
"It's a risk with these buggers, what's in power, aye, it's no matter what whose in power."
I got
"I think if labour gets in, you'll not get it tough at all."
"I can tell you that, now."
Oohh.
What?
Oohh.
"You feel like  er, that's whose, like ex soldiers  throughout the company, and he said to Colin er, he said, how many people are you thinking about employ , our Colin seems to think there'd be enough work to keep 'im going, like, he says, he says, well how many people are you thinking about employing, he says, only only me and me  like, it's oh, oh, he says, there's plenty of work to keep two of going, he said, I thought you employed about six."
"So if he thinks that Colin do have six working for him, and he's got enough work for six, then surely there's gonna be plenty of work for two of 'em."
"Yeah, but what he means by six is, he gets the jobs done quicker"
"Yeah, but then you still got six wages to pay out, haven't ya."
Yeah.
That's it.
"He probably will have six later on, if he gets it off, but  the thing is, I mean, he'll need somebody to drive wagons round yard, and half the time,y you know, he'll be sat doing nothing, scratching his nose."
"Them's the people he's got to be wary of, the people that want a job, but don't wanna work for it."
"There's a hell of a lot in Broadway and Stainford,"
Yeah.
round about here.
"Mind Lee's a, Lee's a good worker, he says that, he wants, you know, best worker what he can"
"Yeah, but I mean, working for a mate, is different to working for a firm."
Yeah.
"You know, I mean"
"Well, he's not a mate, he won't, he's working with him when he were at er  over in Brad oh, here's Richard now."
"Aye, you'd better jump in bed with him,"
"Oh dear, no but he is, Richard is the one with the  comical magazine,laughing bursts two incomes."
I think that's part of
Yes.
"Look, slow down, or you're driving me mad."
One girl nearly got knocked off going up Newtown Road.
It's really quite narrow as you're going up there.
What about the  all the cars all parked round corners everywhere like up at Havers.
Mm.
They could do something about that.
Have you every cycled up there?
"Not round Havers,wh they park where those, those sort of shops are  they they park all around the corners so that you have to go out round them."
And of course you meet something coming the other way  wrong side of the road.
Oh yeah.
What annoys me is that everybody parks on the pavement as well.
Mm.
Seem to disobey all laws there are about parking.
"It does, it doesn't really help us does it?"
Do you wanna pass  these around as well if anyone wants to look.
All the replies  got eleven or so replies that I've had for that questionnaire.
There are a few people  willing to help  aren't.
"But I  haven't gone really as I hoped cos I'd envisaged having the membership list with sort of names of who'll make cakes, who'll help on the stall and then know who to phone"
Yeah.
"when I wanted some help or  who to invite to meetings but  because I haven't got a reply from everyone  or most people, it can't work does it?"
Is that all the replies you got?
sent more than fifty out.
I did sixty and Caroline copied even more .
She's a good girl.
Did Georgina reply?
"Erm  did actually, yes."
"Yeah, cos when I phoned she said she's still quite interested."
Mm.
Yeah I thought she was
but she said if the baby .
And  I've got a local group summer questionnaire which I couldn't really fill in.
. Isn't it awful!
I thought I'm just as bad as you know everybody else really.
Yeah.
And also for doing the programme.
Yeah?
"And you want a task schedule for organizing  this, it's a bit unspecific isn't it?"
Yeah.
Okay.
Erm  how is that then?
Er you happy to leave things as they are for the minute?
Carry on on that basis?
"Yeah, the only other thing like when you were saying about site layouts, if there's any maps  that we need, and that's including maps for coding, wall maps, you know, large scale."
Well obviously we've got to progress into that.
We need to prepare some  zone plans and gazetteers maybe.
Yeah.
"Erm  oh well I'll er the other thing I was thinking of is that er  we could be looking er  towards beginning, you know even now, to doing a trips network and things like that."
"There's no real reason why  you, say, shouldn't start to build up the data on that."
Yeah.
"Erm  y y you know you, you could do a diagram and presumably the person to speak to would be Billy or maybe Peter cos I think Peter did the bulk of the work."
Okay.
"Beverley did a lot of the actual sort of dogsbody work, you know, the actual doing of it."
Erm  so you need to build up a picture of what you've got  erm  but there's no real reason why we shouldn't be working on that now it seems to me.
Er in principle.
"Yes beginning, you know, we, we know what we're trying to do obviously we don't necessarily know every, every node in the network  erm  Cos obviously once you start doing that, or when we start doing tr the, the journey run  things erm we're going to need to know what we're wanting."
So there'll be two sides of it c er
"Well there, there won't be any  will there?"
Erm
Mm.
But anyway I mean it's all part of the picture.
"What I'm getting at is there's no reason why we need, we should wait until after the surveys to start looking at trips."
Which is what happened on Ormskirk.
Mind you it was partly because we didn't get a programme.
"But there's no reason, and on  as well."
Alright?
that yeah can I answer that
Andrew.
Now you would court martial them well I put it to the S I B
S I B what's that?
That's the Special Investigation Branch .
Special Investigation Branch.
"All the allegations I made, all the beatings I took, I'm bleeding  they investigated nothing, and what the brigadier said, the brigadier is talking nonsense."
He knows that the Army is w widespread in the Army and he .
"It's like everything else you  company commander, you tell him, he throws it out the window."
He sends you away  make you feel happy
"Do you know I've served in the Army for thirty three years and I've commanded every thing at every level in the infantry which both these gentlemen have been in, from a platoon right up now to a brig er brigade and I can honestly tell you that I haven't seen more than a couple of incidents of bullying in the whole of that time ."
You're a commissioned officer
The point is the point is that's that's a good point what you've said you don't see it.
That's the whole point.
You come at a barrack room as an officer
Mm.
"or a corp it doesn't matter,"
Mhm.
You'll see it.
with rank on your arm
Yeah.
the soldiers i that room will act a different way
I I agree.
when the door shuts
I understand that.
a different way again
they will .
"I can understand that , I can understand that."
But it's a matter leadership.
And leadership in the Army is some
Leadership has got nothing to do with it whatsoever.
Leadership
"And we just, he knew a lot of the, he was interested in si singing and he just knew the words and and just sang round about the house."
Mhm.
And he just sang too.
You know that's how he he learnt.
So what were his favourite songs?
"Oh dear, he was  what would you say, I don't know  He liked the kind of  ballads, er he was a more a kind of bay he liked a ballad, so I really couldn't tell you who was his favourite singer or anything like that, just if a song interested him he just"
What do you mean by ballad kind of songs?
"Well more the slow, er songs, not the fast."
The love songs and things like that ?
Things like that.
Mhm.
"but I I never sang anywhere, I just sang round the house as well."
Mhm.
And it was really er I think it was really the pantomimes that I started singing
Was it?
"here, oh yes."
I never I never went out
Were you were you in the drama clubs here when you were younger then as well?
"I was in the  Drama Club when I was when I stayed at home, but we didn't do pantomimes, we we did plays, one act plays, and three act plays, we did three act plays."
We never did pantomimes.
"And er  but that's the only time, you sang at weddings."
"So I said, Come on Mabel, sing."
Or my father would sing
So how long did you live in  for?
"We've , into the village, we lived out in the countryside till I was eight, and we come down into the I should say town shouldn't I, we come down into the town when I was eight and I was there till I was twenty two, and I came up here, when I got married."
"Mhm, is Leslie from this part of the country?"
"Les is from  oh well he was, I think he was three when he came up here."
"He lived in, he was born in Castle Douglas."
Mhm.
But I think he was three when his father was sh came up here to work.
What did his father do when he came here?
"Electrician, you know he still worked for the the electricity board ."
"It does actually say together with other said officers and committee members as shall be determined by a general meeting, so if we wish to elect or choose somebody else we can do."
"Erm, but there's be a good idea to have"
She's taken someone's .
"Well I think, we'll, we'll see what, we'll see what comes, if somebody else wishes to compete, compete for the Chair, the post of Chair, erm, then you may perhaps like to invite them to share the Chair with you, or, or, they can become the, the Vice Chair."
"Erm, erm, only too willing to welcome competition cos they're all to aware of my short comings, mm."
Mm.
"Erm, so."
"Well, if, if there isn't anybody else who wishes to  compete with you for the Chair, er, then I think there ought to be a Vice Chair."
Yeah.
Right.
"Now the other thing about, about the meeting is erm, we sometimes arrange for sort of special refreshments or something different in that line, it's at Ann's house, erm do you want, do you want us to do anything about that Ann or?"
"Yeah, interested in any spare wine glasses please."
Sorry?
"Bring some spare wine glasses, I've , I've got some wine glasses."
Wine glasses
"What we have, wine and soft drinks and"
What you want six?
Cheese and biscuits?
"A little bit of that yes, to have afterwards mm?"
.
Cracker wheat.
Cheese
.
"Cheese and biscuits, she's saying."
"What do, do you want help with that Ann, would you like people to bring some or, or, or what?"
.
"Mm, well confir you can confirm with Mary, I think Mary's offer to  possibly."
"Shall I, shall I leave you and Mary to sort that out?"
Okay.
"Between you, mm, mm."
What date is it?.
"I'm not sure what date it is, I haven't got it on here have we really."
Did he come with the start of the scheme then really?
"No well it wasn't the scheme he worked on, he would go round and sort your cooker or you know he was that, maintenance, the maintenance side."
"Er other thing, and they lived down there opposite the garage, that was the electricity board house then."
So would that be about er the late fifties or something you would you came here then yourself?
I ca I came here in nineteen sixty one.
Sixty one.
Mhm.
"That's when I got married, nineteen sixty one, I came up."
What did you think of  when you came ?
"Well it was just a quiet wee village just  I had come, wasn't much different it was quiet as well."
Mhm.
And er there wasn't there wasn't much difference really.
"Everybody was very friendly, it didn't matter whether you were an incomer or not, they always spoke."
Mhm.
You got to know people  very quick  in .
"That was one thing about the village, and your your neighbour would where Jane is the now, I don't think she'll have hardly seen her neighbour in Dumfries, but here they were always you know"
You couldn't get away from them.
Oh they were in or out.
So did you do any singing when you came here first?
What was the first kind of thing you got involved in ?
"Oh the rural choir, I forgot about that, yes, I joined the rural choir and ."
"And er I couldn't sight read or anything like, I can't sight read."
"But I can remember once when I was at the school Mrs  was our music teacher and we were to go from doh to far, you know doh to far, and they used to s , she used to say listen to Mabel, Mabel's the only one one of you that can go from doh to far."
But er  so when we came Mrs  the sight reading of course I was lost because she used to
Is that Mrs John ?
No Mrs Billy.
Billy.
She used to take the rural choir.
How long had it been going then when you came?
"Oh it had been going for quite some time, I don't know really when they would start."
Was it all ladies ?
"Mhm, yes, oh aye, all ladies."
"I think Buckingham Palace is lovely compared to Westminster Palace, beautiful old stone and the, and the shape of it and it's windows, it's beautiful  huge of course, there again the court then had loads and loads of er, there were ten ."
..
"And a lot of the Government, Governing people of the country  Oh it is a bit chill and damp isn't it?"
Did you mention anything to your dad about wanting to watch  Dances with Wolves?
"Ah, I wouldn't of imagine for one second he would want to watch, so it might be better if I buy the video and see"
"No, no ,"
you can watch it at your
why you gonna get something
heart's delight.
"something more adventure, I don't want to buy it, I may, I may not be that keen on it"
"Well you know, in that case you'll have to wait until he goes away somewhere for the evening."
"Didn't like Fantasia, where I can listen to the music and watch them."
"Oh, we'll see what's going on, have a look ."
I would like to see Dances with Wolves  he'll probably be asleep any way Dinda.
He puts the Variety Performance on he'll go to sleep.
Mm
"He's actually been out of his armchair today long enough to erm, spend ten minutes putting a washer on the hand basin in the loo."
"Oh,"
"And you could of done that last weekend,."
"Should of done, yeah"
I owe a letter to Dida.
Mm.
"I don't know whether I owe one to Madge or not, probably I do."
Mm..
"She owes me a letter, thank heavens, somebody who owes me a letter instead of vice versa."
Can't remember whether I owe Madge a letter or she owes me one.
Here dog.
He's probably having a visit   run like bat out of hell good gracious.
Oh look.
Oh sorry.
"Hello magpie, there's two of them  Ooh come on, come try again."
". Are there's a playful one coming, ah, been called away what a shame."
Well when when it was first read by erm  it was mentioned that it had been written by the Green Party by radio four and the Guardian and the Independent.
And as far as I know that's the only coverage I've seen personally of it.
"Well I s I saw an article in erm the Green Alliance, a fairly shadowy organization , er mentioned in their newsletter."
It was it was erm promoted by the association of conservation of energy.
Mhm.
So I rang them up .
But that's yeah I haven't seen much.
Yeah it's supported by the
Well no they said they said prepared by er
Oh right.
What is the Green Alliance?
I don't really know.
I don't know who they get their money from but they.
I mean they used to provide the advisor to various secretaries of state I think didn't they?
Ooh
I don't know who they are really.
They send out this newsletter anyway.
But I mean the main the main I mean in it in certain quarters we've been down playing that aspect of it simply to get it through.
Sure.
But er all of the main organizations that have  you know World Wide  and Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth and so on and Age Concern.
They all know they were all told that it's it's all a bit above board.
But in promoting it to MPs we've been drawing their attention to the kinds of organizations which in turn in their eyes just sort of represent that pyramid or structure of votes that .
And of course when it goes through they already have our our as it were
Yeah.
With a bit of luck and careful handling.
"And the MPs who who asked to put it forward including Alan  they they had to you know they came to Ron  to ask, Can we put your bill forward."
They all know Ron anyway .
He's a very old hand in lobbying er which shows it's how it's we've got it this far.
Mm.
Because he's known this labyrinth  rubbish that they cling to.
Okay shall we move on to billboards?
Mm.
They seemed quite wide to me when they were leaning against the wall.
Wouldn't Sue do them?
She hasn't got a
hasn't she?
"I bet she had, I bet she had er"
no I know she's got a
You really want one with a three
I thought she had a band saw no
I was gonna say you wobbling all over the place aren't you?
And what about Duckman Peters wouldn't they do it for you?
"Er, mm, the other time I took stuff down there"
"huge, to that their costs mm"
I'll have to pay
mm you've got to pay for the teeth and the saw
thirty pound a tooth
"Yeah, god worse than"
erm
"mm, how many have you got to now cut?"
"and you mean to tell me with all that equipment the machine that they've got at the college, you couldn't get it done there?"
"I haven't got anything that deep, the"
only goes to about five inches
"What can you do, can you do half at a time, can you"
No
Why?
"at one time you could of done, but now, you've got to take the guards off"
To reverse them
and turn it over
"Well I don't see how, all you've got to do is turn it upside down, you could still run it through the same way"
To make your first cut
Yeah
you have to take the guard off and the
"knife at the back of the saw, they, it is a bit dangerous, erm  where's the guard goes at the top"
So that's what words are about.
Now brr any anybody here like me from Yorkshire?
No you're from slightly further north.
You're from Yorkshire?
Sometime ago
"Sometime ago right so you may catch this, and you're from slightly further north than that I think?"
Right okay.
Anybody from the Liverpool area?
No no okay.
If I said to John and Joanne erm that I saw a boy running up the ginnel no you understand?
You do you do?
Yeah
I know what you said but I dunno what a ginnel is.
Okay a snicket
I don't know what a snicket is either
No
No
Yes
But I know what you're saying
"Alright yeah, okay you see the point that that it's it's words  what the heck's he talking"
No no I know exactly
"Oh you did, yeah it's it's er no but I mean in terms of the actual word you don't know what it is"
No
er it's it's about geography isn't it? er coming from different areas of the country.
Right let me just explain then just just for the sake of completeness.
"erm in the days when they had terraced houses back to back terraced houses erm well anywhere in the country I guess but but where I come from it was fine for the people who lived with their doors on the on the road but the people who lived at the other side of the block they couldn't get from the road so every so often down the down the terrace they had a little alley way  an entry I think you'd probably call it in Scotland, don't they?"
We  talking about this and I was saying about coming from construction I says I've says I've to go up the cut like
Oh the cut yeah
"Where I call the cut, and he's going the cut what cut that's the canal I says  up the cut between  the two the two buildings she said no that's the alley"
"That's the alley, yeah, or the ginnel or the snicket you know or in Liverpool they call it a jigger"
Or the cut
"Yeah so you see the point, if you're making a presentation and you use words like that based on where you come from the geography you know your regional variations then it's a bit it's a bit difficult for er effective communication isn't it?"
"Er, Brian , is also a regional director for Belfast and the serving areas of Belfast as well, okay?"
"He has sole responsibility for Belfast, but he does have regional directors going to  but Brian tends to cover a general manager role and  with  with erm  Dick ma ,."
"No, not Dick , who's in er  Belfast?"
"Tom, Tom ."
Yeah.
"And er  himself, run the Belfast operation  across all the regions."
"But sometimes, because he doesn't have hundreds of depots I think he's not regional, but that's my own fault."
Brian  is the Northern Ireland region.
Well done.
"Do get a, er buy a map, spend some money to get one."
You may have in your depot  you may have in your depot a map which  have pinpointed the T N T depots.
"Does any, has anybody seen one yet?"
Yeah.
The big wa waterproof one which you can draw on?
Yes.
Yeah.
"They're, er, well they're not waterproof"
Well
but they're coated aren't they?
"Er, so you can wipe them clean if er, you use a special pen."
"But, what I'm saying is, if you, salesmen particularly get one, you'll need one to get round the country  your patch, but you need to get familiar with the towns up and down the country  for deli , for delivery, cos your customers will talk about the area and you're talking to someone from a transport café, you haven't got a clue where the towns are."
"I mean, you know, where's your credibility?"
And write down erm  it.
"I know north of border, nothing happens south of the border and like but, but we do deliver down here so  do, do give yourself a little practise of that."
Now  I'm going to ask you to do another little test for me.
"Simple questions, ten questions, alright?"
"Do you want ta , tidy up your little bit of paper out the way again?"
And there's ten questions about the conditions of carriage.
Name on the top of the list.
Now  how many people have not seen a list of the
carriage yet?
Er erm
"Okay, I think, I think that is, that is a point."
"Again, that came up this morning as well."
That
"Shakespeare's so central to our heritage i you learn him at O level, you learn him at A level, you get used to him."
"Erm  he's part of our language  and, and therefore, you know, to go on to Johnson it's very different."
"Like you say, it takes much more time to get into it."
But I think Johnson does make it harder for us.
There are no characters to get involved with  as the there are in  in Shakespeare.
We can't really imagine ourselves  you don't really have sympathy for any of the characters in the .
They're all  fairly sort of silly characters.
"Whereas in, in Twelfth Night or whatever, we might actually feel involved within the, the people in the play."
Certainly .
"Okay, well I'll leave all those up there."
"Erm  can you look at scene, act four, scene five in my edition."
Now I discovered this morning there is actually act four scene three in some people's editions.
Okay?
"Erm, so act fi act four, scene five."
"And the stage direction at the beginning of this, enter Doll in her bitter talking with Sir Epicure Manhom."
Has everybody got that scene?
Enter Doll in bitter talking with Sir Epicure Manhom.
Okay.
Can you divide yourself up into groups of four first of all please?
"I'll do it for you if you, you want?"
And leave a bit of space.
Right.
"For those who aren't totally sort of in control of the plot  and I probably should include myself as one of them, what's happening in this scene I want you to act out."
What's happening in this scene?
"Doll  is a prostitute, okay?"
First things first.
"Who is working with  Sottle  who's planning to be the alchemist, okay?"
So he's probably fiddled a lot of things  to get money from people.
"The alchemist is getting money, I'm sorry, for people who know this  inside out, but I'll just explain it."
All round erm it was great.
We had our presence.
It's a very effective direct piece of lobbying and at a time when a lot of people who obviously weren't Green Party supporters behind the campaign.
The cross party campaign for the for the bill which we've written.
So.
the only political party ever to have two pieces of legislation in the House of Commons without having any M Ps.
I'd just like to second that it was a good day and also to point out as the er man who made the postcards we shouldn't get too excited about this as a money making scheme.
Because most of that three pounds thirteen's probably been paid for out hundreds of sheets of cardboard.
So.
But considering considering we were we were
Didn't make a loss.
I held ten fifteen pounds for the privilege.
relation thing.
Every time I do a stall I I quake in my boots up until I do it and then I feel great when we're doing it and afterwards realize that it's been  productive and we we've had a good lot a good response from the public.
So there we go.
Helen do you want to tell us about the next stage?
Yes.
Seeing as we all filled in our postcards ages ago we can write some more letters this week.
Or tomorrow.
I can give you a list of people to to write to.
First of all there's Robert Atkins M P.
This is the man who erm replaced erm Mr Yeo
Oh yes.
with his trousers down.
"Now I think erm Ron  was a bit upset because he spent most of of Christmas sending  Christmas cards and saying, Please please let this bill go through don't give it any ."
"And he said, Oh alright then what's your wife like."
Erm however
No that's right.
Erm Tim erm you know having desi have design?resigned  he was followed by Robert Atkins MP for South Riddle.
Now Mr Atkins former job is as Minister in Northern Ireland so he's unlikely to know a lot about what was going on in the in the Commons at the end of last session which is a bit unfortunate.
He's been hiding under a under an agreement.
He should at least be a very effective man.
"I I I think really they er  they forget that that there's a  quite a large number of the population, they do think about what's going on, and they're not all children and they're not  and aren't all that easy  easily persuaded."
"But, having said that  there is  but there are, but there as well!"
"No but I mean,the there's but there's a lot of people, you see  when you say they're not easily persuaded  that  are working class  that are voting Tory  and they're not easily persuaded they cha"
"Well they did, I"
just changed their mind!
Mm.
Well  having  seen a little bit  erm  was on the other day and I I mean I  I must admit I touch  shut up you!
Nothing to do with you!
"A lot of what's erm  you know, going on now, I mean, is just gonna go off as far I'm concerned cos I mean I've already made up my mind."
Yeah.
I'm a loyal supporter!
Well that's it!
And that's it!
"But erm  you know o , I mean it's, there's so much analysis and what not, I mean I I think most, most people must do the same  a lot of them have made their minds up and the ones who haven't  either don't really care"
No!
"or  they're so serious about it that they'll probably be watching everything, you know, just to sort of make sure that they know everything about"
Yeah.
every party!
Yeah.
And making sure I get the right one.
"But I think the majority of them just won't bother anyway, to watch"
No.
they've already made their minds up  and a and definitely a lot of people vote on on  on basically the choice
On the spur of the mom on the spur
Well
"of the moment, on the day"
think well they've had long enough now we'll  we'll have a switch you know
"Or or the  they like the look of the bloke, they like his photograph"
and they'll go and vote for him!
That's right.
"And I mean there's that been that much  publicity about Neil Kinnock  you know, or anti  Neil"
Yeah.
But they would never take 'em out for day
"No, I know."
"But they would fetch 'em and pay for them, and I even today, you cannot buy love."
No.
"And it's proven my point, our Dawn wouldn't even think about  there."
Our our Corinne goes round when she got to.
Don't think about what.
Our Corinne don't only go round when she got to.
She goes round
Goes round  weeks ago.
"Well, she won't go and stop."
Said she won't go and stop again.
Who's gonna stop then.
When we were all on about stopping
"I don't mind going and doing her shopping and bits, she says, I'm not stopping."
Yeah.
"When you were on about that love, what pa was saying about, you know, like every night, that our kids, when, they had their pyjamas on, and they're like, to get hold,I'm lying watching television, I'm usually falling asleep, but I put the kids,you know."
"And er, last time I I get in touch, me mum told me,turned round and says to me, I don't want  any more mum, I says why, he says, oh she won't let me have pillow  and then I then I think if summat else  brought to light, I  kill her"
Yeah.
if she had come in
Yeah.
"and that, I know it's a filthy old thing, but it it's comfort ain't it."
Yeah.
"And when they start  let them have the pillow down, they don't feel, they can't get comfortable."
"I know it's a little bit trivial like, but it's just, it's still"
She has queer ways me mother.
"Karen I I'm forty-seven and I can't work me mother out, so, no chance for you working her out, few years you've known her."
"No no, I I, I mean, she's always been alright with me really, I mean,y you know, she's not  not at all mother-in-law, she's not"
"Well, me and me mum's, me and me me mum's never been close."
"It were always like, me and our Colin were more or less with me dad, and our Margaret and John were more or less for me mum."
"Then when they got older, me dad sort of took our John on, because our John were mechanical minded, and our Colin got pushed out a bit, 'cos our Colin weren't interested in cars."
I found this.
oh shit.
"said, he said, yeah, he said, it'll be ideal in here, he said, I can put, he said, put a full lock on door, and he said, I can come in here, he said,and so I thought, ah."
"Yeah but, there's not many people that you can"
"Sasha, behave."
I don't think I know anybody that hundred per cent 'appy.
"Well, I think it's got a lot to do with the climate we're living in, you know,"
Rushing about
"There's that much, there's that many people out of work, there's and"
"you know, there's that many pressures on people."
"I mean, it's like like Colin and I, I mean, like we're happy but then, no were not hundred per cent happy at all,But like, er, like some people I can't  if you get upset, some people eat more, some people eat less, or you know, some go into recluse, some get  and like Colin,"
"he's when he's depressed, he's goes like a raving sex mania, he"
"I'm bloody glad Albert don't, he'll drive me  out of a bed."
"He takes all, takes all his"
Why didn't you stop
No I think every
I think everybody's got themselves summat some faults.
Nobody's hundred per cent perfect.
"I mean, I don't think Colin's unhappy where he wants to do, then an offers an offer, like either they go in and make  share, but if they work all day."
"No, it's not er, it's so much  I mean, he's at work all day,and he works all bloody hours that God sent, when they want, when they got down,"
Yeah.
and what happens.
"He's got to build an office where he can go and let, sit in it, can't abide"
That's right.
Summat wrong somewhere.
Now look at our Margaret and Peter.
"They've got no family, so they've got no pressures like that, they haven't got any money problems  well they're not 'appy."
They live two entirely separate lives.
"Yeah, I know."
There's is just a marriage of er convenience.
Convenience.
Innit it.
"Yeah, it's convenient"
"Come on, there are rude words in there."
I mean
I grinned at farts.
Good!
Okay.
"Brunt, and a bit of a  at the moment."
Erm
"I mean Shakespeare did not, correct me if I'm wrong, use words like fart and, certainly doesn't use words like fuel gauge, have a leg over things like that, and things like, okay?"
So it's rude language.
Which is funny.
"I mean, we are all er very sympathetic at the end of the twentieth century, but, you know, we can still laugh when somebody says fart on stage."
Erm  there are other examples of that.
"You'll be glad to know that  in line four and five,What to do?"
"Lick figs out of my   he's actually saying lick piles  from my  and, you know the audience replies  fig  fig ."
"And the actor could, you know, draw attention the part of the anatomy he's talking about."
"I mean, this is not"
"this is not his sense of humour but it is visual, it involves the audience."
"Like, if you break off a line like, lick figs out of my  something, you're getting the audience going because the audience is supplying the  rude bits."
Okay?
Any other  things that were a problem about that clip?
Okay.
Forget that funniness.
Why is it different from Shakespeare?
What's the difference between that opening scene  and say the opening scene  in Twelfth Night or Winter's Tale?
Were they di different?
There's no asides  view.
Right.
That's another problem actually I hadn't thought of that.
"It's all  but everybody's  erm  everybody's involved from the word go, so  and the structure the  so think about that point."
"No, are no asides."
"Erm  I suppose there are later on in the play er th characters speak to each other and say very good that stupid berk over there kind of aside, but  what you don't get is  any structures of characters  as such."
You never get told what different characters are like  in th er by somebody else.
And that's looking up towards  up there.
"But the house is in quite good order, it has been extended."
"And that's er from the front view, I didn't go wandering in."
But that was the entrance to the station originally.
"Er  I don't know whether that's listed or not, but er I'm surprised it's still there frankly."
"So as I say, very very very er prominent building."
There's a little weighbridge or or office.
Er in somebody's garden.
And er you can just walk down either side of it.
Er onto the trail.
That's one of the see the old railway building there.
Erm looking up er the er line or that is looking from the bridge erm that's going down towards er th the just it it it er cur curved round to to meet the er the line er an and the s and the station was was here.
Just along the road.
Er that was erm  station just along here.
And that's a line from  between quite er steep er in quite a steep cutting.
"Looking towards  again from the bridge over the main road, er as one gets er near near ."
"Now moving on a little bit further, I know the talk said that I was only going up to er to , but I'm just going a little bit further."
We've cut across the er A six one four here.
Erm at the white post.
"Er and er  the line came from  over here, and on that embankment there was a bridge here, er but they farmer has er removed that embankment, but has still left this part."
And there's some still some one or two rather nice little bridges.
"Er still extant, and er now I rather like the architecture."
Erm and so I wandered up there and had a look at it and photographed.
"Interesting four four arch bricks, and er and and very nice stonework."
"And the copings there, the retaining walls."
"You can see the brickwork there, Nicely done and er very attractive for again for modelling purposes."
"Going a little bit further, I'm only er just a couple here."
"That's up erm near Not a very good picture that, erm but a er L M S eight er eight F, up near  that is."
On a er coal train going towards er towards .
And that's a an L M S crab also at .
"Again on a on a special, going towards Skegness probably, at a guess."
Now what's going the other way?
"historically with  what's happened is, the  design from Japan was taken under licence"
Yeah.
and they were based around  and and  designs.
Yeah.
"Now on the five fifty series for example, it's an  complete cartridge spindle on the twelve thousand revs, yeah?"
And we get you know so Anthony  would get that business.
Because complete spindles come under the precision range of products .
Yeah.
This is something I was trying to get clarified but I don't care really as long as somebody gets it.
Erm  but what happened then is er  tended to get the main bearing supply for the normal spindles that  manufactured and built.
Mm.
"And that was a set of three angular contact ball bearings, and then a N N thirty double row roller at the rear."
"Er we're now doing this partnership which was what today was about, about the new generation spindle."
Yeah.
"Erm so that's going great, I think that's really going well so the new design, I think we're well in on."
"Erm the old on that you know, took me two years to get the bearings approved and er you know but then having to wait a year and a half cos  had a year and a half's worth of orders on 'em and promised to hold the price for three years is that's what it took for them to use them up, er has run out, new orders have been put on  but I've got the chance of taking the business."
"Er but erm obviously with the  thing again, I wanted er obviously"
What was the
"you don't to go to 'em for  and they say, well you just took the bloody off me, I want a cut in me ."
Yeah.
This is this is
You know I don't want to be seen to be
This is clearly er erm a situation where erm we must not knowingly take business which we have not enjoyed before at a price below
No at a price below  the existing suppliers ninety four prices.
Now when erm you say  are supplying at the moment.
Mhm.
Yeah.
"The problem is Dave , the buyer at , is worse than Ken   ."
He's a real dipstick.
Yeah?
W his last comment.
"Wh what happened is, Richard  was the team section leader, Dave  historically looks after the bearings sales."
"Maybe just locally, at local garages but as far as, far as being the all national or anything like that, there was never  anything I  with the tramcars."
"Were the erm the relations with the bosses and the workers quite good, on the ?"
"Very good, very good."
Oh.
"Even with the inspectors too, there was always a good er  going with the, the people in those days."
Mhm.
And was this quite a well paid job?
"Well it erm it was average, it was average."
Yes.
And er did you have to work like erm shifts and things like that?
Oh yes.
Ex exactly the same as  going to the present day.
You had the split shifts and the down shifts and maybe we were called for er a
"What did you do after you left, you left the trams?"
After I left the trams then er I went er I went away to East Kilbride.
I used to work for a certain er c er creamery there.
Er
"getting milk, separating milk er pasteurizing milk and  like that."
Was East Kilbride one of the erm one of the new towns?
"it was er now it was, now at the start of the new town er present East Kilbride a new town, it was known as a new town and it was just starting to build up."
And I had better chances of getting a proper house for myself and my family which was then two daughters and my wife and I.
So we actually went there to better ourselves and try and get a h a reasonable house to sort of live in and
Was there a lot of encouragement given to people to move out  premises?
"Oh yes, at that time there was, yes."
Oh yes.
If they accepted it of course.
"Was it er easy finding a job at that time as well, in the, in the new towns?"
Oh yes.
"It was being that the, the Rolls Royce  Saturday, came in to East Kilbride and, and American firms like that were coming along."
Singer sewing machines and sort of things like that.
"They were all coming into East Kilbride, there was b cos after all there was starting off a new town and they was building up then from it."
What were the erm conditions like in the creamery where you worked?
"Yes, well course I."
The scenery and photography and everything suppose to be absolutely wonderful.
Yes that's worth it .
.
A lot of our modern hol
Hello Max.
"Modern   Come on, no she hasn't got anything for you,."
"Come on, come on, come on."
"You know, it, it makes me smile sometimes when I say  come and try the mo modern politic approach to your ache, ache's and pains, your ailments."
.
"Most of it comes  think so, I mean so much of it comes from the North American Indians that"
Mm.
"and right back into the er, the Keltic legions and the medieval monks."
"That's right, there's certainly a ."
"That's what I said to you, your dad when he didn't want to take Aspirins for his restrained back, and him, don't believe in these drugs and I said look, if a monk gave you this he'd, he'd give you the bark of a birch tree, pound it up in a pestle and water and you'd think it was magic  and you'd take it and you, relax your muscles, is that what it is?,"
I said yes that's what Aspirin is originally  birch bark.
"Well of course they used to use the poppy, for people in great pain"
"Oh yeah,."
"amputations, child birth  gosh the leaves are thick."
"Mm, they're lovely aren't they?"
When ever I see these big leaves you know these big ones
Yes.
they remind me of when I was at school.
"Sycamore oh, sycamore and  ."
"used to get told to go out in the Autumn and we used to get told by the, used to get taken out by the teacher into some woods and you would have to collect the leaves ."
Actually I
"Could always , could always see if  biggest, biggest leaves like these you know,."
"That is a Sycamore cos it isn't a, there isn't a conker tree around here that's Sycamore, there they are, that's it, that's a Sycamore tree, beautiful colour  These are  Dances with Wolves."
"Oh, it's  in shop."
If it's
.
"If it's good, erm, can I say truthful background of the Indians ."
I didn't have to say anything.
"I said to him  I don't know, he said  did you enjoy yourself Tuesday?"
"Oh I said, did you see us?"
Oh yeah we saw you.
And his dad's nice.
Yeah.
But that other bloke was there but he wasn't in his normal place.
Yes
Why wasn't he in his normal place?
Palace played really well.
"The first twenty five minutes, when you think we were one nil up right I thought gosh  if we could get that second goal it would have made all the difference and United would have been really would have been in trouble."
Was a good game though.
"Oh I enjoyed it, yeah."
"Just don't enjoy Palace losing, but   sheer football   and it just shows you that ironically the two games can match each other and there were chances for Palace to wrap that game up."
But er  when they do play that ball to ball  business erm
Yeah.
we look like we've got huge spaces in our  in our midfield.
"I mean  that's what teams are doing now, they're realizing that's where all our weakness is in midfield  so  don't take a er a hefty boot and try and er er  people like Thorn and  I mean Thorn and Young were impeccably  they played beautifully today."
"You cannot ask Thorn and Young, I've never seen two players play  they do, they did th , they do the simple thing  but they do it consistently well."
"Over and over again, maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty times in one match and they'll make one mistake and usually like Coleman was there to c , I think Coleman backed up well and Gareth  backed up well once or twice."
But defence wise  superb.
"Absolutely su , there was a lapse with that guy, don't know who was to blame about that third goal but I mean"
It was Young.
Er Young let it plop over
"Oh, didn't see who it was."
"It was like, it was like a, like they were waiting for an offside or some there were just couldn't believe, it was"
But it was the same when Palace scored and exactly the same thing happened didn't it?
Why do they lapse?
It's weird.
"Yeah, it's  well they do say both sides that it's the most dangerous time straight after a goal."
"I mean often, times you see teams equalize immediately."
"You know it's like, you sometimes you can go a whole game like seventy minutes of a game and no-one's had a goal scoring chance"
"Cos that's what happened to Brian, you know when Brian had his Orion nicked?got stopped in"
the cars or something?
Little Sutton  cars.
"And then, it's taking him ages to get"
Has he got it now though?
Yeah.
But er the things that they were doing were just unbelievable.
Erm you know to get the chassis numbers and that.
"buying old  say a scrapped  a written off Sierra you know, picking them up cheap for about a thousand quid from the scrappy"
Yeah.
"and then getting all the  the chassis numbers and that and welding them on to these stolen cars and    Because what, you know, er Siobhan's dad had a, bought a Montego  and  I don't know how it came about but they discovered that erm it had a diff I mean it's had a Maestro engine in it and it had  this that and the other."
And er they had to repossess it and he was paying .
"And I don't know how, what's happened about it now but at the time he was still having to pay for it"
Mhm.
even though they'd taken the car.
"there was a woman there that erm  the  police do this service thing where they'll look a car over for you, if you bought a car that you know has been er  in an accident and it's been"
Yeah.
they will have a look at it over  and check it over.
"And there was a woman on it, she had a really nice Orion, a J reg."
"Anyway when they  had a good look at it the front half was an Escort  and the back half was an Orion, half a stolen car."
You know they hadn't even matched the same bloody  type of car.
There's not really a lot of difference though is there between
There is
"Well there isn't and I I said to Mike what did it look like, you know?"
He said it was nice.
But when they're doing these welding jobs they haven't got them on those things so  as they're doing it like it's all moving and
Yeah.
Yeah they're totally
it was just a complete bodge.
I if you're driving along you can throw out the balance of the car.
Yeah.
"Well it was that erm one in Manchester, that crash  you know there was three people killed in the middle of Manchester wasn't there?"
"If they're blue, so am I"
I wonder if that miniature rose is gonna come up
"the w the one in the tub, no."
"Oh yeah, the one in the tub looks ok, it's the other one."
"I like the other one best as well, it's the peach one."
When're you going to prune them?
"Well, when I plant that other one where you want it planted, that's"
I wonder when er  going to have the erm
wheel barrow ready
Yes.
"Oh, it said in yesterday's paper that someone had had a wheelbarrow valued at thirty pounds stolen from her back garden and it was somewhere at , where the back gardens aren't particularly accessible."
"So ours must have cost, I'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds cos it didn't it didn't say a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything, it just said a wheelbarrow"
Well there was er four
So we'll have to get it
Those four tapes incidentally  Tchaikovsky.
I sold them for fifteen pounds.
What four tapes?
The four tapes  sold them for fifteen pounds in
That who sent you?
That Shirley and Gareth sent me for Christmas
Oh.
I wish you would think of something you would like for your birthday
"I've told you, I want a  you need binoculars to go to Rome with"
I can't see very well through binoculars
The Cistine Chapel.
Unless we take those big ones with us.
"Oh Jim, they're too heavy"
"It doesn't need an easier camera, it needs you"
"What happens with that camera, you've got to rewind it every time."
"There's better ones now, automatic rewind, that's what I need."
You have never sat down and read
It's the rewind that's the problem
"I'm no longer, yes."
"The next, the next question is is jealousy another powerful promoter of family black sheep."
I'm not quite sure what that means.
Is is is is jealousy another power promoter of family black sheep.
"It is jealousy that pushes people into being  black sheep, into er doing something which is not acceptable."
"Yes, I think it can  part of it."
Mm.
Mm.
"You know one sees, rightly or wrongly, that the other one is having preferential treatment."
"Yeah, yeah."
And getting attention seeking.
"It could well have been the jealousy of the older brother, what caused him to be thought of as a black sheep."
"Black sheep, yes, yeah  So jealousy is quite powerful, could could be the driving force, between sons, yes."
sons.
In those days when there's land expected.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"This, by the way, erm, it it is applied with this study, and that is during the thirties, particularly on the, well it it actually carried on into the forties, but but the, there was a almost a  character in many plays, where one one character was, in effect, the family black sheep."
"Erm, there was  in Eden End, erm, there was another character in erm,there was a further one in"
"Oh, yes."
Yeah.
"Now, all these were black sheep, they were the nicest of the lot, and there was no, they were the ones you turned to, if you wanted to discuss your troubles."
"Not the other respectable brigade, and indeed in Eden End, the whole play turns on the jealousy of the sister, who remained at home."
Mm.
"The the family black sheep, the other sister went, er, er, left home to go on the stage."
"But of course, when she came back, all sorts of things began to happen, that's by the way."
"One other little point, in Brideshead Revisited, there's a character who never appears, she's always spoken about, and thwarted and that is  the man who Brideshead marries, and she says, talking to Julia, Julie was no better than she should have been."
"You know, she says, in every Catholic family, er, there is always a relapse person, and it's usually the nicest."
Aw.
Mm.
So even Evelyn Waugh's  told this story.
"Yes,"
"Yes, yes, yeah."
.
"Yes, I I think, in cer in in most cases that would happen, wouldn't it, if if if the child starts off with a feeling of insecurity, with possible instability."
Mm.
Then a powerful father is going to make the situation  worse.
Because him being the only son.
Mm.
"He was probably spoilt by his sisters, and and got more or less what he wanted as a child, and"
As a child.
"Carried on  you know, what I want, I get."
Mm.
in adulthood.
"What is this, thirty, thirty, how old was he, thirty-one when he died."
Thirty-one.
"Oh, yes."
"Thirty-one very very young age, for someone, apparently so so talented to die."
Think there were drugs as well as the drink.
"Oh well, that"
"Yes, yes, yes, yeah."
"Not mentioned there, but doubtless."
"That is, that is true."
"Okay, the next thing, erm, accurate or not, Trevor and I have already sa erm, talked about this, erm, many an Adult School members will remember the enthusiasm and popularity that surrounded the future Edward the eighth, when he was Prince of Wales."
"Prince of Wales it is suggested erm, was a black sheep of the family."
"Here it was thought, was a man who understood the people and  for them."
"Someone with a genuine concern for the wounded of World War One, the miners of South Wales, the unemployed, for, and homeless in general."
"In slightly less than a year, citizens high expectations had been shattered and it was all over."
"As John Parker put it, in the King of Fools, he had it all, wealth, charm, good looks, and he threw it all away on an American divorcee, who even his closest advisers considered an adventuress."
On the folly of his Nazis connections.
"On the absurdity of his get rich quick schemes, which involved him with shady financiers."
Why?
"This much travelled man, with all of his promise was at best, a controversial figure, and at worst a family black sheep."
"He could have said with Hamlet, The Time is Out of Joint, and Cursed Spit that Ever I was Born to Set it Right."
"Edward, known as David to his family, did not want the role of Kingship, but then, neither did his brother Bertie."
What does against animal testing mean?
These are the kind of things that are actually on cosmetic products.
Mm.
"It could mean, erm, against animal testing but I go along with it anyway."
"It could mean erm  cruelty free, er erm who de defines in that case, what cruelty is?"
"Er, not, not tested on animals might mean, by me  by but by someone else!"
And it all sells products!
"And, beauty without cruelty has been involved recently in having er, trying to put forward an E C  erm, directive on th er, the labelling of cosmetics, but it's very, very difficult!"
"And, mainly because of those kind of problems."
Yeah.
Yep.
"What do you mean by  erm, not tested on animals?"
The finished product?
The ingredient?
Ingredients are tested for other reasons too  not necessarily just for the cosmetic and toiletry trade.
"I think that one of the outstanding erm  criticisms that I would make  of the whole programme, in research with animals, is the fact that only two licences have been revoked I think you said"
Mhm.
"on  now, I think it's a bit like factory inspectors, and I talk from experience on this, er  th o i me , everything gets cleaned up before the inspectors"
Mhm.
arrive!
"If you report something you always get the same reply, nothing wrong when we went round!"
Mm.
"I'd like to move with th er, I I think tha wi given wi , though we haven't got all that much time, can we move onto another area that was brought up at the beginning of the programme which was erm  the use of animals in recreation and er  Lisa particularly mentioned hunting, now, she thinks hunting should be banned, do you?"
Do you think hunting animals should be banned?
"Various animals that  hunted in this country, foxes, in some places deer, hares are coursed er in some places."
Well well!
There's an interesting result!
"Seventy nine of you think yes, hunting should be banned."
"For the minority, twenty one say, no."
Would any of those twenty one feel brave enough to say why they said no?
Yes?
"Well I I so , should er  be unhappy to see the, the the red-coated huntsmen  a an abolished scenario."
"But, erm  I think they could instead have  an electric fox, if there's such a thing?"
"Or, a drag  and there's no need to interfere with the fox at all."
Okay.
Yes?
"They say that hunting's for er  er human pleasure, er, I mean personally I've only been to one hunt, and I don't see what all the  the, the, the, the trouble's about because the huntsman is only a spectator, it's the hounds that are hunting the fox and it is to keep the foxes down."
"What's better than , gassing, shooting, poisoning?"
Mm.
What's more humane?
So you think hunting's fair enough?
"From my point of view, yeah."
Yes?
Beside you.
"Yes, I I would have to, I'd have to disagree with er, my colleague here."
"Erm, I, it's not the  shooting is, most certainly, as long as it's with a  a qualified marksman"
Mm.
it's most
Mhm.
"definitely less cruel than hunting  because the animal is chased and er, what it's heart is doing while it's being chased and it's, really is  the idea's quite horrendous to me!"
"And actually, hunting doesn't kill all that many foxes, a a hunt probably erm, kills one an, at a meet  if they're lucky."
"But hunting does maintain jobs, and countryside people often say."
Would anyone like
Mm.
"to talk to, to to that?"
Yes?
Well coming from a rural community
erm  hunting and shooting and fishing are very important to the
Yeah.
"economy of the community  and to have suburbia creeping in and trying to dictate to what has been  the foundation of the  of their economy, for many, many years is  almost ridiculous!"
Mhm.
Down there.
I think the idea of taking a fox and having it ripped apart legitimized by our society is a bad message to pass onto our children!
"When children nowadays are becoming more responsible to our society, and they see us as one world  we have a responsibility to protect ourselves and our world, and that includes the animals in it."
"Well I can draw the E I P to a close, sorry?"
Why?
Do we?
"Mr Mr Donson, yes, oh that's right, we posed a question to you on the elephant analogy."
What is the equivalent on affordable housing?
"I thinking about it over erm er coffee sir, I I I think the answer is an adder erm because its smaller than an elephant, it's indigenous to the United Kingdom, it blends into the landscape, but if you ignore it it could be just as injurious to your health."
Excellent.
.
Well with that I think I can draw the E I P to a close .
Can I say it it's er we've had a a good day from my point of view anyway.
"Erm some days have been better than others but I I I have in retrospect enjoyed it,heartbroke though it is."
"Er and from our point of view er erm the panel, erm this is only the end of the beginning for us because we've got a lot of other work to do."
Er but certainly we are grateful for your participation erm some very good contributions.
"I'm also particularly grateful for, and I said yesterday, to our two friends in the right hand corner here who've er done some sterling work."
I'm grateful to North Yorkshire and through you to the Strensall people for the arrangements and the use of the Village Hall and I think I must commend Mr Whipp for his fortitude through the last week or so.
Because even if he wasn't participating he was sitting listening.
Thank you very much.
"Chairman before before you do finally er pack your bag and zoom off back to wherever it is you're going, could I on behalf of the county council and all of our participants here today and those who've been around in the last fortnight thank you and Miss Whittaker and your assistant able assistants er Mrs Binns and Dave  in the programme office for the sterling work they've done."
And for making the E I P erm an interesting and er fortnight and I think er commending on the way that you er and your colleagues have handled it er all the way through and er we hope that er at the end of the day we'll get something back from you fairly quickly which er we'll act upon.
I won't promise
Thank you very much Chairman.
I shan't promise before Christmas..
Hiya.
Hello.
Oh oh here comes the monster.
Here comes the monster.
Well Miss  come and have your head cut off.
Erm
She's got asthma.
Right.
Mhm.
I'm the Chief Superintendent that covers the the north east of England yes.
OK.
So you're the big boss are you?
One of them.
One of them.
Have you er polished your brass today got it all ready to talk to me I hope you have.
Now  sorry Alan I've got to turn you up a bit you don't mind do you?
No not at all.
It won't hurt there we are that's nice OK.
"Now Alan, first of all er have we learned anything do you think over the years or do we seem to be getting worse?"
Sadly the things seem to be getting worse.
Er we the Society try our very best to get over the message to people just before Christmas.
Please don't give a pet for Christmas.
But unfortunately er it seems to fall on many deaf ears and we the Society as other many charities who deal with animals are left to pick up the pieces.
"Why is it it seems to me also, and I may be totally wrong here, but it seems people who are least likely to look after themselves are the ones who want to have animals?"
"I mean you see them walking around particularly people who go for the big dogs, you see them walking around with a big thick necks, the tattoos, the er the boots and the jeans rolled up."
Well I think that's a little bit to do with a bit of macho image.
Erm and er perhaps it's the owners wanting to look rather big.
Unfortunately they don't think before they get the pet that you've got to look after it.
It takes
But an an
time it takes money.
Another thing is of course it's all pets it isn't just dogs and cats.
That's right yes.
I mean people have er er budgie or er er er another sort of bird and they think it doesn't need any looking after.
That's right.
Er just before Christmas you see people think that buying a Christmas present er that's easy.
Once you've er got over the newness of it the the the thing can be put in away in a drawer can be put back in it's box.
But with an animal it's for life.
Er you've got to look after it.
You've got to devote a lot of time to the care and attention that it requires.
"I I heard the other day what I thought was one of the best advertisements not to have an animal for Christmas very emotive, er I think it was for the R S P C A, and I I'm told I don't think you've heard it but it b basically it's it's er the sound of a  er well it's a human pretending to be a dog really and saying you know, Well this is nice my my er family have taken me to the vet, I didn't think I was ill but never mind."
"That is being taken to good money they say, it was the professional's choice yesterday the faces were all backing it yesterday."
"The five to one will last to the end of the ten minute guarantee at the shops, it will then go four and by the  General Pershing could be as low as seven to two or a hundred to thirty according to Ladbrokes."
Hills have had erm  each way for  Nephew and Our Margaret but the focus of the betting today with this rain coming at Cheltenham is going to be Gordon Richard's General Pershing and he's gonna go off a short price.
Is your money going to be on the favourite?
Er my money's gone on Storm Storm Alert about ten days ago at twelves and
Mm.
that's almost certainly enough to nail it to the floor I would have thought.
Are you worried that you were obviously worried about this rain as well?
Er likes it likes the ground.
It needs the ground.
Mhm.
And I've said that you know I'd rather it was on the soft but whether it will get
Yeah.
the trip or not we'll find out this afternoon.
It's gonna be a cracking good race at  too.
But what about the other race meetings today?
Let's have the early news.

"There's no danger of the river rising so fast  it floods the course as it sometimes does but sadly  as you can see, rain overnight and it's raining now."
And do watch out for those roadworks on the M four just by the M twenty five junction.
Well at Nottingham as well as first race twelve forty five there's a wedding.
The prospective Mr and Mrs Martin are celebrating their wedding in a private hospitality suite and as well as er entertaining their guests they're sponsoring the Andy and Tracy wedding day novelties chase.

So all the very best to them.
"The going however whether their horse will like it or not is good from good to firm and there's a non runner in the one fifteen that's number one urgh Canderbill, there we go."
That's about a third of an inch of rain overnight and again it's gonna be wet for the rest of the day.
When you go into the course follow signs for Colic Park.
celebrating your wedding with  Chase but this is Ayr and it's the only dry spot in the British Isles.
There was no rain overnight so that the ground er is good with just a few soft places.
No hazards on the roads.
"No, it even says in here, it says look, there well may be groups of supporters in different categories who'd like to arrange seats together, unfortunately not be able to do this unless you are prepared to wait until the end of the main selling period"
Alright
They won't be able to do that to be honest cos they're not gonna go are they?
I don't know

Shame of the Killer oh no I don't think we'll do that er  look through the Sun see if there's anything interesting erm  in there  I've got nothing in the Ewbank .

What has he done with his money?
What has got he didn't give me any.
Oh he's bought a big house has he?
OK.
"Usual sort of sex, drugs, rock and roll as you get in the papers on a Saturday as well."
Or is he the best dress man too?
Chris Ewbank is the best dressed man.
That'll upset Jonathan Ross he always thought he was.
Er O nine O four six four one six four one.
Anybody who can hum by the way the er theme to the television programme Ivanhoe and I would be interested to hear from you as well.
Now as the United Nations doesn't have enough on its plate dealing with the problems on earth and obviously they're er they're there at the forefront of everything that happens  .
Action is being demanded to track down possible visitors from outer space and this is serious.
A small group demonstrators have staged a protest outside the U N Headquarters in New York calling for an end to what they say is a cover up over the existence of U F Os.
"One of the organizers, Michael Luckman, says President Clinton is scared to acknowledge that superior beings do exist."
The United States er government is afraid as are other governments to admit er to their people that there is a higher form of life.
Obviously if the U F Os touch down that would mean they would be charge and not Bill Clinton at the White House.
Okay well er I I figure that there must be quite a number of er extraterrestrials  around  around North Yorkshire and I thought it would be quite nice actually if er if there are any extraterrestrials listening at the moment they could ring in and we could have a chat.
So if erm if if you  yeah yes E T E T phoned when what do you want?
I'm not even speaking to you because of that flipping letter.

Er the individual responsible for this this is your letter from the er director of er  the Officers of the Director General's broadcasting Principle Assistant Dalek to the Director General.
Yes it is.
Yeah.
To that charge Shaun David  do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Worships if I may interrupt the the this erm dispute about the  damage  which was  allegedly caused  I have mentioned it to Miss  this morning and she has  undertaken to make further enquiries.
"Erm  briefly, the situation is that it's alleged that he broke two stained glass door panels  and Mr  denies that he broke  the second of the two, the one at the front door he says was broken  at some time earlier  on the evening on which he was involved."
"Unfortunately Miss  hasn't been able to conclude her enquiries  er, to  apportion the damage  and to take instructions as to the  the residue of what I've just said."
"It is suggested er, by both myself and er  my colleague that the matter should be adjourned for one week."
"Well it, it was adjourned last week for him to  with instructions your worship."
Yes we we've adjourned this case for one week  other enquiries can be made.
"So he doesn't have to, on conditional bail today?"
Well bail will be extended for one week.
"Well you know what that means Mr , you were told  this last week you will be  to surrender yourself to bail  next Tuesday at er ."
Hopefully the matter will proceed next week.
Can we go your worships?
"Yes, you can leave the court."

Do you understand?
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Have you got your driving license with you Mr ?
"I haven't got it actually, no."
Why?
"Because, well I told the police at the time  that er  I've misplaced it  and er  my  is."
"What are you doing about getting er, a replacement?"
Well I haven't done anything at the moment because I di I didn't think it was worth it actually.
Oh here comes a nice man with er an injection.
Ah perhaps they're going to give me some vitamins.
Yes.
"And it goes on and on like this until the voice is erm, I can't feel anything any more."
Yes it's it's it was one of the er advertisements or programmes that went out on radio er again this is why I've been trying to get over to people the sad things that have to happen to animals.
Erm we hate putting animals to sleep.
"In fact it was the Society's policy now that we won't put animals to sleep unless there is an extreme er cause for that the sick, diseased."
Erm and we're attempting to try to get over to people please please think before you get a pet.
"Why is it that in the north of England, particularly in this region of the north of England, we seem to be worse than anywhere else?"
I I don't think you are.
Now I've spent seventeen years in Hartlepool and yes that er
They hate monkeys in Hartlepool did you know that?
Found a honkey they monkey
I wasn't going to say anything the Kirkham Hotel.
they hung it.
Er yes and there's one hanging behind their door.
Er the thing is that the people in the northeast yes er there is a lot more work done up there by the Society but you know since I've been down in Horsham I have found that the northeast is not alone.
There are many other areas in the country where animals are seriously abused.
The northeast isn't the only place.
Mm.
Ok thank you very much indeed er Chief Superintendent.
"And Pa Pat I don't think I don't hold out any hope at all that people will pay any attention they will go they'll see a little puppy somewhere they'll say, Oh that's lovely we'll buy that for  Tommy er, and then Tommy will abuse it totally and er they'll say, Well the dog was a a waste of time it didn't work properly and er didn't know how to er how to look after itself."
"May I just say that the majority of people will care for their animals but it is those people who buy, we have s er cases where erm people will turn up on Christmas day and say to their elderly relative, We bought you a puppy."
The elderly relative hadn't didn't want a puppy.
Never ever wanted a puppy because it makes them a captive person
Mm.
they've got to look after something.
And this is where the Society is called in er to look after that puppy.
Or just after Christmas usually between Christmas and New Year.
"We're called to waste ground, behind pet shops, a any place to pick up boxes of unwanted puppies, kittens that have obviously been er planned for selling to people er before Christmas."
Good Alan thank you very much indeed.
You're very welcome.
Yeah.
"Yes  I mean it doesn't go down well and I'll  say the things you have to do when you when you're helping to run a club, you have to commit yourself to the club and you have to do the jobs that th presented by the club."
"I mean I date mine, er well I don't date 'em I  I sign the cards at home and do all that at home before I go"
That's right.
and then when I come here I've just got to date  what fish is on the bench.
That's right.
And it cuts down the work then.
The way he's doing this  is there's  they can go.
Well that's no use is it?
That's no use.
I know they were still judging after midnight  and that's no good really  no good at all on a working week.
When we got there we had to  species of fish  and then take it out and
Yeah  yeah.
"It's a good idea  it's a good idea in principle  but, but it's not a workable proposition when you've over a hundred fish  and there's evening"
Yes.
she hasn't got enough time
one of the  didn't come till nearly quarter past ten.
Yeah  yeah.
"I think it er, on reflection I think er I would discourage  members from having a three-way table show  I like the, the one-off  you know, one against one  because it works better"
yeah.
I think it works better.
Yeah.
"Yes of course yeah, but the, you know, we, we have to, I have to make a report and I have to recommend  so I'm recommending  that we forget about the three-way stuff."
"Er, we had a breeders' meeting in October which was  I enjoy them very much, I enjoy the  the talk because it's the first chance I get during the year when I can sit down and listen  and I don't have to worry about them generally, in another club, I don't have to worry about minutes or anything, I just sit and listen and it's great  it, I really enjoy that."
"Meetings  once again I have to say  the old, old  chestnut  please can we start at eight o' clock  er we're getting new members who  get a bit discouraged when we have a late start."
"I know it isn't easy  but erm  I think we should  you know, try and we  advertise starting at eight o'clock  and very often there's only Alan and I here at eight."
So if we could all try our best to get here at eight o' clock.
Particularly when we're trying to get juveniles into the club  I mean they want to go at ten possibly  you owe them  not starting till
Yeah  yeah.
It's very difficult to
"nine there's nothing, you know  they'll get discouraged."
"So you  John  now  Jonathan   he's only fifteen, I know he looks in his twenties, but he's only fifteen and he's done a lot of homework  so it makes him  late and it makes him uncomfortable and he's fidgety because he  knows he's got to disturb us when he goes out, he doesn't  doesn't enjoy disturbing us, so  I have to make that clear to you."
This year alone.
"So if you total it up,Be er again and first of all  council  being a, being a council, and they succeeded very well."
"And  at the Leith, South Leith very very well and they just er  district council."
"Was there a lot of that sort of feeling around, that sort of protestant action"
"No no this one man this one, one man in the whole of Edinburgh district council was  protestant tax."
"What er caused them to put that for the  er group forward I could not tell you, but that's what he stood for, this protestant action."
"He was neither Liberal, Labour, Conservative, none of them, he was just, he"
Mm.
What had been a er election representative until
"Er er an election agent,election agent when you're er a er d doing the work of an election agent, you've got to be responsible for all the data going out concerning the running of the election."
"Making sure that your candidate attends every meeting, for er s you know during er an election campaign they've got to attend all the meetings."
"Well the election agent was the man responsible for getting that data through to the, the candidate to say that you're speaking at a meeting, such and such a night, and another meeting at such and such  so keeping the, keeps that candidate on his toes, all the time, during an election campaign until election's over and then of course er you know what  transpires after that I su it's either"
Was you involved in the Labour Party for a long time before erm before you were the election agent?
No.
No no no no.
No n never.
"Of course I had this spell er er don't forget I was five years as a prisoner of war, and  a lot of interest because I was a union member pra b previous to that you see?"
Was this what erm led you to join the Labour Party?
Your initials at a trade union
"Yeah yes, that was er actually yes er"
Mhm.
I wanted to see how it o o operated politically.
I'd heard a lot about er af er I've been in the Transport and General Workers' Union as a shop steward and so forth like that.
That this was interesting me.
"I want to know, find out the workings of it, politically."
What did erm how did you find the Labour Party at that time compares with the Labour Party now?
Oh much better.
W er united.
"It's not united at the present day, there are far too many lefts and rights and centres."
"If there's e if there any  party's operating at all, there's only one p one thing and that's centre."
"No lefts, no rights, centre."
United.
"M m yes, they talked about work  or work , and erm, but not about conditions particularly, and  was a medium pit for conditions."
"They talked about conditions at  which was a wet pit, and er how Hucknall was much better, anyhow and things like that."
But great talk about Union activities.
What were the Union activities?
"Er well, there was the highly immoral thing called overtime, erm if you had too much overtime you was keeping someone out of job."
Er you wanted a fair number of hours and you wanted a fair wage.
Er the Union was very  parochial .
Mm.
So the men in the house were all members of Nottingham Miners Association?
Yes.
What about the General Strike?
I suppose the strike would be an early
Well
memory for you?
Yeah.
"The General Strike,it's a strange memory  because I had to walk down  Pad er now, erm I forget what the proper word is now, er it's called  Walk, now ."
"sounds terr er terrible to me,because  Pad was the way to  Colliery, the last half mile along a dirt track."
"And er Granddad  was on maintenance, of course, and I used to have to take his meals, so I used to go past the er picket, along with many other people who were busy coal  out of the pit tip ."
"Er the picket was not as militant as it is now, and there were the talks of scabs, and things like that."
"But the Strike was, well we had the pit ponies up, and er we always used to go and feed them, and then we went, of course, to chapel for meals."
"I won't say soup kitchens because they weren't that at all, I mean, they weren't as civili You had a civilized meal, I know you sang grace before it, and said grace afterwards, but you had knifes, forks and spoons and chapel china."
Mm.
So how?
Do you remember how your grandfather and father felt about the Strike?
"Erm yes, they er, they felt they'd been let down by the Railway men, I think, or someone else at the beginning at the Strike, and they were out on a limb but er they'd got to make the best of it."
Mm.
Erm I think they thought they'd been let down at the end of it.
"Erm I was taken to h hear A J , the miners leader at the time, he was the best type perhaps, a Welsh Chapel Parson, erm on the recreation ground and on the marketplace, when thousands turned up,"
Mm.
attend .
"How how did people feel about , because well if you read read Alan Alan  book, then he's criticized very strongly as being too militant, and r well really Cri preferred to him."
How how did the the  miners?
Don't tell him blue eyes
Oh dear.
"I know that's not funny, but, it is funny."
It is
"Ryan just revels in anybody who's been naughty, he think he really is spite which I think is a bit frightening in a child, really."
It is because he'll be
Yeah
Looks to  just led into
"Yeah, he is, he's very easily led, Ryan, you know, and he's very into, you know, getting on with the gang."
Which is really sad.
"But erm, he's a little shit."
"Called me, he's called me a college crappy, he goes why don't you go back, he goes, why don't you go back to college, you college crappy."
"He went, you're just a drop-out, you're just sponging off the government."
"I was like, shut up, Ryan."
"He's like, I know your sort."
fourteen.
Yeah.
"But the sad thing is, he's got he's got quite a bit of brain, ain't he, to come out, you know, little things like, although they're rude, he's obviously aware, but he's wasting it all, ain't he?"
I know.
Quite intelligent.
"It's like, what was he, he was going, oh that's right,he keeps going, I can't, but they're cold now  but he was like, at the dinner table once, right, and Ryan and Gran argue continuously, and he was going erm, and he went, Gran, and Gran went, yeah, and he went, do you know what you are, and Gran went no, and he went, well, I can't remember what it's called, he goes, they're this, I think it's a hybrid, he goes, you're a hybrid."
"He goes, do you know what one of them is, he goes, it's just sort of like evolutionary thing between the ape and man, and he goes, it's sort of part way between, and it's sort of like some sort of creature, and it's half like an ape and half like a human, and he goes, and you're one of them  he goes, you're one of them Gran, he goes, you've got a brain like one of them, as well, and Gran just like went  oh shut up Ryan."
She doesn't really know what to say.
"Oh, shut up Ryan, and then he sits there for a bit,and she goes, yeah well, you used to wear national health spectacles."
"Ha ha ha  and Ryan goes, oh shut up Gran."
"But he's like, when they think they can get any little thing they can think of to wind each other up."
It was so amusing.
"But it just go Ryan is, you know, he's a bright boy."
"Yeah, I know, it's sad ain't it?"
"But like,Mi Miss  said to me, when I went up there, she said, ah I know, she said, you hear a lot of bad stuff about Ryan, she said, but he's a nice, he's a nice little boy really, and she said, he's very polite, he's very polite, he can be very polite to you."
"She said, and a lot of the time, she said, he's a, he's a little sod, she said, but you know, she said, I mean, it's not all bad things about him, and I said, I've been hearing things about you from Miss , and she  oh, what she's been bloody saying, I bet she's been saying I'm crap at English."
Yeah well .
.
"and I had, got  pick up two so I, I just had to give up, I phoned him up when I got here, apologise, he hasn't been in touch with Michael yet, I don't know why not, er, though why, er sorry"
"Erm, there used to be ."
"Sorry, there used to be a group at the College I think."
"Yes, yes."
"Well there used to be that's right,with you John,talking about college group just about that time ."
"Erm  yes and it's, it's funny thing I haven't sent things to the College with, with the other stuff that went out, but, er we have, I have spoken to Michael about College, yeah I mean ."
"So we didn't, yeah well if we've got someone's who's interested in starting a group, that's the time which to start, we did, yeah, but there was a group, er previous thing but I think that, there was one girl who was very er keen, but I think when she left it probably lapsed."
"Mm,"
But.
"yeah, yeah, I did, did discuss it with Michael, I'd forgotten that, I just remembered now ."
"Maybe, maybe I don't know if he's shy or anything, why he hasn't phoned up Michael yet, perhaps I ought to ask Michael to phone him then, he does , yes."
"Maybe, yes , we have, we have approved school or er student group officer so we should perhaps let him  you know, perhaps we should, perhaps we should come back to him or Michael could."
Mm.
"Well, shouldn't, shall I"
"Should imagine, mm."
"take that number from you, cos I'll, I'm probably going, probably be seeing Michael this week,."
Do you want the letter?.
"Yes, okay."
"Right, that's fine, well I, that would be very good if there was a group at the coll at the coll at the college, there ought to be one at the college"
Mm.
"of all, of all the"
Mm.
you know.
"Oh, he's only, he's only there till September till"
"Oh, great."
"he's only there till the Summer, by the way."
"Yes, well perhaps we could get it going quickly then"
.
"Right, erm, now, er, do you want to say something?"
"I did, yes, erm, when erm, we thought our prisoner was finished the co-ordinators wrote to me and said would I be interested, would our group be interested in erm, writing to Yugoslavia's still, because with the Civil War going on there's lots of cases coming up, for example there was a whole hospital full of patients that were taken prisoner  I don't know if they were actually physically removed or whether they were held in the hospital without access to medical treatment for something like ten days, and erm, Saria did say she'd help me last time and I wrote back and said yes, two of us could write once a month, well they're taken that very liberally  and, and, got two or three things from the already and erm, if anyone else is interested in writing an odd letter say once a month to Yugoslavia maybe they could erm, let me know later on.."
"Good, that's fine, right, any other business?"
"Well after the break, you can buy them, this is one of them, for as little as twenty five pounds, Elton John's been wearing something altogether more expensive at the High Court this week but  does it  look much better?"
Will you see the join when you join us?
"And men in wigs, next."
for a while I was in the Air Force and then  I lived in various parts of the country.
"But coming back to live in   like to call it, er in nineteen seventy five."
"And I know perfectly well that there's no way that er I could get my wife to move out of the town, she loves it."
And so so indeed do I.
"Anyhow, er this evening  very happy to provide a few pictures for you to have a look at, and hopefully with a bit of information."
"If there's anything you want to er er to ask me about, please don't hesitate to er to butt in at any time."
Erm can you all reasonably see what er what's going on?
Right this is er merely a map erm where we're dealing with  er local people.
It's er it's not so necessary probably er as where at times I've given talks in various parts of the country on on this area.
"Er but erm this gives an idea of the railway lines that er well basically were in this area, erm I suppose er still round about nineteen fifty sixty time."
Some of them had er already gone.
But that's that's er basically what was was around.
"And of course er the Nottingham, Lincoln y Lincoln line here."
The er main East Coast Main Line over here.
"The er mass of lines in the Nottingham area, and so on."
"And that is a real subject in itself, and I think you've probably had John  talking to you."
Have you not?
Er John's erm quite a whiz on that one.
"Erm anyhow, this evening, I'm proposing to just merely cover this particular area, particularly."
Erm and then just coming along here and er as far as  and and just coming back to there.
Erm let's have a look and see what we can we've got.
"Erm well as many of you know the first one of the first things that you see, if you're c approaching the town from from the A six one two, from er ."
"Or from , er is that building, which is the old  crossing keeper's house or cottage."
"Erm it has been altered somewhat since the original er railway days, but nevertheless it retains quite a bit of the old character erm and er the high pitched roofs erm and the ."
"Interestingly, of different styles on that."
"It's not such an attractive house as the station master's house, but nevertheless er it is one of only two railway buildings now left er in this town."
"And of course as many of you will know, the railway line er used to run just in front, here."
"There's another picture of it, as one er goes past on the road."
Any good news in the papers Alastair?
Well Derek for a change there is.
"And here in the Sporting Life there's the man who rode Gay Trip to Mackeson victory one of his Mackeson victories, Terry Biddlecombe."
Large as life and smiling.
He's been in the wars a bit since his racing career.
"He was one of my childhood heroes, a marvellous jockey and a great chap."
"He's been on the sauce basically but he's kicked the habit and he says of kicking the drinking habit  I've had a lot of help and a lot of good counselling, in the end it's up to me."
I don't want to be complacent but since March I seem to be winning .
Well that's great news.
"And a lot of people have rallied round Terry Biddlecombe, very popular man, Injured Jockeys' Fund among others and he's back in the back in the swim fully employed and in action for Mackeson today at er Cheltenham."
Here in the Mail Peter Scudimore wearing his new hack's hat.
Pipe can still meet the gold standard.
There are a lot of people saying that Mike Martin Pipe is not the force he was etcetera but there's been a change of policy down at  and if anyone thinks that Pipe has lost his touch they're talking twaddle.
He'll be back and he might be back at working men's prices.
You pay your money and you take your choice on the Mackeson and here J A Magrar in the Telegraph  idea represents Mackeson value .
He has some very harsh words for the Japanese about their ban on Frankie Detory saying it's shortsighted and harsh in the extreme and we'll all say yes to that.
Er in the Star Brad's a star.
This is Josh Gifford exclusive another one of these trainers learning to be a journalist.
Time some journalists learned to be trainers I think.
He says
I'm convinced he's a mu this is Bradbury he's a much better stronger horse this season and really do think he can bring the beer money back to Sussex.
We will see.
"And here today's bandwagon rolling tip,Pershing po poised to fulfil his promise , that's Paul Johnson in the Racing Post, John de Moreville in the Express  Pershing to strike his target  and now here is something of which nobody can be proud  Gosforth Park South Africa ."
This is in the Sporting Life and it's also in the Racing Post and this is a cynical move by the bookies to pick your pocket.
There are five race meetings today.
There are more dog cards than you shake a stick at yet the bookies are peddling this tripe from South Africa through the morning.
"Now in the first race the ten fifty, number nine is called Jew Wanna Bet"
Now when you hear that mentioned in the betting shops go no and pull the plugs out of the television.
"We do not want to bet thank you very much on South African racing, we've got quite enough of our own without the bookies ."
I like South Africa.
Well you're barmy.
We've got quite enough of our own without you peddling the
"Yeah, I might do"
your handwriting's quite nice and neat
"Erm, oh I've got another piece back that I've  twenty nine, twenty nine  as it goes"
That's a C innit?
"Yeah, but that goes, that goes in the lit file, so I got rid of my er with the thirty five I managed to get rid of erm"
Who's got all these things?
They're at school in a box
Thank goodness for that
"but er, so now I've got a thirty six, thirty five, thirty four, thirty four, thirty four, thirty two and thirty, so that's a B count in B file, so there's no hassle with that, but if I can get on and get rid of the er, I've got twenty eight, twenty nine in there as well, er twenty eight in there as well, so I want to get rid of the twenty eight and twenty nine  but it is a guarantee that a B file, so there's"
Mm
"no real worry about it, but erm I want to do better"
What about your economics?
Or don't you know that yet?
"Yeah, he still keeps far faffing around with the erm  whatever detail, yeah, he still hasn't given it to us"
Well how you supposed to do it?
"Did you get, did you get that thing finished er geography whatever it was?"
"Something, something"
Science
well well whatever it was you
No
had to finish off?
No
Why not?
"Because I didn't have time, but er they started geography course work today and I was out the lesson"
Why were you out the lesson?
"The drama thing, so I'm a se a section hand already on that and I've even got a, well we're supposed to listen to it tomorrow, we've got a tutor period instead, so it means that we miss another lesson"
"Can't you copy out what you, what you missed?"
"Yeah, I'm out tomorrow night, I'm out school, selling books again  so should be at home"
When you gonna get all this work done Richard?
"Yes I'm trying to get it done, but I am getting pressure from the year group as well, it was, and so I've got that, back out at Wednesday, so I'm gonna have to have my hair done last"
Gonna Wednesday what?
"Erm, got a rehearsal haven't I?"
"Your worships, Mr  works for Wallbank aerials in Worley and he works for them as an engineer  his vehicle was  erm  something that he did use for work, but unfortunately as a result of the accident his has been written off and he hasn't yet been able to  er, replace it and so he's having to be erm  er, chauffeured by  the company to do his er  his work."
"Erm  he  was using at that time an R registered Ford Escort  er, which was er, only insured third party, fire and theft."
"He receives for his employment a take home pay of  seventy three pounds per week, he lives with his parents  and pays a board of twenty pounds per week  he's fortunate in that his employer takes him to work in the mornings but he has to catch the bus home in the evening  and  at lunchtime on Saturdays which costs him seven pounds forty."
He hasn't any other commitments and he would ask  that  erm  he be allowed to pay the fine at the rate of twenty pounds per week.
"Your worships, those are the circumstances I would ask you to bear in mind that  this man  a ha , has four summonses against him purely as a result of  really ignorance as far as purchasing documents is concerned  they were in order  and  erm  he would of produced them had he  realised what the officer was saying to him and  er, that he would of  realised had he not been suffering the shock, but he was actually sufferance  suffering at the er  at the time of the accident."
I don't think  your worships.
Well Mr   er  pleading guilty to these offenses  and we've listened to what  the solicitor has said on your behalf  the main offence  of having no excise licence you'll be fined seventy five pounds  and be willing to pay eighty pounds thirty three back duty  and ten pounds costs  and for the offenses of failing to produce you'll be fined ten pounds for each of those three offenses.
We will order the fines and costs to be paid at a rate of twenty pounds a week.
"So  I make that a hundred and thirteen  a hundred and twenty three pounds, and the costs are  thirty three pence?"
Erm  a hundred twenty six  thirty three.
"Sorry, you're right!"
"One, two, three"
a
sa
hundred and eight
"One two, three three three sir."
"So do, you understand that er  Mr ?"
Yes.
"You pay out twenty pounds a week the officer of the court is agreed and the address will be given to you by the court usher before you leave  it is your responsibility to make sure that money is paid each and every week, the first payment is due by next Tuesday."
Erm  I'm off sick at the moment  from work so
"so  I won't be able to pay the first payment cos, you know  ain't got no money."
Don't you get any  sick payment or
"Well erm, I've just come up   and  and the accident so  I'm only entitled to money for the first four days."
I see.
And when you are likely to be earning again?
Erm  perhaps anywhere next week.
Well I do think give fourteen days for the first payment sir.
Yes.
You have you fourteen days the first payment  will be twenty pounds a week thereafter.
So by  a fortnight today  there's gotta be a payment in?
Yes.

"Oh, we're sure they were but er this was the thing with a private collier company where you had er a sort of, not quite chairman, of the colliery sitting there at the top o in the office, watching everybody come and go."
"And er after that, my father went with the rounds with the collieries, where you had to belong to  union to go to them, and  Colliery didn't accept what was called the old union."
Yeah was?
The  Pit was the  Colliery  ?
"Pit as my n Pit was  colliery, then there was , and then, of course, there were the  pits and the  pits, on the edge."
"Er but , Collieries as they became, they didn't acc That was Lancaster, they didn't accept er the old unions, so they erm they belonged Both I can't on Friday night I used to the Methodist's chapel to pay the old union subscription, and to the West  to pay  's."
What was your father and grandfather's attitude to authority in the pit?
"Were they very resentful about, well, these dismissals?"
"Very resentful about that,, but er no, er I think er tt some of the pi It was Er not authority in the pits, they disliked the co-owners, erm one or two, and respected  Pit always had a respectable authority er and ownership, I mean, stemming from the Quaker one."
But er  and the other pits where personalities were involved were not quite so  happy.
"But er the managers and er and the The manager of the pit and then the underviewers, and the rest, they were people who had worked their way up generally, and were accepted."
"So had the idea of the coal owner Er well at the end of the century, the the coal ow owner and liberal MP sort of connections in ?"
"Well  was  pit, was   and er they came to the  family, that was someone at Mansfield, came back to open chapel bazaars, and all sorts of things, and particularly for the adult school."
"Yeah, going on to schools, which w which schools did you attend?"
"I went  Street erm, which was just next door to Grandma's, only over the wall,."
"And er then to  's Street, which was called  School, for a year and then to  's, when it opened in nineteen twenty nine."
"Do you have many memories of your, well, early education?"
"Street, yes, because er you went er you had a marvellous thing called Nature study, come geography, come everything, where you went for walk."
"But equally,the first thing I remember was my number in the infant school, when I was number fifty five, and er there were fifty eight of us in the class, and one lady kept order."
. They were very ordered classes  I'm afraid .
"Was much learnt, or?"
"Yes, oh yes, you learnt quite a lot and er much depended on er the teacher, of course, they weren't as bound as er teachers had been."
Mm.
We heard discussions of that.
"But erm you learnt quite a lot, and you learnt the basics very, very thoroughly."
"I mean, you marched round the playground until you could knew that twelve fourteens were a hundred and sixty eight."
"Which was when the top class in the infants, at seven, got in.."
"Di Was there any sort of education outside school, say, Sunday Schools, or?"
"Sunday Schools, er, mainly was er in best chapel tt tradition, I suppose, of er bible study and also of the social conscience of the Methodist."
"And er to me it presented a great opportunity,I I j I won quite a lot of books."
"I always remember asking for Lawrence In Arabia, as a Sunday School prize."
". And they weren't the Victorian prizes, that I won,I we got them for getting through an exam, because you could write or something, and er tt well, they were quite good books, and it was one way of getting a book."
I think erm  yo e you know you asked about the support and I think having identified that there was a gap in the support in
Mhm.
"times of  I mean, I actually think it's a  an awful lot of ask of a friendship, or of a family situation  and also, indeed, if you  I mean I think sometimes they can be very supportive but th the true understanding may not be there  and erm  I think that's what led me to start up a self- help group in Edinburgh  erm which is, has been erm  running for the last two years now."
"And, I think that  level of real understanding that you do get from fellow sufferers, and indeed, it's a su , it's a support for erm  families as well who are  able to come along and, and share that kind of  support."
Mhm.
"After my own experiences I wo I wouldn't advice someone not to go to their G P, but firstly, I would advice them to contact the Eating Disorders Association  er, because they are very helpful and they're more supportive than any G P I've ever come across."
Okay.
Yes?
"You mentioned er, earlier about yo , the fact that you were surprised that it was fifteen year olds, and that was quite young"
Yeah.
"and yet, in fact, that's the time when you're most vulnerable  yo , it's time of puberty, your"
Mhm.
"interested in fashion, your interested in the opposite sex and th the ages between fifteen and eighteen teenagers ar , tend to be faddy, if it's not  er, their body shape th th , it's vegetari , vegetarianism."
"I think there's a third fact that you touched on earlier that I think it's just worth mentioning  and that is that we know it's also a genetic  pre-disposition to anorexia nervosa, in other words, we know that in certain families it is a disorder that will run from one generation to another."
"Na , yes?"
"Erm, I'd consider myself to have an eating disorder but I don't have anorexia or bulimia."
"And er, I first started feeling I was overweight when I fourteen and I was, I was twelve stone  and I went to the doctor  and got black capsules to take  which had me as high as a kite  for a long time!"
And then there were the  the dose was reduced and then I had to come off them altogether  and after twenty nine years of dieting unsuccessfully  I gave up dieting and I haven't put on any weight since I gave up dieting!
"And, and what sto , why did you stop?"
"Erm, a friend started a  a self-help group which I went to."
"And I realised, well I had realised for a long time that dieting wasn't the answer for me."
And erm
"Oh so, over twenty nine years you're saying that food was controlling your life, in a way?"
Oh yes!
Very much so!
"I mean that was , that was the dominant thing, was wha what you"
"I could have told you every single item of food I had in the cupboard  every, down to the last bean!"
And now I don't know.
"I have sweets lying on the counter, I don't have to take them if I don't want to."
"I'm not controlled by food any more, and I don't feel guilty any more."
I think the lady who said earlier when you go to your G P you can't express yourself
Mm.
"Erm, and er, on other hand he got everything, got his own book out biography"
"Of course, I think if, if, if Freud were here, he would defend himself, by saying I was quite open about my prejudice against Wilson at the beginning of the book, as  reminds us, Freud says quite clearly, how he felt about all this."
"But I think Freud would have also gone on to say that he had very good reason for resenting Wilson, because he blamed Wilson personally for the unjust peace, after er Versailles, but er, was indirectly, many people would argue, going to lead to the Second World War, and er, so Freud's defence I think would be, this man really was responsible."
"Because after all, the situation in my, I don't know, I mean, I don't know how well you know your modern history."
"I'm not certain, I'm not a great expert on it, but erm, the situation seems to be, that after the First World War, the central power was Germany and Austria, were defeated."
"Er, France, er was, er battle ravaged and its economy in ruins."
"This country was bankrupt, and had to borrow money from the United States of America to keep going, and er, Russia had just had a revolution and was still in chaos."
"So the United States was really the only world power erm, erm, as were able to do anything."
"In, in some ways, the situation you know, was a bit like, like what it is now, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, only more so, I would say, because the, the other powers were more, were even more prostrate than is, is, is the situation today."
"So  for a while, the President of the United States effectively had world power, there was no other power in the world who could stand up to the U S, er, after, after, World War One for one argument anyway, and I think Freud's er, defence disposition would be, Woodrow Wilson was the man who came to Europe, saying he would bring a just peace for all, and went away leaving a total mess, and, and, Freud's er argument in his book is, told us was, well, the mess er, was really Wilson's own doing, and if it was his doing, what was it in his character that allowed him to er,si to  on some Lloyd George, who bullied him into getting most of what they wanted."
"So, that would be Freud's defence, now, I suppose you would have to know a lot more about modern history, to, to know, if this was really true or not, but erm, the  the er, question that Freud was really asking himself, really was, why did Wilson let us down, because Freud admits that he regarded Wilson, when he came to Europe as a saviour."
"You know, here, here was somebody coming from outside Europe who would bring, you know, peace and justice for all."
"Let's hope, I quoted the American Constitution correctly, did I?"
"Erm, you know, perhaps the kind of way people look on President  today."
"You know, which is only day one of his inauguration."
"We'll see what happens to him, President ."
"But erm, that would be for its, for its er,defence, I suppose."
"Is it fallible  I mean how do, how do modern America let's ask er  and erm, er and ."
How do modern Americans see Woodrow Wilson?
Erm
What's your image of him?
"er, I don't know, I think he forgot  you know,"
Yeah
"I don't, I don't"
I remembered him having  in my school library
Mm.
he was regarded as a very very smart man
Mm.
"and er, one of our most intellectual presidents."
Yeah.
"And I don't think, I don't think most people considered him vulnerable, very vulnerable."
"I mean, they know that  working"
"Erm  again i er the old story, we can't get speakers on a Monday and  better luck in last year  this year, sorry  er  I was able to get Danny   but there again he came very expensive  erm  but we brought, we had to bring him from Lancaster so  er, you can't expect him to come for nothing."
"So  erm  and another thing I was going to suggest    erm  I need help really  erm  for the meetings, I need somebody who will help, a social secretary say  somebody who will help with the raffles  and somebody who will organize meetings, what's going on at meetings  because it's getting, the job is getting most difficult  and I work part-time and it's, it's, I'm not getting any younger  and I'm finding it a struggle to try and get everything fixed, the raffles and the  what's going on and  everything organized, so if you, if you  if you could see the way clear, perhaps we could create a  social secretary or an assistant secretary where we could have  somebody who can give a hand with the organization of the meetings"
"Just to get things like slide shows or erm  videos and things, you know, that's how we're gonna"
organizing the raffles  just to get things like slide shows organized  videos organized  just a little bit of help.
Will you?
"Thank you, Robert."
Yes.
"So if we make a list of what we've got  when you have a video night, if you or, or somebody else has the video  list, you can say, well if you bring them back"
"That's right  and we, Brian had the club slides  which he very kindly handed over to us  when he, he, he felt it became difficult for him  to cope with it  erm  cos his dad's not well."
"We have the club slides in our house  so that you know  really whoever takes over organizing the meeting should really have those and  they're all sorted out in order so  it's just a case of diving in the bag and looking for  whatever you want, ever the  I always try to bring some fish  to look at, to the  the scr to the screen  erm  some of the fish that were on show on the table for that particular sh er in erm  table show  because I think it shows interest and to learn more about the fish  and it's always  nice when somebody else knows a lot more about the  particular species than you do, and i is able to tell you   quirks and fancies that they have."
"So I always try to do that but I, I, again I find that  it's very erm  very tiring and it's very, gets very  can get very involved with it, so I would like  us, I'd like you to think of the idea of a social secretary  to help with the raffles and organizing what's going on at the meetings  please."
"Erm  and that's about all I have to say, Mr Chairman."

"and the report from the treasurer  can we have your report, please?"
This is what everyone's been waiting for.
have the er  figures in front of you  of our  progress during the last twelve months  you will no doubt see that we are in a very  nice  financial position  er only a pound and a penny off that magic thousand pound in  in the club now.
Erm  during the year we've made about  er two hundred and  two hundred and twenty odd pounds.
"Er  it's not due to my  expertise at all, it's just mainly due to the fact we don't go to shows these days  we've always  in the good old days when we used to go to shows we spent probably a hundred and thirty to two hundred pounds a year so we never had very much money  as we don't go to these shows and spend this money it is  it is a it is accumulating each year."
"Erm  I'll go through, roughly through the accounts in case anybody's not quite clear what it's all about."
"Er   we started off with seven hundred and seventy five pounds, seventy six, at the beginning of the year  er  the membership is only thirty seven, we have fewer members but er  that's a very small proportion of our income."
Four pound for visitors  only seem to come and then disappear  not many of them seem to join us.
Erm  because of a social evening er we had a raffle and a whiskey bowl  I think the purists might not like the E in whiskey but that's the way it's been done  that must be the southern way.
"Erm    right the Yorkshire Aquarist Festival we had a coach  two ninety three pound on the coach  and a raffle  a hundred and six pound  erm  on the inter-club  we had a fourteen pound twenty five entry and we had a raffle, twenty nine twenty five, making forty three pound fifty."
"Yorkshire was quite a  success this year, we made a lot of money o on the income side  er sixty two pound for entries  ninety one pound ten for refreshments  hundred and nine forty for the raffle, our  kind and thanks to  Bert"
Thanks to Bert

This was seeing ; it was not hearing .
He means foully .
"Hark , else , if his bell be not stopped ! ''"
Such was the case .
The bell rang no longer .
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I like not that ."
"Nay , '' he cried again , `` I like that little ."
What may this betoken ?
"Let us go , by the mass ! ''"
"`` He hath gone east , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Good Dick , let us go westward straight ; I shall not breathe till I have my back turned upon that leper . ''"
"`` Jack , y ' are too cowardly , '' replied Dick ."
"`` We shall go fair for Holywood , or as fair , at least , as I can guide you , and that will be due north . ''"
"They were afoot at once , passed the stream upon some stepping-stones , and began to mount on the other side , which was steeper , towards the margin of the wood ."
"The ground became very uneven , full of knolls and hollows ; trees grew scattered or in clumps ; it became difficult to choose a path , and the lads somewhat wandered ."
"They were weary , besides , with yesterday 's exertions and the lack of food , and they moved but heavily and dragged their feet among the sand ."
"Presently , coming to the top of a knoll , they were aware of the leper , some hundred feet in front of them , crossing the line of their march by a hollow ."
"His bell was silent , his staff no longer tapped the ground , and he went before him with the swift and assured footsteps of a man who sees ."
Next moment he had disappeared into a little thicket .
"The lads , at the first glimpse , had crouched behind a tuft of gorse ; there they lay , horror-struck ."
"`` Certain , he pursueth us , '' said Dick -- `` certain !"
"He held the clapper of his bell in one hand , saw ye ?"
that it should not sound .
"Now may the saints aid and guide us , for I have no strength to combat pestilence ! ''"
`` What maketh he ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` What doth he want ?
"Who ever heard the like , that a leper , out of mere malice , should pursue unfortunates ?"
"Hath he not his bell to that very end , that people may avoid him ?"
"Dick , there is below this something deeper . ''"
"`` Nay , I care not , '' moaned Dick ; `` the strength is gone out of me ; my legs are like water ."
The saints be mine assistance ! ''
Never to feel that perhaps her eyes rested on him now and then as he went about his work in the valley fields !
Never to stoop with a glad thrill over the first spring flowers because it was his privilege to take them to her !
Jeffrey groaned aloud .
"No , he could not go up to see her that night ; he must wait -- he must strengthen himself ."
Then his heart rebuked him .
This was selfishness ; this was putting his own feelings before hers -- a thing he had sworn never to do .
Perhaps she needed him -- perhaps she had wondered why he had not come to offer her such poor service as might be in his power .
"He turned and went down through the orchard lane , taking the old field-path across the valley and up the hill , which he had traversed so often and so joyfully in boyhood ."
"It was dark now , and a few stars were shining in the silvery sky ."
The wind sighed among the pines as he walked under them .
Sometimes he felt that he must turn back -- that his pain was going to master him ; then he forced himself to go on .
"The old grey house where Sara lived seemed bleak and stricken in the dull light , with its leafless vines clinging to it ."
There were no lights in it .
It looked like a home left soulless .
Jeffrey went around to the garden door and knocked .
"He had expected the maid to open it , put Sara herself came ."
"`` Why , Jeff , '' she said , with pleasure in her tones ."
`` I am so glad to see you .
I have been wondering why you had not come before . ''
"`` I did not think you would want to see me yet , '' he said hurriedly ."
`` I have thought about you every hour -- but I feared to intrude . '' ''
"You could n't intrude , '' she said gently ."
"`` Yes , I have wanted to see you , Jeff ."
Come into the library . ''
He followed her into the room where they had always sat in his rare calls .
Sara lighted the lamp on the table .
"As the light shot up she stood clearly revealed in it -- a tall , slender woman in a trailing gown of grey ."
"Even a stranger , not knowing her age , would have guessed it to be what it was , yet it would have been hard to say what gave the impression of maturity ."
"Her face was quite unlined -- a little pale , perhaps , with more finely cut outlines than those of youth ."
"Her eyes were clear and bright ; her abundant brown hair waved back from her face in the same curves that Jeffrey had noted in the purple-gowned child of six , under the pines ."
Perhaps it was the fine patience and serenity in her face that told her tale of years .
Youth can never acquire it .
"`` Now , men , '' said he , `` do you hear me ? ''"
There was no answer from the forecastle .
"`` It 's to you , Abraham Gray -- it 's to you I am speaking . ''"
Still no reply .
"`` Gray , '' resumed Mr. Smollett , a little louder , `` I am leaving this ship , and I order you to follow your captain ."
"I know you are a good man at bottom , and I dare say not one of the lot of you 's as bad as he makes out ."
I have my watch here in my hand ; I give you thirty seconds to join me in . ''
There was a pause .
"`` Come , my fine fellow , '' continued the captain ; `` do n't hang so long in stays ."
I 'm risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second . ''
"There was a sudden scuffle , a sound of blows , and out burst Abraham Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek , and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle ."
"`` I 'm with you , sir , '' said he ."
"And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us , and we had shoved off and given way ."
"We were clear out of the ship , but not yet ashore in our stockade ."
17 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : The Jolly-boat 's Last Trip THIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others .
"In the first place , the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded ."
"Five grown men , and three of them -- Trelawney , Redruth , and the captain -- over six feet high , was already more than she was meant to carry ."
"Add to that the powder , pork , and bread-bags ."
The gunwale was lipping astern .
"Several times we shipped a little water , and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards ."
"The captain made us trim the boat , and we got her to lie a little more evenly ."
"All the same , we were afraid to breathe ."
"In the second place , the ebb was now making -- a strong rippling current running westward through the basin , and then south ` ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning ."
"Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft , but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place behind the point ."
"If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs , where the pirates might appear at any moment ."
"`` I can not keep her head for the stockade , sir , '' said I to the captain ."
"I was steering , while he and Redruth , two fresh men , were at the oars ."
`` The tide keeps washing her down .
Could you pull a little stronger ? ''
"`` Not without swamping the boat , '' said he ."
"`` You must bear up , sir , if you please -- bear up until you see you 're gaining . ''"
"I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east , or just about right angles to the way we ought to go ."
I have lost my favourite ring ; DO stop for a moment and look if you can see it . '
But Jose answered : ` You will find plenty of rings where you are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"At last they entered the palace gates , and the king 's heart bounded with joy at beholding his beloved Princess Bella-Flor ."
"But the princess brushed him aside as if he had been a fly , and locked herself into the nearest room , which she would not open for all his entreaties ."
"` Bring me the three things I lost on the way , and perhaps I may think about it , ' was all she would say ."
"And , in despair , the king was driven to take counsel of Jose ."
"` There is no remedy that I can see , ' said his majesty , ` but that you , who know where they are , should go and bring them back ."
And if you return without them I will have you drowned . '
Poor Jose was much troubled at these words .
"He thought that he had done all that was required of him , and that his life was safe ."
"However , he bowed low , and went out to consult his friend the horse ."
"` Do not vex yourself , ' said the horse , when he had heard the story ; ` jump up , and we will go and look for the things . '"
And Jose mounted at once .
"They rode on till they came to the ant-hill , and then the horse asked : ` Would you like to have the bran ? '"
` What is the use of liking ? '
answered Jose .
"` Well , call the ants , and tell them to fetch it for you ; and , if some of it has been scattered by the wind , to bring in its stead the grains that were in the cakes you gave them . '"
Jose listened in surprise .
"He did not much believe in the horse 's plan ; but he could not think of anything better , so he called to the ants , and bade them collect the bran as fast as they could ."
"Then he saw under a tree and waited , while his horse cropped the green turf ."
` Look there ! '
"said the animal , suddenly raising its head ; and Jose looked behind him and saw a little mountain of bran , which he put into a bag that was hung over his saddle ."
"` Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later , ' observed the horse ; ` but mount again , as we have far to go . '"
"When they arrived at the tree , they saw the handkerchief fluttering like a flag from the topmost branch , and Jose 's spirits sank again ."
` How am I to get that handkerchief ? '
cried he ; ` why I should need Jacob 's ladder ! '
"But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call to the eagle you set free from the net , he will bring it to you . '"
"So Jose called to the eagle , and the eagle flew to the top of the tree and brought back the handkerchief in its beak ."
"Jose thanked him , and vaulting on his horse they rode on to the river ."
"A great deal of rain had fallen in the night , and the river , instead of being clear as it was before , was dark and troubled ."
"` How am I to fetch the ring from the bottom of this river when I do not know exactly where it was dropped , and can not even see it ? '"
At first my only feeling was one of annoyance .
Then a thought flashed into my mind that made me dizzy with fear .
The tide would be high that night .
If I could not escape from Island Rock I would inevitably be drowned .
I sat down limply on a ledge and tried to look matters fairly in the face .
I could not swim ; calls for help could not reach anybody ; my only hope lay in the chance of somebody passing down the shore or of some boat appearing .
I looked at my watch .
It was a quarter past three .
"The tide would begin to turn about five , but it would be at least ten before the rock would be covered ."
"I had , then , little more than six hours to live unless rescued ."
The flat was by this time out of sight around the point .
I hoped that the sight of an empty flat drifting down shore might attract someone 's attention and lead to investigation .
That seemed to be my only hope .
No alarm would be felt at Uncle Richard 's because of my non-appearance .
They would suppose I had gone to Uncle Adam 's .
"I have heard of time seeming long to a person in my predicament , but to me it seemed fairly to fly , for every moment decreased my chance of rescue ."
"I determined I would not give way to cowardly fear , so , with a murmured prayer for help , I set myself to the task of waiting for death as bravely as possible ."
"At intervals I shouted as loudly as I could and , when the sun came to the proper angle for the best view of the `` Hole in the Wall , '' I took the picture ."
"It afterwards turned out to be a great success , but I have never been able to look at it without a shudder ."
At five the tide began to come in .
"Very , very slowly the water rose around Island Rock ."
"Up , up , up it came , while I watched it with fascinated eyes , feeling like a rat in a trap ."
"The sun fell lower and lower ; at eight o'clock the moon rose large and bright ; at nine it was a lovely night , dear , calm , bright as day , and the water was swishing over the highest ledge of the rock ."
With some difficulty I climbed to the top and sat there to await the end .
"I had no longer any hope of rescue but , by a great effort , I preserved self-control ."
"If I had to die , I would at least face death staunchly ."
"But when I thought of my mother at home , it tasked all my energies to keep from breaking down utterly ."
Suddenly I heard a whistle .
Never was sound so sweet .
I stood up and peered eagerly shoreward .
"Coming around the `` Hole in the Wall '' headland , on top of the cliffs , I saw a boy and a dog ."
I sent a wild halloo ringing shoreward .
"Most disquieting reflection of all , was it not bad form to think about good form ?"
His vitals were tortured by this problem .
"It was a claw within him sharper than the iron one ; and as it tore him , the perspiration dripped down his tallow -LSB- waxy -RSB- countenance and streaked his doublet ."
"Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face , but there was no damming that trickle ."
"Ah , envy not Hook ."
There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution -LSB- death -RSB- .
It was as if Peter 's terrible oath had boarded the ship .
"Hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech , lest presently there should be no time for it ."
"`` Better for Hook , '' he cried , `` if he had had less ambition ! ''"
It was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person .
`` No little children to love me ! ''
"Strange that he should think of this , which had never troubled him before ; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind ."
"For long he muttered to himself , staring at Smee , who was hemming placidly , under the conviction that all children feared him ."
Feared him !
Feared Smee !
There was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him .
"He had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his hand , because he could not hit with his fist , but they had only clung to him the more ."
Michael had tried on his spectacles .
To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable !
"Hook itched to do it , but it seemed too brutal ."
"Instead , he revolved this mystery in his mind : why do they find Smee lovable ?"
He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was .
"If Smee was lovable , what was it that made him so ?"
A terrible answer suddenly presented itself -- `` Good form ? ''
"Had the bo ` sun good form without knowing it , which is the best form of all ?"
He remembered that you have to prove you do n't know you have it before you are eligible for Pop -LSB- an elite social club at Eton -RSB- .
With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee 's head ; but he did not tear .
"What arrested him was this reflection : `` To claw a man because he is good form , what would that be ? ''"
`` Bad form ! ''
"The unhappy Hook was as impotent -LSB- powerless -RSB- as he was damp , and he fell forward like a cut flower ."
"His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time , discipline instantly relaxed ; and they broke into a bacchanalian -LSB- drunken -RSB- dance , which brought him to his feet at once , all traces of human weakness gone , as if a bucket of water had passed over him ."
"`` Quiet , you scugs , '' he cried , `` or I 'll cast anchor in you ; '' and at once the din was hushed ."
"And when the loaves lay in crumbs on the road , the horse galloped on ."
"By-and-by they entered a rocky pass between two mountains , and here they saw an eagle which had been caught in a hunter 's net ."
"` Get down and cut the meshes of the net , and set the poor bird free , ' said the horse ."
"` But it will take so long , ' objected Jose , ` and we may miss the princess . '"
"` Never mind that ; do not lose a chance of helping others , ' answered the horse ."
"And when the meshes were cut , and the eagle was free , the horse galloped on ."
"The had ridden many miles , and at last they came to a river , where they beheld a little fish lying gasping on the sand , and the horse said : ` Do you see that little fish ?"
It will die if you do not put it back in the water . '
"` But , really , we shall never find the Princess Bella-Flor if we waste our time like this ! '"
cried Jose .
"` We never waste time when we are helping others , ' answered the horse ."
And soon the little fish was swimming happily away .
"A little while after they reached a castle , which was built in the middle of a very thick wood , and right in front was the Princess Bella-Flor feeding her hens ."
"` Now listen , ' said the horse . '"
"I am going to give all sorts of little hops and skips , which will amuse the Princess Bella-Flor ."
"Then she will tell you that she would like to ride a little way , and you must help her to mount ."
"When she is seated I shall begin to neigh and kick , and you must say that I have never carried a woman before , and that you had better get up behind so as to be able to manage me ."
Once on my back we will go like the wind to the king 's palace . '
"Jose did exactly as the horse told him , and everything fell out as the animal prophesied ; so that it was not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive ."
"She said nothing , however , but quietly opened her apron which contained the bran for the chickens , and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground ."
"` Oh , I have let fall my bran ! '"
cried she ; ` please get down and pick it up for me . '
But Jose only answered : ` We shall find plenty of bran where we are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"They were now passing through a forest , and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards , so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree ."
` Dear me ; how stupid !
"I have let my handkerchief blow away , ' said she ."
` Will you climb up and get it for me ? '
But Jose answered : ` We shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"After the wood they reached a river , and the princess slipped a ring off her finger and let it roll into the water ."
"` How careless of me , ' gasped she , beginning to sob . '"
If he spent a shilling he got back a florin-such an excellent merchant he was till he died .
Now his son inherited all this money .
"He lived very merrily ; he went every night to the theatre , made paper kites out of five-pound notes , and played ducks and drakes with sovereigns instead of stones ."
"In this way the money was likely to come soon to an end , and so it did ."
"At last he had nothing left but four shillings , and he had no clothes except a pair of slippers and an old dressing-gown ."
His friends did not trouble themselves any more about him ; they would not even walk down the street with him .
"But one of them who was rather good-natured sent him an old trunk with the message , ` Pack up ! ''"
"That was all very well , but he had nothing to pack up , so he got into the trunk himself ."
"It was an enchanted trunk , for as soon as the lock was pressed it could fly ."
"He pressed it , and away he flew in it up the chimney , high into the clouds , further and further away ."
"But whenever the bottom gave a little creak he was in terror lest the trunk should go to pieces , for then he would have turned a dreadful somersault-just think of it !"
In this way he arrived at the land of the Turks .
"He hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves , and then walked into the town ."
"He could do that quite well , for all the Turks were dressed just as he was-in a dressing-gown and slippers ."
He met a nurse with a little child .
` Halloa !
"you Turkish nurse , ' said he , ` what is that great castle there close to the town ?"
The one with the windows so high up ? '
"` The sultan 's daughter lives there , ' she replied ."
"` It is prophesied that she will be very unlucky in her husband , and so no one is allowed to see her except when the sultan and sultana are by . '"
"` Thank you , ' said the merchant 's son , and he went into the wood , sat himself in his trunk , flew on to the roof , and crept through the window into the princess 's room ."
"She was lying on the sofa asleep , and was so beautiful that the young merchant had to kiss her ."
"Then she woke up and was very much frightened , but he said he was a Turkish god who had come through the air to see her , and that pleased her very much ."
"They sat close to each other , and he told her a story about her eyes ."
They were beautiful dark lakes in which her thoughts swam about like mermaids .
"And her forehead was a snowy mountain , grand and shining ."
These were lovely stories .
"Then he asked the princess to marry him , and she said yes at once ."
"` But you must come here on Saturday , ' she said , ` for then the sultan and the sultana are coming to tea with me ."
They will be indeed proud that I receive the god of the Turks .
"But mind you have a really good story ready , for my parents like them immensely ."
"My mother likes something rather moral and high-flown , and my father likes something merry to make him laugh . '"
he asked .
`` I thought ye were of the other party . ''
Matcham began to sob .
`` What cheer ! ''
cried Dick .
`` Now the saints behold us !
would ye snivel for a word ? ''
"`` Ye hurt me , '' sobbed Matcham ."
`` Ye hurt me when ye threw me down .
Y ' are a coward to abuse your strength . ''
"`` Nay , that is fool 's talk , '' said Dick , roughly ."
"`` Y ' had no title to my windac , Master John ."
I would ` a ' done right to have well basted you .
"If ye go with me , ye must obey me ; and so , come . ''"
"Matcham had half a thought to stay behind ; but , seeing that Dick continued to scour full-tilt towards the eminence and not so much as looked across his shoulder , he soon thought better of that , and began to run in turn ."
"But the ground was very difficult and steep ; Dick had already a long start , and had , at any rate , the lighter heels , and he had long since come to the summit , crawled forward through the firs , and ensconced himself in a thick tuft of gorse , before Matcham , panting like a deer , rejoined him , and lay down in silence by his side ."
"Below , in the bottom of a considerable valley , the short cut from Tunstall hamlet wound downwards to the ferry ."
"It was well beaten , and the eye followed it easily from point to point ."
Here it was bordered by open glades ; there the forest closed upon it ; every hundred yards it ran beside an ambush .
"Far down the path , the sun shone on seven steel salets , and from time to time , as the trees opened , Selden and his men could be seen riding briskly , still bent upon Sir Daniel 's mission ."
"The wind had somewhat fallen , but still tussled merrily with the trees , and , perhaps , had Appleyard been there , he would have drawn a warning from the troubled conduct of the birds ."
"`` Now , mark , '' Dick whispered ."
`` They be already well advanced into the wood ; their safety lieth rather in continuing forward .
"But see ye where this wide glade runneth down before us , and in the midst of it , these two score trees make like an island ?"
There were their safety .
"An they but come sound as far as that , I will make shift to warn them ."
"But my heart misgiveth me ; they are but seven against so many , and they but carry cross-bows ."
"The long-bow , Jack , will have the uppermost ever . ''"
"Meanwhile , Selden and his men still wound up the path , ignorant of their danger , and momently drew nearer hand ."
"Once , indeed , they paused , drew into a group , and seemed to point and listen ."
"But it was something from far away across the plain that had arrested their attention -- a hollow growl of cannon that came , from time to time , upon the wind , and told of the great battle ."
"It was worth a thought , to be sure ; for if the voice of the big guns were thus become audible in Tunstall Forest , the fight must have rolled ever eastward , and the day , by consequence , gone sore against Sir Daniel and the lords of the dark rose ."
"`` Fool , he had more in his sandal , or stitched into his tippet ."
"Y ' are but a child , Tom Cuckow ; ye have lost the fish . ''"
"But , for all that , Ellis pocketed the purse with nonchalance ."
"He stood leaning on his boar-spear , and looked round upon the rest ."
"They , in various attitudes , took greedily of the venison pottage , and liberally washed it down with ale ."
"This was a good day ; they were in luck ; but business pressed , and they were speedy in their eating ."
The first-comers had by this time even despatched their dinner .
"Some lay down upon the grass and fell instantly asleep , like boa-constrictors ; others talked together , or overhauled their weapons : and one , whose humour was particularly gay , holding forth an ale-horn , began to sing : `` Here is no law in good green shaw , Here is no lack of meat ; 'T is merry and quiet , with deer for our diet , In summer , when all is sweet ."
"Come winter again , with wind and rain -- Come winter , with snow and sleet , Get home to your places , with hoods on your faces , And sit by the fire and eat . ''"
"All this while the two lads had listened and lain close ; only Richard had unslung his cross-bow , and held ready in one hand the windac , or grappling-iron that he used to bend it ."
Otherwise they had not dared to stir ; and this scene of forest life had gone on before their eyes like a scene upon a theatre .
But now there came a strange interruption .
The tall chimney which over-topped the remainder of the ruins rose right above their hiding-place .
"There came a whistle in the air , and then a sounding smack , and the fragments of a broken arrow fell about their ears ."
"Some one from the upper quarters of the wood , perhaps the very sentinel they saw posted in the fir , had shot an arrow at the chimney-top ."
"Matcham could not restrain a little cry , which he instantly stifled , and even Dick started with surprise , and dropped the windac from his fingers ."
"But to the fellows on the lawn , this shaft was an expected signal ."
"They were all afoot together , tightening their belts , testing their bow-strings , loosening sword and dagger in the sheath ."
Ellis held up his hand ; his face had suddenly assumed a look of savage energy ; the white of his eyes shone in his sun-brown face .
"`` Lads , '' he said , `` ye know your places ."
Let not one man 's soul escape you .
Appleyard was a whet before a meal ; but now we go to table .
"I have three men whom I will bitterly avenge -- Harry Shelton , Simon Malmesbury , and '' -- striking his broad bosom -- `` and Ellis Duckworth , by the mass ! ''"
"Another man came , red with hurry , through the thorns . ''"
'T is not Sir Daniel ! ''
he panted .
`` They are but seven .
Is the arrow gone ? ''
"`` It struck but now , '' replied Ellis ."
`` A murrain ! ''
cried the messenger .
`` Methought I heard it whistle .
"Y ' are called to count for this ; in the end , I wot not how , ye have ever the uppermost at law , and ye think all patched ."
"But give me leave , Sir Oliver : the man that ye have dispossessed and beaten is but the angrier , and some day , when the black devil is by , he will up with his bow and clout me a yard of arrow through your inwards . ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , y ' are in the wrong ."
"Bennet , ye should be glad to be corrected , '' said Sir Oliver ."
"`` Y ' are a prater , Bennet , a talker , a babbler ; your mouth is wider than your two ears ."
"Mend it , Bennet , mend it . ''"
"`` Nay , I say no more ."
"Have it as ye list , '' said the retainer ."
"The priest now rose from the stool , and from the writing-case that hung about his neck took forth wax and a taper , and a flint and steel ."
"With these he sealed up the chest and the cupboard with Sir Daniel 's arms , Hatch looking on disconsolate ; and then the whole party proceeded , somewhat timorously , to sally from the house and get to horse . ''"
"'T is time we were on the road , Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , as he held the priest 's stirrup while he mounted ."
"`` Ay ; but , Bennet , things are changed , '' returned the parson ."
`` There is now no Appleyard -- rest his soul !
-- to keep the garrison .
"I shall keep you , Bennet ."
I must have a good man to rest me on in this day of black arrows .
"` The arrow that flieth by day , ' saith the evangel ; I have no mind of the context ; nay , I am a sluggard priest , I am too deep in men 's affairs ."
"Well , let us ride forth , Master Hatch ."
The jackmen should be at the church by now . ''
"So they rode forward down the road , with the wind after them , blowing the tails of the parson 's cloak ; and behind them , as they went , clouds began to arise and blot out the sinking sun ."
"They had passed three of the scattered houses that make up Tunstall hamlet , when , coming to a turn , they saw the church before them ."
Ten or a dozen houses clustered immediately round it ; but to the back the churchyard was next the meadows .
"At the lych-gate , near a score of men were gathered , some in the saddle , some standing by their horses ' heads ."
"They were variously armed and mounted ; some with spears , some with bills , some with bows , and some bestriding plough-horses , still splashed with the mire of the furrow ; for these were the very dregs of the country , and all the better men and the fair equipments were already with Sir Daniel in the field ."
"`` We have not done amiss , praised be the cross of Holywood !"
"Sir Daniel will be right well content , '' observed the priest , inwardly numbering the troop ."
`` Who goes ?
Stand !
if ye be true ! ''
shouted Bennet .
"A man was seen slipping through the churchyard among the yews ; and at the sound of this summons he discarded all concealment , and fairly took to his heels for the forest ."
"The men at the gate , who had been hitherto unaware of the stranger 's presence , woke and scattered ."
"A splashing noise near by drew him down to a valley through which ran a large river , and up a waterfall some salmon were leaping ."
"How their silver sides glistened in the light , and how he longed to catch some of the great fellows !"
But how could he do it ?
"He had beheld no one except the old women , and it was not very likely that they would be able to help him ."
"So with a sigh he turned away and went back to them , but , as he walked , a thought struck him ."
"He pulled out one of his hairs which hung nearly to his waist , and it instantly became a strong line , nearly a mile in length ."
"` Weave me a net that I may catch some salmon , ' said he ."
"And they wove him the net he asked for , and for many weeks he watched by the river , only going back to the old women when he wanted a fish cooked ."
"At last , one day , when he was eating his dinner , the old woman who always spoke first , said to him : ` We have been very glad to see you , grandson , but now it is time that you went home . '"
"And pushing aside a rock , he saw a deep hole , so deep that he could not see to the bottom ."
"Then they dragged a basket out of the house , and tied a rope to it ."
"` Get in , and wrap this blanket round your head , ' said they ; ` and , whatever happens , do n't uncover it till you get to the bottom . '"
"Then they bade him farewell , and he curled himself up in the basket ."
"Down , down , down he went ; would he ever stop going ?"
"But when the basket did stop , the young man forgot what he had been told , and put his head out to see what was the matter ."
"In an instant the basket moved , but , to his horror , instead of going down , he felt himself being drawn upwards , and shortly after he beheld the faces of the old women ."
"` You will never see your wife and son if you will not do as you are bid , ' said they ."
"` Now get in , and do not stir till you hear a crow calling . '"
"This time the young man was wiser , and though the basket often stopped , and strange creatures seemed to rest on him and to pluck at his blanket , he held it tight till he heard the crow calling ."
"Then he flung off the blanket and sprang out , while the basket vanished in the sky ."
"He walked on quickly down the track that led to the hut , when , before him , he saw his wife with his little son on her back ."
` Oh !
"there is father at last , ' cried the boy ; but the mother bade him cease from idle talking ."
"` But , mother , it is true ; father is coming ! '"
repeated the child .
"And , to satisfy him , the woman turned round and perceived her husband ."
"Oh , how glad they all were to be together again !"
"And when the wind whistled through the forest , and the snow stood in great banks round the door , the father used to take the little boy on his knee and tell him how he caught salmon in the Land of the Sun ."
How the Stalos Were Tricked -LSB- From the Journal of the Anthropological Institute . -RSB-
"` Mother , I have seen such a wonderful man , ' said a little boy one day , as he entered a hut in Lapland , bearing in his arms the bundle of sticks he had been sent out to gather ."
"` Have you , my son ; and what was he like ? '"
"asked the mother , as she took off the child 's sheepskin coat and shook it on the doorstep ."
"Only you must unfasten the halter you lead it with and bring it back , and do n't return by the high road , but through the forest . '"
"The next day , when the couple rose , they saw an enormous head looking in at their bedroom window , and behind it was a cow which was nearly as big as their hut ."
Kirsten was wild with joy to think of the money the cow would bring them .
` But how are you going to put the rope over her head ? '
asked she .
"` Wait and you 'll see , mother , ' answered her husband ."
"Then Peder took the ladder that led up to the hayloft and set it against the cow 's neck , and he climbed up and slipped the rope over her head ."
"When he had made sure that the noose was fast they started for the palace , and met the king himself walking in his grounds . '"
"I heard that the princess was going to be married , ' said Peder , ` so I 've brought your majesty a cow which is bigger than any cow that was ever seen ."
Will your majesty deign to buy it ? '
"The king had , in truth , never seen so large a beast , and he willingly paid the thousand dollars , which was the price demanded ; but Peder remembered to take off the halter before he left ."
After he was gone the king sent for the butcher and told him to kill the animal for the wedding feast .
"The butcher got ready his pole-axe ; but just as he was going to strike , the cow changed itself into a dove and flew away , and the butcher stood staring after it as if he were turned to stone ."
"However , as the dove could not be found , he was obliged to tell the king what had happened , and the king in his turn despatched messengers to capture the old man and bring him back ."
"But Peder was safe in the woods , and could not be found ."
"When at last he felt the danger was over , and he might go home , Kirsten nearly fainted with joy at the sight of all the money he brought with him ."
"` Now that we are rich people we must build a bigger house , ' cried she ; and was vexed to find that Peder only shook his head and said : ` No ; if they did that people would talk , and say they had got their wealth by ill-doing . '"
A few mornings later Hans came again .
"` Be off before you get us into trouble , ' said his father ."
"` So far the money has come right enough , but I do n't trust it . '"
"` Do n't worry over that , father , ' said Hans ."
` To-morrow you will find a horse outside by the gate .
Ride it to market and you will get a thousand dollars for it .
Only do n't forget to loosen the bridle when you sell it . '
"Well , in the morning there was the horse ; Kirsten had never seen so find an animal ."
"` Take care it does n't hurt you , Peder , ' said she ."
"` Nonsense , wife , ' answered he crossly ."
"` When I was a lad I lived with horses , and could ride anything for twenty miles round . '"
"But that was not quite the truth , for he had never mounted a horse in his life ."
"Still , the animal was quiet enough , so Peder got safely to market on its back ."
"There he met a man who offered nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars for it , but Peder would take nothing less than a thousand ."
"At last there came an old , grey-bearded man who looked at the horse and agreed to buy it ; but the moment he touched it the horse began to kick and plunge . '"
I 'LL keel-haul him ! ''
"All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch , slapping tables with his hand , and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner ."
"My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass , and I watched the cook narrowly ."
"But he was too deep , and too ready , and too clever for me , and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd , and been scolded like thieves , I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver ."
"`` See here , now , Hawkins , '' said he , `` here 's a blessed hard thing on a man like me , now , ai n't it ?"
There 's Cap'n Trelawney -- what 's he to think ?
Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum !
Here you comes and tells me of it plain ; and here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights !
"Now , Hawkins , you do me justice with the cap'n ."
"You 're a lad , you are , but you 're as smart as paint ."
I see that when you first come in .
"Now , here it is : What could I do , with this old timber I hobble on ?"
"When I was an A B master mariner I 'd have come up alongside of him , hand over hand , and broached him to in a brace of old shakes , I would ; but now -- '' And then , all of a sudden , he stopped , and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something ."
`` The score ! ''
he burst out .
`` Three goes o ' rum !
"Why , shiver my timbers , if I had n't forgotten my score ! ''"
"And falling on a bench , he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks ."
"I could not help joining , and we laughed together , peal after peal , until the tavern rang again ."
"`` Why , what a precious old sea-calf I am ! ''"
"he said at last , wiping his cheeks ."
"`` You and me should get on well , Hawkins , for I 'll take my davy I should be rated ship 's boy ."
"But come now , stand by to go about ."
This wo n't do .
"Dooty is dooty , messmates ."
"I 'll put on my old cockerel hat , and step along of you to Cap'n Trelawney , and report this here affair ."
"For mind you , it 's serious , young Hawkins ; and neither you nor me 's come out of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit ."
"Nor you neither , says you ; not smart -- none of the pair of us smart ."
But dash my buttons !
That was a good un about my score . ''
"And he began to laugh again , and that so heartily , that though I did not see the joke as he did , I was again obliged to join him in his mirth ."
"On our little walk along the quays , he made himself the most interesting companion , telling me about the different ships that we passed by , their rig , tonnage , and nationality , explaining the work that was going forward -- how one was discharging , another taking in cargo , and a third making ready for sea -- and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly ."
"If we had been allowed to sit idle , we should all have fallen in the blues , but Captain Smollett was never the man for that ."
"All hands were called up before him , and he divided us into watches ."
"The doctor and Gray and I for one ; the squire , Hunter , and Joyce upon the other ."
"Tired though we all were , two were sent out for firewood ; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth ; the doctor was named cook ; I was put sentry at the door ; and the captain himself went from one to another , keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted ."
"From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes , which were almost smoked out of his head , and whenever he did so , he had a word for me ."
"`` That man Smollett , '' he said once , `` is a better man than I am ."
"And when I say that it means a deal , Jim . ''"
Another time he came and was silent for a while .
"Then he put his head on one side , and looked at me ."
`` Is this Ben Gunn a man ? ''
he asked .
"`` I do not know , sir , '' said I. `` I am not very sure whether he 's sane . ''"
"`` If there 's any doubt about the matter , he is , '' returned the doctor ."
"`` A man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island , Jim , ca n't expect to appear as sane as you or me ."
It does n't lie in human nature .
Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for ? ''
"`` Yes , sir , cheese , '' I answered ."
"`` Well , Jim , '' says he , `` just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food ."
"You 've seen my snuff-box , have n't you ?"
"And you never saw me take snuff , the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese -- a cheese made in Italy , very nutritious ."
"Well , that 's for Ben Gunn ! ''"
Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bare-headed in the breeze .
"A good deal of firewood had been got in , but not enough for the captain 's fancy , and he shook his head over it and told us we `` must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier . ''"
"Then , when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog , the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects ."
"It appears they were at their wits ' end what to do , the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came ."
"But our best hope , it was decided , was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA ."
"From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen , two others were wounded , and one at least -- the man shot beside the gun -- severely wounded , if he were not dead ."
"Every time we had a crack at them , we were to take it , saving our own lives , with the extremest care ."
"And besides that , we had two able allies -- rum and the climate ."
"As for the first , though we were about half a mile away , we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night ; and as for the second , the doctor staked his wig that , camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies , the half of them would be on their backs before a week ."
"`` So , '' he added , `` if we are not all shot down first they 'll be glad to be packing in the schooner ."
"It 's always a ship , and they can get to buccaneering again , I suppose . ''"
He may not stand alone ; 't is not in nature . ''
"`` They that have no judgment should not draw the sword , '' replied the young lady ."
"`` Ye that fight but for a hazard , what are ye but a butcher ?"
"War is but noble by the cause , and y ' have disgraced it . ''"
"`` Madam , '' said the miserable Dick , `` I do partly see mine error ."
I have made too much haste ; I have been busy before my time .
"Already I stole a ship -- thinking , I do swear it , to do well -- and thereby brought about the death of many innocent , and the grief and ruin of a poor old man whose face this very day hath stabbed me like a dagger ."
"And for this morning , I did but design to do myself credit , and get fame to marry with , and , behold !"
I have brought about the death of your dear kinsman that was good to me .
"And what besides , I know not ."
"For , alas !"
"I may have set York upon the throne , and that may be the worser cause , and may do hurt to England ."
"O , madam , I do see my sin ."
I am unfit for life .
"I will , for penance sake and to avoid worse evil , once I have finished this adventure , get me to a cloister ."
I will forswear Joanna and the trade of arms .
"I will be a friar , and pray for your good kinsman 's spirit all my days . ''"
"It appeared to Dick , in this extremity of his humiliation and repentance , that the young lady had laughed ."
"Raising his countenance , he found her looking down upon him , in the fire-light , with a somewhat peculiar but not unkind expression ."
"`` Madam , '' he cried , thinking the laughter to have been an illusion of his hearing , but still , from her changed looks , hoping to have touched her heart , `` madam , will not this content you ?"
I give up all to undo what I have done amiss ; I make heaven certain for Lord Risingham .
"And all this upon the very day that I have won my spurs , and thought myself the happiest young gentleman on ground . ''"
"`` O boy , '' she said -- `` good boy ! ''"
"And then , to the extreme surprise of Dick , she first very tenderly wiped the tears away from his cheeks , and then , as if yielding to a sudden impulse , threw both her arms about his neck , drew up his face , and kissed him ."
A pitiful bewilderment came over simple-minded Dick .
"`` But come , '' she said , with great cheerfulness , `` you that are a captain , ye must eat ."
Why sup ye not ? ''
"`` Dear Mistress Risingham , '' replied Dick , `` I did but wait first upon my prisoner ; but , to say truth , penitence will no longer suffer me to endure the sight of food ."
"I were better to fast , dear lady , and to pray . ''"
"`` Call me Alicia , '' she said ; `` are we not old friends ?"
"And now , come , I will eat with you , bit for bit and sup for sup ; so if ye eat not , neither will I ; but if ye eat hearty , I will dine like a ploughman . ''"
"So there and then she fell to ; and Dick , who had an excellent stomach , proceeded to bear her company , at first with great reluctance , but gradually , as he entered into the spirit , with more and more vigour and devotion : until , at last , he forgot even to watch his model , and most heartily repaired the expenses of his day of labour and excitement ."
She picked her steps carefully back with her precious specimens .
The stranger eyed her severely as she stepped on the rocks .
"`` I should think you would have more sense than to risk your life in that fashion for a handful of seaweeds , '' he said ."
"`` I have n't the faintest idea what you mean , '' said Miss Rangely ."
"`` You do n't look crazy , but you talk as if you were . ''"
`` Do you mean to say you do n't know that what the people hereabouts call the Bottomless Pit is situated right off that point -- the most dangerous spot along the whole coast ? ''
"`` No , I did n't , '' said Katherine , horrified ."
"She remembered now that Aunt Elizabeth had warned her to be careful of some bad hole along shore , but she had not been paying much attention and had supposed it to be in quite another direction ."
`` I am a stranger here . ''
"`` Well , I hardly thought you 'd be foolish enough to be out there if you knew , '' said the other in mollified accents ."
"`` The place ought not to be left without warning , anyhow ."
It is the most careless thing I ever heard of .
There is a big hole right off that point and nobody has ever been able to find the bottom of it .
A person who got into it would never be heard of again .
The rocks there form an eddy that sucks everything right down . ''
"`` I am very grateful to you for calling me in , '' said Katherine humbly ."
`` I had no idea I was in such danger . ''
"`` You have a very fine bunch of seaweeds , I see , '' said the unknown ."
But Katherine was in no mood to converse on seaweeds .
"She suddenly realized what she must look like -- bare feet , draggled skirts , dripping arms ."
And this creature whom she had taken for a lunatic was undoubtedly a gentleman .
"Oh , if he would only go and give her a chance to put on her shoes and stockings !"
Nothing seemed further from his intentions .
"When Katherine had picked up the aforesaid articles and turned homeward , he walked beside her , still discoursing on seaweeds as eloquently as if he were commonly accustomed to walking with barefooted young women ."
"In spite of herself , Katherine could n't help listening to him , for he managed to invest seaweeds with an absorbing interest ."
"She finally decided that as he did n't seem to mind her bare feet , she would n't either ."
He knew so much about seaweeds that Katherine felt decidedly amateurish beside him .
He looked over her specimens and pointed out the valuable ones .
"He explained the best method of preserving and mounting them , and told her of other and less dangerous places along the shore where she might get some new varieties ."
"When they came in sight of Harbour Hill , Katherine began to wonder what on earth she would do with him ."
"It was n't exactly permissible to snub a man who had practically saved your life , but , on the other hand , the prospect of walking through the principal street of Harbour Hill barefooted and escorted by a scholarly looking gentleman discoursing on seaweeds was not to be calmly contemplated ."
The unknown cut the Gordian knot himself .
It was Peter 's cockiness .
"This had got on Hook 's nerves ; it made his iron claw twitch , and at night it disturbed him like an insect ."
"While Peter lived , the tortured man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come ."
"The question now was how to get down the trees , or how to get his dogs down ?"
"He ran his greedy eyes over them , searching for the thinnest ones ."
"They wriggled uncomfortably , for they knew he would not scruple -LSB- hesitate -RSB- to ram them down with poles ."
"In the meantime , what of the boys ?"
"We have seen them at the first clang of the weapons , turned as it were into stone figures , open-mouthed , all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter ; and we return to them as their mouths close , and their arms fall to their sides ."
"The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose , passed like a fierce gust of wind ; but they know that in the passing it has determined their fate ."
Which side had won ?
"The pirates , listening avidly at the mouths of the trees , heard the question put by every boy , and alas , they also heard Peter 's answer ."
"`` If the redskins have won , '' he said , `` they will beat the tom-tom ; it is always their sign of victory . ''"
"Now Smee had found the tom-tom , and was at that moment sitting on it ."
"`` You will never hear the tom-tom again , '' he muttered , but inaudibly of course , for strict silence had been enjoined -LSB- urged -RSB- ."
"To his amazement Hook signed him to beat the tom-tom , and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order ."
"Never , probably , had this simple man admired Hook so much ."
"Twice Smee beat upon the instrument , and then stopped to listen gleefully ."
"`` The tom-tom , '' the miscreants heard Peter cry ; `` an Indian victory ! ''"
"The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above , and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter ."
"This puzzled the pirates , but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees ."
They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands .
"Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders : one man to each tree , and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart ."
Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES ?
The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better .
The first to emerge from his tree was Curly .
"He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco , who flung him to Smee , who flung him to Starkey , who flung him to Bill Jukes , who flung him to Noodler , and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate ."
"All the boys were plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner ; and several of them were in the air at a time , like bales of goods flung from hand to hand ."
"A different treatment was accorded to Wendy , who came last ."
"With ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her , and , offering her his arm , escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged ."
"He did it with such an air , he was so frightfully DISTINGUE -LSB- imposingly distinguished -RSB- , that she was too fascinated to cry out ."
She was only a little girl .
"Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her , and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results ."
"`` Turn her into something that does not mind the cold , '' seemed a good suggestion of the doctor 's , but the only thing they could think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake ."
"`` And it might melt , '' the Queen pointed out , so that idea had to be given up ."
"A magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot , but though there were so many of them she was too heavy ."
"By this time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs , but presently the Cupids had a lovely idea ."
"`` Build a house round her , '' they cried , and at once everybody perceived that this was the thing to do ; in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among the branches , architects were running round Maimie , measuring her ; a bricklayer 's yard sprang up at her feet , seventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation stone and the Queen laid it , overseers were appointed to keep the boys off , scaffoldings were run up , the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning lathes , and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting in the windows ."
The house was exactly the size of Maimie and perfectly lovely .
"One of her arms was extended and this had bothered them for a second , but they built a verandah round it , leading to the front door ."
"The windows were the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller , but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof ."
"The fairies , as is their custom , clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness , and they were all so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear to think they had finished it ."
"So they gave it ever so many little extra touches , and even then they added more extra touches ."
"For instance , two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney ."
"`` Now we fear it is quite finished , '' they sighed ."
"But no , for another two ran up the ladder , and tied some smoke to the chimney ."
"`` That certainly finishes it , '' they cried reluctantly ."
"`` Not at all , '' cried a glow-worm , `` if she were to wake without seeing a night-light she might be frightened , so I shall be her night-light . ''"
"`` Wait one moment , '' said a china merchant , `` and I shall make you a saucer . ''"
"Now alas , it was absolutely finished ."
"Oh , dear no !"
"`` Gracious me , '' cried a brass manufacturer , `` there 's no handle on the door , '' and he put one on ."
An ironmonger added a scraper and an old lady ran up with a door-mat .
"Carpenters arrived with a water-butt , and the painters insisted on painting it ."
Finished at last !
`` Finished !
"how can it be finished , '' the plumber demanded scornfully , `` before hot and cold are put in ? ''"
and he put in hot and cold .
"Then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and bulbs and forcing-houses , and soon they had a flower garden to the right of the verandah and a vegetable garden to the left , and roses and clematis on the walls of the house , and in less time than five minutes all these dear things were in full bloom ."
"Oh , how beautiful the little house was now !"
"But it was at last finished true as true , and they had to leave it and return to the dance ."
"They all kissed their hands to it as they went away , and the last to go was Brownie ."
She stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney .
"All through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the Figs taking care of Maimie , and she never knew ."
"She slept until the dream was quite finished and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg , and then she almost fell asleep again , and then she called out , `` Tony , '' for she thought she was at home in the nursery ."
The scene must have been highly farcical . ''
"I thought myself it was a silly business , but I could not forget my father had a hand in it ."
"`` Surely , sir , it had some note of tragedy , '' said I. `` Why , no , sir , not at all , '' returned the lawyer ."
"`` For tragedy implies some ponderable matter in dispute , some dignus vindice nodus ; and this piece of work was all about the petulance of a young ass that had been spoiled , and wanted nothing so much as to be tied up and soundly belted ."
"However , that was not your father 's view ; and the end of it was , that from concession to concession on your father 's part , and from one height to another of squalling , sentimental selfishness upon your uncle 's , they came at last to drive a sort of bargain , from whose ill results you have recently been smarting ."
"The one man took the lady , the other the estate ."
"Now , Mr. David , they talk a great deal of charity and generosity ; but in this disputable state of life , I often think the happiest consequences seem to flow when a gentleman consults his lawyer , and takes all the law allows him ."
"Anyhow , this piece of Quixotry on your father 's part , as it was unjust in itself , has brought forth a monstrous family of injustices ."
"Your father and mother lived and died poor folk ; you were poorly reared ; and in the meanwhile , what a time it has been for the tenants on the estate of Shaws !"
And I might add -LRB- if it was a matter I cared much about -RRB- what a time for Mr. Ebenezer ! ''
"`` And yet that is certainly the strangest part of all , '' said I , `` that a man 's nature should thus change . ''"
"`` True , '' said Mr. Rankeillor ."
`` And yet I imagine it was natural enough .
He could not think that he had played a handsome part .
"Those who knew the story gave him the cold shoulder ; those who knew it not , seeing one brother disappear , and the other succeed in the estate , raised a cry of murder ; so that upon all sides he found himself evited ."
"Money was all he got by his bargain ; well , he came to think the more of money ."
"He was selfish when he was young , he is selfish now that he is old ; and the latter end of all these pretty manners and fine feelings you have seen for yourself . ''"
"`` Well , sir , '' said I , `` and in all this , what is my position ? ''"
"`` The estate is yours beyond a doubt , '' replied the lawyer ."
"`` It matters nothing what your father signed , you are the heir of entail ."
But your uncle is a man to fight the indefensible ; and it would be likely your identity that he would call in question .
"A lawsuit is always expensive , and a family lawsuit always scandalous ; besides which , if any of your doings with your friend Mr. Thomson were to come out , we might find that we had burned our fingers ."
"The kidnapping , to be sure , would be a court card upon our side , if we could only prove it ."
"But it may be difficult to prove ; and my advice -LRB- upon the whole -RRB- is to make a very easy bargain with your uncle , perhaps even leaving him at Shaws where he has taken root for a quarter of a century , and contenting yourself in the meanwhile with a fair provision . ''"
"I told him I was very willing to be easy , and that to carry family concerns before the public was a step from which I was naturally much averse ."
In the meantime -LRB- thinking to myself -RRB- I began to see the outlines of that scheme on which we afterwards acted .
"`` The great affair , '' I asked , `` is to bring home to him the kidnapping ? ''"
"`` Surely , '' said Mr. Rankeillor , `` and if possible , out of court ."
"For mark you here , Mr. David : we could no doubt find some men of the Covenant who would swear to your reclusion ; but once they were in the box , we could no longer check their testimony , and some word of your friend Mr. Thomson must certainly crop out ."
Which -LRB- from what you have let fall -RRB- I can not think to be desirable . ''
"`` Well , sir , '' said I , `` here is my way of it . ''"
And I opened my plot to him .
"cried Jack , ready to follow where his beloved friend led , and the others nodded , unwilling to be outdone by the youngest member ."
`` Good !
"With all of us to lend a hand , we can do a great deal ; and I tell you , boys , it is time , if we want to keep poor Bob straight ."
"We all turn our backs on him , so he loafs round the tavern , and goes with fellows we do n't care to know ."
"But he is n't bad yet , and we can keep him up , I 'm sure , if we just try ."
"I hope to get him into the Lodge , and that will be half the battle , wo n't it , Frank ? ''"
"added Ed , sure that this suggestion would have weight with the honorable Chairman ."
`` Bring him along ; I 'm with you ! ''
"answered Frank , making up his mind at once , for he had joined the Temperance Lodge four years ago , and already six boys had followed his example ."
"`` He is learning to smoke , but we 'll make him drop it before it leads to worse ."
"You can help him there , Admiral , if you only will , '' added Ed , giving a grateful look at one friend , and turning to the other ."
"`` I 'm your man ; '' and Gus looked as if he knew what he promised , for he had given up smoking to oblige his father , and kept his word like a hero ."
"`` You other fellows can do a good deal by just being kind and not twitting him with old scrapes , and I 'll do anything I can for you all to pay for this ; '' and Ed sat down with a beaming smile , feeling that his cause was won ."
"The vote was taken , and all hands went up , for even surly Joe gave in ; so Bob and Tom were duly elected , and proved their gratitude for the honor done them by becoming worthy members of the club ."
"It was only boys ' play now , but the kind heart and pure instincts of one lad showed the others how to lend a helping hand to a comrade in danger , and win him away from temptation to the safer pastimes of their more guarded lives ."
"Well pleased with themselves -- for every genuine act or word , no matter how trifling it seems , leaves a sweet and strengthening influence behind -- the members settled down to the debate , which was never very long , and often only an excuse for fun of all sorts ."
"`` Ralph , Gus , and Ed are for , and Brickbat , Grif , and Chick against , I suppose ? ''"
"said Frank , surveying his company like a general preparing for battle ."
"`` No , sir !"
I believe in co-everything ! ''
"cried Chick , a mild youth , who loyally escorted a chosen damsel home from school every day ."
"A laugh greeted this bold declaration , and Chick sat down , red but firm ."
"`` I 'll speak for two since the Chairman ca n't , and Jack wo n't go against those who pet him most to death , '' said Joe , who , not being a favorite with the girls , considered them a nuisance and lost no opportunity of telling them so ."
"`` Fire away , then , since you are up ; '' commanded Frank ."
"`` Well , '' began Joe , feeling too late how much he had undertaken , `` I do n't know a great deal about it , and I do n't care , but I do not believe in having girls at college ."
"They do n't belong there , nobody wants 'em , and they 'd better be at home darning their stockings . ''"
"`` Yours , too , '' put in Ralph , who had heard that argument so often he was tired of it ."
`` Of course ; that 's what girls are for .
"I do n't mind 'em at school , but I 'd just as soon they had a room to themselves ."
We should get on better . '' ''
"You would if Mabel was n't in your class and always ahead of you , '' observed Ed , whose friend was a fine scholar , and he very proud of the fact ."
"`` Look here , if you fellows keep interrupting , I wo n't sit down for half an hour , '' said Joe , well knowing that eloquence was not his gift , but bound to have his say out ."
"The other boys were flying around him now , flouting , scornful ; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently , his mind was no longer with them ; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago , or being sent up -LSB- to the headmaster -RSB- for good , or watching the wall-game from a famous wall ."
"And his shoes were right , and his waistcoat was right , and his tie was right , and his socks were right ."
"James Hook , thou not wholly unheroic figure , farewell ."
For we have come to his last moment .
"Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised , he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea ."
He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him ; for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him : a little mark of respect from us at the end .
"He had one last triumph , which I think we need not grudge him ."
"As he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air , he invited him with a gesture to use his foot ."
It made Peter kick instead of stab .
At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved .
"`` Bad form , '' he cried jeeringly , and went content to the crocodile ."
Thus perished James Hook .
"`` Seventeen , '' Slightly sang out ; but he was not quite correct in his figures ."
"Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night ; but two reached the shore : Starkey to be captured by the redskins , who made him nurse for all their papooses , a melancholy come-down for a pirate ; and Smee , who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles , making a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas ."
Hook had feared .
"Wendy , of course , had stood by taking no part in the fight , though watching Peter with glistening eyes ; but now that all was over she became prominent again ."
"She praised them equally , and shuddered delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one ; and then she took them into Hook 's cabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail ."
It said `` half-past one ! ''
The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all .
"She got them to bed in the pirates ' bunks pretty quickly , you may be sure ; all but Peter , who strutted up and down on the deck , until at last he fell asleep by the side of Long Tom ."
"He had one of his dreams that night , and cried in his sleep for a long time , and Wendy held him tightly ."
"Chapter 16 THE RETURN HOME By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps -LSB- legs -RSB- ; for there was a big sea running ; and Tootles , the bo ` sun , was among them , with a rope 's end in his hand and chewing tobacco ."
"They all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee , shaved smartly , and tumbled up , with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers ."
It need not be said who was the captain .
Nibs and John were first and second mate .
There was a woman aboard .
"The rest were tars -LSB- sailors -RSB- before the mast , and lived in the fo ` c ` sle ."
"Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel ; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to them ; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties , but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast , and if they snapped at him he would tear them ."
"The bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood , and they cheered him lustily ."
"Then a few sharp orders were given , and they turned the ship round , and nosed her for the mainland ."
"Captain Pan calculated , after consulting the ship 's chart , that if this weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June , after which it would save time to fly ."
"Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping it a pirate ; but the captain treated them as dogs , and they dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin -LSB- one person after another , as they had to Cpt ."
"Then they all took ship and sailed home , and when they came to the princess 's country , Hans disguised himself as the sovereign of a neighbouring kingdom , and went up to the palace alone ."
"He was given a hearty welcome by the king , who prided himself on his hospitality , and a banquet was commanded in his honour ."
"That evening , whilst they sat drinking their wine , Hans said to the king : ' I have heard the fame of your majesty 's wisdom , and I have travelled from far to ask your counsel ."
A man in my country has buried his daughter alive because she loved a youth who was born a peasant .
"How shall I punish this unnatural father , for it is left to me to give judgment ? '"
"The king , who was still truly grieved for his daughter 's loss , answered quickly : ` Burn him alive , and strew his ashes all over the kingdom . '"
"Hans looked at him steadily for a moment , and then threw off his disguise ."
"` You are the man , ' said he ; ` and I am he who loved your daughter , and became a gold ring on her finger ."
"She is safe , and waiting not far from here ; but you have pronounced judgment on yourself . '"
"Then the king fell on his knees and begged for mercy ; and as he had in other respects been a good father , they forgave him ."
The wedding of Hans and the princess was celebrated with great festivities which lasted a month .
As for the hill-man he intended to be present ; but whilst he was walking along a street which led to the palace a loose stone fell on his head and killed him .

"The Cat 's Elopement -LSB- From the Japanische Marchen und Sagen , von David Brauns -LRB- Leipzig : Wilhelm Friedrich -RRB- . -RSB-"
"Once upon a time there lived a cat of marvellous beauty , with a skin as soft and shining as silk , and wise green eyes , that could see even in the dark ."
"His name was Gon , and he belonged to a music teacher , who was so fond and proud of him that he would not have parted with him for anything in the world ."
Now not far from the music master 's house there dwelt a lady who possessed a most lovely little pussy cat called Koma .
"She was such a little dear altogether , and blinked her eyes so daintily , and ate her supper so tidily , and when she had finished she licked her pink nose so delicately with her little tongue , that her mistress was never tired of saying , ` Koma , Koma , what should I do without you ? '"
"Well , it happened one day that these two , when out for an evening stroll , met under a cherry tree , and in one moment fell madly in love with each other ."
"Gon had long felt that it was time for him to find a wife , for all the ladies in the neighbourhood paid him so much attention that it made him quite shy ; but he was not easy to please , and did not care about any of them ."
"Now , before he had time to think , Cupid had entangled him in his net , and he was filled with love towards Koma ."
"She fully returned his passion , but , like a woman , she saw the difficulties in the way , and consulted sadly with Gon as to the means of overcoming them ."
"Gon entreated his master to set matters right by buying Koma , but her mistress would not part from her ."
"Then the music master was asked to sell Gon to the lady , but he declined to listen to any such suggestion , so everything remained as before ."
"At length the love of the couple grew to such a pitch that they determined to please themselves , and to seek their fortunes together ."
"So one moonlight night they stole away , and ventured out into an unknown world ."
"All day long they marched bravely on through the sunshine , till they had left their homes far behind them , and towards evening they found themselves in a large park ."
"The wanderers by this time were very hot and tired , and the grass looked very soft and inviting , and the trees cast cool deep shadows , when suddenly an ogre appeared in this Paradise , in the shape of a big , big dog !"
"He came springing towards them showing all his teeth , and Koma shrieked , and rushed up a cherry tree ."
"Gon , however , stood his ground boldly , and prepared to give battle , for he felt that Koma 's eyes were upon him , and that he must not run away ."
"But , alas !"
"his courage would have availed him nothing had his enemy once touched him , for he was large and powerful , and very fierce ."
"Merry hated clearing up , but dutifully did every distasteful task , and kept her eye on careless Roxy till all was in order ; then she gladly went to perch on her father 's knee , seeing in all the faces about her the silent welcome they always wore for the `` little one . ''"
"`` Yes , I do want something , but I know you will say it is silly , '' she began , as her father pinched her blooming cheek , with the wish that his peaches would ever look half as well ."
"`` Should n't wonder if it was a doll now ; '' and Mr. Grant stroked her head with an indulgent smile , as if she was about six instead of fifteen ."
"`` Why , father , you know I do n't !"
I have n't played with dollies for years and years .
"No ; I want to fix up my room pretty , like Jill 's ."
"I 'll do it all myself , and only want a few things , for I do n't expect it to look as nice as hers . ''"
"Indignation gave Merry courage to state her wishes boldly , though she knew the boys would laugh ."
"They did , and her mother said in a tone of surprise , -- `` Why , child , what more can you want ?"
"I 'm sure your room is always as neat as a new pin , thanks to your bringing up , and I told you to have a fire there whenever you wanted to . ''"
"`` Let me have some old things out of the garret , and I 'll show you what I want ."
"It is neat , but so bare and ugly I hate to be there ."
I do so love something pretty to look at ! ''
and Merry gave a little shiver of disgust as she turned her eyes away from the large greasy boot Dick was holding up to be sure it was well lubricated all round .
"`` So do I , and that 's a fact ."
"I could n't get on without my pretty girl here , any way ."
"Why , she touches up the old place better than a dozen flower-pots in full blow , '' said the farmer , as his eye went from the scarlet geranium to the bright young face so near his own ."
`` I wish I had a dozen in the sitting-room window .
"Mother says they are not tidy , but I 'd keep them neat , and I know you 'd like it , '' broke in Merry , glad of the chance to get one of the long-desired wishes of her heart fulfilled ."
`` I 'll fetch you some next time I go over to Ballad 's .
"Tell me what you want , and we 'll have a posy bed somewhere round , see if we do n't , '' said her father , dimly understanding what she wanted ."
"`` Now , if mother says I may fix my room , I shall be satisfied , and I 'll do my chores without a bit of fuss , to show how grateful I am , '' said the girl , thanking her father with a kiss , and smiling at her mother so wistfully that the good woman could not refuse ."
`` You may have anything you like out of the blue chest .
"There 's a lot of things there that the moths got at after Grandma died , and I could n't bear to throw or give 'em away ."
"Trim up your room as you like , and mind you do n't forget your part of the bargain , '' answered Mrs. Grant , seeing profit in the plan ."
"`` I wo n't ; I 'll work all the morning to-morrow , and in the afternoon I 'll get ready to show you what I call a nice , pretty room , '' answered Merry , looking so pleased it seemed as if another flower had blossomed in the large bare kitchen ."
"She kept her word , and the very stormy afternoon when Jill got into trouble , Merry was working busily at her little bower ."
"In the blue chest she found a variety of treasures , and ignoring the moth holes , used them to the best advantage , trying to imitate the simple comfort with a touch of elegance which prevailed in Mrs. Minot 's back bedroom ."
"Three faded red-moreen curtains went up at the windows over the chilly paper shades , giving a pleasant glow to the bare walls ."
"A red quilt with white stars , rather the worse for many washings , covered the bed , and a gay cloth the table , where a judicious arrangement of books and baskets concealed the spots ."
"The little air-tight stove was banished , and a pair of ancient andirons shone in the fire-light ."
"Grandma 's last and largest braided rug lay on the hearth , and her brass candlesticks adorned the bureau , over the mirror of which was festooned a white muslin skirt , tied up with Merry 's red sash ."
"Shoes , skirts , books , and toys lay about , and her drawers were a perfect chaos of soiled ruffles , odd gloves , old ribbons , boot lacings , and bits of paper ."
"`` Oh , my heart , what a muddle !"
"Mrs. Minot would n't think much of me if she could see that , '' said Molly , recalling how that lady once said she could judge a good deal of a little girl 's character and habits by a peep at her top drawer , and went on , with great success , to guess how each of the school-mates kept her drawer ."
"`` Come , missionary , clear up , and do n't let me find such a glory-hole again , or I 'll report you to the society , '' said Molly , tipping the whole drawer-full out upon the bed , and beguiling the tiresome job by keeping up the new play ."
"Twilight came before it was done , and a great pile of things loomed up on her table , with no visible means of repair , -- for Molly 's work-basket was full of nuts , and her thimble down a hole in the shed-floor , where the cats had dropped it in their play ."
"`` I 'll ask Bat for hooks and tape , and papa for some money to buy scissors and things , for I do n't know where mine are ."
Glad I ca n't do any more now !
Being neat is such hard work ! ''
"and Molly threw herself down on the rug beside the old wooden cradle in which Boo was blissfully rocking , with a cargo of toys aboard ."
"She watched her time , and as soon as her father had done supper , she hastened to say , before he got to his desk , -- `` Please , papa , I want a dollar to get some brass buttons and things to fix Boo 's clothes with ."
He wore a hole in his new trousers coasting down the Kembles ' steps .
And ca n't I wash him ?
"He needs it , and Miss Bat wo n't let me have a tub . ''"
"`` Certainly , child , certainly ; do what you like , only do n't keep me ."
"I must be off , or I shall miss Jackson , and he 's the man I want ; '' and , throwing down two dollars instead of one , Mr. Bemis hurried away , with a vague impression that Boo had swallowed a dozen brass buttons , and Miss Bat had been coasting somewhere in a bath-pan ; but catching Jackson was important , so he did not stop to investigate ."
"Armed with the paternal permission , Molly carried her point , and oh , what a dreadful evening poor Boo spent !"
"First , he was decoyed upstairs an hour too soon , then put in a tub by main force and sternly scrubbed , in spite of shrieks that brought Miss Bat to the locked door to condole with the sufferer , scold the scrubber , and depart , darkly prophesying croup before morning ."
"`` He always howls when he is washed ; but I shall do it , since you wo n't , and he must get used to it ."
"I will not have people tell me he 's neglected , if I can help it , '' cried Molly , working away with tears in her eyes -- for it was as hard for her as for Boo ; but she meant to be thorough for once in her life , no matter what happened ."
"When the worst was over , she coaxed him with candy and stories till the long task of combing out the curls was safely done ; then , in the clean night-gown with a blue button newly sewed on , she laid him in bed , worn out , but sweet as a rose ."
"`` Now , say your prayers , darling , and go to sleep with the nice red blanket all tucked round so you wo n't get cold , '' said Molly , rather doubtful of the effect of the wet head ."
"`` No , I wo n't !"
Going to sleep now !
"'' and Boo shut his eyes wearily , feeling that his late trials had not left him in a prayerful mood ."
"`` Then you 'll be a real little heathen , as Mrs. Pecq called you , and I do n't know what I shall do with you , '' said Molly , longing to cuddle rather than scold the little fellow , whose soul needed looking after as well as his body ."
"`` No , no ; I wo n't be a heevin !"
I do n't want to be frowed to the trockindiles .
I will say my prayers !
"oh , I will ! ''"
"and , rising in his bed , Boo did so , with the devotion of an infant Samuel , for he remembered the talk when the society was formed ."
"Molly thought her labors were over for that night , and soon went to bed , tired with her first attempts ."
"But toward morning she was wakened by the hoarse breathing of the boy , and was forced to patter away to Miss Bat 's room , humbly asking for the squills , and confessing that the prophecy had come to pass ."
"You must know that , while Lucy was busy for others , she was not forgotten , and when she was expecting to lie on her bed through the summer , plans were being made for all sorts of pleasant changes ."
"First of all , she was to have a nice little brace to support the back which was growing better every day ; then , as the warm weather came on , she was to go out , or lie on the piazza ; and by and by , when school was done , she was to go with the queen and the princes for a month or two down to the sea-side , where fresh air and salt water were to build her up in the most delightful way ."
"There , now !"
is n't that the best ending of all ? ''
"and Mamma paused to read her answer in the bright faces of two of the listeners , for Jill hid hers in the pillow , and lay quite still , as if it was too much for her ."
`` That will be regularly splendid !
"I 'll row you all about -- boating is so much easier than riding , and I like it on salt water , '' said Frank , going to sit on the arm of the sofa , quite excited by the charms of the new plan ."
"`` And I 'll teach you to swim , and roll you over the beach , and get sea-weed and shells , and no end of nice things , and we 'll all come home as strong as lions , '' added Jack , scrambling up as if about to set off at once ."
"`` The doctor says you have been doing finely of late , and the brace will come to-morrow , and the first really mild day you are to have a breath of fresh air ."
Wo n't that be good ? ''
"asked Mrs. Minot , hoping her story had not been too interesting ."
`` Is she crying ? ''
"said Jack , much concerned as he patted the pillow in his most soothing way , while Frank lifted one curl after another to see what was hidden underneath ."
"Not tears , for two eyes sparkled behind the fingers , then the hands came down like clouds from before the sun , and Jill 's face shone out so bright and happy it did one 's heart good to see it ."
"`` I 'm not crying , '' she said with a laugh which was fuller of blithe music than any song she sung ."
"`` But it was so splendid , it sort of took my breath away for a minute ."
"I thought I was n't any better , and never should be , and I made up my mind I would n't ask , it would be so hard for any one to tell me so ."
"Now I see why the doctor made me stand up , and told me to get my baskets ready to go a-Maying ."
I thought he was in fun ; did he really mean I could go ? ''
"asked Jill , expecting too much , for a word of encouragement made her as hopeful as she had been despondent before ."
"`` No , dear , not so soon as that ."
"It will be months , probably , before you can walk and run , as you used to ; but they will soon pass ."
"You need n't mind about May-day ; it is always too cold for flowers , and you will find more here among your own plants , than on the hills , to fill your baskets , '' answered Mrs. Minot , hastening to suggest something pleasant to beguile the time of probation ."
`` I can wait .
"Months are not years , and if I 'm truly getting well , everything will seem beautiful and easy to me , '' said Jill , laying herself down again , with the patient look she had learned to wear , and gathering up the scattered carnations to enjoy their spicy breath , as if the fairies hidden there had taught her some of their sweet secrets ."
"`` Dear little girl , it has been a long , hard trial for you , but it is coming to an end , and I think you will find that it has not been time wasted , I do n't want you to be a saint quite yet , but I am sure a gentler Jill will rise up from that sofa than the one who lay down there in December . ''"
"`` How could I help growing better , when you were so good to me ? ''"
"cried Jill , putting up both arms , as Mrs. Minot went to take Frank 's place , and he retired to the fire , there to stand surveying the scene with calm approval ."
`` You have done quite as much for us ; so we are even .
"I proved that to your mother , and she is going to let the little house and take care of the big one for me , while I borrow you to keep me happy and make the boys gentle and kind ."
"That is the bargain , and we get the best of it , '' said Mrs. Minot , looking well pleased , while Jack added , `` That 's so ! ''"
"and Frank observed with an air of conviction , `` We could n't get on without Jill , possibly . ''"
"From her perch in the tree Koma saw it all , and screamed with all her might , hoping that some one would hear , and come to help ."
"Luckily a servant of the princess to whom the park belonged was walking by , and he drove off the dog , and picking up the trembling Gon in his arms , carried him to his mistress ."
"So poor little Koma was left alone , while Gon was borne away full of trouble , not in the least knowing what to do ."
"Even the attention paid him by the princess , who was delighted with his beauty and pretty ways , did not console him , but there was no use in fighting against fate , and he could only wait and see what would turn up ."
"The princess , Gon 's new mistress , was so good and kind that everybody loved her , and she would have led a happy life , had it not been for a serpent who had fallen in love with her , and was constantly annoying her by his presence ."
"Her servants had orders to drive him away as often as he appeared ; but as they were careless , and the serpent very sly , it sometimes happened that he was able to slip past them , and to frighten the princess by appearing before her ."
"One day she was seated in her room , playing on her favourite musical instrument , when she felt something gliding up her sash , and saw her enemy making his way to kiss her cheek ."
"She shrieked and threw herself backwards , and Gon , who had been curled up on a stool at her feet , understood her terror , and with one bound seized the snake by his neck ."
"He gave him one bite and one shake , and flung him on the ground , where he lay , never to worry the princess any more ."
"Then she took Gon in her arms , and praised and caressed him , and saw that he had the nicest bits to eat , and the softest mats to lie on ; and he would have had nothing in the world to wish for if only he could have seen Koma again ."
"Time passed on , and one morning Gon lay before the house door , basking in the sun ."
"He looked lazily at the world stretched out before him , and saw in the distance a big ruffian of a cat teasing and ill-treating quite a little one ."
"He jumped up , full of rage , and chased away the big cat , and then he turned to comfort the little one , when his heart nearly burst with joy to find that it was Koma ."
"At first Koma did not know him again , he had grown so large and stately ; but when it dawned upon her who it was , her happiness knew no bounds ."
"And they rubbed their heads and their noses again and again , while their purring might have been heard a mile off ."
"Paw in paw they appeared before the princess , and told her the story of their life and its sorrows ."
"The princess wept for sympathy , and promised that they should never more be parted , but should live with her to the end of their days ."
"By-and-bye the princess herself got married , and brought a prince to dwell in the palace in the park ."
"And she told him all about her two cats , and how brave Gon had been , and how he had delivered her from her enemy the serpent ."
"And when the prince heard , he swore they should never leave them , but should go with the princess wherever she went ."
"So it all fell out as the princess wished ; and Gon and Koma had many children , and so had the princess , and they all played together , and were friends to the end of their lives ."

"Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons but they did not get on at all well together , for the younger was much handsomer than his elder brother who was very jealous of him ."
"When they grew older , things became worse and worse , and at last one day as they were walking through a wood the elder youth seized hold of the other , tied him to a tree , and went on his way hoping that the boy might starve to death ."
"However , it happened that an old and humpbacked shepherd passed the tree with his flock , and seeing the prisoner , he stopped and said to him , ` Tell me , my son why are you tied to that tree ? '"
"` Because I was so crooked , ' answered the young man ; ` but it has quite cured me , and now my back is as straight as can be . ' '"
"I wish you would bind me to a tree , ' exclaimed the shepherd , ` so that my back would get straight . '"
"` With all the pleasure in life , ' replied the youth ."
` If you will loosen these cords I will tie you up with them as firmly as I can . '
"This was soon done , and then the young man drove off the sheep , leaving their real shepherd to repent of his folly ; and before he had gone very far he met with a horse boy and a driver of oxen , and he persuaded them to turn with him and to seek for adventures ."
"I do not know if the collops were truly very good , but my heart rose against the sight of them , and I could eat but little ."
"All the while Cluny entertained us with stories of Prince Charlie 's stay in the Cage , giving us the very words of the speakers , and rising from his place to show us where they stood ."
"By these , I gathered the Prince was a gracious , spirited boy , like the son of a race of polite kings , but not so wise as Solomon ."
"I gathered , too , that while he was in the Cage , he was often drunk ; so the fault that has since , by all accounts , made such a wreck of him , had even then begun to show itself ."
"We were no sooner done eating than Cluny brought out an old , thumbed , greasy pack of cards , such as you may find in a mean inn ; and his eyes brightened in his face as he proposed that we should fall to playing ."
"Now this was one of the things I had been brought up to eschew like disgrace ; it being held by my father neither the part of a Christian nor yet of a gentleman to set his own livelihood and fish for that of others , on the cast of painted pasteboard ."
"To be sure , I might have pleaded my fatigue , which was excuse enough ; but I thought it behoved that I should bear a testimony ."
"I must have got very red in the face , but I spoke steadily , and told them I had no call to be a judge of others , but for my own part , it was a matter in which I had no clearness ."
Cluny stopped mingling the cards .
`` What in deil 's name is this ? ''
says he .
"`` What kind of Whiggish , canting talk is this , for the house of Cluny Macpherson ? ''"
"`` I will put my hand in the fire for Mr. Balfour , '' says Alan ."
"`` He is an honest and a mettle gentleman , and I would have ye bear in mind who says it ."
"I bear a king 's name , '' says he , cocking his hat ; `` and I and any that I call friend are company for the best ."
"But the gentleman is tired , and should sleep ; if he has no mind to the cartes , it will never hinder you and me ."
"And I 'm fit and willing , sir , to play ye any game that ye can name . ''"
"`` Sir , '' says Cluny , `` in this poor house of mine I would have you to ken that any gentleman may follow his pleasure ."
"If your friend would like to stand on his head , he is welcome ."
"And if either he , or you , or any other man , is not preceesely satisfied , I will be proud to step outside with him . ''"
I had no will that these two friends should cut their throats for my sake .
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` I am very wearied , as Alan says ; and what 's more , as you are a man that likely has sons of your own , I may tell you it was a promise to my father . ''"
"`` Say nae mair , say nae mair , '' said Cluny , and pointed me to a bed of heather in a corner of the Cage ."
"For all that he was displeased enough , looked at me askance , and grumbled when he looked ."
"And indeed it must be owned that both my scruples and the words in which I declared them , smacked somewhat of the Covenanter , and were little in their place among wild Highland Jacobites ."
"What with the brandy and the venison , a strange heaviness had come over me ; and I had scarce lain down upon the bed before I fell into a kind of trance , in which I continued almost the whole time of our stay in the Cage ."
"Sometimes I was broad awake and understood what passed ; sometimes I only heard voices , or men snoring , like the voice of a silly river ; and the plaids upon the wall dwindled down and swelled out again , like firelight shadows on the roof ."
"I must sometimes have spoken or cried out , for I remember I was now and then amazed at being answered ; yet I was conscious of no particular nightmare , only of a general , black , abiding horror -- a horror of the place I was in , and the bed I lay in , and the plaids on the wall , and the voices , and the fire , and myself ."
"The barber-gillie , who was a doctor too , was called in to prescribe for me ; but as he spoke in the Gaelic , I understood not a word of his opinion , and was too sick even to ask for a translation ."
"I knew well enough I was ill , and that was all I cared about ."
I paid little heed while I lay in this poor pass .
"But Alan and Cluny were most of the time at the cards , and I am clear that Alan must have begun by winning ; for I remember sitting up , and seeing them hard at it , and a great glittering pile of as much as sixty or a hundred guineas on the table ."
"asked sly Mrs. Jo , popping the sweeties into her little spool-bag ."
"`` Yes , '' said Stuffy , with a sigh ; and pocketing the forbidden fruit , he went away to give Bess the present , that won a smile from her , and permission to escort her round the garden ."
"`` Poor Stuffy 's heart has really got the better of his stomach at last , and his efforts will be much encouraged by the rewards Bess gives him , '' said Mrs. Jo ."
`` Happy is the man who can put temptation in his pocket and learn self-denial from so sweet a little teacher ! ''
"added Mr. Bhaer , as the children passed the window , Stuffy 's fat face full of placid satisfaction , and Goldilocks surveying her sugar-rose with polite interest , though she would have preferred a real flower with a `` pitty smell . ''"
"When her father came to take her home , a universal wail arose , and the parting gifts showered upon her increased her luggage to such an extent that Mr. Laurie proposed having out the big wagon to take it into town ."
"Every one had given her something ; and it was found difficult to pack white mice , cake , a parcel of shells , apples , a rabbit kicking violently in a bag , a large cabbage for his refreshment , a bottle of minnows , and a mammoth bouquet ."
"The farewell scene was moving , for the Princess sat upon the hall-table , surrounded by her subjects ."
"She kissed her cousins , and held out her hand to the other boys , who shook it gently with various soft speeches , for they were taught not to be ashamed of showing their emotions ."
"`` Come again soon , little dear , '' whispered Dan , fastening his best green-and-gold beetle in her hat ."
"`` Do n't forget me , Princess , whatever you do , '' said the engaging Tommy , taking a last stroke of the pretty hair ."
"`` I am coming to your house next week , and then I shall see you , Bess , '' added Nat , as if he found consolation in the thought ."
"`` Do shake hands now , '' cried Jack , offering a smooth paw ."
"`` Here are two nice new ones to remember us by , '' said Dick and Dolly , presenting fresh whistles , quite unconscious that seven old ones had been privately deposited in the kitchen-stove ."
`` My little precious !
"I shall work you a book-mark right away , and you must keep it always , '' said Nan , with a warm embrace ."
"But of all the farewells , poor Billy 's was the most pathetic , for the thought that she was really going became so unbearable that he cast himself down before her , hugging her little blue boots and blubbering despairingly , `` Do n't go away !"
"oh , do n't ! ''"
"Goldilocks was so touched by this burst of feeling , that she leaned over and lifting the poor lad 's head , said , in her soft , little voice , `` Do n't cry , poor Billy !"
I will tiss you and tum adain soon . ''
"This promise consoled Billy , and he fell back beaming with pride at the unusual honor conferred upon him ."
`` Me too !
me too ! ''
"clamored Dick and Dolly , feeling that their devotion deserved some return ."
"The others looked as if they would like to join in the cry ; and something in the kind , merry faces about her moved the Princess to stretch out her arms and say , with reckless condescension , `` I will tiss evvybody ! ''"
"Like a swarm of bees about a very sweet flower , the affectionate lads surrounded their pretty playmate , and kissed her till she looked like a little rose , not roughly , but so enthusiastically that nothing but the crown of her hat was visible for a moment ."
"Then her father rescued her , and she drove away still smiling and waving her hands , while the boys sat on the fence screaming like a flock of guinea-fowls , `` Come back !"
come back ! ''
till she was out of sight .
"They all missed her , and each dimly felt that he was better for having known a creature so lovely , delicate , and sweet ; for little Bess appealed to the chivalrous instinct in them as something to love , admire , and protect with a tender sort of reverence ."
"Many a man remembers some pretty child who has made a place in his heart and kept her memory alive by the simple magic of her innocence ; these little men were just learning to feel this power , and to love it for its gentle influence , not ashamed to let the small hand lead them , nor to own their loyalty to womankind , even in the bud ."
CHAPTER XIV .
"He gave it me at Savannah , when he lay a-dying , like as if I was to now , you see ."
"But you wo n't peach unless they get the black spot on me , or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg , Jim -- him above all . ''"
"`` But what is the black spot , captain ? ''"
I asked .
"`` That 's a summons , mate ."
I 'll tell you if they get that .
"But you keep your weather-eye open , Jim , and I 'll share with you equals , upon my honour . ''"
"He wandered a little longer , his voice growing weaker ; but soon after I had given him his medicine , which he took like a child , with the remark , `` If ever a seaman wanted drugs , it 's me , '' he fell at last into a heavy , swoon-like sleep , in which I left him ."
What I should have done had all gone well I do not know .
"Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor , for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me ."
"But as things fell out , my poor father died quite suddenly that evening , which put all other matters on one side ."
"Our natural distress , the visits of the neighbours , the arranging of the funeral , and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain , far less to be afraid of him ."
"He got downstairs next morning , to be sure , and had his meals as usual , though he ate little and had more , I am afraid , than his usual supply of rum , for he helped himself out of the bar , scowling and blowing through his nose , and no one dared to cross him ."
"On the night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever ; and it was shocking , in that house of mourning , to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song ; but weak as he was , we were all in the fear of death for him , and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after my father 's death ."
"I have said the captain was weak , and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength ."
"He clambered up and down stairs , and went from the parlour to the bar and back again , and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea , holding on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain ."
"He never particularly addressed me , and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences ; but his temper was more flighty , and allowing for his bodily weakness , more violent than ever ."
He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table .
"But with all that , he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering ."
"Once , for instance , to our extreme wonder , he piped up to a different air , a kind of country love-song that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea ."
"So things passed until , the day after the funeral , and about three o'clock of a bitter , foggy , frosty afternoon , I was standing at the door for a moment , full of sad thoughts about my father , when I saw someone drawing slowly near along the road ."
"He was plainly blind , for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose ; and he was hunched , as if with age or weakness , and wore a huge old tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed ."
I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure .
"He stopped a little from the inn , and raising his voice in an odd sing-song , addressed the air in front of him , `` Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man , who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his native country , England -- and God bless King George !"
-- where or in what part of this country he may now be ? ''
"`` You are at the Admiral Benbow , Black Hill Cove , my good man , '' said I. `` I hear a voice , '' said he , `` a young voice ."
"Will you give me your hand , my kind young friend , and lead me in ? ''"
"I held out my hand , and the horrible , soft-spoken , eyeless creature gripped it in a moment like a vise ."
"I was so much startled that I struggled to withdraw , but the blind man pulled me close up to him with a single action of his arm ."
"`` Now , boy , '' he said , `` take me in to the captain . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` upon my word I dare not . ''"
"`` Oh , '' he sneered , `` that 's it !"
"`` I guess we had better go , '' said Demi , suddenly , as Aunt Jo 's voice was heard on the stairs ."
"`` P ` r ` aps we had , '' and Nat hastily dropped a stray jumble that he had just picked up ."
"But Mrs. Jo was among them before the retreat was accomplished , and into her sympathetic ear the young ladies poured the story of their woes ."
"`` No more balls for these boys till they have atoned for this bad behavior by doing something kind to you , '' said Mrs. Jo , shaking her head at the three culprits ."
"`` We were only in fun , '' began Demi ."
`` I do n't like fun that makes other people unhappy .
"I am disappointed in you , Demi , for I hoped you would never learn to tease Daisy ."
Such a kind little sister as she is to you . ''
"`` Boys always tease their sisters ; Tom says so , '' muttered Demi ."
"`` I do n't intend that my boys shall , and I must send Daisy home if you can not play happily together , '' said Aunt Jo , soberly ."
"At this awful threat , Demi sidled up to his sister , and Daisy hastily dried her tears , for to be separated was the worst misfortune that could happen to the twins ."
"`` Nat was bad , too , and Tommy was baddest of all , '' observed Nan , fearing that two of the sinners would not get their fair share of punishment ."
"`` I am sorry , '' said Nat , much ashamed ."
`` I ai n't ! ''
"bawled Tommy through the keyhole , where he was listening with all his might ."
"Mrs. Jo wanted very much to laugh , but kept her countenance , and said impressively , as she pointed to the door , `` You can go , boys , but remember , you are not to speak to or play with the little girls till I give you leave ."
"You do n't deserve the pleasure , so I forbid it . ''"
"The ill-mannered young gentlemen hastily retired , to be received outside with derision and scorn by the unrepentant Bangs , who would not associate with them for at least fifteen minutes ."
"Daisy was soon consoled for the failure of her ball , but lamented the edict that parted her from her brother , and mourned over his short-comings in her tender little heart ."
"Nan rather enjoyed the trouble , and went about turning up her pug nose at the three , especially Tommy , who pretended not to care , and loudly proclaimed his satisfaction at being rid of those `` stupid girls . ''"
"But in his secret soul he soon repented of the rash act that caused this banishment from the society he loved , and every hour of separation taught him the value of the `` stupid girls . ''"
"The others gave in very soon , and longed to be friends , for now there was no Daisy to pet and cook for them ; no Nan to amuse and doctor them ; and , worst of all , no Mrs. Jo to make home life pleasant and life easy for them ."
"To their great affliction , Mrs. Jo seemed to consider herself one of the offended girls , for she hardly spoke to the outcasts , looked as if she did not see them when she passed , and was always too busy now to attend to their requests ."
"This sudden and entire exile from favor cast a gloom over their souls , for when Mother Bhaer deserted them , their sun had set at noon-day , as it were , and they had no refuge left ."
"This unnatural state of things actually lasted for three days , then they could bear it no longer , and fearing that the eclipse might become total , went to Mr. Bhaer for help and counsel ."
It is my private opinion that he had received instructions how to behave if the case should be laid before him .
"But no one suspected it , and he gave the afflicted boys some advice , which they gratefully accepted and carried out in the following manner : Secluding themselves in the garret , they devoted several play-hours to the manufacture of some mysterious machine , which took so much paste that Asia grumbled , and the little girls wondered mightily ."
"Nan nearly got her inquisitive nose pinched in the door , trying to see what was going on , and Daisy sat about , openly lamenting that they could not all play nicely together , and not have any dreadful secrets ."
"Wednesday afternoon was fine , and after a good deal of consultation about wind and weather , Nat and Tommy went off , bearing an immense flat parcel hidden under many newspapers ."
"Nan nearly died with suppressed curiosity , Daisy nearly cried with vexation , and both quite trembled with interest when Demi marched into Mrs. Bhaer 's room , hat in hand , and said , in the politest tone possible to a mortal boy of his years , `` Please , Aunt Jo , would you and the girls come out to a surprise party we have made for you ?"
Do it 's a very nice one . ''
"`` Thank you , we will come with pleasure ; only , I must take Teddy with me , '' replied Mrs. Bhaer , with a smile that cheered Demi like sunshine after rain ."
"At first this little damsel was afraid of Maimie , who most kindly went to her aid , but soon she sat in her hand chatting gaily and explaining that her name was Brownie , and that though only a poor street singer she was on her way to the ball to see if the Duke would have her ."
"`` Of course , '' she said , `` I am rather plain , '' and this made Maimie uncomfortable , for indeed the simple little creature was almost quite plain for a fairy ."
It was difficult to know what to reply .
"`` I see you think I have no chance , '' Brownie said falteringly ."
"`` I do n't say that , '' Maimie answered politely , `` of course your face is just a tiny bit homely , but -- '' Really it was quite awkward for her ."
Fortunately she remembered about her father and the bazaar .
"He had gone to a fashionable bazaar where all the most beautiful ladies in London were on view for half-a-crown the second day , but on his return home instead of being dissatisfied with Maimie 's mother he had said , `` You ca n't think , my dear , what a relief it is to see a homely face again . ''"
"Maimie repeated this story , and it fortified Brownie tremendously , indeed she had no longer the slightest doubt that the Duke would choose her ."
"So she scudded away up the ribbon , calling out to Maimie not to follow lest the Queen should mischief her ."
"But Maimie 's curiosity tugged her forward , and presently at the seven Spanish chestnuts , she saw a wonderful light ."
"She crept forward until she was quite near it , and then she peeped from behind a tree ."
"The light , which was as high as your head above the ground , was composed of myriads of glow-worms all holding on to each other , and so forming a dazzling canopy over the fairy ring ."
"There were thousands of little people looking on , but they were in shadow and drab in colour compared to the glorious creatures within that luminous circle who were so bewilderingly bright that Maimie had to wink hard all the time she looked at them ."
"It was amazing and even irritating to her that the Duke of Christmas Daisies should be able to keep out of love for a moment : yet out of love his dusky grace still was : you could see it by the shamed looks of the Queen and court -LRB- though they pretended not to care -RRB- , by the way darling ladies brought forward for his approval burst into tears as they were told to pass on , and by his own most dreary face ."
"Maimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the Duke 's heart and hear him give utterance to his parrot cry , and she was particularly sorry for the Cupids , who stood in their fools ' caps in obscure places and , every time they heard that `` Cold , quite cold , '' bowed their disgraced little heads ."
"She was disappointed not to see Peter Pan , and I may as well tell you now why he was so late that night ."
"It was because his boat had got wedged on the Serpentine between fields of floating ice , through which he had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle ."
"The fairies had as yet scarcely missed him , for they could not dance , so heavy were their hearts ."
They forget all the steps when they are sad and remember them again when they are merry .
"David tells me that fairies never say `` We feel happy '' : what they say is , `` We feel dancey . ''"
"Well , they were looking very undancy indeed , when sudden laughter broke out among the onlookers , caused by Brownie , who had just arrived and was insisting on her right to be presented to the Duke ."
"Maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared , though she had really no hope ; no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie herself who , however , was absolutely confident ."
"She was led before his grace , and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart , which for convenience sake was reached by a little trap-door in his diamond shirt , had begun to say mechanically , `` Cold , qui -- , '' when he stopped abruptly ."
`` What 's this ? ''
"he cried , and first he shook the heart like a watch , and then put his ear to it ."
`` Bless my soul ! ''
"cried the doctor , and by this time of course the excitement among the spectators was tremendous , fairies fainting right and left ."
"Everybody stared breathlessly at the Duke , who was very much startled and looked as if he would like to run away ."
`` Good gracious me ! ''
"the doctor was heard muttering , and now the heart was evidently on fire , for he had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth ."
The suspense was awful !
"Then in a loud voice , and bowing low , `` My Lord Duke , '' said the physician elatedly , `` I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love . ''"
"asked Gus , when the song ended , for Ed had not returned to school in the autumn , but had gone into a store in the city ."
"`` Dull ; things will look up toward spring , they say ."
"I get on well enough , but I miss you fellows dreadfully ; '' and Ed put a hand on the broad shoulder of each friend , as if he longed to be a school-boy again ."
"`` Better give it up and go to college with me next year , '' said Frank , who was preparing for Boston University , while Gus fitted for Harvard ."
"`` No ; I 've chosen business , and I mean to stick to it , so do n't you unsettle my mind ."
Have you practised that March ? ''
"asked Ed , turning to a gayer subject , for he had his little troubles , but always looked on the bright side of things ."
"`` Skating is so good , I do n't get much time ."
"Come early , and we 'll have a turn at it . ''"
`` I will .
Must run home now . ''
`` Pretty cold loafing here . ''
`` Mail is in by this time . ''
"And with these artless excuses the three boys leaped off the posts , as if one spring moved them , as a group of girls came chattering down the path ."
"The blue cloud floated away beside Frank , the scarlet feather marched off with the Admiral , while the fur cap nodded to the gray hat as two happy faces smiled at each other ."
"The same thing often happened , for twice a-day the streets were full of young couples walking to and from school together , smiled at by the elders , and laughed at by the less susceptible boys and girls , who went alone or trooped along in noisy groups ."
"The prudent mothers had tried to stop this guileless custom , but found it very difficult , as the fathers usually sympathized with their sons , and dismissed the matter with the comfortable phrase , `` Never mind ; boys will be boys . ''"
"`` Not forever , '' returned the anxious mammas , seeing the tall lads daily grow more manly , and the pretty daughters fast learning to look demure when certain names were mentioned ."
"It could not be stopped without great parental sternness and the danger of deceit , for co-education will go on outside of school if not inside , and the safest way is to let sentiment and study go hand in hand , with teachers and parents to direct and explain the great lesson all are the better for learning soon or late ."
"So the elders had to give in , acknowledging that this sudden readiness to go to school was a comfort , that the new sort of gentle emulation worked wonders in lazy girls and boys , and that watching these `` primrose friendships '' bud , blossom , and die painless deaths , gave a little touch of romance to their own work-a-day lives ."
"`` On the whole I 'd rather have my sons walking , playing , and studying with bright , well-mannered girls , than always knocking about with rough boys , '' said Mrs. Minot at one of the Mothers ' Meetings , where the good ladies met to talk over their children , and help one another to do their duty by them ."
"`` I find that Gus is more gentle with his sisters since Juliet took him in hand , for he wants to stand well with her , and they report him if he troubles them ."
"I really see no harm in the little friendship , though I never had any such when I was a girl , '' said Mrs. Burton , who adored her one boy and was his confidante ."
"`` My Merry seems to be contented with her brothers so far , but I should n't wonder if I had my hands full by and by , '' added Mrs. Grant , who already foresaw that her sweet little daughter would be sought after as soon as she should lengthen her skirts and turn up her bonny brown hair ."
"Molly Loo had no mother to say a word for her , but she settled matters for herself by holding fast to Merry , and declaring that she would have no escort but faithful Boo ."
"It is necessary to dwell a moment upon this new amusement , because it was not peculiar to Harmony Village , but appears everywhere as naturally as the game parties and croquet which have taken the place of the husking frolics and apple-bees of olden times , and it is impossible to dodge the subject if one attempts to write of boys and girls as they really are nowadays ."
"`` Here , my hero , see how you like this ."
"If it suits , you will be ready to march as soon as the doctor gives the word , '' said Ralph , coming into the Bird Room that evening with a neat little crutch under his arm ."
"`` Ha , ha , that looks fine !"
"I 'd like to try it right off , but I wo n't till I get leave ."
"Did you make it yourself , Ral ? ''"
"asked Jack , handling it with delight , as he sat bolt upright , with his leg on a rest , for he was getting on capitally now ."
The Thrush 's Nest Shelley was a young gentleman and as grown-up as he need ever expect to be .
He was a poet ; and they are never exactly grown-up .
"They are people who despise money except what you need for to-day , and he had all that and five pounds over ."
"So , when he was walking in the Kensington Gardens , he made a paper boat of his bank-note , and sent it sailing on the Serpentine ."
"It reached the island at night : and the look-out brought it to Solomon Caw , who thought at first that it was the usual thing , a message from a lady , saying she would be obliged if he could let her have a good one ."
"They always ask for the best one he has , and if he likes the letter he sends one from Class A , but if it ruffles him he sends very funny ones indeed ."
"Sometimes he sends none at all , and at another time he sends a nestful ; it all depends on the mood you catch him in ."
"He likes you to leave it all to him , and if you mention particularly that you hope he will see his way to making it a boy this time , he is almost sure to send another girl ."
"And whether you are a lady or only a little boy who wants a baby-sister , always take pains to write your address clearly ."
You ca n't think what a lot of babies Solomon has sent to the wrong house .
"Shelley 's boat , when opened , completely puzzled Solomon , and he took counsel of his assistants , who having walked over it twice , first with their toes pointed out , and then with their toes pointed in , decided that it came from some greedy person who wanted five ."
They thought this because there was a large five printed on it .
`` Preposterous ! ''
"cried Solomon in a rage , and he presented it to Peter ; anything useless which drifted upon the island was usually given to Peter as a play-thing ."
"But he did not play with his precious bank-note , for he knew what it was at once , having been very observant during the week when he was an ordinary boy ."
"With so much money , he reflected , he could surely at last contrive to reach the Gardens , and he considered all the possible ways , and decided -LRB- wisely , I think -RRB- to choose the best way ."
"But , first , he had to tell the birds of the value of Shelley 's boat ; and though they were too honest to demand it back , he saw that they were galled , and they cast such black looks at Solomon , who was rather vain of his cleverness , that he flew away to the end of the island , and sat there very depressed with his head buried in his wings ."
"Now Peter knew that unless Solomon was on your side , you never got anything done for you in the island , so he followed him and tried to hearten him ."
Nor was this all that Peter did to pin the powerful old fellow 's good will .
You must know that Solomon had no intention of remaining in office all his life .
"He looked forward to retiring by-and-by , and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yew-stump in the Figs which had taken his fancy , and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking ."
"It was a stocking belonging to some bathing person which had been cast upon the island , and at the time I speak of it contained a hundred and eighty crumbs , thirty-four nuts , sixteen crusts , a pen-wiper and a bootlace ."
"When his stocking was full , Solomon calculated that he would be able to retire on a competency ."
Peter now gave him a pound .
He cut it off his bank-note with a sharp stick .
"This made Solomon his friend for ever , and after the two had consulted together they called a meeting of the thrushes ."
You will see presently why thrushes only were invited .
"The scheme to be put before them was really Peter 's , but Solomon did most of the talking , because he soon became irritable if other people talked ."
"He began by saying that he had been much impressed by the superior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nest-building , and this put them into good-humour at once , as it was meant to do ; for all the quarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests ."
"Other birds , said Solomon , omitted to line their nests with mud , and as a result they did not hold water ."
"Here he cocked his head as if he had used an unanswerable argument ; but , unfortunately , a Mrs. Finch had come to the meeting uninvited , and she squeaked out , `` We do n't build nests to hold water , but to hold eggs , '' and then the thrushes stopped cheering , and Solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water ."
"`` Consider , '' he said at last , `` how warm the mud makes the nest . ''"
"I agree with him , and if you want an example of what girls can do , why , look at Jill ."
"She 's young , I know , but a first-rate scholar for her age ."
"As for pluck , she is as brave as a boy , and almost as smart at running , rowing , and so on ."
"Of course , she ca n't play ball -- no girl can ; their arms are not made right to throw -- but she can catch remarkably well ."
I 'll say that for her .
"Now , if she and Mabel -- and -- and -- some others I could name , are so clever and strong at the beginning , I do n't see why they should n't keep up and go along with us all through ."
"I 'm willing , and will do what I can to help other fellows ' sisters as I 'd like to have them help mine ."
"And I 'll punch their heads if they do n't ; '' and Gus subsided , assured , by a burst of applause , that his manly way of stating the case met with general approval ."
"`` We shall be happy to hear from our senior member if he will honor us with a few remarks , '' said Frank , with a bow to Ralph ."
"No one ever knew whom he would choose to personate , for he never spoke in his own character ."
"Now he rose slowly , put one hand in his bosom , and fixing his eye sternly on Grif , who was doing something suspicious with a pin , gave them a touch of Sergeant Buzfuz , from the Pickwick trial , thinking that the debate was not likely to throw much light on the subject under discussion ."
"In the midst of this appeal to `` Me lud and gentlemen of the jury , '' he suddenly paused , smoothed his hair down upon his forehead , rolled up his eyes , and folding his hands , droned out Mr. Chadband 's sermon on Peace , delivered over poor Jo , and ending with the famous lines : -- `` Oh , running stream of sparkling joy , To be a glorious human boy ! ''"
"Then , setting his hair erect with one comprehensive sweep , he caught up his coat-skirts over his arm , and , assuming a parliamentary attitude , burst into a comical medley , composed of extracts from Jefferson Brick 's and Lafayette Kettle 's speeches , and Elijah Pogram 's Defiance , from `` Martin Chuzzlewit . ''"
"Gazing at Gus , who was convulsed with suppressed merriment , he thundered forth : -- `` In the name of our common country , sir , in the name of that righteous cause in which we are jined , and in the name of the star-spangled banner , I thank you for your eloquent and categorical remarks ."
"You , sir , are a model of a man fresh from Natur 's mould ."
A true-born child of this free hemisphere ; verdant as the mountains of our land ; bright and flowin ' as our mineral Licks ; unspiled by fashion as air our boundless perearers .
Rough you may be ; so air our Barrs .
Wild you may be ; so air our Buffalers .
"But , sir , you air a Child of Freedom , and your proud answer to the Tyrant is , that your bright home is in the Settin ' Sun ."
"And , sir , if any man denies this fact , though it be the British Lion himself , I defy him ."
Let me have him here ! ''
"-- smiting the table , and causing the inkstand to skip -- `` here , upon this sacred altar !"
"Here , upon the ancestral ashes cemented with the glorious blood poured out like water on the plains of Chickabiddy Lick ."
"Alone I dare that Lion , and tell him that Freedom 's hand once twisted in his mane , he rolls a corse before me , and the Eagles of the Great Republic scream , Ha , ha ! ''"
"By this time the boys were rolling about in fits of laughter ; even sober Frank was red and breathless , and Jack lay back , feebly squealing , as he could laugh no more ."
"In a moment Ralph was as meek as a Quaker , and sat looking about him with a mildly astonished air , as if inquiring the cause of such unseemly mirth ."
"A knock at the door produced a lull , and in came a maid with apples ."
"`` Time 's up ; fall to and make yourselves comfortable , '' was the summary way in which the club was released from its sterner duties and permitted to unbend its mighty mind for a social half-hour , chiefly devoted to whist , with an Indian war-dance as a closing ceremony ."
Chapter X .
"The Dramatic Club While Jack was hopping gayly about on his crutches , poor Jill was feeling the effects of her second fall , and instead of sitting up , as she hoped to do after six weeks of rest , she was ordered to lie on a board for two hours each day ."
"Not an easy penance , by any means , for the board was very hard , and she could do nothing while she lay there , as it did not slope enough to permit her to read without great fatigue of both eyes and hands ."
"So the little martyr spent her first hour of trial in sobbing , the second in singing , for just as her mother and Mrs. Minot were deciding in despair that neither she nor they could bear it , Jill suddenly broke out into a merry chorus she used to hear her father sing : -- `` Faut jouer le mirliton , Faut jouer le mirlitir , Faut jouer le mirliter , Mir -- li -- ton . ''"
"Then I told him that , sure enough , I had a pistol in my pocket as well as he , and if he did not strike across the hill due south I would even blow his brains out ."
"He became at once very polite , and after trying to soften me for some time , but quite in vain , he cursed me once more in Gaelic and took himself off ."
"I watched him striding along , through bog and brier , tapping with his stick , until he turned the end of a hill and disappeared in the next hollow ."
"Then I struck on again for Torosay , much better pleased to be alone than to travel with that man of learning ."
"This was an unlucky day ; and these two , of whom I had just rid myself , one after the other , were the two worst men I met with in the Highlands ."
"At Torosay , on the Sound of Mull and looking over to the mainland of Morven , there was an inn with an innkeeper , who was a Maclean , it appeared , of a very high family ; for to keep an inn is thought even more genteel in the Highlands than it is with us , perhaps as partaking of hospitality , or perhaps because the trade is idle and drunken ."
"He spoke good English , and finding me to be something of a scholar , tried me first in French , where he easily beat me , and then in the Latin , in which I do n't know which of us did best ."
"This pleasant rivalry put us at once upon friendly terms ; and I sat up and drank punch with him -LRB- or to be more correct , sat up and watched him drink it -RRB- , until he was so tipsy that he wept upon my shoulder ."
"I tried him , as if by accident , with a sight of Alan 's button ; but it was plain he had never seen or heard of it ."
"Indeed , he bore some grudge against the family and friends of Ardshiel , and before he was drunk he read me a lampoon , in very good Latin , but with a very ill meaning , which he had made in elegiac verses upon a person of that house ."
"When I told him of my catechist , he shook his head , and said I was lucky to have got clear off ."
"`` That is a very dangerous man , '' he said ; `` Duncan Mackiegh is his name ; he can shoot by the ear at several yards , and has been often accused of highway robberies , and once of murder . ''"
"`` The cream of it is , '' says I , `` that he called himself a catechist . ''"
`` And why should he not ? ''
"says he , `` when that is what he is ."
It was Maclean of Duart gave it to him because he was blind .
"But perhaps it was a peety , '' says my host , `` for he is always on the road , going from one place to another to hear the young folk say their religion ; and , doubtless , that is a great temptation to the poor man . ''"
"At last , when my landlord could drink no more , he showed me to a bed , and I lay down in very good spirits ; having travelled the greater part of that big and crooked Island of Mull , from Earraid to Torosay , fifty miles as the crow flies , and -LRB- with my wanderings -RRB- much nearer a hundred , in four days and with little fatigue ."
Indeed I was by far in better heart and health of body at the end of that long tramp than I had been at the beginning .
CHAPTER XVI THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON : ACROSS MORVEN There is a regular ferry from Torosay to Kinlochaline on the mainland .
"Both shores of the Sound are in the country of the strong clan of the Macleans , and the people that passed the ferry with me were almost all of that clan ."
"The skipper of the boat , on the other hand , was called Neil Roy Macrob ; and since Macrob was one of the names of Alan 's clansmen , and Alan himself had sent me to that ferry , I was eager to come to private speech of Neil Roy ."
"In the crowded boat this was of course impossible , and the passage was a very slow affair ."
"There was no wind , and as the boat was wretchedly equipped , we could pull but two oars on one side , and one on the other ."
"The men gave way , however , with a good will , the passengers taking spells to help them , and the whole company giving the time in Gaelic boat-songs ."
"And what with the songs , and the sea-air , and the good-nature and spirit of all concerned , and the bright weather , the passage was a pretty thing to have seen ."
But there was one melancholy part .
"In the mouth of Loch Aline we found a great sea-going ship at anchor ; and this I supposed at first to be one of the King 's cruisers which were kept along that coast , both summer and winter , to prevent communication with the French ."
"As we got a little nearer , it became plain she was a ship of merchandise ; and what still more puzzled me , not only her decks , but the sea-beach also , were quite black with people , and skiffs were continually plying to and fro between them ."
"Yet nearer , and there began to come to our ears a great sound of mourning , the people on board and those on the shore crying and lamenting one to another so as to pierce the heart ."
Then I understood this was an emigrant ship bound for the American colonies .
"We put the ferry-boat alongside , and the exiles leaned over the bulwarks , weeping and reaching out their hands to my fellow-passengers , among whom they counted some near friends ."
`` Can I do all that ?
I did n't know I was of any use .
"I only tried to be good and grateful , for there did n't seem to be anything else I could do , '' said Jill , wondering why they were all so fond of her ."
`` No real trying is ever in vain .
"It is like the spring rain , and flowers are sure to follow in good time ."
"The three gifts Patience gave Saint Lucy were courage , cheerfulness , and love , and with these one can work the sweetest miracles in the world , as you see , '' and Mrs. Minot pointed to the pretty room and its happy inmates ."
`` Am I really the least bit like that good Lucinda ?
"I tried to be , but I did n't think I was , '' asked Jill softly ."
`` You are very like her in all ways but one .
"She did not get well , and you will . ''"
"A short answer , but it satisfied Jill to her heart 's core , and that night , when she lay in bed , she thought to herself : `` How curious it is that I 've been a sort of missionary without knowing it !"
"They all love and thank me , and wo n't let me go , so I suppose I must have done something , but I do n't know what , except trying to be good and pleasant . ''"
"That was the secret , and Jill found it out just when it was most grateful as a reward for past efforts , most helpful as an encouragement toward the constant well-doing which can make even a little girl a joy and comfort to all who know and love her ."
Chapter XVI .
"Up at Merry 's `` Now fly round , child , and get your sweeping done up smart and early . ''"
"`` Yes , mother . ''"
"`` I shall want you to help me about the baking , by and by . ''"
"`` Yes , mother . ''"
"`` Roxy is cleaning the cellar-closets , so you 'll have to get the vegetables ready for dinner ."
"Father wants a boiled dish , and I shall be so busy I ca n't see to it . ''"
"`` Yes , mother . ''"
"A cheerful voice gave the three answers , but it cost Merry an effort to keep it so , for she had certain little plans of her own which made the work before her unusually distasteful ."
"Saturday always was a trying day , for , though she liked to see rooms in order , she hated to sweep , as no speck escaped Mrs. Grant 's eye , and only the good old-fashioned broom , wielded by a pair of strong arms , was allowed ."
"Baking was another trial : she loved good bread and delicate pastry , but did not enjoy burning her face over a hot stove , daubing her hands with dough , or spending hours rolling out cookies for the boys ; while a `` boiled dinner '' was her especial horror , as it was not elegant , and the washing of vegetables was a job she always shirked when she could ."
"However , having made up her mind to do her work without complaint , she ran upstairs to put on her dust-cap , trying to look as if sweeping was the joy of her life ."
"`` It is such a lovely day , I did want to rake my garden , and have a walk with Molly , and finish my book so I can get another , '' she said with a sigh , as she leaned out of the open window for a breath of the unusually mild air ."
"Down in the ten-acre lot the boys were carting and spreading loam ; out in the barn her father was getting his plows ready ; over the hill rose the smoke of the distant factory , and the river that turned the wheels was gliding through the meadows , where soon the blackbirds would be singing ."
"Old Bess pawed the ground , eager to be off ; the gray hens were scratching busily all about the yard ; even the green things in the garden were pushing through the brown earth , softened by April rains , and there was a shimmer of sunshine over the wide landscape that made every familiar object beautiful with hints of spring , and the activity it brings ."
"Something made the old nursery hymn come into Merry 's head , and humming to herself , `` In works of labor or of skill I would be busy too , '' she tied on her cap , shouldered her broom , and fell to work so energetically that she soon swept her way through the chambers , down the front stairs to the parlor door , leaving freshness and order behind her as she went ."
"She always groaned when she entered that apartment , and got out of it again as soon as possible , for it was , like most country parlors , a prim and chilly place , with little beauty and no comfort ."
"Black horse-hair furniture , very slippery and hard , stood against the wall ; the table had its gift books , albums , worsted mat and ugly lamp ; the mantel-piece its china vases , pink shells , and clock that never went ; the gay carpet was kept distressingly bright by closed shutters six days out of the seven , and a general air of go-to-meeting solemnity pervaded the room ."
"Merry longed to make it pretty and pleasant , but her mother would allow of no change there , so the girl gave up her dreams of rugs and hangings , fine pictures and tasteful ornaments , and dutifully aired , dusted , and shut up this awful apartment once a week , privately resolving that , if she ever had a parlor of her own , it should not be as dismal as a tomb ."
"He hid by day in a hole of the braes under a little wood ; and at night , when the coast was clear , would come into the house to visit me ."
"I need not say if I was pleased to see him ; Mrs. Maclaren , our hostess , thought nothing good enough for such a guest ; and as Duncan Dhu -LRB- which was the name of our host -RRB- had a pair of pipes in his house , and was much of a lover of music , this time of my recovery was quite a festival , and we commonly turned night into day ."
"The soldiers let us be ; although once a party of two companies and some dragoons went by in the bottom of the valley , where I could see them through the window as I lay in bed ."
"What was much more astonishing , no magistrate came near me , and there was no question put of whence I came or whither I was going ; and in that time of excitement , I was as free of all inquiry as though I had lain in a desert ."
Yet my presence was known before I left to all the people in Balquhidder and the adjacent parts ; many coming about the house on visits and these -LRB- after the custom of the country -RRB- spreading the news among their neighbours .
"The bills , too , had now been printed ."
"There was one pinned near the foot of my bed , where I could read my own not very flattering portrait and , in larger characters , the amount of the blood money that had been set upon my life ."
"Duncan Dhu and the rest that knew that I had come there in Alan 's company , could have entertained no doubt of who I was ; and many others must have had their guess ."
"For though I had changed my clothes , I could not change my age or person ; and Lowland boys of eighteen were not so rife in these parts of the world , and above all about that time , that they could fail to put one thing with another , and connect me with the bill ."
"So it was , at least ."
"Other folk keep a secret among two or three near friends , and somehow it leaks out ; but among these clansmen , it is told to a whole countryside , and they will keep it for a century ."
"There was but one thing happened worth narrating ; and that is the visit I had of Robin Oig , one of the sons of the notorious Rob Roy ."
He was sought upon all sides on a charge of carrying a young woman from Balfron and marrying her -LRB- as was alleged -RRB- by force ; yet he stepped about Balquhidder like a gentleman in his own walled policy .
"It was he who had shot James Maclaren at the plough stilts , a quarrel never satisfied ; yet he walked into the house of his blood enemies as a rider * might into a public inn ."
* Commercial traveller .
Duncan had time to pass me word of who it was ; and we looked at one another in concern .
"You should understand , it was then close upon the time of Alan 's coming ; the two were little likely to agree ; and yet if we sent word or sought to make a signal , it was sure to arouse suspicion in a man under so dark a cloud as the Macgregor ."
"He came in with a great show of civility , but like a man among inferiors ; took off his bonnet to Mrs. Maclaren , but clapped it on his head again to speak to Duncan ; and having thus set himself -LRB- as he would have thought -RRB- in a proper light , came to my bedside and bowed ."
"`` I am given to know , sir , '' says he , `` that your name is Balfour . ''"
"`` They call me David Balfour , '' said I , `` at your service . ''"
"`` I would give ye my name in return , sir , '' he replied , `` but it 's one somewhat blown upon of late days ; and it 'll perhaps suffice if I tell ye that I am own brother to James More Drummond or Macgregor , of whom ye will scarce have failed to hear . ''"
"`` No , sir , '' said I , a little alarmed ; `` nor yet of your father , Macgregor-Campbell . ''"
"And I sat up and bowed in bed ; for I thought best to compliment him , in case he was proud of having had an outlaw to his father ."
He bowed in return .
"`` But what I am come to say , sir , '' he went on , `` is this ."
"In the year ' 45 , my brother raised a part of the ` Gregara ' and marched six companies to strike a stroke for the good side ; and the surgeon that marched with our clan and cured my brother 's leg when it was broken in the brush at Preston Pans , was a gentleman of the same name precisely as yourself ."
"He was brother to Balfour of Baith ; and if you are in any reasonable degree of nearness one of that gentleman 's kin , I have come to put myself and my people at your command . ''"
"You are to remember that I knew no more of my descent than any cadger 's dog ; my uncle , to be sure , had prated of some of our high connections , but nothing to the present purpose ; and there was nothing left me but that bitter disgrace of owning that I could not tell ."
"Robin told me shortly he was sorry he had put himself about , turned his back upon me without a sign of salutation , and as he went towards the door , I could hear him telling Duncan that I was `` only some kinless loon that did n't know his own father . ''"
"Angry as I was at these words , and ashamed of my own ignorance , I could scarce keep from smiling that a man who was under the lash of the law -LRB- and was indeed hanged some three years later -RRB- should be so nice as to the descent of his acquaintances ."
"Just in the door , he met Alan coming in ; and the two drew back and looked at each other like strange dogs ."
"They were neither of them big men , but they seemed fairly to swell out with pride ."
"The sound of the brave little voice was very comforting to the two mothers hovering about her , and Jack said , with a look of mingled pity and admiration , as he brandished his crutch over the imaginary foes , -- `` That 's right !"
"Sing away , and we 'll play you are an Indian captive being tormented by your enemies , and too proud to complain ."
"I 'll watch the clock , and the minute time is up I 'll rush in and rescue you . ''"
"Jill laughed , but the fancy pleased her , and she straightened herself out under the gay afghan , while she sang , in a plaintive voice , another little French song her father taught her : -- `` J'avais une colombe blanche , J'avais un blanc petit pigeon , Tous deux volaient , de branche en branche , Jusqu'au faîte de mon dongeon : Mais comme un coup de vent d'automne , S'est abattu là , l'épervier , Et ma colombe si mignonne Ne revient plus au colombier . ''"
"`` My poor Jean had a fine voice , and always hoped the child would take after him ."
"It would break his heart to see her lying there trying to cheer her pain with the songs he used to sing her to sleep with , '' said Mrs. Pecq , sadly ."
"`` She really has a great deal of talent , and when she is able she shall have some lessons , for music is a comfort and a pleasure , sick or well , '' answered Mrs. Minot , who had often admired the fresh voice , with its pretty accent ."
"Here Jill began the Canadian boat-song , with great vigor , as if bound to play her part of Indian victim with spirit , and not disgrace herself by any more crying ."
"All knew the air , and joined in , especially Jack , who came out strong on the `` Row , brothers , row , '' but ended in a squeak on a high note , so drolly , that the rest broke down ."
"So the hour that began with tears ended with music and laughter , and a new pleasure to think of for the future ."
"After that day Jill exerted all her fortitude , for she liked to have the boys call her brave and admire the cheerful way in which she endured two hours of discomfort ."
"She found she could use her zither as it lay upon her breast , and every day the pretty music began at a certain hour , and all in the house soon learned to love and listen for it ."
"Even the old cook set open her kitchen door , saying pitifully , `` Poor darlint , hear how purty she 's singin ' , wid the pain , on that crewel boord ."
"It 's a little saint , she is ."
May her bed above be aisy ! ''
"Frank would lift her gently on and off , with a kind word that comforted her immensely , and gentle Ed would come and teach her new bits of music , while the other fellows were frolicking below ."
"Ralph added his share to her amusement , for he asked leave to model her head in clay , and set up his work in a corner , coming to pat , scrape , and mould whenever he had a spare minute , amusing her by his lively chat , and showing her how to shape birds , rabbits , and queer faces in the soft clay , when the songs were all sung and her fingers tired of the zither ."
"The girls sympathized very heartily with her new trial , and brought all manner of gifts to cheer her captivity ."
Merry and Molly made a gay screen by pasting pictures on the black cambric which covered the folding frame that stood before her to keep the draughts from her as she lay on her board .
"Bright birds and flowers , figures and animals , covered one side , and on the other they put mottoes , bits of poetry , anecdotes , and short stories , so that Jill could lie and look or read without the trouble of holding a book ."
"It was not all done at once , but grew slowly , and was a source of instruction as well as amusement to them all , as they read carefully , that they might make good selections ."
"But the thing that pleased Jill most was something Jack did , for he gave up going to school , and stayed at home nearly a fortnight after he might have gone , all for her sake ."
"The day the doctor said he might try it if he would be very careful , he was in great spirits , and limped about , looking up his books , and planning how he would astonish his mates by the rapidity of his recovery ."
"When he sat down to rest he remembered Jill , who had been lying quietly behind the screen , while he talked with his mother , busy putting fresh covers on the books ."
"`` She is so still , I guess she is asleep , '' thought Jack , peeping round the corner ."
"No , not asleep , but lying with her eyes fixed on the sunny window , beyond which the bright winter world sparkled after a fresh snow-fall ."
"The jingle of sleigh-bells could be heard , the laughter of boys and girls on their way to school , all the pleasant stir of a new day of happy work and play for the rest of the world , more lonely , quiet , and wearisome than ever to her since her friend and fellow-prisoner was set free and going to leave her ."
"Jack understood that patient , wistful look , and , without a word , went back to his seat , staring at the fire so soberly , that his mother presently asked : `` What are you thinking of so busily , with that pucker in your forehead ? ''"
"`` I 've about made up my mind that I wo n't go to school just yet , '' answered Jack , slowly lifting his head , for it cost him something to give up the long-expected pleasure ."
`` Why not ? ''
"and Mrs. Minot looked much surprised , till Jack pointed to the screen , and , making a sad face to express Jill 's anguish , answered in a cheerful tone , `` Well , I 'm not sure that it is best ."
"Doctor did not want me to go , but said I might because I teased ."
"Anne choked , unable to answer ."
"Gilbert waited for her at the fir-tree gate , while she went over the house and said farewell to every room ."
"She was going away ; but the old house would still be there , looking seaward through its quaint windows ."
"The autumn winds would blow around it mournfully , and the gray rain would beat upon it and the white mists would come in from the sea to enfold it ; and the moonlight would fall over it and light up the old paths where the schoolmaster and his bride had walked ."
There on that old harbor shore the charm of story would linger ; the wind would still whistle alluringly over the silver sand-dunes ; the waves would still call from the red rock-coves .
"`` But we will be gone , '' said Anne through her tears ."
"She went out , closing and locking the door behind her ."
Gilbert was waiting for her with a smile .
The lighthouse star was gleaming northward .
"The little garden , where only marigolds still bloomed , was already hooding itself in shadows ."
Anne knelt down and kissed the worn old step which she had crossed as a bride .
_BOOK_TITLE_ : Lucy_Maud_Montgomery___Anne_Of_Avonlea.txt.out
"I An Irate Neighbor A tall , slim girl , `` half-past sixteen , '' with serious gray eyes and hair which her friends called auburn , had sat down on the broad red sandstone doorstep of a Prince Edward Island farmhouse one ripe afternoon in August , firmly resolved to construe so many lines of Virgil ."
"But an August afternoon , with blue hazes scarfing the harvest slopes , little winds whispering elfishly in the poplars , and a dancing slendor of red poppies outflaming against the dark coppice of young firs in a corner of the cherry orchard , was fitter for dreams than dead languages ."
"The Virgil soon slipped unheeded to the ground , and Anne , her chin propped on her clasped hands , and her eyes on the splendid mass of fluffy clouds that were heaping up just over Mr. J. A. Harrison 's house like a great white mountain , was far away in a delicious world where a certain schoolteacher was doing a wonderful work , shaping the destinies of future statesmen , and inspiring youthful minds and hearts with high and lofty ambitions ."
"To be sure , if you came down to harsh facts ... which , it must be confessed , Anne seldom did until she had to ... it did not seem likely that there was much promising material for celebrities in Avonlea school ; but you could never tell what might happen if a teacher used her influence for good ."
"Anne had certain rose-tinted ideals of what a teacher might accomplish if she only went the right way about it ; and she was in the midst of a delightful scene , forty years hence , with a famous personage ... just exactly what he was to be famous for was left in convenient haziness , but Anne thought it would be rather nice to have him a college president or a Canadian premier ... bowing low over her wrinkled hand and assuring her that it was she who had first kindled his ambition , and that all his success in life was due to the lessons she had instilled so long ago in Avonlea school ."
This pleasant vision was shattered by a most unpleasant interruption .
A demure little Jersey cow came scuttling down the lane and five seconds later Mr. Harrison arrived ... if `` arrived '' be not too mild a term to describe the manner of his irruption into the yard .
"He bounced over the fence without waiting to open the gate , and angrily confronted astonished Anne , who had risen to her feet and stood looking at him in some bewilderment ."
"Mr. Harrison was their new righthand neighbor and she had never met him before , although she had seen him once or twice ."
"In early April , before Anne had come home from Queen 's , Mr. Robert Bell , whose farm adjoined the Cuthbert place on the west , had sold out and moved to Charlottetown ."
"His farm had been bought by a certain Mr. J. A. Harrison , whose name , and the fact that he was a New Brunswick man , were all that was known about him ."
"But before he had been a month in Avonlea he had won the reputation of being an odd person ... `` a crank , '' Mrs. Rachel Lynde said ."
"Mrs. Rachel was an outspoken lady , as those of you who may have already made her acquaintance will remember ."
"Mr. Harrison was certainly different from other people ... and that is the essential characteristic of a crank , as everybody knows ."
In the first place he kept house for himself and had publicly stated that he wanted no fools of women around his diggings .
Feminine Avonlea took its revenge by the gruesome tales it related about his house-keeping and cooking .
He had hired little John Henry Carter of White Sands and John Henry started the stories .
"For one thing , there was never any stated time for meals in the Harrison establishment ."
"Mr. Harrison `` got a bite '' when he felt hungry , and if John Henry were around at the time , he came in for a share , but if he were not , he had to wait until Mr. Harrison 's next hungry spell ."
"John Henry mournfully averred that he would have starved to death if it was n't that he got home on Sundays and got a good filling up , and that his mother always gave him a basket of `` grub '' to take back with him on Monday mornings ."
repeated Punchkin.
"""Not so fast, my master,"" rejoined the Prince; ""I must first beg that you will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned."""
"The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and, whilst he cried, in an imploring voice, ""Give me my parrot!"" the whole garden became suddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before, stood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing horses, and jewelled pages, and troops of armed attendants."
"""Give me my parrot!"" cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the parrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician's right arm fell off."
"Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, ""Give me my parrot!"""
"The Prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's left arm tumbled off."
"""Give me my parrot!"" cried he, and fell on his knees. The Prince pulled off the parrot's right leg, the Magician's right leg fell off:"
"the Prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell the Magician's left."
"Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but still he rolled his eyes, and cried, ""Give me my parrot!"" ""Take your parrot, then,"" cried the boy, and with that he wrung the bird's neck, and threw it at the Magician; and, as he did so, Punchkin's head twisted round, and, with a fearful groan, he died!"
"Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the seven Princes went to their own country, and lived very happily ever afterwards. And as to the rest of the world, every one went to his own house."
The Broken Pot
"There lived in a certain place a Brahman, whose name was Svabhavakripana, which means ""a born miser."" He had collected a quantity of rice by begging, and after having dined off it, he filled a pot with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall, placed his couch beneath, and looking intently at it all the night, he thought, ""Ah, that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now, if there should be a famine, I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With this I shall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every six months, and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then, with the goats, I shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved, I shall sell the calves. Then, with the calves, I shall buy buffaloes; with the buffaloes, mares. When the mares have foaled, I shall have plenty of horses; and when I sell them, plenty of gold. With that gold I shall get a house with four wings. And then a Brahman will come to my house, and will give me his beautiful daughter, with a large dowry. She will have a son, and I shall call him Somasarman."
"When he is old enough to be danced on his father's knee, I shall sit with a book at the back of the stable, and while I am reading, the boy will see me, jump from his mother's lap, and run towards me to be danced on my knee. He will come too near the horse's hoof, and, full of anger, I shall call to my wife, 'Take the baby; take him!' But she, distracted by some domestic work, does not hear me. Then I get up, and give her such a kick with my foot."" While he thought this, he gave a kick with his foot, and broke the pot. All the rice fell over him, and made him quite white. Therefore, I say, ""He who makes foolish plans for the future will be white all over, like the father of Somasarman."""
The Magic Fiddle
"Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister. The brothers were married, but their wives did not do the cooking for the family."
"It was done by their sister, who stopped at home to cook. The wives for this reason bore their sister-in-law much ill-will, and at length they combined together to oust her from the office of cook and general provider, so that one of themselves might obtain it. They said, ""She does not go out to the fields to work, but remains quietly at home, and yet she has not the meals ready at the proper time."" They then called upon their Bonga, and vowing vows unto him they secured his good-will and assistance; then they said to the Bonga, ""At midday when our sister-in-law goes to bring water, cause it thus to happen, that on seeing her pitcher the water shall vanish, and again slowly re-appear. In this way she will be delayed. Let the water not flow into her pitcher, and you may keep the maiden as your own."""
"At noon when she went to bring water, it suddenly dried up before her, and she began to weep. Then after a while the water began slowly to rise. When it reached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher, but it would not go under the water. Being frightened she began to wail and cry to her brother:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my ankles,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water continued to rise until it reached her knee, when she began to wail again:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my knee,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water continued to rise, and when it reached her waist, she cried again:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my waist,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water still rose, and when it reached her neck she kept on crying:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my neck,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"At length the water became so deep that she felt herself drowning, then she cried aloud:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water measures a man's height,     Oh! my brother, the pitcher begins to fill."""
"The pitcher filled with water, and along with it she sank and was drowned. The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself, and carried her off."
"After a time she re-appeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of the tank in which she had been drowned. When the bamboo had grown to an immense size, a Jogi, who was in the habit of passing that way, seeing it, said to himself, ""This will make a splendid fiddle."" So one day he brought an axe to cut it down; but when he was about to begin, the bamboo called out, ""Do not cut at the root, cut higher up."" When he lifted his axe to cut high up the stem, the bamboo cried out, ""Do not cut near the top, cut at the root."" When the Jogi again prepared himself to cut at the root as requested, the bamboo said, ""Do not cut at the root, cut higher up;"" and when he was about to cut higher up, it again called out to him, ""Do not cut high up, cut at the root."" The Jogi by this time felt sure that a Bonga was trying to frighten him, so becoming angry he cut down the bamboo at the root, and taking it away made a fiddle out of it. The instrument had a superior tone and delighted all who heard it. The Jogi carried it with him when he went a-begging, and through the influence of its sweet music he returned home every evening with a full wallet."
"He now and then visited, when on his rounds, the house of the Bonga girl's brothers, and the strains of the fiddle affected them greatly."
"When the morning came the old dame was so poorly that she couldn't utter a word but groans and sighs. She was sure she should never be well again, unless she had some of those apples that grew in the orchard near the castle where the man's brothers lived; only she had no one to send for them."
"Oh! the lad was ready to go that instant; but the eleven lions went with him. So when he came to the orchard, he climbed up into the apple tree and ate as many apples as he could, and he had scarce got down before he fell into a deep sleep; but the lions all lay round him in a ring. The third day came the Troll's brothers, but they did not come in man's shape. They came snorting like man-eating steeds, and wondered who it was that dared to be there, and said they would tear him to pieces, so small that there should not be a bit of him left."
"But up rose the lions and tore the Trolls into small pieces, so that the place looked as if a dung heap had been tossed about it; and when they had finished the Trolls they lay down again. The lad did not wake till late in the afternoon, and when he got on his knees and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, he began to wonder what had been going on, when he saw the marks of hoofs. But when he went towards the castle, a maiden looked out of a window who had seen all that had happened, and she said:"
"""You may thank your stars you weren't in that tussle, else you must have lost your life."""
"""What! I lose my life! No fear of that, I think,"" said the lad."
"So she begged him to come in, that she might talk with him, for she hadn't seen a Christian soul ever since she came there. But when she opened the door the lions wanted to go in too, but she got so frightened that she began to scream, and so the lad let them lie outside. Then the two talked and talked, and the lad asked how it came that she, who was so lovely, could put up with those ugly Trolls. She never wished it, she said; 'twas quite against her will."
"They had seized her by force, and she was the King of Arabia's daughter. So they talked on, and at last she asked him what he would do; whether she should go back home, or whether he would have her to wife. Of course he would have her, and she shouldn't go home."
"After that they went round the castle, and at last they came to a great hall, where the Trolls' two great swords hung high up on the wall."
"""I wonder if you are man enough to wield one of these,"" said the Princess."
"""Who? I?"" said the lad. ""'Twould be a pretty thing if I couldn't wield one of these."""
"With that he put two or three chairs one a-top of the other, jumped up, and touched the biggest sword with his finger tips, tossed it up in the air, and caught it again by the hilt; leapt down, and at the same time dealt such a blow with it on the floor that the whole hall shook. After he had thus got down, he thrust the sword under his arm and carried it about with him."
"So, when they had lived a little while in the castle, the Princess thought she ought to go home to her parents, and let them know what had become of her; so they loaded a ship, and she set sail from the castle."
"After she had gone, and the lad had wandered about a little, he called to mind that he had been sent out on an errand thither, and had come to fetch something for his mother's health; and though he said to himself, ""After all the old dame was not so bad but she's all right by this time"" still he thought he ought to go and just see how she was."
So he went and found both the man and his mother quite fresh and hearty.
"""What wretches you are to live in this beggarly hut,"" said the lad."
"""Come with me up to my castle, and you shall see what a fine fellow I am."""
"Well! they were both ready to go, and on the way his mother talked to him, and asked how it was he had got so strong."
"""If you must know it came of that blue belt which lay on the hill-side that time when you and I were out begging,"" said the lad."
"""Have you got it still?"" asked she."
"""Yes"" he had. It was tied round his waist."
"""Might she see it?"""
"""Yes"" she might; and with that he pulled open his waistcoat and shirt to show it to her."
"Then she seized it with both hands, tore it off, and twisted it round her fist."
"""Now,"" she cried, ""what shall I do with such a wretch as you? I'll just give you one blow, and dash your brains out!"""
"""Far too good a death for such a scamp,"" said the Troll. ""No! let's first burn out his eyes, and then turn him adrift in a little boat."""
"So they burned out his eyes and turned him adrift, in spite of his prayers and tears; but, as the boat drifted, the lions swam after, and at last they laid hold of it and dragged it ashore on an island, and placed the lad under a fir tree. They caught game for him, and they plucked the birds and made him a bed of down; but he was forced to eat his meat raw and he was blind. At last, one day the biggest lion was chasing a hare which was blind, for it ran straight over stock and stone, and the end was, it ran right up against a fir-stump and tumbled head over heels across the field right into a spring; but lo!"
"when it came out of the spring it saw its way quite plain, and so saved its life."
"""So, so!"" thought the lion, and went and dragged the lad to the spring, and dipped him over head and ears in it. So, when he had got his sight again, he went down to the shore and made signs to the lions that they should all lie close together like a raft; then he stood upon their backs while they swam with him to the mainland. When he had reached the shore he went up into a birchen copse, and made the lions lie quiet. Then he stole up to the castle, like a thief, to see if he couldn't lay hands on his belt; and when he got to the door, he peeped through the keyhole, and there he saw his belt hanging up over a door in the kitchen. So he crept softly in across the floor, for there was no one there; but as soon as he had got hold of the belt, he began to kick and stamp about as though he were mad. Just then his mother came rushing out:"
"""Dear heart, my darling little boy! do give me the belt again,"" she said."
"""Thank you kindly,"" said he. ""Now you shall have the doom you passed on me,"" and he fulfilled it on the spot. When the old Troll heard that, he came in and begged and prayed so prettily that he might not be smitten to death."
"""Well, you may live,"" said the lad, ""but you shall undergo the same punishment you gave me;"" and so he burned out the Troll's eyes, and turned him adrift on the sea in a little boat, but he had no lions to follow him."
"Now the lad was all alone, and he went about longing and longing for the Princess; at last he could bear it no longer; he must set out to seek her, his heart was so bent on having her. So he loaded four ships and set sail for Arabia."
"""You come rather sharply,"" said the soldier."
"""As you whistle so I come,"" answered the eagle. So he asked her if she knew any means by which he could get away from the world in which they were."
"""You can't get away from here unless you can fly,"" said the eagle, ""but if you will slaughter twelve oxen for me, so that I can have a really good meal, I will try and help you. Have you got a knife?"""
"""No, but I have a sword,"" he said. When the eagle had swallowed the twelve oxen she asked the soldier to kill one more for victuals on the journey. ""Every time I gape you must be quick and fling a piece into my mouth,"" she said, ""else I shall not be able to carry you up to earth."""
"He did as she asked him and hung two large bags of meat round her neck and seated himself among her feathers. The eagle then began to flap her wings and off they went through the air like the wind. It was as much as the soldier could do to hold on, and it was with the greatest difficulty he managed to throw the pieces of flesh into the eagle's mouth every time she opened it."
"At last the day began to dawn, and the eagle was then almost exhausted and began flapping with her wings, but the soldier was prepared and seized the last hind quarter and flung it to her. Then she gained strength and brought him up to earth. When she had sat and rested a while at the top of a large pine-tree she set off with him again at such a pace that flashes of lightning were seen both by sea and land wherever they went."
"Close to the palace the soldier got off and the eagle flew home again, but first she told him that if he at any time should want her he need only blow the whistle and she would be there at once."
"In the meantime everything was ready at the palace, and the time approached when the captain and lieutenant were to be married with the two eldest Princesses, who, however, were not much happier than their youngest sister; scarcely a day passed without weeping and mourning, and the nearer the wedding-day approached the more sorrowful did they become."
"At last the King asked what was the matter with them; he thought it was very strange that they were not merry and happy now that they were saved and had been set free and were going to be married. They had to give some answer, and so the eldest sister said they never would be happy any more unless they could get such checkers as they had played with in the blue mountain."
"That, thought the King, could be easily managed, and so he sent word to all the best and cleverest goldsmiths in the country that they should make these checkers for the Princesses. For all they tried there was no one who could make them. At last all the goldsmiths had been to the palace except one, and he was an old, infirm man who had not done any work for many years except odd jobs, by which he was just able to keep himself alive. To him the soldier went and asked to be apprenticed. The old man was so glad to get him, for he had not had an apprentice for many a day, that he brought out a flask from his chest and sat down to drink with the soldier. Before long the drink got into his head, and when the soldier saw this he persuaded him to go up to the palace and tell the King that he would undertake to make the checkers for the Princesses."
"He was ready to do that on the spot; he had made finer and grander things in his day, he said. When the King heard there was some one outside who could make the checkers he was not long in coming out."
"""Is it true what you say, that you can make such checkers as my daughters want?"" he asked."
"""Yes, it is no lie,"" said the goldsmith; that he would answer for."
"""That's well!"" said the King. ""Here is the gold to make them with; but if you do not succeed you will lose your life, since you have come and offered yourself, and they must be finished in three days."""
"The next morning when the goldsmith had slept off the effects of the drink, he was not quite so confident about the job. He wailed and wept and blew up his apprentice, who had got him into such a scrape while he was drunk. The best thing would be to make short work of himself at once, he said, for there could be no hope for his life; when the best and grandest goldsmiths could not make such checkers, was it likely that he could do it?"
"""Don't fret on that account,"" said the soldier, ""but let me have the gold and I'll get the checkers ready in time; but I must have a room to myself to work in,"" he said. This he got, and thanks into the bargain."
"The time wore on, and the soldier did nothing but lounge about, and the goldsmith began to grumble, because he would not begin with the work."
"""Don't worry yourself about it,"" said the soldier, ""there is plenty of time! If you are not satisfied with what I have promised you had better make them yourself."" The same thing went on both that day and the next; and when the smith heard neither hammer nor file from the soldier's room the whole of the last day, he quite gave himself up for lost; it was now no use to think any longer about saving his life, he thought."
But when the night came on the soldier opened the window and blew his whistle. The eagle then came and asked what he wanted.
"""Those gold checkers, which the Princesses had in the blue mountain,"" said the soldier; ""but you'll want something to eat first, I suppose? I have two ox carcases lying ready for you in the hay-loft yonder; you had better finish them,"" he said. When the eagle had done she did not tarry, and long before the sun rose she was back again with the checkers. The soldier then put them under his bed and lay down to sleep."
Early next morning the goldsmith came and knocked at his door.
"""What are you after now again?"" asked the soldier. ""You rush about enough in the day, goodness knows! If one cannot have peace when one is in bed, whoever would be an apprentice here?"" said he."
"Neither praying nor begging helped that time; the goldsmith must and would come in, and at last he was let in."
"And then, you may be sure, there was soon an end to his wailing."
"But still more glad than the goldsmith were the Princesses, when he came up to the palace with the checkers, and gladdest of all was the youngest Princess."
"""Have you made them yourself?"" she asked."
"""No, if I must speak the truth, it is not I,"" he said, ""but my apprentice, who has made them."""
"""I should like to see that apprentice,"" said the Princess. In fact all three wanted to see him, and if he valued his life, he would have to come."
"He was not afraid, either of women-folk or grand-folk, said the soldier, and if it could be any amusement to them to look at his rags, they should soon have that pleasure."
"The youngest Princess recognised him at once; she pushed the soldiers aside and ran up to him, gave him her hand, and said:"
"""Good day, and many thanks for all you have done for us. It is he who freed us from the trolls in the mountain,"" she said to the King. ""He is the one I will have!"" and then she pulled off his cap and showed them the ring she had tied in his hair."
"It soon came out how the captain and lieutenant had behaved, and so they had to pay the penalty of their treachery with their lives, and that was the end of their grandeur. But the soldier got the golden crown and half the kingdom, and married the youngest Princess."
"When the Lord, who just then came by, saw that, he was angry, and said, “Henceforth shall the stalks of corn bear no more ears; men are no longer worthy of heavenly gifts.” The by-standers who heard this, were terrified, and fell on their knees and prayed that he would still leave something on the stalks, even if the people were undeserving of it, for the sake of the innocent birds which would otherwise have to starve."
"The Lord, who foresaw their suffering, had pity on them, and granted the request. So the ears were left as they now grow."
195 The Grave-Mound
"A rich farmer was one day standing in his yard inspecting his fields and gardens. The corn was growing up vigorously and the fruit-trees were heavily laden with fruit. The grain of the year before still lay in such immense heaps on the floors that the rafters could hardly bear it. Then he went into the stable, where were well-fed oxen, fat cows, and horses bright as looking-glass. At length he went back into his sitting-room, and cast a glance at the iron chest in which his money lay."
"Whilst he was thus standing surveying his riches, all at once there was a loud knock close by him. The knock was not at the door of his room, but at the door of his heart. It opened, and he heard a voice which said to him, “Hast thou done good to thy family with it? Hast thou considered the necessities of the poor? Hast thou shared thy bread with the hungry? Hast thou been contented with what thou hast, or didst thou always desire to have more?” The heart was not slow in answering, “I have been hard and pitiless, and have never shown any kindness to my own family. If a beggar came, I turned away my eyes from him. I have not troubled myself about God, but have thought only of increasing my wealth. If everything which the sky covers had been mine own, I should still not have had enough.”"
"When he was aware of this answer he was greatly alarmed, his knees began to tremble, and he was forced to sit down."
"Then there was another knock, but the knock was at the door of his room. It was his neighbour, a poor man who had a number of children whom he could no longer satisfy with food. “I know,” thought the poor man, “that my neighbour is rich, but he is as hard as he is rich. I don’t believe he will help me, but my children are crying for bread, so I will venture it.” He said to the rich man, “You do not readily give away anything that is yours, but I stand here like one who feels the water rising above his head. My children are starving, lend me four measures* of corn.” The rich man looked at him long, and then the first sunbeam of mercy began to melt away a drop of the ice of greediness. “I will not lend thee four measures,” he answered, “but I will make thee a present of eight, but thou must fulfil one condition.” “What am I to do?” said the poor man. “When I am dead, thou shalt watch for three nights by my grave.” The peasant was disturbed in his mind at this request, but in the need in which he was, he would have consented to anything; he accepted, therefore, and carried the corn home with him."
"It seemed as if the rich man had foreseen what was about to happen, for when three days were gone by, he suddenly dropped down dead. No one knew exactly how it came to pass, but no one grieved for him. When he was buried, the poor man remembered his promise; he would willingly have been released from it, but he thought, “After all, he acted kindly by me. I have fed my hungry children with his corn, and even if that were not the case, where I have once given my promise I must keep it.”"
"At nightfall he went into the churchyard, and seated himself on the grave-mound. Everything was quiet, only the moon appeared above the grave, and frequently an owl flew past and uttered her melancholy cry."
"When the sun rose, the poor man betook himself in safety to his home, and in the same manner the second night passed quietly by. On the evening of the third day he felt a strange uneasiness, it seemed to him that something was about to happen. When he went out he saw, by the churchyard-wall, a man whom he had never seen before. He was no longer young, had scars on his face, and his eyes looked sharply and eagerly around. He was entirely covered with an old cloak, and nothing was visible but his great riding-boots. “What are you looking for here?”"
the peasant asked. “Are you not afraid of the lonely churchyard?”
"“I am looking for nothing,” he answered, “and I am afraid of nothing! I am like the youngster who went forth to learn how to shiver, and had his labour for his pains, but got the King’s daughter to wife and great wealth with her, only I have remained poor. I am nothing but a paid-off soldier, and I mean to pass the night here, because I have no other shelter.” “If you are without fear,” said the peasant, “stay with me, and help me to watch that grave there.”"
"“To keep watch is a soldier’s business,” he replied, “whatever we fall in with here, whether it be good or bad, we will share it between us.”"
"The peasant agreed to this, and they seated themselves on the grave together."
"All was quiet until midnight, when suddenly a shrill whistling was heard in the air, and the two watchers perceived the Evil One standing bodily before them. “Be off, you ragamuffins!” cried he to them, “the man who lies in that grave belongs to me; I want to take him, and if you don’t go away I will wring your necks!” “Sir with the red feather,”"
"said the soldier, “you are not my captain, I have no need to obey you, and I have not yet learned how to fear. Go away, we shall stay sitting here.”"
"The Devil thought to himself, “Money is the best thing with which to get hold of these two vagabonds.” So he began to play a softer tune, and asked quite kindly, if they would not accept a bag of money, and go home with it? “That is worth listening to,” answered the soldier, “but one bag of gold won’t serve us, if you will give as much as will go into one of my boots, we will quit the field for you and go away.”"
"“I have not so much as that about me,” said the Devil, “but I will fetch it. In the neighbouring town lives a money-changer who is a good friend of mine, and will readily advance it to me.” When the Devil had vanished the soldier took his left boot off, and said, “We will soon pull the charcoal-burner’s nose for him, just give me your knife, comrade.” He cut the sole off the boot, and put it in the high grass near the grave on the edge of a hole that was half over-grown. “That will do,” said he; “now the chimney-sweep may come.”"
"They both sat down and waited, and it was not long before the Devil returned with a small bag of gold in his hand. “Just pour it in,” said the soldier, raising up the boot a little, “but that won’t be enough.”"
"The Black One shook out all that was in the bag; the gold fell through, and the boot remained empty. “Stupid Devil,” cried the soldier, “it won’t do! Didn’t I say so at once? Go back again, and bring more.” The Devil shook his head, went, and in an hour’s time came with a much larger bag under his arm. “Now pour it in,” cried the soldier, “but I doubt the boot won’t be full.” The gold clinked as it fell, but the boot remained empty. The Devil looked in himself with his burning eyes, and convinced himself of the truth. “You have shamefully big calves to your legs!” cried he, and made a wry face. “Did you think,” replied the soldier, “that I had a cloven foot like you? Since when have you been so stingy? See that you get more gold together, or our bargain will come to nothing!” The Wicked One went off again. This time he stayed away longer, and when at length he appeared he was panting under the weight of a sack which lay on his shoulders. He emptied it into the boot, which was just as far from being filled as before. He became furious, and was just going to tear the boot out of the soldier’s hands, but at that moment the first ray of the rising sun broke forth from the sky, and the Evil Spirit fled away with loud shrieks. The poor soul was saved."
"The peasant wished to divide the gold, but the soldier said, “Give what falls to my lot to the poor, I will come with thee to thy cottage, and together we will live in rest and peace on what remains, as long as God is pleased to permit.”"
196 Old Rinkrank
"There was once on a time a King who had a daughter, and he caused a glass mountain to be made, and said that whosoever could cross to the other side of it without falling should have his daughter to wife. Then there was one who loved the King’s daughter, and he asked the King if he might have her. “Yes,” said the King; “if you can cross the mountain without falling, you shall have her.” And the princess said she would go over it with him, and would hold him if he were about to fall. So they set out together to go over it, and when they were half way up the princess slipped and fell, and the glass-mountain opened and shut her up inside it, and her betrothed could not see where she had gone, for the mountain closed immediately. Then he wept and lamented much, and the King was miserable too, and had the mountain broken open where she had been lost, and though the would be able to get her out again, but they could not find the place into which she had fallen. Meanwhile the King’s daughter had fallen quite deep down into the earth into a great cave. An old fellow with a very long gray beard came to meet her, and told her that if she would be his servant and do everything he bade her, she might live, if not he would kill her. So she did all he bade her. In the mornings he took his ladder out of his pocket, and set it up against the mountain and climbed to the top by its help, and then he drew up the ladder after him. The princess had to cook his dinner, make his bed, and do all his work, and when he came home again he always brought with him a heap of gold and silver. When she had lived with him for many years, and had grown quite old, he called her Mother Mansrot, and she had to call him Old Rinkrank. Then once when he was out, and she had made his bed and washed his dishes, she shut the doors and windows all fast, and there was one little window through which the light shone in, and this she left open. When Old Rinkrank came home, he knocked at his door, and cried, “Mother Mansrot, open the door for me.”"
"“No,” said she, “Old Rinkrank, I will not open the door for thee.” Then he said,"
"“Here stand I, poor Rinkrank, On my seventeen long shanks, On my weary, worn-out foot, Wash my dishes, Mother Mansrot.”"
"“I have washed thy dishes already,” said she. Then again he said,"
"“Here stand I, poor Rinkrank, On my seventeen long shanks, On my weary, worn-out foot, Make me my bed, Mother Mansrot.”"
"“I have made thy bed already,” said she. Then again he said,"
"“Here stand I, poor Rinkrank, On my seventeen long shanks, On my weary, worn-out foot, Open the door, Mother Mansrot.”"
"Then he ran all round his house, and saw that the little window was open, and thought, “I will look in and see what she can be about, and why she will not open the door for me.” He tried to peep in, but could not get his head through because of his long beard. So he first put his beard through the open window, but just as he had got it through, Mother Mansrot came by and pulled the window down with a cord which she had tied to it, and his beard was shut fast in it. Then he began to cry most piteously, for it hurt him very much, and to entreat her to release him again. But she said not until he gave her the ladder with which he ascended the mountain. Then, whether he would or not, he had to tell her where the ladder was. And she fastened a very long ribbon to the window, and then she set up the ladder, and ascended the mountain, and when she was at the top of it she opened the window. She went to her father, and told him all that had happened to her. The King rejoiced greatly, and her betrothed was still there, and they went and dug up the mountain, and found Old Rinkrank inside it with all his gold and silver. Then the King had Old Rinkrank put to death, and took all his gold and silver. The princess married her betrothed, and lived right happily in great magnificence and joy."
197 The Crystal Ball
"There was once an enchantress, who had three sons who loved each other as brothers, but the old woman did not trust them, and thought they wanted to steal her power from her. So she changed the eldest into an eagle, which was forced to dwell in the rocky mountains, and was often seen sweeping in great circles in the sky. The second, she changed into a whale, which lived in the deep sea, and all that was seen of it was that it sometimes spouted up a great jet of water in the air. Each of them only bore his human form for only two hours daily. The third son, who was afraid she might change him into a raging wild beast a bear perhaps, or a wolf, went secretly away. He had heard that a King’s daughter who was bewitched, was imprisoned in the Castle of the Golden Sun, and was waiting for deliverance. Those, however, who tried to free her risked their lives; three-and-twenty youths had already died a miserable death, and now only one other might make the attempt, after which no more must come. And as his heart was without fear, he caught at the idea of seeking out the Castle of the Golden Sun. He had already travelled about for a long time without being able to find it, when he came by chance into a great forest, and did not know the way out of it."
"Calfskin shoes up to the Revolution were the exclusive property of the gentry, and the rest wore cowhide and were extremely glad to mend them themselves. These were greased every week with tallow, and could be worn on either foot with impunity. Rights and lefts were never thought of until after the Revolutionary War, but to-day the American shoe is the most symmetrical, comfortable, and satisfactory shoe made in the world."
"The British shoe is said to be more comfortable. Possibly for a British foot it is so, but for a foot containing no breathing-apparatus or viscera it is somewhat roomy and clumsy."
"Farmers and laborers of those days wore green or red baize in the shape of jackets, and their breeches were made of leather or bed-ticking. Our ancestors dressed plainly, and a man who could not make over two hundred pounds per year was prohibited from dressing up or wearing lace worth over two shillings per yard. It was a pretty sad time for literary men, as they were thus compelled to wear clothing like the common laborers."
"Lord Cornwallis once asked his aidy kong why the American poet always had such an air of listening as if for some expected sound. ""I give it up,"" retorted the aidy kong. ""It is,"" said Lord Cornwallis, as he took a large drink from a jug which he had tied to his saddle, ""because he is trying to see if he cannot hear his bed-ticking."" On the following day he surrendered his army, and went home to spring his bon-mot on George III."
"Yet the laws were very stringent in other respects besides apparel. A man was publicly whipped for killing a fowl on the Sabbath in New England. In order to keep a tavern and sell rum, one had to be of good moral character and possess property, which was a good thing. The names of drunkards were posted up in the alehouses, and the keepers forbidden to sell them liquor. No person under twenty years of age could use tobacco in Connecticut without a physician's order, and no one was allowed to use it more than once a day, and then not within ten miles of any house. It was a common thing to see large picnic-parties going out into the backwoods of Connecticut to smoke."
(Will the reader excuse me a moment while I light up a peculiarly black and redolent pipe?)
"Only the gentry were called Mr. and Mrs. This included the preacher and his wife. A friend of mine who is one of the gentry of this century got on the trail of his ancestry last spring, and traced them back to where they were not allowed to be called Mr. and Mrs., and, fearing he would fetch up in Scotland Yard if he kept on, he slowly unrolled the bottoms of his trousers, got a job on the railroad, and since then his friends are gradually returning to him. He is well pleased now, and looks humbly gratified even if you call him a gent."
"The Scriptures were literally interpreted, and the Old Testament was read every morning, even if the ladies fainted."
"The custom yet noticed sometimes in country churches and festive gatherings of placing the males and females on opposite sides of the room was originated not so much as a punishment to both, as to give the men an opportunity to act together when the red brother felt ill at ease."
"I am glad the red brother does not molest us nowadays, and make us sit apart that way. Keep away, red brother; remain on your reservation, please, so that the pale-face may sit by the loved one and hold her little soft hand during the sermon."
"Church services meant business in those days. People brought their dinners and had a general penitential gorge. Instrumental music was proscribed, as per Amos fifth chapter and twenty-third verse, and the length of prayer was measured by the physical endurance of the performer."
"The preacher often boiled his sermon down to four hours, and the sexton up-ended the hourglass each hour. Boys who went to sleep in church were sand-bagged, and grew up to be border murderers."
"New York people were essentially Dutch. New York gets her Santa Claus, her doughnuts, crullers, cookies, and many of her odors, from the Dutch."
"The New York matron ran to fine linen and a polished door-knocker, while the New England housewife spun linsey-woolsey and knit ""yarn mittens"""
for those she loved.
"Philadelphia was the largest city in the United States, and was noted for its cleanliness and generally sterling qualities of mind and heart, its Sabbath trance and clean white door-steps."
"The Southern Colonies were quite different from those of the North. In place of thickly-settled towns there were large plantations with African villages near the house of the owner. The proprietor was a sort of country squire, living in considerable comfort for those days. He fed and clothed everybody, black or white, who lived on the estate, and waited patiently for the colored people to do his work and keep well, so that they would be more valuable. The colored people were blessed with children at a great rate, so that at this writing, though voteless, they send a large number of members to Congress. This cheers the Southern heart and partially recoups him for his chickens. (See Appendix.)"
"The South then, as now, cured immense quantities of tobacco, while the North tried to cure those who used it."
"Washington was a Virginian. He packed his own flour with his own hands, and it was never inspected. People who knew him said that the only man who ever tried to inspect Washington's flour was buried under a hill of choice watermelons at Mount Vernon."
"Along the James and Rappahannock the vast estates often passed from father to son according to the law of entail, and such a thing as a poor man ""prior to the war"" must have been unknown."
"Education, however, flourished more at the North, owing partly to the fact that the people lived more in communities. Governor Berkeley of Virginia was opposed to free schools from the start, and said, ""I thank God there are no free schools nor printing-presses here, and I hope we shall not have them these hundred years."" His prayer has been answered."
CHAPTER XIV.
THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
William Pitt was partly to blame for the Revolutionary War. He claimed that the Colonists ought not to manufacture so much as a horseshoe nail except by permission of Parliament.
"It was already hard enough to be a colonist, without the privilege of expressing one's self even to an Indian without being fined. But when we pause to think that England seemed to demand that the colonist should take the long wet walk to Liverpool during a busy season of the year to get his horse shod, we say at once that P. Henry was right when he exclaimed that the war was inevitable and moved that permission be granted for it to come."
"Then came the Stamp Act, making almost everything illegal that was not written on stamp paper furnished by the maternal country."
"John Adams, Patrick Henry, and John Otis made speeches regarding the situation. Bells were tolled, and fasting and prayer marked the first of November, the day for the law to go into effect."
"These things alarmed England for the time, and the Stamp Act was repealed; but the king, who had been pretty free with his money and had entertained a good deal, began to look out for a chance to tax the Colonists, and ordered his Exchequer Board to attend to it."
"Patrick Henry got excited, and said in an early speech, ""Cæsar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and George the Third  "" Here he paused and took a long swig of pure water, and added, looking at the newspaper reporters, ""If this be treason, make the most of it."" He also said that George the Third might profit by their example. A good many would like to know what he started out to say, but it is too hard to determine."
"asked the peasant. “Oh, I have not got the money,” replied the woman; “he had happened to forget his money-belt, but he will soon bring it, and he left good security behind him.” “What kind of security?” asked the man. “One of the three cows, which he shall not have until he has paid for the other two. I have managed very cunningly, for I have kept the smallest, which eats the least.” The man was enraged and lifted up his stick, and was just going to give her the beating he had promised her. Suddenly he let the stick fail and said, “You are the stupidest goose that ever waddled on God’s earth, but I am sorry for you. I will go out into the highways and wait for three days to see if I find anyone who is still stupider than you. If I succeed in doing so, you shall go scot-free, but if I do not find him, you shall receive your well-deserved reward without any discount.”"
"He went out into the great highways, sat down on a stone, and waited for what would happen. Then he saw a peasant’s waggon coming towards him, and a woman was standing upright in the middle of it, instead of sitting on the bundle of straw which was lying beside her, or walking near the oxen and leading them. The man thought to himself, “That is certainly one of the kind I am in search of,” and jumped up and ran backwards and forwards in front of the waggon like one who is not very wise. “What do you want, my friend?” said the woman to him; “I don’t know you, where do you come from?” “I have fallen down from heaven,”"
"replied the man, “and don’t know how to get back again, couldn’t you drive me up?” “No,” said the woman, “I don’t know the way, but if you come from heaven you can surely tell me how my husband, who has been there these three years is. You must have seen him?” “Oh, yes, I have seen him, but all men can’t get on well. He keeps sheep, and the sheep give him a great deal to do. They run up the mountains and lose their way in the wilderness, and he has to run after them and drive them together again. His clothes are all torn to pieces too, and will soon fall off his body. There is no tailor there, for Saint Peter won’t let any of them in, as you know by the story.” “Who would have thought it?”"
"cried the woman, “I tell you what, I will fetch his Sunday coat which is still hanging at home in the cupboard, he can wear that and look respectable. You will be so kind as to take it with you.” “That won’t do very well,” answered the peasant; “people are not allowed to take clothes into Heaven, they are taken away from one at the gate.” “Then hark you,” said the woman, “I sold my fine wheat yesterday and got a good lot of money for it, I will send that to him. If you hide the purse in your pocket, no one will know that you have it.” “If you can’t manage it any other way,” said the peasant, “I will do you that favor.”"
"“Just sit still where you are,” said she, “and I will drive home and fetch the purse, I shall soon be back again. I do not sit down on the bundle of straw, but stand up in the waggon, because it makes it lighter for the cattle.” She drove her oxen away, and the peasant thought, “That woman has a perfect talent for folly, if she really brings the money, my wife may think herself fortunate, for she will get no beating.” It was not long before she came in a great hurry with the money, and with her own hands put it in his pocket. Before she went away, she thanked him again a thousand times for his courtesy."
"When the woman got home again, she found her son who had come in from the field. She told him what unlooked-for things had befallen her, and then added, “I am truly delighted at having found an opportunity of sending something to my poor husband. Who would ever have imagined that he could be suffering for want of anything up in heaven?” The son was full of astonishment. “Mother,” said he, “it is not every day that a man comes from Heaven in this way, I will go out immediately, and see if he is still to be found; he must tell me what it is like up there, and how the work is done.” He saddled the horse and rode off with all speed. He found the peasant who was sitting under a willow-tree, and was just going to count the money in the purse. “Have you seen the man who has fallen down from Heaven?” cried the youth to him. “Yes,”"
"answered the peasant, “he has set out on his way back there, and has gone up that hill, from whence it will be rather nearer; you could still catch him up, if you were to ride fast.” “Alas,” said the youth, “I have been doing tiring work all day, and the ride here has completely worn me out; you know the man, be so kind as to get on my horse, and go and persuade him to come here.” “Aha!” thought the peasant, “here is another who has no wick in his lamp!” “Why should I not do you this favor?” said he, and mounted the horse and rode off in a quick trot. The youth remained sitting there till night fell, but the peasant never came back. “The man from Heaven must certainly have been in a great hurry, and would not turn back,” thought he, “and the peasant has no doubt given him the horse to take to my father.” He went home and told his mother what had happened, and that he had sent his father the horse so that he might not have to be always running about."
"“Thou hast done well,” answered she, “thy legs are younger than his, and thou canst go on foot.”"
"When the peasant got home, he put the horse in the stable beside the cow which he had as a pledge, and then went to his wife and said, “Trina, as your luck would have it, I have found two who are still sillier fools than you; this time you escape without a beating, I will store it up for another occasion.” Then he lighted his pipe, sat down in his grandfather’s chair, and said, “It was a good stroke of business to get a sleek horse and a great purse full of money into the bargain, for two lean cows. If stupidity always brought in as much as that, I would be quite willing to hold it in honor.” So thought the peasant, but you no doubt prefer the simple folks."
105 Stories about Snakes
First Story.
"There was once a little child whose mother gave her every afternoon a small bowl of milk and bread, and the child seated herself in the yard with it. When she began to eat however, a snake came creeping out of a crevice in the wall, dipped its little head in the dish, and ate with her. The child had pleasure in this, and when she was sitting there with her little dish and the snake did not come at once, she cried,"
"“Snake, snake, come swiftly Hither come, thou tiny thing, Thou shalt have thy crumbs of bread, Thou shalt refresh thyself with milk.”"
"Then the snake came in haste, and enjoyed its food. Moreover it showed gratitude, for it brought the child all kinds of pretty things from its hidden treasures, bright stones, pearls, and golden playthings. The snake, however, only drank the milk, and left the bread-crumbs alone."
"Then one day the child took its little spoon and struck the snake gently on its head with it, and said, “Eat the bread-crumbs as well, little thing.” The mother, who was standing in the kitchen, heard the child talking to someone, and when she saw that she was striking a snake with her spoon, ran out with a log of wood, and killed the good little creature."
"From that time forth, a change came over the child. As long as the snake had eaten with her, she had grown tall and strong, but now she lost her pretty rosy cheeks and wasted away. It was not long before the funeral bird began to cry in the night, and the redbreast to collect little branches and leaves for a funeral garland, and soon afterwards the child lay on her bier."
Second Story.
"An orphan child was sitting on the town walls spinning, when she saw a snake coming out of a hole low down in the wall. Swiftly she spread out beside this one of the blue silk handkerchiefs which snakes have such a strong liking for, and which are the only things they will creep on. As soon as the snake saw it, it went back, then returned, bringing with it a small golden crown, laid it on the handkerchief, and then went away again. The girl took up the crown, it glittered and was of delicate golden filagree work. It was not long before the snake came back for the second time, but when it no longer saw the crown, it crept up to the wall, and in its grief smote its little head against it as long as it had strength to do so, until at last it lay there dead. If the girl had but left the crown where it was, the snake would certainly have brought still more of its treasures out of the hole."
Third Story.
"A snake cries, “Huhu, huhu.” A child says, “Come out.” The snake comes out, then the child inquires about her little sister: “Hast thou not seen little Red-stockings?” The snake says, “No.” “Neither have I.”"
"“Then I am like you. Huhu, huhu, huhu.”"
106 The Poor Miller’s Boy and the Cat
"In a certain mill lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child, and three apprentices served under him. As they had been with him several years, he one day said to them, “I am old, and want to sit in the chimney-corner, go out, and whichsoever of you brings me the best horse home, to him will I give the mill, and in return for it he shall take care of me till my death.” The third of the boys was, however, the drudge, who was looked on as foolish by the others; they begrudged the mill to him, and afterwards he would not have it. Then all three went out together, and when they came to the village, the two said to stupid Hans, “Thou mayst just as well stay here, as long as thou livest thou wilt never get a horse.” Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep. The two sharp ones waited until Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away leaving him where he was. And they thought they had done a very clever thing, but it was certain to turn out ill for them. When the sun arose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern. He looked around on every side and exclaimed, “Oh, heavens, where am I?”"
"Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, “Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I obtain a horse now?” Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he met a small tabby-cat which said quite kindly, “Hans, where are you going?” “Alas, thou canst not help me.” “I well know your desire,” said the cat. “You wish to have a beautiful horse. Come with me, and be my faithful servant for seven years long, and then I will give you one more beautiful than any you have ever seen in your whole life.” “Well, this is a wonderful cat!” thought Hans, “but I am determined to see if she is telling the truth.” So she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were nothing but cats who were her servants. They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy. In the evening when they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make music."
"One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly could. When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the cat said, “Now, Hans, come and dance with me.” “No,” said he, “I won’t dance with a pussy cat. I have never done that yet.” “Then take him to bed,” said she to the cats. So one of them lighted him to his bed-room, one pulled his shoes off, one his stockings, and at last one of them blew out the candle. Next morning they returned and helped him out of bed, one put his stockings on for him, one tied his garters, one brought his shoes, one washed him, and one dried his face with her tail. “That feels very soft!” said Hans. He, however, had to serve the cat, and chop some wood every day, and to do that, he had an axe of silver, and the wedge and saw were of silver and the mallet of copper."
"So he chopped the wood small; stayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw anyone but the tabby-cat and her servants. Once she said to him, “Go and mow my meadow, and dry the grass,” and gave him a scythe of silver, and a whetstone of gold, but bade him deliver them up again carefully. So Hans went thither, and did what he was bidden, and when he had finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and hay to the house, and asked if it was not yet time for her to give him his reward. “No,” said the cat, “you must first do something more for me of the same kind. There is timber of silver, carpenter’s axe, square, and everything that is needful, all of silver, with these build me a small house.” Then Hans built the small house, and said that he had now done everything, and still he had no horse. Nevertheless the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six months. The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses?"
"“Yes,” said Hans. Then she opened the door of the small house, and when she had opened it, there stood twelve horses, such horses, so bright and shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them. And now she gave him to eat and drink, and said, “Go home, I will not give thee thy horse away with thee; but in three days’ time I will follow thee and bring it.” So Hans set out, and she showed him the way to the mill. She had, however, never once given him a new coat, and he had been obliged to keep on his dirty old smock-frock, which he had brought with him, and which during the seven years had everywhere become too small for him. When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there again as well, and each of them certainly had brought a horse with him, but one of them was a blind one, and the other lame. They asked Hans where his horse was. “It will follow me in three days’ time.” Then they laughed and said, “Indeed, stupid Hans, where wilt thou get a horse?”"
"“It will be a fine one!” Hans went into the parlour, but the miller said he should not sit down to table, for he was so ragged and torn, that they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in. So they gave him a mouthful of food outside, and at night, when they went to rest, the two others would not let him have a bed, and at last he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie down on a little hard straw. In the morning when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to see them! and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for the poor miller’s boy. And a magnificent princess alighted from the coach and went into the mill, and this princess was the little tabby-cat whom poor Hans had served for seven years. She asked the miller where the miller’s boy and drudge was? Then the miller said, “We cannot have him here in the mill, for he is so ragged; he is lying in the goose-house.”"
Then the King’s daughter said that they were to bring him immediately.
"So they brought him out, and he had to hold his little smock-frock together to cover himself. The servants unpacked splendid garments, and washed him and dressed him, and when that was done, no King could have looked more handsome. Then the maiden desired to see the horses which the other apprentices had brought home with them, and one of them was blind and the other lame. So she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse, and when the miller saw it, he said that such a horse as that had never yet entered his yard. “And that is for the third miller’s boy,” said she. “Then he must have the mill,” said the miller, but the King’s daughter said that the horse was there, and that he was to keep his mill as well, and took her faithful Hans and set him in the coach, and drove away with him. They first drove to the little house which he had built with the silver tools, and behold it was a great castle, and everything inside it was of silver and gold; and then she married him, and he was rich, so rich that he had enough for all the rest of his life. After this, let no one ever say that anyone who is silly can never become a person of importance."
107 The Two Travellers
"Hill and vale do not come together, but the children of men do, good and bad. In this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other in their travels. The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full of enjoyment. He saw the shoemaker coming towards him from the other side, and as he observed by his bag what kind of a trade he plied, he sang a little mocking song to him,"
"A long debate ensued, and, according to tradition, while the members of the Assembly stood around the table taking a farewell look at the charter, one of the largest members of the house fell on the governor's breast and wept so copiously on his shirt-frill that harsh words were used by his Excellency; a general quarrel ensued, the lights went out, and when they were relighted the charter was gone."
"Captain Wadsworth had taken it and concealed it in a hollow tree, since called the Charter Oak. After Andros was ejected from the Boston office, the charter was brought out again, and business under it was resumed."
"Important documents, however, should not be, as a general thing, secreted in trees. The author once tried this while young, and when engaged to, or hoping to become engaged to, a dear one whose pa was a singularly coarse man and who hated a young man who came as a lover at his daughter's feet with nothing but a good education and his great big manly heart. He wanted a son-in-law with a brewery; and so he bribed the boys of the neighborhood to break up a secret correspondence between the two young people and bring the mail to him. This was the cause of many a heart-ache, and finally the marriage of the sweet young lady to a brewer who was mortgaged so deeply that he wandered off somewhere and never returned. Years afterwards the brewery needed repairs, and one of the large vats was found to contain all of the missing man that would not assimilate with the beer, viz., his watch. Quite a number of people at that time quit the use of beer, and the author gave his hand in marriage to a wealthy young lady who was attracted by his gallantry and fresh young beauty."
"Roger Williams now settled at Providence Plantation, where he was joined by Mrs. Hutchinson, who also believed that the church and state should not be united, but that the state should protect the church and that neither should undertake to boss the other. It was also held that religious qualifications should not be required of political aspirants, also that no man should be required to whittle his soul into a shape to fit the religious auger-hole of another."
"This was the beginning of Rhode Island. She desired at once to join the New England Colony, but was refused, as she had no charter. Plymouth claimed also to have jurisdiction over Rhode Island. This was very much like Plymouth."
"Having banished Roger Williams and Mrs. Hutchinson to be skinned by the Pequods and Narragansetts over at Narragansett Pier, they went on about their business, flogging Quakers, also ducking old women who had lumbago, and burning other women who would not answer affirmatively when asked, ""Be you a witch?"""
"Then when Roger began to make improvements and draw the attention of Eastern capital to Rhode Island and to organize a State or Colony with a charter, Plymouth said, ""Hold on, Roger: religiously we have cast you out, to live on wild strawberries, clams, and Indians, but from a mercantile and political point of view you will please notice that we have a string which you will notice is attached to your wages and discoveries."""
"Afterwards, however, Roger Williams obtained the necessary funds from admiring friends with which to go to England and obtain a charter which united the Colonies yet gave to all the first official right to liberty of conscience ever granted in Europe or America. Prior to that a man's conscience had a brass collar on it with the royal arms engraved thereon, and was kept picketed out in the king's grounds. The owner could go and look at it on Sundays, but he never had the use of it."
"With the advent of freedom of political opinion, the individual use of the conscience has become popularized, and the time is coming when it will grow to a great size under our wise institutions and fostering skies. Instead of turning over our consciences to the safety deposit company of a great political party or religious organization and taking the key in our pocket, let us have individual charge of this useful little instrument and be able finally to answer for its growth or decay."
CHAPTER VII.
THE DISCOVERY OF NEW YORK.
The author will now refer to the discovery of the Hudson River and the town of New York via Fort Lee and the 125th Street Ferry.
"New York was afterwards sold for twenty-four dollars, the whole island."
"When I think of this I go into my family gallery, which I also use as a swear room, and tell those ancestors of mine what I think of them. Where were they when New York was sold for twenty-four dollars? Were they having their portraits painted by Landseer, or their deposition taken by Jeffreys, or having their Little Lord Fauntleroy clothes made?"
"Do not encourage them to believe that they will escape me in future years. Some of them died unregenerate, and are now, I am told, in a country where they may possibly be damned; and I will attend to the others personally."
"Twenty-four dollars for New York! Why, my Croton-water tax on one house and lot with fifty feet four and one-fourth inches front is fifty-nine dollars and no questions asked. Why, you can't get a voter for that now."
"Henry or Hendrik Hudson was an English navigator, of whose birth and early history nothing is known definitely, hence his name is never mentioned in many of the best homes in New York."
"In 1607 he made a voyage in search of the Northwest Passage. In one of his voyages he discovered Cape Cod, and later on the Hudson River."
This was one hundred and seventeen years after Columbus discovered America; which shows that the discovering business was not pushed as it should have been by those who had it in charge.
"Hudson went up the river as far as Albany, but, finding no one there whom he knew, he hastened back as far as 209th Street West, and anchored."
"He discovered Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, and made other journeys by water, though aquatting was then in its infancy. Afterwards his sailors became mutinous, and set Hendrik and his son, with seven infirm sailors, afloat."
Ah! Whom have we here?
"It is Hendrik Hudson, who discovered the Hudson River."
"Here he has just landed at the foot of 209th Street, New York, where he offered the Indians liquor, but they refused."
How 209th Street has changed!
The artist has been fortunate in getting the expression of the Indians in the act of refusing. Mr. Hudson's great reputation lies in the fact that he discovered the river which bears his name; but the thinking mind will at once regard the discovery of an Indian who does not drink as far more wonderful.
"Some historians say that this especial delegation was swept away afterward by a pestilence, whilst others commenting on the incident maintain that Hudson lied."
"The shoemaker had to make the shoes in which the little tailor danced at the wedding festival, after which he was commanded to quit the town for ever. The road to the forest led him to the gallows. Worn out with anger, rage, and the heat of the day, he threw himself down. When he had closed his eyes and was about to sleep, the two crows flew down from the heads of the men who were hanging there, and pecked his eyes out. In his madness he ran into the forest and must have died there of hunger, for no one has ever either seen him again or heard of him."
108 Hans the Hedgehog
"There was once a countryman who had money and land in plenty, but how rich soever he was, one thing was still wanting in his happiness he had no children. Often when he went into the town with the other peasants they mocked him and asked why he had no children. At last he became angry, and when he got home he said, “I will have a child, even if it be a hedgehog.” Then his wife had a child, that was a hedgehog in the upper part of his body, and a boy in the lower, and when she saw the child, she was terrified, and said, “See, there thou hast brought ill-luck on us.” Then said the man, “What can be done now? The boy must be christened, but we shall not be able to get a godfather for him.”"
"The woman said, “And we cannot call him anything else but Hans the Hedgehog.”"
"When he was christened, the parson said, “He cannot go into any ordinary bed because of his spikes.” So a little straw was put behind the stove, and Hans the Hedgehog was laid on it. His mother could not suckle him, for he would have pricked her with his quills. So he lay there behind the stove for eight years, and his father was tired of him and thought, “If he would but die!” He did not die, however, but remained lying there. Now it happened that there was a fair in the town, and the peasant was about to go to it, and asked his wife what he should bring back with him for her. “A little meat and a couple of white rolls which are wanted for the house,” said she. Then he asked the servant, and she wanted a pair of slippers and some stockings with clocks. At last he said also, “And what wilt thou have, Hans my Hedgehog?” “Dear father,” he said, “do bring me bagpipes.” When, therefore, the father came home again, he gave his wife what he had bought for her; meat and white rolls, and then he gave the maid the slippers, and the stockings with clocks; and, lastly, he went behind the stove, and gave Hans the Hedgehog the bagpipes. And when Hans the Hedgehog had the bagpipes, he said, “Dear father, do go to the forge and get the cock shod, and then I will ride away, and never come back again.” On this, the father was delighted to think that he was going to get rid of him, and had the cock shod for him, and when it was done, Hans the Hedgehog got on it, and rode away, but took swine and asses with him which he intended to keep in the forest. When they got there he made the cock fly on to a high tree with him, and there he sat for many a long year, and watched his asses and swine until the herd was quite large, and his father knew nothing about him. While he was sitting in the tree, however, he played his bagpipes, and made music which was very beautiful. Once a King came travelling by who had lost his way and heard the music. He was astonished at it, and sent his servant forth to look all round and see from whence this music came. He spied about, but saw nothing but a little animal sitting up aloft on the tree, which looked like a cock with a hedgehog on it which made this music. Then the King told the servant he was to ask why he sat there, and if he knew the road which led to his kingdom. So Hans the Hedgehog descended from the tree, and said he would show the way if the King would write a bond and promise him whatever he first met in the royal courtyard as soon as he arrived at home. Then the King thought, “I can easily do that, Hans the Hedgehog understands nothing, and I can write what I like.” So the King took pen and ink and wrote something, and when he had done it, Hans the Hedgehog showed him the way, and he got safely home. But his daughter, when she saw him from afar, was so overjoyed that she ran to meet him, and kissed him. Then he remembered Hans the Hedgehog, and told her what had happened, and that he had been forced to promise whatsoever first met him when he got home, to a very strange animal which sat on a cock as if it were a horse, and made beautiful music, but that instead of writing that he should have what he wanted, he had written that he should not have it. Thereupon the princess was glad, and said he had done well, for she never would have gone away with the Hedgehog."
"Hans the Hedgehog, however, looked after his asses and pigs, and was always merry and sat on the tree and played his bagpipes."
"Now it came to pass that another King came journeying by with his attendants and runners, and he also had lost his way, and did not know how to get home again because the forest was so large. He likewise heard the beautiful music from a distance, and asked his runner what that could be, and told him to go and see. Then the runner went under the tree, and saw the cock sitting at the top of it, and Hans the Hedgehog on the cock. The runner asked him what he was about up there?"
"“I am keeping my asses and my pigs; but what is your desire?” The messenger said that they had lost their way, and could not get back into their own kingdom, and asked if he would not show them the way."
"Then Hans the Hedgehog got down the tree with the cock, and told the aged King that he would show him the way, if he would give him for his own whatsoever first met him in front of his royal palace. The King said, “Yes,” and wrote a promise to Hans the Hedgehog that he should have this. That done, Hans rode on before him on the cock, and pointed out the way, and the King reached his kingdom again in safety. When he got to the courtyard, there were great rejoicings. Now he had an only daughter who was very beautiful; she ran to meet him, threw her arms round his neck, and was delighted to have her old father back again."
"She asked him where in the world he had been so long. So he told her how he had lost his way, and had very nearly not come back at all, but that as he was travelling through a great forest, a creature, half hedgehog, half man, who was sitting astride a cock in a high tree, and making music, had shown him the way and helped him to get out, but that in return he had promised him whatsoever first met him in the royal court-yard, and how that was she herself, which made him unhappy now."
"But on this she promised that, for love of her father, she would willingly go with this Hans if he came."
"Hans the Hedgehog, however, took care of his pigs, and the pigs multiplied until they became so many in number that the whole forest was filled with them. Then Hans the Hedgehog resolved not to live in the forest any longer, and sent word to his father to have every stye in the village emptied, for he was coming with such a great herd that all might kill who wished to do so. When his father heard that, he was troubled, for he thought Hans the Hedgehog had died long ago. Hans the Hedgehog, however, seated himself on the cock, and drove the pigs before him into the village, and ordered the slaughter to begin. Ha!"
"but there was a killing and a chopping that might have been heard two miles off! After this Hans the Hedgehog said, “Father, let me have the cock shod once more at the forge, and then I will ride away and never come back as long as I live.” Then the father had the cock shod once more, and was pleased that Hans the Hedgehog would never return again."
"Hans the Hedgehog rode away to the first kingdom. There the King had commanded that whosoever came mounted on a cock and had bagpipes with him should be shot at, cut down, or stabbed by everyone, so that he might not enter the palace. When, therefore, Hans the Hedgehog came riding thither, they all pressed forward against him with their pikes, but he spurred the cock and it flew up over the gate in front of the King’s window and lighted there, and Hans cried that the King must give him what he had promised, or he would take both his life and his daughter’s. Then the King began to speak his daughter fair, and to beg her to go away with Hans in order to save her own life and her father’s. So she dressed herself in white, and her father gave her a carriage with six horses and magnificent attendants together with gold and possessions. She seated herself in the carriage, and placed Hans the Hedgehog beside her with the cock and the bagpipes, and then they took leave and drove away, and the King thought he should never see her again. He was however, deceived in his expectation, for when they were at a short distance from the town, Hans the Hedgehog took her pretty clothes off, and pierced her with his hedgehog’s skin until she bled all over. “That is the reward of your falseness,” said he, “go your way, I will not have you!” and on that he chased her home again, and she was disgraced for the rest of her life."
"Hans the Hedgehog, however, rode on further on the cock, with his bagpipes, to the dominions of the second King to whom he had shown the way. This one, however, had arranged that if any one resembling Hans the Hedgehog should come, they were to present arms, give him safe conduct, cry long life to him, and lead him to the royal palace."
"But when the King’s daughter saw him she was terrified, for he looked quite too strange. She remembered however, that she could not change her mind, for she had given her promise to her father. So Hans the Hedgehog was welcomed by her, and married to her, and had to go with her to the royal table, and she seated herself by his side, and they ate and drank. When the evening came and they wanted to go to sleep, she was afraid of his quills, but he told her she was not to fear, for no harm would befall her, and he told the old King that he was to appoint four men to watch by the door of the chamber, and light a great fire, and when he entered the room and was about to get into bed, he would creep out of his hedgehog’s skin and leave it lying there by the bedside, and that the men were to run nimbly to it, throw it in the fire, and stay by it until it was consumed. When the clock struck eleven, he went into the chamber, stripped off the hedgehog’s skin, and left it lying by the bed. Then came the men and fetched it swiftly, and threw it in the fire; and when the fire had consumed it, he was delivered, and lay there in bed in human form, but he was coal-black as if he had been burnt. The King sent for his physician who washed him with precious salves, and anointed him, and he became white, and was a handsome young man. When the King’s daughter saw that she was glad, and the next morning they arose joyfully, ate and drank, and then the marriage was properly solemnized, and Hans the Hedgehog received the kingdom from the aged King."
"When several years had passed he went with his wife to his father, and said that he was his son. The father, however, declared he had no son he had never had but one, and he had been born like a hedgehog with spikes, and had gone forth into the world. Then Hans made himself known, and the old father rejoiced and went with him to his kingdom."
"My tale is done, And away it has run To little August’s house."
109 The Shroud
"There was once a mother who had a little boy of seven years old, who was so handsome and lovable that no one could look at him without liking him, and she herself worshipped him above everything in the world. Now it so happened that he suddenly became ill, and God took him to himself; and for this the mother could not be comforted, and wept both day and night. But soon afterwards, when the child had been buried, it appeared by night in the places where it had sat and played during its life, and if the mother wept, it wept also, and when morning came it disappeared. As, however, the mother would not stop crying, it came one night, in the little white shroud in which it had been laid in its coffin, and with its wreath of flowers round its head, and stood on the bed at her feet, and said, “Oh, mother, do stop crying, or I shall never fall asleep in my coffin, for my shroud will not dry because of all thy tears, which fall upon it.” The mother was afraid when she heard that, and wept no more. The next night the child came again, and held a little light in its hand, and said, “Look, mother, my shroud is nearly dry, and I can rest in my grave.” Then the mother gave her sorrow into God’s keeping, and bore it quietly and patiently, and the child came no more, but slept in its little bed beneath the earth."
110 The Jew Among Thorns
"There was once a rich man, who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly: He was every morning the first out of bed, and the last to go to rest at night; and, whenever there was a difficult job to be done, which nobody cared to undertake, he was always the first to set himself to it. Moreover, he never complained, but was contented with everything, and always merry."
"When a year was ended, his master gave him no wages, for he said to himself, “That is the cleverest way; for I shall save something, and he will not go away, but stay quietly in my service.” The servant said nothing, but did his work the second year as he had done it the first; and when at the end of this, likewise, he received no wages, he made himself happy, and still stayed on."
"When the third year also was past, the master considered, put his hand in his pocket, but pulled nothing out. Then at last the servant said, “Master, for three years I have served you honestly, be so good as to give me what I ought to have, for I wish to leave, and look about me a little more in the world.”"
"“Yes, my good fellow,” answered the old miser; “you have served me industriously, and, therefore, you shall be cheerfully rewarded;” And he put his hand into his pocket, but counted out only three farthings, saying, “There, you have a farthing for each year; that is large and liberal pay, such as you would have received from few masters.”"
"The honest servant, who understood little about money, put his fortune into his pocket, and thought, “Ah! now that I have my purse full, why need I trouble and plague myself any longer with hard work!” So on he went, up hill and down dale; and sang and jumped to his heart’s content. Now it came to pass that as he was going by a thicket a little man stepped out, and called to him, “Whither away, merry brother? I see you do not carry many cares.” “Why should I be sad?” answered the servant; “I have enough; three years’ wages are jingling in my pocket.”"
"“How much is your treasure?” the dwarf asked him. “How much? Three farthings sterling, all told.” “Look here,” said the dwarf, “I am a poor needy man, give me your three farthings; I can work no longer, but you are young, and can easily earn your bread.”"
"And as the servant had a good heart, and felt pity for the old man, he gave him the three farthings, saying, “Take them in the name of Heaven, I shall not be any the worse for it.”"
"Then the little man said, “As I see you have a good heart I grant you three wishes, one for each farthing, they shall all be fulfilled.”"
"“Aha?” said the servant, “you are one of those who can work wonders!"
"Well, then, if it is to be so, I wish, first, for a gun, which shall hit everything that I aim at; secondly, for a fiddle, which when I play on it, shall compel all who hear it to dance; thirdly, that if I ask a favor of any one he shall not be able to refuse it.”"
"“All that shall you have,” said the dwarf; and put his hand into the bush, and only think, there lay a fiddle and gun, all ready, just as if they had been ordered. These he gave to the servant, and then said to him, “Whatever you may ask at any time, no man in the world shall be able to deny you.”"
Perhaps a word of apology is due the Indians after all. Possibly they got their ideas from Cockburn.
"The battle of Lundy's Lane had been arranged for July 25, 1814, and so the Americans crossed Niagara under General Brown to invade Canada."
"General Winfield Scott led the advance, and gained a brilliant victory, July 5, at Chippewa. The second engagement was at Lundy's Lane, within the sound of the mighty cataract. Old man Lundy, whose lane was used for the purpose, said that it was one of the bloodiest fights, by a good many gallons, that he ever attended. The battle was, however, barren of results, the historian says, though really an American victory from the stand-point of the tactician and professional gore-spiller."
"In September, Sir George Prevost took twelve thousand veteran troops who had served under Wellington, and started for Plattsburg. The ships of the British at the same time opened fire on the nine-dollar American navy, and were almost annihilated. The troops under Prevost started in to fight, but, learning of the destruction of the British fleet on Lake Champlain, Prevost fled like a frightened fawn, leaving his sick and wounded and large stores of lime-juice, porridge, and plum-pudding. The Americans, who had been living on chopped horse-feed and ginseng-root, took a week off and gave themselves up to the false joys of lime-juice and general good feeling."
"Along the coast the British destroyed everything they could lay their hands on; but perhaps the rudest thing they did was to enter Washington and burn the Capitol, the Congressional library, and the smoke-house in which President Madison kept his hams. Even now, when the writer is a guest of some great English dignitary, and perhaps at table picking the ""merry-thought"" of a canvas-back duck, the memory of this thing comes over him, and, burying his face in the costly napery, he gives himself up to grief until kind words and a celery-glass-full of turpentine, or something, bring back his buoyancy and rainbow smile. The hospitality and generous treatment of our English brother to Americans now is something beautiful, unaffected, and well worth a voyage across the qualmy sea to see, but when Cockburn burned down the Capitol and took the President's sugar-cured hams he did a rude act."
CHAPTER XXI.
THE ADVANCE OF THE REPUBLIC.
"The administration now began to suffer at the hands of the people, many of whom criticised the conduct of the war and that of the President also. People met at Hartford and spoke so harshly that the Hartford Federalist obtained a reputation which clung to him for many years."
"There being no cable in those days, the peace by Treaty of Ghent was not heard of in time to prevent the battle of New Orleans, January 8, 1815, there having been two weeks of peace as a matter of fact when this hot and fatal battle was fought."
"General Pakenham, with a force of twelve thousand men by sea and land, attacked the city. The land forces found General Jackson intrenched several miles below the city. He had used cotton for fortifications at first, but a hot shot had set a big bunch of it on fire and rolled it over towards the powder-supplies, so that he did not use cotton any more."
"General Pakenham was met by the solid phalanx of Tennessee and Kentucky riflemen, who reserved their fire, as usual, until the loud uniform of the English could be distinctly heard, when they poured into their ranks a galling fire, as it was so tersely designated at the time. General Pakenham fell mortally wounded, and his troops were repulsed, but again rallied, only to be again repulsed. This went on until night, when General Lambert, who succeeded General Pakenham, withdrew, hopelessly beaten, and with a loss of over two thousand men."
"The United States now found that an honorable peace had been obtained, and with a debt of $127,000,000 started in to pay it up by instalments, which was done inside of twenty years from the ordinary revenue."
"In the six years following, one State per year was added to the Union, and all kinds of manufactures were built up to supply the goods that had been cut off by the blockade during the war. Even the deluge of cheap goods from abroad after the war did not succeed in breaking these down."
"James Monroe was almost unanimously elected. He was generally beloved, and his administration was, in fact, known as the original ""era of good feeling,"" since so successfully reproduced especially by the Governors of North and South Carolina. (See Appendix.)"
"Through the efforts of Henry Clay, Missouri was admitted as a slave State in 1821, under the compromise that slavery should not be admitted into any of the Territories west of the Mississippi and north of parallel 36° 30' N."
"Clay was one of the greatest men of his time, and was especially eminent as an eloquent and magnetic speaker in the days when the record for eloquence was disputed by the giants of American oratory, and before the Senate of the United States had become a wealthy club of men whose speeches are rarely printed except at so much per column, paid in advance."
Clay was the original patentee of the slogan for campaign use.
"Lafayette revisited this country in 1819, and was greeted with the greatest hospitality. He visited the grave of Washington, and tenderly spoke of the grandeur of character shown by his chief."
"He was given the use of the Brandywine, a government ship, for his return. As he stood on the deck of the vessel at Pier 1, North River, his mind again recurred to Washington, and to those on shore he said that ""to show Washington's love of truth, even as a child, he could tell an interesting incident of him relating to a little new hatchet given him at the time by his father."" As he reached this point in his remarks, Lafayette noted with surprise that some one had slipped his cable from shore and his ship was gently shoved off by people on the pier, while his voice was drowned in the notes of the New York Oompah Oompah Band as it struck up ""Johnny, git yer Gun."""
"Florida was ceded to the United States in the same year by Spain, and was sprinkled over with a light coating of sand for the waves to monkey with. The Everglades of Florida are not yet under cultivation."
"Mr. Monroe became the author of what is now called the ""Monroe doctrine,"" viz., that the effort of any foreign country to obtain dominion in America would thereafter and forever afterwards be regarded as an unfriendly act. Rather than be regarded as unfriendly, foreign countries now refrain from doing their dominion or dynasty work here."
"The Whigs now appeared, and the old Republican party became known as the Democratic party. John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay were Whigs, and John C. Calhoun and Andrew Jackson were Democrats. The Whigs favored a high protective tariff and internal improvement. The Democrats did not favor anything especially, but bitterly opposed the Whig measures, whatever they were."
"In 1825, John Quincy Adams, son of John Adams, was elected President, and served one term. He was a bald-headed man, and the country was given four years of unexampled prosperity. Yet this experience has not been regarded by the people as it should have been. Other kinds of men have repeatedly been elected to that office, only to bring sorrow, war, debt, and bank-failures upon us. Sometimes it would seem to the thinking mind that, as a people, we need a few car-loads of sense in each school-district, where it can be used at a moment's notice."
"Adams was not re-elected, on account of his tariff ideas, which were not popular at the South. He was called ""The old man eloquent,"" and it is said that during his more impassioned passages his head, which was round and extremely smooth, became flushed, so that, from resembling the cue-ball on the start, as he rose to more lofty heights his dome of thought looked more like the spot ball on a billiard-table. No one else in Congress at that time had succeeded in doing this."
"John Quincy Adams was succeeded in 1829 by Andrew Jackson, the hero of New Orleans. Jackson was the first to introduce what he called ""rotation in office."" During the forty years previous there had been but seventy-four removals; Jackson made seven hundred. This custom has been pretty generally adopted since, giving immense satisfaction to those who thrive upon the excitement of offensive partisanship and their wives'"
"relations, while those who have legitimate employment and pay taxes support and educate a new official kindergarten with every change of administration."
"The prophet sees in the distance an eight-year term for the President, and employment thereafter as ""charge-d'affaires"" of the United States, with permission to go beyond the seas. Thus the vast sums of money and rivers of rum used in the intervening campaigns at present will be used for the relief of the widow and orphan. The ex-President then, with the portfolio of International Press Agent for the United States, could go abroad and be fêted by foreign governments, leaving dyspepsia everywhere in his wake and crowned heads with large damp towels on them."
"Every ex-President should have some place where he could go and hide his shame. A trip around the world would require a year, and by that time the voters would be so disgusted with the new President that the old one would come like a healing balm, and he would be permitted to die without publishing a bulletin of his temperature and showing his tongue to the press for each edition of the paper."
"South Carolina in 1832 passed a nullification act declaring the tariff act ""null and void"" and announcing that the State would secede from the Union if force were used to collect any revenue at Charleston. South Carolina has always been rather ""advanced"" regarding the matter of seceding from the American Union."
"President Jackson, however, ordered General Scott and a number of troops to go and see that the laws were enforced; but no trouble resulted, and soon more satisfactory measures were enacted, through the large influence of Mr. Clay."

"sake from beside the brazier. ""By the way, I know you prefer tequila,"
"one of your odd quirks, but there was no time to acquire any. Perhaps"
"this will suffice."""

"must proceed."""
"Post time, Vance thought."

"Intelligence Agency, and finally a private consultant affiliated with a"
group of mercenaries. I had your file updated when I first heard you
were involved. I see you have not been entirely idle since our last

"""You haven't done too bad yourself."" Vance toasted him back. ""This new"
"project is a big step up from the old days. Has a lot of style."""
"""It does indeed,"" he nodded. ""I'm quite proud of our achievement here."""
"""You always thought big."" Vance sipped again at his sake, warm and"
soothing.

"""You hope to make something out of it?"""
"""We hope,"" replied Allison. ""We can't be sure."""
"""But surely this pile of junk has been tested before?"""
Allison nodded.
"""Any results?"""
"""Some. We've had as much as five minutes of constant operation out of"

"As he spoke, the hemisphere over their heads flashed a full bright"
"green, then went black. A bell tinkled somewhere and a couple of techs"
dropped their tools and headed for the back room on the double. A
couple of others stood up from their work and lit cigarettes because
their instruments had gone dead. Some of the rest continued to nurse
their particular circuits because that section was still running.
[Illustration: The dome became a riot of flaming green.]
"After scanning the operation to see which section had gone blooey,"
"Allison went on. ""We've never tested this outfit under anything"
but ideal conditions. We've had spacecraft sent out to specified
"distances, fired up the gizmo and found fragments of response right"
"where there should be a response."""
"That added the last straw. She took two steps to the table, and"
"sitting down blindly, covered her face with her hands. Her shoulders"
"began to tremble, her head sank lower and lower on the table. Her"
pride was gone.
'Heaven help us!' she whispered in a passion of grief. 'Heaven help
"us, for there is no help here!'"
"'That is better,' he said, eyeing her coldly. 'We shall soon come to"
terms now.'
In his exultation he went a step nearer to her. He was about to touch
"her--to lay his hand on her hair, believing his evil victory won, when"
suddenly two dark figures rose like shadows behind her chair. He
"recoiled, dropping his hand. In a moment a pistol barrel was thrust"
into his face. He fell back another step.
'One word and you are a dead man!' a stern voice hissed in his ear.
"Then he saw another barrel gleam in the lamplight, and he stood still."
"'What is this?' he said, looking from one to the other, his voice"
trembling with rage.
'Justice!' the same speaker answered harshly. 'But stand still and be
"silent, and you shall have your life. Give the alarm, and you die,"
"general, though we die the next minute. Sit down in that chair.'"
"He hesitated. But the two shining barrels converging on his head, the"

"""They may be contraterrene."""

"Linus Brein nodded. ""In which case from both sides we must watch our"
steps. Get involved with a seetee race the wrong way and you have two
"cultures with absolutely nothing in common but a life-factor, busy"
tossing chunks of their own kind of matter at one another in a fight
"to exterminate. So before either of you start making half-baked plans,"
you'd better get your heads together and plan something that sounds
"reasonable to the Big Boss. Right?"""

Commodore Wilson eyed the spacecraft full of hastily assembled
instruments with a grimace. The ship was swarming with techs who were
"peering into oscilloscopes, watching meters, and tinkering with signal"
generators. A huge concave hemispherical dome above was a splatter of
little flickering green pinpoints and dark patches.
"""Well, here goes for food!"" he said, as though he were going to require"
all his energy for the task of eating.
Why had she written? There was nothing to prevent her speaking to him. He
"had, after all, been sitting on the doorstep when she emerged from her"
room and passed him. Had she foreseen that the good comedian could not
"contain himself, but would surely let a third person into the secret?"
"Why probe or question further? The actor did not eat much, but he looked"
"very happy. So the note must have said yes, must have been a promise;"
perhaps she would not tantalize him further.

"A few days later, they were going to leave. They would travel together,"
and that would be the end.
"I might have pitied them both, for though life is good, life is stern. One"
"result at any rate was accomplished. She had not sent for him in vain, nor"
had he come in vain.
That was the end of the act. But there were more acts to come--many more.
"She had lost much: having been ravished, she gave herself away; why be"
"niggardly now? And this is the destiny of her type, that they lose"
"increasingly much, retaining ever less; what need to hold back now? The"

"42. Tendrils cleft. Leaves lobed. Fruit dry, opening by a lid.--Species"
7. Tropical and South Africa; one species also cultivated in North
Africa. They are used as vegetables and medicinal plants; some have
"edible, others poisonous fruits; the fibres of the fruit are employed"
"for making sponges, hats, and various utensils; the seeds are oily."
=Luffa= L.
"Tendrils absent. Leaves undivided. Flowers yellow, the male without"
"a rudimentary pistil. Fruit fleshy, ejecting the seeds when"
ripe.--Species 1. North Africa. A poisonous and medicinal plant.

43. Male flowers without a rudimentary pistil. Ovules few.
"Stem climbing. Tendrils two-cleft. Flowers in clusters, small,"
"yellowish-green, monoecious. Fruit small, globular.--Species 1."
Tropics. Used as an ornamental and medicinal plant. =Bryonopsis= Arn.
Male flowers with a rudimentary pistil. Ovules numerous. 44

febrile diseases.

This made me feel queer.

Her perplexity was fast approaching alarm when we heard a muffled report

expressed intention of hiding this terrible discovery from him. He had
"been duped, not by her, but by his own romantic folly."
Yet what would his life be without her--or rather without his illusion?
An icy hand gripped his heart. He turned to the glimmering window and
stared at the blank wall.
"Presently a moan struck upon his ear. He wheeled round sharply, and"
distinguished her lying with helpless outspread arms on the couch. Mere
humanity brought him to her side.
"“I am so tired,” she moaned."
"“You must go to bed,” he replied in a gentler voice than hitherto. “We"
"had better part now. To-morrow, if you are well enough to travel, we"
will leave for England.”
"“Let me go alone,” she murmured, “and you go on to Switzerland. Why"
should your holiday be spoiled?”
"“It is my life that is spoiled,” he said ungenerously. “The holiday"
matters very little. It is best to return to England as soon as
possible. Between now and to-morrow morning I shall have time to reflect
upon the situation.”
He struck a match and lit the candles and drew down the blind. The
light revealed her to him so wan and exhausted that he was moved with
compunction.
"“Don’t think me hard, my child,” he said, bending over her. “It is the"
bitterest day of our lives. We must pray to God for strength to bear it.

at the lethal fist that held the weapon. And he was lucky. The hand
snapped open under the ripping impact of the bullet and the knife rang
sharply against the wall as it ricocheted to the ground.
"Only then, did the patrolman obey the order to drop. He went to one knee"
and Brent Taber fired three shots into the chest of the android.
He hesitated. There was only one slug left in the revolver. If the three
"didn't spot the android, he planned to wait for closer contact and put"
the sixth slug into the forehead.
The android shuddered. The fire and frenzy went out of him. He tried to
lift a leg and was surprised when it didn't move. He looked down at it.
"Completely bemused, he peered down at his crimson chest. He looked up at"
"Taber without anger, only with surprise. A distinct expression of"
wistful regret crossed his face as he sank to the ground.
The tenth android was dead.
The patrolman came shakily to his feet. His face was as pale as death.

"been on the force for ten years."""
"""Don't worry about it,"" Taber said."

"'Don't worry.'"""

CONCLUSION
This is the end of my book. I have tried always as I wrote to remember
the principles that I laid down for myself in the first chapter. Whether
"I have always done so I cannot say. It is so difficult, so very"
"difficult, to understand a people--any people--to separate their beliefs"
"from their assents, to discover the motives of their deeds, that I fear"
I must often have failed.
My book is short. It would have been easy to make a book out of each
"chapter, to write volumes on each great subject that I have touched on;"
but I have not done so--I have always been as brief as I could.
"I have tried always to illustrate only the central thought, and not the"
"innumerable divergencies, because only so can a great or strange thought"
"be made clear. Later, when the thought is known, then it is easy to"
"stray into the byways of thought, always remembering that they are"
"byways, wandering from a great centre."
difficulties personally had produced an unexpected dividend.
"""As you say, _Mino-sama_,"" Ikeda bowed. ""I merely wanted to make you"
aware of my concern about the pilot. He should be monitored more
"closely from now on."""
"""Which is precisely what I intend to do."" Tanzan Mino's silver hair"
"seemed to blend with the sea beyond. ""There is an obvious solution."
"When he takes the vehicle hypersonic, he will not be alone."""
"""What are you suggesting? No one else--"""
"""Merely a simple security precaution. If he is not reliable, then steps"
"must be taken. Two of our people will be in the cockpit with him."""
"""You mean the scientists from Tsukuba? The cockpit was designed to"
"accommodate a three-man crew, but MITI hasn't yet designated the two"
"researchers."""
"""No. I mean my personal pilot and copilot. From the Boeing. Then if"
"Androv deviates from the prescribed test program in any way, they will"
"be there, ready to take immediate action. The problem is solved."" He"
"revolved back from the window. ""That will be all."""
"Ikeda bowed, then turned and hurriedly made his way toward the door. He"
"didn't like last-minute improvisations, but the CEO was now fully in"
command. Preparations for two additional life-support systems would
have to be started immediately.
"After Tanzan Mino watched him depart, he reached down and activated a"
line of personal video monitors beside his desk.
"""Frankly, I haven't had time to read them. However, I think there is"
little doubt as to the mood of my people. They will be indignant and
"angry at Washington bungling."""
He pointed to another hand.
"""Senator, granting the details you outlined are accurate, have you any"
"knowledge as to--"""
"""Young man. _Every_ detail I outlined was completely accurate."" Senator"
Crane withered the reporter with a hostile look and pointed elsewhere.
"""Senator, did you consult with the people responsible for handling the"
"situation before making your speech?"""
"""I tried. I was willing to co-operate in every way, but my patience ran"
"out. Also, I was alarmed at the bungling and inefficiency I saw. For"
"that reason I went straight to the people with my story."""
"""Senator, I have a wire from the governor of your state. It just arrived"
in response to my query as to his attitude on this affair. The governor
"says, quote, _No comment_, unquote. Would _you_ care to comment on his"
"statement?"""
Senator Crane thought he heard a faint ripple of mirth drift across the
"room. But, of course, he had to be mistaken. ""I think the governor"
replied wisely. I expect to return home and confer with him as soon as
"possible."""

cut and run!”
“So that’s what you did all the talking for?” queried Jack.
"“You bet!” answered Frank. “And while you’re running, I’ll do a little"
sprinting myself.”
"“Here, you!” shouted the leader, almost lifting Frank’s feet from the"
ground as he dragged him away.
“What were you whispering to that boy?” demanded one of the others.
"“I was telling him,” Frank answered, making an insulting face, “that I"
used to have a dog that looked exactly like you.”
The fellow thus insulted sprang for the boy with upraised fist. The
"leader blocked his rush by imposing his own burly form, and the two went"
"down together. The half-breeds sprang forward, too, the intention"
evidently being to assist their companion as against the leader.
"Frank let out a yell which might have been heard half a mile away, and"
"the three boys darted down the mountainside, followed by harmless shots"
from the guns of the half-breeds.
The incident had taken place on a rocky level flanked by steep slopes on
"each side. The place, in fact, was almost like a shelf of rock cut into"
a long fifty percent grade.
Not many minutes had passed after their perilous descent when a sphere
"of fire shot from the clouds, followed by a crash as if the earth had"
"been rent in twain, and the western tower of Astura was seen toppling"
into the sea.
"Bye and bye sea and land reflected a crimson glow, which steadily"
"increased, fanned by the gale, until it shone far out upon the sea."
"Astura was in flames, the funeral pyre of the Frangipani."
CHAPTER VII
THE QUEST
"As the world grew gray with waking light, Francesco came from the"
woods and heard the noise of the sea in the hush that breathed in the
dawn. The storm had passed over the sea and a vast calm hung upon the
lips of the day. In the east a green streak shone above the hills. The
sky was still aglitter with sparse stars. An immensity of gloom
brooded over the sea.
"Gaunt, wounded, triumphant, Francesco rode up beneath the banners of"
"the dawn, eager yet fearful, inspired and strong of purpose. Wood and"
hill slept in a haze of mist. The birds were only beginning in the
"thickets, like the souls of children yet unborn, calling to eternity."
"Beyond in the cliffs, San Nicandro, wrapped round with night, stood"
silent and sombre athwart the west.
"me by speaking English, though I shall not attempt to reproduce his"
"pronunciation. ""How far better it is to say: 'Monsieur, permit to me,'"
before one runs a man through than to do it as though one were sticking
"a mere pig. Is it not so?"""
"""True as sunshine, my dear count,"" I returned. ""There's a vast difference"
"between the trade of butchering and the gentle art of murder."""
"De Grammont threw back his head, laughing softly. ""Ah, good, good! Very"
"good, dear baron! The sentiment is beau-ti-ful and could not be better"
"expressed--in English. You should have been born across the channel."""
"""I wish I had been born any place, not excepting hell, rather than in"
"England,"" I answered."
"""True, true, what a hole it is,"" returned the count, regretfully. ""The"
"Englishman is one pig."""
He saw by the expression of my face that while I might abuse my own
"countrymen, I did not relish hearing it from others, so with true French"
tact he held up his hand to keep me from speaking till he could correct
himself.
"""Pardon, baron, I forgot the 'r,' The Englishman's affectation of a"
"virtue he despises makes of him a prig--not a pig. Non, non! Mon Dieu!"
"Not a pig--a prig! Is it not so?"""
"""True, true, count,"" I returned, unable to restrain a laugh. ""It is the"
"affectation of virtue that makes frank vice attractive by comparison."""
"""Ah, true, true, my dear baron. May I proceed with my errand?"""
"next year it comes up thicker. If you mow it down, remove the seeds,"
"sow it with salt and kill the field, you have a useless plot of land, a"
worthless territory. Then some day up comes weed and briar--which then
must be removed root and branch before the land is plantable again.
"Just remember, we are after a profitable exchange of economy, not"
another stellar system to list as a conquest for the sake of history
"our children will read. I want my reward now, or next week. Having my"
"name on a monument does not have much appeal."""
"He was half standing with his hands closed into fists, his knuckles on"
the table supporting him as he leaned forward to drive his facts home.
"""Or,"" he added scathingly, ""are you two firebrands so youthful that you"
don't know that a man has only one single lone chance at this business
of living? And that your finest reward at eventide is knowing you have
lived a full and eventful life without screwing it up somewhere along
"the line by making a lot of idiotic moves?"""
Viggon Sarri turned on a heel and walked out.

Naylo and Twill turned to Linus Brein.
"""What do you think?"" Twill asked."
"Linus Brein shrugged. ""He is undoubtedly right. Besides, we don't know"
"all there is to know about the strange race out there yet."""
"""Oh, faugh! What else--"""
"Linus Brein smiled. He said slowly. ""We don't even know whether or not"
"""We seem to be working toward different objectives,"" Novosty answered."
"""Michael has a solution to everybody's problem. I regret very much"
"you've chosen not to help facilitate it."""
"""The only problem he solved was yours,"" she shot back. ""Mr. Vance"
devised what amounts to an enormous check kiting scheme. You two
"planned to perpetrate fraud. You're nothing better than criminals, both"
"of you, and I intend to make sure you haven't also given us a short"
"count."""
"""Comrade, fraud is a harsh word,"" Vance interjected."
"""You are not as amusing as you think,"" she replied."
"""Humor makes the world go round."""
'This is not a joke. The negotiable instruments in this room are Soviet
funds. I intend to make sure those funds are intact. There will be a
"full and complete count. Now."""
"She's gone over the edge, he told himself. She's definitely going to"
"try and screw us, either wittingly or unwittingly. But who in the room"
is going to help her? That huddled group of Russian bankers now staring
"terrified at Novosty's 9mm? Not damned likely. She's improvising, on"
her own. But her little stunt could well end up sinking the ship.
The two couriers were now spread against the brown textured fabric of
"the wall, legs apart. He walked over and reached into the leather"
"holsters at their hips, drawing out their revolvers. They were snub-"
"nosed Smith & Wesson Bodyguards, .38 caliber. He looked them over,"
"cocked them, and handed one to Eva."
"""Mr. Vance."" Vera Karanova watched as the two security men unlatched"
their satchels and began withdrawing the bundles of open cashiers
"checks and bearer bonds. ""I want to recount these securities, now."""
"""There're double-counted tallys already prepared""--he pointed toward the"
"bundles--""yesterday by the main branch of Moscow Narodny. The printouts"
"are attached."""
"""That was their count,"" she replied. ""I intend to make my own, before"
"we go any further."""
"Which means time lost, he thought. Doesn't she realize we've got to get"
"this cash recycled, those bonds purchased and in place, before Tanzan"

"Ken's new Mino Industries debentures doesn't go through, giving us"
something to hold over the godfather's head . . .
She's literally playing into his hands.
"""The instruments are all here, all negotiable, and all ready to go,"" he"
"said, stealing a quick glance toward Eva. One look at her eyes told him"
"she also sensed trouble brewing. ""Now, we're damn well going to move"
"and move fast. We credit the funds here, then wire them to Westminster"
"Union. And by God we do it immediately."""
"""Mr. Vance, you are no longer giving the orders,"" she replied sharply."
"""I'm in charge here now. As a matter of fact, I have no intention of"
wiring the money anywhere. There will be no purchase of debentures. As
"far as I'm concerned, it has now been returned."" She paused for"
"emphasis. ""But first we will count it."""
"""No, you have a problem."" She examined him confidently. ""Because if"
"those materials are not returned to us, we will be forced to take"
"actions you may find harsh."""
"""Give it your best shot,"" he went on, glancing at Eva and hoping they"
"could keep up the bravado, ""because we've got a few cards in our hand"
too. Forget the money--that's history now--but we could still be in a
"position to blow your whole project sky high."""
"""You two are the only ones outside our organization who know about the"
"protocol. That knowledge will not be allowed to go any farther."""
"""Don't be so sure. For all you know, we've already stashed a copy"
"somewhere. Left word that if anything happens to either one of us, the"
package gets sent to the papers. Made public. Think what some premature
"headlines would do for your little project."""
"""We have thought about it, Mr. Vance. That contingency has been"
"covered."""
"""Well, if I don't know what the other player's got, I tend to trust my"
"own cards."""
But why play at all? he suddenly found himself musing. Fold this hand
and go for the next move.
"Before leaving Crete he'd transmitted a copy of the protocol, still in"
"its encrypted form, to his office computer in Nassau. At the time it'd"
merely seemed like prudence; now it might turn out to be a lifeline.
One phone call and it could be transmitted back here this very
afternoon. The magic of satellites in space. Knock out another quick
At last they had reached the high plateau. A dog barked. The wood
suddenly swarmed with bearded and grotesque forms. They did not
recognize in Francesco the monk who had spent a night in their midst.
"The goatherd had maliciously disappeared, as if to revenge himself for"
his interrupted orisons. With glowering faces they thronged around
"Francesco, a babel of voices shouting questions and threatening the"
intruder.
"He waved them contemptuously aside, and his demeanor seemed to raise"
him in their regards.
At his request to be forthwith conducted into the presence of the
"duke, one pointed to a low building at the edge of the plateau. Wisps"
of smoke curled out of it and vanished into the night.
"""The duke and the Abbot are at orisons,"" the man said with a grimace,"
"the meaning of which was lost upon Francesco. ""He will not return"
"before midnight."""
"""I will await him here,"" said the newcomer, dismounting and leading"
"his steed to a small plot of pasture, where the grass was tall and"
"untrodden. Then, spent as he was, he requested food and drink, and as"
"he joined the band of outlaws, listening to their jokes and banter, he"
"thought he could discern among them many a one whom Fate had, like"
"himself, buffeted into a life, not of his forming, not of his choice."
CHAPTER V
THE ABBEY OF FARFA
For him also there seemed no other escape. He pointed to the revolver.
"""For whom is that?"" he asked."
"""I do not know--but I will make them kill me."""
"""Why do you not shoot me, then?"" he demanded, between despair and"
"bitterness. ""That would save you all. If I fell, they would turn and"
fly. They think I am Vishnu. Haven't you thought of that? I am in your
power. Why don't you make yourself the benefactress of your country?
"Why don't you shoot her enemy?"""
"She made no answer, but her eyes met his steadily and calmly. He"
"turned away, groaning. In vain he fought against it, in vain stung"
himself to action by the memory of all that she had done to him. His
love remained triumphant. In that supreme moment his faith burst
"through the darkness, and again he believed in her, believed in her"
"against reason, against the world, against the ineffaceable past, and"
against himself. And it was too late. He no longer stood alone. His
word was given.
"""Have pity on me!"" he said, once more facing her. ""Let me save you!"""
"""I should despise myself, and you would despise me--even more than you"
do now. I can not do less than share the fate of those whose lives my

"sake!--I can not turn back. You have made me suffer enough--."" He"
"stood before her now as an incoherent pleader, and her heart burned"
with an exultation in which the thought of life and death played no
part. She knew that he still loved her. It seemed for the moment all
"We paraded, and marched off to work. The continuous roar gradually gave"
"place to irregular, though frequent, outbursts of firing along the"
entire front.
The next day the sound seemed to have come nearer. Rumours began to
"circulate--it was said that Armentières had fallen, that the Portuguese"
"had been annihilated at Merville, that the British had counter-attacked"
and taken Lille.
"Rations, newspapers and letters were delayed. Large bodies of troops"
"passed through the village. We got no definite or official news, and"
nobody had any clear notion of what was happening.
But the sound of firing grew louder and louder and our anxiety deepened.
There could no longer be any doubt about it--the Germans were advancing
on our front.
The sickening certainty transcended all other considerations. A few
miles from us thousands were being slaughtered. I ceased to ponder the
problems of failure and success. I forgot the politicians and was
"conscious of only one despairing wish, that the terrible thing might"
come to an end. Victory and defeat seemed irrelevant considerations. If
only the end would come quickly--nothing else really mattered.
I often wondered what was in the minds of the other men. Many of them
"looked anxious, but on the whole they were normal in their behaviour."
They grumbled and quarrelled much as usual and talked rather more than
"usual--but so did I, in spite of my intense mental agitation."
The sound of firing grew louder.
"But now science has learned a new wisdom, to look only at what it can"
"see, to leave vain imaginings to children and idealists, certain always"
that the truth is inconceivably more beautiful than any dream.
"Science with us has gained her freedom, but the soul is still in bonds."
Only in Buddhism has this soul-freedom been partly gained. How beautiful
"this is, how full of great thoughts, how very different to the barren"
"materialism it has often been said to be, I have tried to show."
I believe myself that in this teaching of the laws of righteousness we
"have the grandest conception, the greatest wisdom, the world has known."
I believe that in accepting this conception we are opening to ourselves
"a new world of unimaginable progress, in justice, in charity, in"
"sympathy, and in love."
"I believe that as our minds, when freed from their bonds, have grown"
"more and more rapidly to heights of thought before undreamed of, to"
"truths eternal, to beauty inexpressible, so shall our souls, when freed,"
"as our minds now are, rise to sublimities of which now we have no"
conception.
"Let each man but open his eyes and see, and his own soul shall teach him"
marvellous things.

The work of exploring the planets that swung with Earth around the sun
"was still a new branch of the service. Less than ten years ago, it had"
"been, when Ansen devised his first crude atomic motor."
"At once, with the introduction of this tremendous new motive power,"
"men had begun to build space ships and explore the sky. And, as so"
"often happens with a new invention, the thing had grown rather beyond"
itself.
Everywhere amateur space flyers launched forth into the heavens to try
their new celestial wings. Everywhere young and old enthusiasts set
Ansen motors into clumsily insulated shells and started for Mars or
the moon or Venus.
"The resultant loss of life, as might have been foreseen, was"
appalling. Eager but inexperienced explorers edged over onto the wrong
side of Mercury and were burned to cinders. They set forth in ships
"that were badly insulated, and froze in the absolute zero of space."
"They learned the atomic motor controls too hastily, ran out of"
"supplies or lost their courses, and wandered far out into space--stiff"
corpses in coffins that were to be buried only in time's infinity.
"To stop the foolish waste of life, the Earth Government stepped in. It"
was decreed that no space ship might be owned or built privately. It
was further decreed that those who felt an urge to explore must join
order made in the exercise of the ordinary jurisdiction of such court;
and in the meantime and until a final order has been made on such
application the court shall have power to make all such provisional and
"other orders as to the care or custody of such captured ship, goods, or"
"merchandize, and (if the same be of perishable nature, or incurring risk"
"of deterioration) for the sale thereof, and with respect to the deposit"
"or investment of the proceeds of any such sale, as may be made by such"
court in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction.

"as the work progressed, it seemed that good-fortune would never smile"
"upon them for long. One day, when their preparations were nearly"
"completed, a foreman came to Boyd, and said excitedly:"
"""Boss, I'd like you to look at the Iron Chinks right away."""
"""What's up?"""
"""I don't know, but something is wrong."" A hurried examination showed"
the machines to be cunningly crippled; certain parts were entirely
"missing, while others were broken."
"""They were all right when we brought them ashore,"" the man declared."
"""Somebody's been at them lately."""
"""When? How?"" questioned Boyd. ""We have had watchmen on guard all the"
"time. Have any strangers been about?"""
"""Nobody seems to know. When we got ready to set 'em just now, I saw"
"this."""
"The Iron Chink, or mechanical cleaner, is perhaps the most ingenious of"
the many labor-saving devices used in the salmon fisheries. It is an
"awkward-looking, yet very effective contrivance of revolving knives and"
"conveyors which seizes the fish whole and delivers it cleaned, clipped,"
"cut, and ready to be washed. With superhuman dexterity it does the work"
of twenty lightning-like butchers. Without the aid of these Iron
"Chinks, Boyd knew that his fish would spoil before they could be"
"handled. In a panic, he pursued his investigation far enough to realize"
that the machines were beyond repair; that what had seemed at first a
"trivial mishap was in fact an appalling disaster. Then, since his own"
"experience left him without resource, he hastened straightway to George"
The officer hesitated. In such circumstances one might easily do wrong.
"He might shoot these men, and after all find that they were innocent. He"
preferred to wait. The living are more easily deprived of life than the
dead restored to it. Such was his thought.
In any case he had not long to wait.
"Round the angle of the mill-house swept the general and his staff,"
"brilliant in scarlet and white, heightened by the glitter of abundant"
"gold-lace. For the ex-butcher of Tortosa was a kind of military dandy,"
and loved to surround himself with the foppery of the _matador_ and the
"brigand. At heart, indeed, he was still the _guerrillero_ of Morella,"
riding home through the streets of that little rebel city after a
successful foray.
As his eyes fell on the row of men dark against the dusty _adobe_ of the
"garden wall, and on the two pale women, a dark frown overspread his"
face.
"""What is the meaning of this?"" he cried. ""Why have you not obeyed your"
"instructions? Why are these men not yet dead?"""
"The officer trembled, and began an explanation, pointing to Concha and"
"La Giralda, both of whom stood for a moment motionless. Then flinging"
herself over the low wall of the garden as if her years had more nearly
"approached seventeen than seventy, La Giralda caught the great man by"
the stirrup.
"""Little Ramon, Ramon Cabrera,"" she cried, ""have you forgotten your old"
"nurse, La Giralda of Sevilla, your mother's gossip, your own playmate?"""
"The general turned full upon her, with the quick indignant threat of one"
"d’hôtes_, at whirlwind lunch counters, on sandwiches and beer in his"
"hall-bedroom. He was willing to do that, for he was a true son of the"
"great city of razzle-dazzle, and to him one evening in the limelight"
made up for many dark ones.
Chandler protracted his walk until the Forties began to intersect the
"great and glittering primrose way, for the evening was yet young, and"
"when one is of the _beau monde_ only one day in seventy, one loves to"
"protract the pleasure. Eyes bright, sinister, curious, admiring,"
"provocative, alluring were bent upon him, for his garb and air"
proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure.
"At a certain corner he came to a standstill, proposing to himself the"
question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in
which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury. Just
"then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner, slipped on a patch of"
icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk.
Chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy.
"The girl hobbled to the wall of the building, leaned against it, and"
thanked him demurely.
"“I think my ankle is strained,” she said. “It twisted when I fell.”"
“Does it pain you much?” inquired Chandler.
“Only when I rest my weight upon it. I think I will be able to walk in
a minute or two.”
"“If I can be of any further service,” suggested the young man, “I will"
"call a cab, or—”"
"Jessica held the casket to Severance, with a little outward sweep of her"
"wrist. He took it and, folding his arms, looked at her steadily. A tide"
"of angry colour rose to her hair, then she turned her back upon him and"
looking out over the water tapped her foot on the rocks.
“Why do you not go?” she asked. “I hate you more than any one on earth.”
“No. You love me.”
"“I hate you! You are a brute! The coolest, the rudest, the most"
exasperating man on—on earth.”
"“That is the reason you love me. My dear Mrs. Pendleton,” he continued,"
"taking the ring from the casket and laying the latter on a rock, “a"
woman of brains and headstrong will—but unegoistic—likes a brutal and
"masterful man. An egoistical woman, whether she be fool or brilliant,"
"likes a slave. The reason is that egoism, not being a feminine quality"
"primarily, but borrowed from man, places its fair possessor outside of"
her sex’s limitations and supplies her with the satisfying simulacrum of
those stronger characteristics which she would otherwise look for in
man. You are not an egoist.”
He took her hand and removed her glove in spite of her resistance.
“Don’t struggle. You would only look ridiculous if any one should pass.
"Besides, it is useless. I am so much stronger. I do not know or care"
what really possessed you to indulge in such a freak as to engage
"yourself to four men at once,” he continued, slipping the ring on her"
"finger. “You had your joke, and I hope you enjoyed it. The dénouement"
"was highly dramatic. As I said, I desire no explanation, for I am never"
concerned with anything but results. And now—you are going to marry
me.”
"rays of living lightning, of which neither painter nor poet has any"
"true conception, . . long, dazzling rays such as encircled God's"
"maiden, Edris, with an arch of roseate effulgence, so that the very air"
was sunset-colored in the splendor of her presence! How if she were a
"wingless angel,--made woman?"
"""Glory is thine, and gladness, and the wings!"" And with the name of his"
angel-love upon his lips he closed his eyes and sank into a deep and
dreamless slumber.
CHAPTER XL.
IN THE CATHEDRAL.
"A booming, thunderous, yet mellow sound! a grand, solemn, sonorous"
"swing of full and weighty rhythm, striking the air with deep, slowly"
"measured resonance like the rolling of close cannon! Awake, all ye"
people!--Awake to prayer and praise! for the Night is past and sweet
"Morning reddens in the east, ... another Day is born,--a day in which"
"to win God's grace and pardon,--another wonder of Light, Movement,"
"Creation, Beauty, Love! Awake, awake! Be glad and grateful for the"
"present joy of life,--this life, dear harbinger of life to come! open"
"your eyes, ye drowsy mortals, to the divine blue of the beneficent sky,"
"the golden beams of the sun, the color of flowers, the foliage of"
"trees, the flash of sparkling waters!--open your ears to the singing of"
"birds, the whispering of winds, the gay ripple of children's laughter,"
"the soft murmurs of home affection,--for all these things are freely"
"bestowed upon you with each breaking dawn, and will you offer unto God"
"With a choked, inarticulate outcry the duke snatched bow and arrow"
"from the nearest sentry, and ere the Pisan could grasp the meaning of"
"what he saw, or prevent, he set and sped the bolt. A moan died on the"
"stillness. A form collapsed, shuddered and lay still."
"The duke dropped bow and arrow, staring like a madman, then rushed"
towards the prostrate form.
"Bending over it, a moan broke from his lips, as he threw his arms"
"about the lifeless clay of her he had loved in the days of yore, ere"
the honeyed treachery of the Frangipani had sundered and broken their
lives. The woman of the Red Tower had expiated her guilt.
He saw at once that no human agency might here avail. Death had been
instantaneous. The arrow had pierced the heart.
"The duke knelt long by her side, and the strong man's frame heaved"
"with convulsive sobs, as he closed the eyes and muttered an Ave for"
her untimely departed soul.
"When he arose, he looked into the pale face of Francesco, whose"
blood-stained sword and garments told a tale his lips would not. He
"understood without a word. Silently he extended his hand to the duke,"
"then, taking off his own mantle, he covered therewith the woman's"
body.
It was midnight when the Pisans and the duke's men groped their way
cautiously down the steep winding path to the shore. The Pisans made
"for their ships and Spoleto's men for the dusk of their native woods,"
carrying on a hurriedly constructed bier the body of the woman of the
Red Tower.
"gumming up their dope. Well, it's about time to plug in on E2. Here's"
"where the fireworks start!"" He closed the connections which transferred"
the central portion of the upper lookout screen to a small micrometer
screen at Breckenridge's desk and plugged it into the first
"check-station. Instantly a point of red light, surrounded by a vivid"
"orange circle, appeared upon the screen, low down and to the left of"
"center, and the timing galvanometer showed a wide positive deflection."
"""Hashed again!"" growled Breckenridge. ""I must be losing my grip,"
"I guess. I put everything I had on that sight, and missed it ten"
divisions. I think I'll turn in my badge--I've cocked our perfect curve
"already, before we got to the first check-station!"" His hands moved"
"toward the controls, to correct their course and acceleration."
"""As you were--hold everything! Lay off those controls!"" snapped the"
"computer. ""There's something screwy, just as I thought--and it isn't"
"you, either. I'm no pilot, of course, but I do know good compensation"
"when I see it, and if you weren't compensating that point I never saw it"
"done. Besides, with your skill and my figures I know darn well that we"
aren't off more than a tenth of one division. He's cuckoo! Don't call
"him--let him start it, and refer him to me."""
"""All x--I'll be only too glad to pass the buck. But I still think,"
"Steve, that you're playing with dynamite. Who ever heard of an"
"astronomer being wrong?"""
"""You'd be surprised,"" grinned the physicist, ""Since this fuss has"
"just started, nobody has tried to find out whether they were wrong"
"or not...."""
"""IPV _Arcturus_, attention!"" came from the speaker curtly."
firing in the distance.
Clear days and clear nights followed each other. Sometimes a train would
"stop in front of the C.C.S., hissing and puffing, and throwing up a"
"great shaft of light. We would curse it, fearing that it would attract"
German raiders.
If only the fine weather would come to an end! Give us wind and rain so
that we could lie in bed without being oppressed by anxiety! But the sun
continued to shine and the stars to glitter.
"The disaster that had befallen the adjoining C.C.S., which had been"
"brilliantly lit up during the raid, had acted as a warning example to"
us. At nightfall the windows of the theatre were screened with blankets
and no lights were allowed to show in the wards or on the duckboards.
If only the trains would halt somewhere else at night-time!
One day a number of Flemish peasants began to collect hop-refuse in the
surrounding fields. They made three great heaps of it and set fire to
"them. In the evening the heaps were burning brightly, but no one took"
any notice.
The canteen was crowded. All the benches were occupied and men who were
unable to find seats stood around in groups. There was noisy
conversation and singing and shouting. Nearly everyone was drinking
beer. Those who sat at the tables were playing cards. The air was thick
with tobacco-smoke. Two or three candles were burning on every table.
"And all at once, without any warning, the thunder was loosened upon us."
"There was an ear-splitting roar and in a moment candles were swept away,"
"benches and tables overturned, and the whole crowd of men was down on"
"the floor, trembling and panic-stricken. Another detonation, and then"
"purifying yourself from the lust of life, you will come unto that lake"
where all desire shall be washed away.
CHAPTER XX
'NOBLESSE OBLIGE'
"'Sooner shall the cleft rock reunite so as to make a whole, than"
may he who kills any living being be admitted into our
society.'--_Acceptance into the Monkhood._
It is very noticeable throughout the bazaars of Burma that all the beef
"butchers are natives of India. No Burman will kill a cow or a bullock,"
and no Burman will sell its meat. It is otherwise with pork and fowls.
Burmans may sometimes be found selling these; and fish are almost
"invariably sold by the wives of the fishermen. During the king's time,"
any man who was even found in possession of beef was liable to very
"severe punishment. The only exception, as I have explained elsewhere,"
"was in the case of the queen when expecting an addition to her family,"
"and it was necessary that she should be strengthened in all ways. None,"
"not even foreigners, were allowed to kill beef, and this law was very"
"stringently observed. Other flesh and fish might, as far as the law of"
"the country went, be sold with impunity. You could not be fined for"
"killing and eating goats, or fowls, or pigs, and these were sold"
"occasionally. It is now ten years since King Thibaw was overthrown, and"
"there is now no law against the sale of beef. And yet, as I have said,"
no respectable Burman will even now kill or sell beef. The law was
"founded on the beliefs of the people, and though the law is dead, the"
"Vance's attention, however, was riveted on what awaited at the end of"
"the stony walkway. It was a traditional teahouse, set in a grove of"
flowering azaleas. And standing in the doorway was a silver-haired
figure dressed in a formal black kimono. He was beckoning.
"""Did I neglect to tell you I prefer Japanese _cha-no-yu _to the usual"
"British afternoon tea?"" Tanzan Mino announced. ""It is a ritual designed"
"to renew the spirit, to cleanse the mind. It goes back hundreds of"
"years. I always enjoy it in the afternoon, and I find it has"
marvelously restorative powers. This seemed the ideal occasion for us
"to meet and chat."""
"""Don't want to slight tradition."" Vance slipped on the pair of wooden"
clogs that awaited at the bottom of the path.
"""My feelings entirely,"" the CEO continued, smiling as he watched him"
"approach. ""You understand the Japanese way, Dr. Vance, which is one"
"reason we have so much to discuss."""
He bowed a greeting as Vance deposited his clogs on the stepping stone
by the teahouse door. Together they stooped to enter.
A light murmur of boiling water came from a brazier set into the
"_tatami_-matted floor, but otherwise the room was caught in an ethereal"
"silence. The decor was more modern than most teahouses, with fresh"
cedar and pine for the ceiling and walls rather than the customary
"reed, bark, and bamboo."
Tanzan Mino gestured for him to sit opposite as he immediately began
"the formalities of ritually cleaning the bamboo scoop, then elevating"
the rugged white tea bowl like an ancient chalance and ceremonially
"was a curious hush--a new thing in their struggle, and one that seemed"
surcharged with calamity. After a moment Colonel Carmichael looked up.
"He was many years the senior of his companions, but just then there"
"seemed no difference in years between them. They were three wan,"
"haggard men, weakened with hunger, exhausted with sleepless watching."
That week had killed the youth in two of them.
"""Geoffries has just given me this,"" Carmichael said. ""It is a list of"
"our provisions. We have enough food, but there is no fresh water. The"
enemy has cut off the supply. We could not expect them to do
"otherwise."" He waited, and then, as neither spoke, he went on: ""I have"
"spoken with the others. You know, gentlemen, we can not go on another"
"twenty-four hours without water. We have made a good fight for it, but"
"this is the end. We must look the fact in the face."""
"""Surely they must know at headquarters what a state we are in--"""
Saunders began.
The Colonel shrugged his shoulders.
"""No doubt they know, but they can not help in time. This is not a"
petty frontier business. It is something worse--a rising with a leader.
"A rising with a leader is a lengthy business to tackle, and it"
"requires its victims. In this case we are the victims."" He smiled"
"grimly. ""We have only one thing left to do--make a dash for it while we"
have the strength. You must know as well as I do that there is
"scarcely anything worth calling a hope, but it's a more agreeable way"
of dying than being starved out like rats and then butchered like
"sheep. I know these devils."" He glanced around the shadowy room with a"
"curious light in his eyes. ""My best friend was murdered in this room,"""
"he added. ""Personally, I prefer a fair fight in the open."""
Then he saw a gleam of blue metal in Fraser's hands.
"""Give me that gun!"" he panted, but his deliverer held him off."
"""I may need it myself, and I ain't got but the one here! Let's get"
"Clyde out of this."""
"Stepping over the motionless form at his feet, Fraser lifted the young"
"club-man, who was huddled in a formless heap as if he had fallen from a"
"great height, and together the two dragged him toward _The Bedford"
"Castle_. As they went aboard, they were nearly run down by a body of"
reinforcements that Captain Peasley had finally mustered from between
"decks. Down the gang-plank and over the side they poured, grimy"
"stokers, greasy oilers, and swearing deckhands, equipped with"
"capstan-bars, wrenches, and marlin-spikes. Without waiting to observe"
"the effect of these new-comers, Boyd and Fraser bundled Alton into the"
"first cabin at hand, then turned back."
"""Better stay here and look after him. You're all in, yourself,"" the"
"adventurer advised. ""I'm going to hunt up George."""
"He was away on the instant, with Boyd staggering after him, still weak"
"and shaking, the vague discomfort of running blood at the back of his"
"neck, muttering thickly as he went: ""Give me your gun, Fraser! Give me"
"your gun!"""
"The battle was still raging when the police arrived, after an"
"interminable delay, and it ceased only at the rough play of"
"night-sticks, and after repeated charges of the uniformed men had"
"broken up the ranks of the strikers. The dock was cleared at length,"
"and wagon-loads of bleeding, struggling combatants rolled away to jail,"
union and non-union men bundled in together. But work was not resumed
"Let's see what our surroundings look like."""
"They walked to the nearest window-aperture, and gazed out on a"
startling and marvelous scene.
*       *       *       *       *
"Beneath their high tower window, extending as far as the eye could"
"reach, lay the city, lit by the reddish glare of the peculiar metal"
with which its streets were paved. For the most part the metropolis
consisted of perfectly square buildings pierced by many windows to
indicate that each housed a large number of inmates. But here and
"there grotesque turrets lanced the sky, and symbolic domes arched"
above the surrounding flat metal roofs.
One building in particular they noticed. This was an enormous
structure in the shape of a half-globe that reared its spherical
height less than an eighth of a mile from the building they were in.
"It was situated off to their right at the foot of a vast, high-walled"
enclosure whose near end seemed to be formed by the right wall of
their prison. They could only see it by leaning far out of the
window; and it would not have come to their attention at all had they
"not heard it first--or, rather, heard the sound of something within"
it: for from it came a curious whining hum that never varied in
"intensity, something like the hum of a gigantic dynamo, only greater"
and of a more penetrating pitch.
"""Sounds as though it might be some sort of central power station,"""
"said Brand. ""But what could it supply power for?"""
"""Give it up,"" said Dex. ""For their damned shock-tubes, perhaps, among"
"other things--"""
"abdomen slightly tumid; tenderness over lower half, especially"
on left side; the lower half moves little with respiration.
Twenty-four hours later the patient had improved. He was
comfortable and hopeful; slept well with morphia 1/3 grain
"hypodermically. Tongue moist, covered with white fur; has been"
"taking milk only, [Symbol: ounce]ij every half-hour. No"
sickness. Temperature
99°. Pulse 104. Respirations 24. Abdomen flatter; general
respiratory movement; tenderness now mainly localised to an
"area 2-1/2 inches in diameter, to the left of the umbilicus,"
above exit wound.
"The patient continued to improve, and on the fifth day"
travelled six hours in a bullock wagon to Bloemfontein. Soon
"after arrival his temperature was normal: pulse 80,"
"respirations 16, with good abdominal movement. Local tenderness"
"persisted in the same area, but was less in degree. Tongue"
"rather dry, bowels confined. Micturition normal. Two drachms of"
castor oil and an enema were given.
"On the ninth day patient was practically well, except for"
slight deep tenderness. He remained in bed on ordinary light
"diet, but at the end of the third week he was seized by a"
"sudden attack of pain, the temperature rising to 103° and the"
"pulse to 140, the abdomen becoming swollen and tender. He was"
"then under the charge of Mr. Bowlby, who ordered some opium,"
and the symptoms rapidly subsided. Although this wound crossed
"the small intestine area, it is probable that the symptoms may"
have been due to an injury of the rectum or sigmoid flexure.
disturbances Captain Peasley made his way shoreward from the ship to
"scan the scene, and the sight of his uniform excited the ire of the"
"strikers afresh. After a glance over the mob, he remarked to Emerson:"
"""Bli'me! It looks like a bloody riot already, doesn't it? Four hundred"
pounds to those dock wallopers! Huh! You know if I allowed them to
"bleed me that way--"""
"At that instant, from some quarter, a railroad spike whizzed past the"
"Captain's head, banging against the boards behind him with such a thump"
that the dignified Englishman ducked quickly amid a shout of derision.
He began to curse them roundly in his own particular style.
"""You'd better keep under cover, Captain,"" advised Emerson. ""They don't"
"seem to care for you."""
"""So it would appear,"" he agreed. ""They're getting nawsty, aren't they?"
"I hope it doesn't lawst."""
"""Well, I hope it does,"" said George Balt. ""If they'll only keep at it"

"It seemed that his wishes bade fair to be realized, for, as the day"
"wore on, instead of diminishing, the excitement increased. By evening"
it became so menacing that Boyd was forced to send in an urgent demand
"for a squadron of bluecoats to escort his men to their lodgings, and it"
was only by the most vigorous efforts that a serious clash was averted.
Nor was this task the easier since it did not meet with the approval of
"the fishermen themselves, who keenly resented protection of any sort."
"True to George's prediction, the next morning found the non union men"

Here El Sarria interrupted.
"""With respect,"" he said, ""it is true that this gentleman hath some"
private matters to communicate to me which have nothing to do with the
object of our mission. I crave your permission that for to-day I may
"dine apart with him!"""
After this there was no more to be said. El Sarria helped the sergeant
"to serve the meal, which was at once the proof of his foraging ability"
"and his consummate genius as a cook. For though the day was Friday, the"
soup was very far from _maigre_. The stew contained both lamb and fresh
pork cut into generous cubes with a sufficiency of savoury fat included.
A sausage had been sliced small for seasoning and the whole had been so
"smothered in _garbanzos_, haricot beans, rice, mixed with strips of"
"toothsome salt fish, that John Mortimer bent and said a well-deserved"
blessing over the viands.
"""I don't usually in this country,"" he explained, ""but really this is"
what my good old father would call a manifest providence. That fellow of

"and fight as well as he can cater and cook."""

Against the class-interest behind the East India Company the republican
"party, as led and represented by De Witt, were strongly arrayed. They"
could point to the expansion of the Greenland whaling trade that had
followed on the abolition of the original monopoly in that adventure--an
increase of from ten to fifteen times the old quantity of
product[818]--and the treatise expounding their policy strongly
condemned the remaining monopolies of all kinds. But there was no
sufficient body of enlightened public opinion to support the attack; and
the menaced interests spontaneously turned to the factor which could
best maintain them against such pressure--the military power of the
"House of Orange. The capitalist monopolists and ""imperialists"" of the"
republic were thus the means first of artificially limiting its economic
"basis, and later of subverting its republican constitution--a disservice"
"which somewhat outweighs the credit earned by them, as by the merchant"
"oligarchies of Venice, for an admirable management of their army.[819]"
"""And you have no further thought of her?"" she asked."
"""As far as marriage is concerned, no,"" I responded.  ""Nevertheless, I"
still regard her as an intimate friend.  I was here only two or three
"hours ago chatting with her."""
"""You!"" she cried, glaring at me strangely.  ""You were here--to-day?"""
"""Yes,"" I replied.  ""I thought she would certainly tell you of my visit."""
"""She told me nothing.  I was quite unaware of it.  I was out, and the"
"servants told me that a gentlemen had called in my absence."""

"thorns? If we could gather the flowers and find no thorns, we should not"
"care for them. The more the thorns, the more valuable the blossoms.'"
"So they said, and they gathered the blossoms, and they faded. But the"
thorns did not fade; they were ever there. The more blossoms a man had
"gathered, the more thorns he had to wear, and Time was ever behind him."
"They wanted to rest in the glades, but Time willed that ever they must"
"go forward; no going back, no rest, ever and ever on. So they grew very"
weary.
"'These flowers,' they said at last, 'are always the same. We are tired"
of them; their smell is heavy; they are dead. This forest is full of
thorns only. How shall we escape from it? Ever as we go round and round
"we hate the flowers more, we feel the thorns more acutely. We must"
"escape! We are sick of Time and his whip, our feet are very, very weary,"
"our eyes are dazzled and dim. We, too, would seek the Peace. We laughed"
at those before who went along the rocky path; we did not want peace;
but now it seems to us the most beautiful thing in the world. Will Time
never cease to drive us on and on? Will these lights _never_ cease to
flash to and fro?'
Each man at last will turn to the straight road. He will find out. Every
"man will find out at last that the forest is hateful, that the flowers"
"are deadly, that the thorns are terrible; every man will learn to fear"
Time.
"Then, when the longing for peace has come, he will go to the straight"
way and find it; no man will remain in the forest for ever. He will
"learn. When he is very, very weary, when his feet are full of thorns,"
"and his back scarred with the lashes of Time--great, kindly Time, the"
schoolmaster of the world--he will learn.

"He took the drop easily, riding the log with that perfect balance which"
is second nature to the seasoned riverman. When the timber bumped
"against the rapidly forming jam, Curly leaped again, thrusting the log"
"down as he did so, and landed on the solid barrier. Scrambling lightly"
"over to the face of this, he thrust deftly with his peavey into the"
"mass, and began to work desperately to loosen the key log--that first"
"upended stick of pine which had started the whole trouble, and which"
must be started before the rest of the barrier would give.
"He got a good hold on it, but the thing defied his efforts to tear it"
"loose. It was wedged too tightly for even his great strength, and,"
"though he seemed to feel it move slightly, he strained his muscles to"
the utmost in vain to accomplish anything further. Presently he
"realized, with a thrill, that the jam was piling up behind him faster"
"and faster. He ceased his efforts, and clamping the peavey on timber"
"above the key log, pried it free, and sent it bobbing downstream."
"Another followed, and another still. Sweat poured in streams from him,"
"trickling blindingly into his eyes, but he did not stop to wipe it away."
"There was no time. He must go on doing his best till help came, or"
else----
A faint jar shook the jam. A second later Curly felt a hand lightly
touch his shoulder. A familiar voice sounded in his ear:
"“Good work, son! Where’s that trouble maker? Oh, I see. Let me drop down"
"to that ledge, where I can get a good hold. That’s the idea. Now grip"
"her above me. Fine! Ready, now? Yank away!”"
"It was Bainbridge--swift, agile, incredibly fresh considering what he"
had accomplished that day. For a moment or two Curly did not realize

frontier. These posts were already in difficulties owing to the
Raiders' interference with their commissariat.
"As can be imagined there was a great deal of noise, the native"
drivers gesticulating and talking in a way which proved that
something was afoot. I got out of the car and asked who was in charge
"of the caravan. A huge native contractor was pointed out to me, and,"
summoning him to my side I asked him what all the hubbub was about.
He was in a state of great agitation and told me that he had received
information from several reliable sources that the whole of the
"countryside ahead of them was in the hands of the Raiders, and that,"
"therefore, it was useless to go a step further."
"I expostulated with the man, pointing out that, by the terms of his"
"contract, he must go on, and that if he did not the soldiers for whom"
he was bringing supplies would die of starvation.
But he was dogged. He knew too well the methods of the Raiders with
the men they captured.
"""It's no use, Sahib,"" he said, respectfully but firmly. ""My men will"
"not go on as they are unarmed, and a single armed Raider is enough to"
"hold up the whole caravan."""
"I knew the man was right, but persisted in my efforts to persuade him"
"to chance it, pointing out that he might be lucky enough to elude the"
Raiders and to win through.

"within my experience. I saw before me the puffed, degraded face of one"
to whom I had given chance after chance of redeeming himself from
"thraldom to the whisky bottle, one who had promised again and again to"
"amend his ways. At last, wearied, I had cast him out. He had been"
"looking after an important shipbuilding district, had conspicuous"
"ability and knowledge, the support of a faithful wife. But nothing"
"availed to save him from himself. ""Give me five minutes alone with"
"your prisoner,"" I said to Dawson, ""and I will give you the spy you"
"seek."""
"I had asked for five minutes, but two were sufficient for my purpose."
"The draughtsman had been obstinate with Dawson, seeking loyally to"
"shield his wretched brother-in-law, but when he found that I had the"
"missing thread in my hands, he gave in at once. ""What relation is ----"
"to your wife?"" I asked. He had risen at my entrance, but the question"
"went through him like a bullet; his pale face flushed, he staggered"
"pitifully, and, sitting down, buried his face in his hands. ""You may"
"tell the truth now,"" I said gently. ""We can easily find out what we"
"must know, but the information will come better from you."""
"""He is my wife's brother,"" murmured the man."
"""You knew that he was no longer in my service?"""
"""Yes, I knew."""
"I might fairly have asked why he had used my name, but refrained. One"
"can readily pardon the lapses of an honest man, terrified at finding"
"himself in the coils of the police, clinging to the good name of his"

expectorated some blood at the end of about ten minutes after
"being shot, and experienced a 'half-choking sensation.' A small"
quantity of phlegm and occasional clots had been expectorated
since. He had walked about a good deal; movement occasioned
"cough, and he became 'blown' very rapidly."
On admission there were signs of fluid in the lower third of
"the pleural cavity, but no general symptoms beyond an evening"
rise of temperature to an average of 99°. About the twentieth
"day the temperature commenced to rise, and on the twenty-third"
and four following evenings reached 102°. The fever was
"accompanied by some distress, and a well-marked increase in the"
physical signs of the presence of fluid in the chest. The pulse
"rose to 96, and the respirations considerably above the average"
"of 24, which was at first noted. A strictly expectant attitude"
"was maintained, and the temperature steadily fell in a curve"
"corresponding to the rise, gradually reaching the normal at the"
end of a week. The physical signs at the base steadily cleared
"up, and at the end of six weeks the patient returned to England"

THE PLATES
The process of electrotyping is one of the most interesting steps in
"the making of a book, and authors will find it well worth while to"
brave the grime of the black-lead in order to become familiar with the
"detail. In brief, the type form is pressed down into a tablet made of"
"wax or similar substance, in which it leaves an impression. This wax"
"tablet is then allowed to remain in a galvanic bath, through which it"
"becomes covered with a coating of copper. When separated from the wax,"
"the thin, copper replica of the composed type is backed up by an alloy,"
"and, after passing through various stages in finishing, finally becomes"
an electrotype plate.[39]

“But do not let us think of these things--it is so warm here.”
"The touch of the affectionate hands, the childlike caress of the girl,"
"the confidence and the clinging of her warm body to him, thrilled him."
She was in all the fresh beauty of her young womanhood; and the simple

her skin and pronounced the delicacy of her colour and the richness of

"that held his young years, even as he sat there in the thrill of his"
"sweetest memories, he vaguely felt the gentle presence of these simple"

"Failure was written across them all. The coats were, if anything, more"
faded; the shoes more worn; the eyes alone lit up with the wonted glow
of delight in art. A little praise was their rich barmecidal feast.

openings were included within a length of 2-1/2 inches. There
was no surrounding ecchymosis of the bowel wall. Very little
escaped intestinal contents were found in the situation of the
"bowel. The latter had apparently been retracted upwards, and"
lay to the left of the lumbar spine. The wounds were readily
"closed by five Lembert's sutures, three crossing the openings,"
and one at each end. The belly was then washed out with boiled
water and closed. The delay in finding the wounds due to the
mistaken impression that they would be found in the pelvis
"materially prolonged the operation, which lasted an hour and a"
"half. The patient never rallied, and died seventeen hours"
later. It is possible that a wound in the sigmoid flexure was
present which had already closed at the time of operation.

"tears, my thoughts were all of the past, my anguish of heart"

that I had given her in Brussels long ago--seemed to be the only reality
in all that hideous phantasmagoria of events.
"""Do not despair,"" murmured the kind voice of my old friend, standing"
"opposite me on the other side of the bed.  ""You loved her once, but it"

In that moment the memory of the day when we had parted arose gaunt and

The train was running over the malarial-looking sea-plain--past the
"down-at-heel palm trees, past the mosque-looking buildings. At a level"
crossing the woman crossing-keeper darted out vigorously with her red
flag. And we rambled into the first village. It was built of sun-dried
"brick-adobe houses, thick adobe garden-walls, with tile ridges to keep"
off the rain. In the enclosures were dark orange trees. But the
"clay-coloured villages, clay-dry, looked foreign: the next thing to mere"
"earth they seem, like fox-holes or coyote colonies."
"Looking back, one sees Cagliari bluff on her rock, rather fine, with the"
thin edge of the sea's blade curving round. It is rather hard to believe
"in the real sea, on this sort of clay-pale plain."

But soon we begin to climb to the hills. And soon the cultivation begins
"to be intermittent. Extraordinary how the heathy, moor-like hills come"
near the sea: extraordinary how scrubby and uninhabited the great spaces
"of Sardinia are. It is wild, with heath and arbutus scrub and a sort of"
"myrtle, breast-high. Sometimes one sees a few head of cattle. And then"
"again come the greyish arable-patches, where the corn is grown. It is"
"like Cornwall, like the Land's End region. Here and there, in the"
"distance, are peasants working on the lonely landscape. Sometimes it is"
"one man alone in the distance, showing so vividly in his black-and-white"
"costume, small and far-off like a solitary magpie, and curiously"
distinct. All the strange magic of Sardinia is in this sight. Among the
"low, moor-like hills, away in a hollow of the wide landscape one"
"solitary figure, small but vivid black-and-white, working alone, as if"
"eternally. There are patches and hollows of grey arable land, good for"
corn. Sardinia was once a great granary.

The Helderberg is a transition epoch referred by some geologists
to the Silurian. The thin sandstones of the Oriskany mark an epoch
when waves worked over the deposits of former coastal plains. The
limestones of the Corniferous testify to a warm and clear wide sea
which extended from the Hudson to beyond the Mississippi. Corals
"throve luxuriantly, and their remains, with those of mollusks and"
"other lime-secreting animals, built up great beds of limestone."
"The bordering continents, as during the later Silurian, must now"
have been monotonous lowlands which sent down little of even the
finest waste to the sea.
In the Hamilton the clear seas of the previous epoch became
clouded with mud. The immense deposits of coarse sandstones and
"sandy shales of the Chemung, which are found off what was at the"
"time the west coast of Appalachia, prove an uplift of that ancient"
continent.
The Chemung series extends from the Catskill Mountains to
"northeastern Ohio and south to northeastern Tennessee, covering an"
area of not less than a hundred thousand square miles. In eastern
New York it attains three thousand feet in thickness; in
Pennsylvania it reaches the enormous thickness of two miles; but
it rapidly thins to the west. Everywhere the Chemung is made of
"thin beds of rapidly alternating coarse and fine sands and clays,"
"with an occasional pebble layer, and hence is a shallow-water"
deposit. The fine material has not been thoroughly winnowed from
"plucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and"
"shivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,"
"although his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with"
"the living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet"
infinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape
the scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered.

The grizzled general--there was also one who was gray--was thinking
that this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and
usually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his
ire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent
"than himself. And always orders of the ""Tell me how to kill that man"""
"rather than the ""Kill that man"" sort. The distinction bothered him"
obscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls
"which made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's"
right-minded leaders--even the Thinkers weren't certain which.
"The gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a"
"more turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and"
the dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.
He asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation
be in metal rather than flesh?
The austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such
pains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success
"with Buddhism. Sitting before his _guru_, his teacher, feeling the"
"Occidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had"
felt a little like this.

"In this connection, it is a good plan occasionally during the story"
"hour to introduce really good poetry which, delivered in a dramatic"
"manner (far removed, of course, from the melodramatic), might give"
children their first love of beautiful form in verse. And I do not
think it necessary to wait for this. Even the normal child of seven
(though there is nothing arbitrary in the suggestion of this age) will
appreciate the effect--if only on the ear--of beautiful lines well
"spoken. Mahomet has said, in his teaching advice: “Teach your children"
"poetry: it opens the mind, lends grace to wisdom and makes heroic"
virtues hereditary.”

"Now, in comparing this poem with some of the doggerel verse offered"
"to small children, one is struck with the literary superiority in the"
"choice of words. Here, in spite of the simplicity of the poem, there"
"is not the ordinary limited vocabulary, nor the forced rhyme, nor the"
"application of a moral, by which the artist falls from grace."

paramount. Tell him that I have studied my own heart as well as one
"can, and I know its weakness as well as I do its needs. That is why I"
"decline to hear his pleas, whatever they may be. I did not condemn him"
"through hearsay or doubtful evidence, and that is why I made no charge."
"But, since he persists in hearing what he already well knows, you may"
convey the matter.
"“Tell him that I entered the conservatory that evening from the rear,"
to cut a rose for my mother. Tell him I saw him and Miss Ashburton

Northern companies are finding some profit in exploiting such natural

"industry to large proportions seems probable, as several foreign"
corporations are experimenting on a considerable scale. Cocoanuts are
easily grown along both coasts of the Isthmus. A new grove takes about
"five years to come into bearing, costing an average of about three"
dollars a tree. Once established the trees bring in a revenue of about
"one dollar each at present prices and, as the demand for Panama"
"cocoanuts is steady, the industry seems to offer attractive"
"possibilities. The groves must be near the coast, as the cocoanut tree"
needs salt air to reach its best estate. Given the right atmospheric
conditions they will thrive where no other plant will take root. Growing
"at the edge of the sea, water transportation is easy."

Ten days after the injury the temperature was still rising to
"100°, and did not become normal till the fourteenth day. The"
"pulse averaged 80. The abdomen, meanwhile, moved fairly well,"
respirations 18 to 20. Some tenderness was present in the
epigastrium and towards the spleen. Resonance throughout.
"Ordinary diet was now resumed, and beyond slight epigastric"
"pain on deep inspiration, no further symptoms were observed,"
and the patient left for England at the end of the month. The
"spleen may have been traversed in this patient, as well as the"
lower margin of the right lung.
"(164*) Wounded at Enslin. _Entry_ (Mauser), 3/4 of an inch from"
"the spine, opposite the eighth intercostal space; _exit_,"
"through the seventh left costal cartilage, 1 inch from the"
median line. The patient was lying in the prone position when
"shot: he vomited blood freely, and the bowels acted three times"
"before he was seen forty hours after the accident, each motion"
to be blamed as her sins?
"To me the Yellow Peril cry, which is so often revived in some quarters"
"of the Continent, is either a sort of what we call 'guchi,' that is to"
"say, useless repetition of complaint of some unreasonable"
"disappointment, or a perpetuation of wicked instigation and selfish"
"intention. In either case, it is not at all a laudable action; indeed, I"
may say it is wasteful calumny for no material good will come of it
inasmuch as its object can never be achieved from the very condition of
the world. The people who entertain that idea would be doing far better
"service to their country, to the progress of civilisation, to the"
"general cause of humanity, if only they put aside such a silly notion,"
and busy themselves in teaching their fellow country-folks to accustom
themselves to the changed circumstances of the time. It would be a far
"more manly and noble act if they revised their old notions, which in a"
measure may be called prejudice.
"As to ourselves, the Japanese, we shall only be glad if we can enjoy a"
"peaceful and harmonious life in the happy family of the world, as we are"
"determined to do, in spite of all the obstacles which may be laid before"
us.

XI
THE INDO-CHINA QUESTION[1]
INTERVIEW WITH THE BARON SUYEMATSU
"""run"" across the mountains or beached on the desolate sands of"
Catalunia.
"""I am no inlander,"" he said, ""I am of the sea-coast of Tarragona. I have"
never been south of Tortosa in my life; but there does not live a man
who has conducted more good cigars and brandy to their destination than
"old Pépe of the Eleven Wounds!"""
The sergeant with grave courtesy reached him a well-rolled cigarette.
"""I have heard of your fame, brother,"" he said; ""even at Ronda and on the"
Madrid-Seville road your deeds are not unknown. But what of this venture
"to-night? Have you enough men, think you, to overpower the town watchmen"
"and the palace-guards?"""
The old gipsy tossed his bony hands into the air with a gesture of
incomparable contempt.
"""The palace guards are fled back to Madrid,"" he cried, ""and as to the"
"town watch they are either drunk or in their dotage!"""
Meantime the main body of the gipsies waited patiently in the
"background, and every few minutes their numbers were augmented by the"
arrival of others over the various passes of the mountains. These took
"their places without salutation, like men expected, and fell promptly to"
"listening to the conversation of the two great men, who sat smoking"
their cigarettes each on his own stone in the wide wild corrie among the
rocks of the Guadarrama which had been chosen as an appropriate
rendezvous.
"Singularly enough, after the sergeant had shown the scarlet mark of the"
"strangling ring about his neck, no one of all that company doubted for a"
and Gaspard bade him good-night in a cheery voice as they passed him.
The doorkeeper stood and watched the pair for a minute as they left the
Square and turned down a narrow street which led to the poorer part of
"the town, and thence to the quays. He heard Gaspard's high-pitched voice"
"and shrill laughter, and, in answer, Benham's thick tones and heavy"
"shout of drunken mirth. Once or twice these sounds repeated themselves,"
then they ceased; the footsteps of the Frenchman and his companion died
"away in the distance. The doorkeeper went on his way, thinking with"
"relief that Mr. Gaspard, for all his tall talk, was more at home with a"
bottle than with a knife or a bomb.
"Notwithstanding his dissipation, Gaspard was afoot very early in the"
"morning. It was hardly light, and the deep scratch of finger-nails on"
his face--it is so awkward when drunken fools wake at the wrong
minute--attracted no attention from the few people he encountered. He
"did not give them long to look at him, for he hurried swiftly through"
"the streets, towards the quays where the ships lay loading their"
"cargoes. He seemed to have urgent business to transact down there,"
"business that would brook no delay, and that was, if one might guess"
"from his uneasy glances over his shoulder, of a private nature. With one"
"hand he held tight hold of something in his trousers pocket, the other"
"rested on his belt, hard by a little revolver. In his business it is"
necessary to be ready for everything.
"Meanwhile Mr. Benham, having no affairs to trouble him, and no more"
"business to transact, stayed where he was."
CHAPTER XIX.
"Perhaps, after all, my jealousy might have been utterly unfounded."
"Sometimes I had thought I had treated her harshly, for, truth to tell, I"
had never obtained absolute proof that this man was more than a mere
"acquaintance.  Indeed, I think it was this fact, or just a slight twinge"
"of conscience, that caused a suspicion of the old love I once bore her"
to remain within me.  It was not just to Edith--that I knew; yet
"notwithstanding the denunciations of both Kaye and Anderson, I could not"
altogether crush her from my heart.  To wholly forget the woman for whom
"one has entertained the grand passion is often most difficult,"
"sometimes, indeed, impossible of accomplishment.  Visions of some sweet"
"face with its pouting and ready lips will arise, constantly keeping the"
"past ever present, and recalling a day one would fain forget.  Thus it"
was with me--just as it has been with thousands of others.
"""No,"" I admitted truthfully and honestly at last, ""my love for Yolande"
"is perhaps not altogether dead."""
"""Then you will render me a service?"" she cried quickly.  ""Say that you"
"will--for her sake!--for the sake of the great love you once bore her!"""
"""Of what nature is this service you desire?""  I asked, determined to act"
"with caution, for the startling stories I had heard had aroused within"
me considerable suspicion.
"""I desire your silence regarding an absolute secret,"" she answered in a"
hoarse half-whisper.
"""What secret?"""
"""A secret concerning Yolande,"" she responded.  ""Will you, for her sake,"
"render us assistance, and at the same time preserve absolute secrecy as"
"to what you may see or learn here to-day?"""
"him--namely, that the Regent and her daughter were by no means averse to"
"Holy Church, nor yet eager to keep the true King out of his own. But,"
"they were in the power of unscrupulous men--Mendizábal, Linares, and"
"others, who for their own ends published edicts and compelled the ladies"
"to sign them. If they were captured and sequestered for their own good,"
the ministry would break down and Don Carlos would reign undisturbed.
Rollo thought the exposition a marvel of clearness and point. It was
"somewhat disappointing, therefore, when he had finished to hear from"
"Cabrera the unmoved declaration: ""A Cristino is a Cristino whether in"
the palace of Madrid or on the mountains of Morella. And the quickest
"way is the best way with such an one, wherever met with!"""
"""But you do not mean to say that you would shoot the girl-Queen or the"
"mother-Regent if they fell into your hands?"" cried Rollo, aghast at the"
horror.
The deep underlying anger leaped up fiery red into the eyes of the
_guerrilla_ chief.
"""Aye, that would I,"" he cried, ""as quickly as they slew my own old"
"mother in the barrack yard of Tortosa!"""
"And thinking of that tragedy and the guilt of Nogueras, Rollo felt there"
"was something to be said for the indomitable, implacable little"
butcher-general of Don Carlos.
"Cabrera was silent for a while after making this speech, and then"
abruptly demanded of Rollo how many men he would require for his
undertaking.
"""I am bidden to place my entire command at your service,"" he said with"
"me--may the Devil take him!"""
(ANDREYEFF.)
Throughout the winter one question above all others was discussed by the
"few who took an interest in the war: ""What were the Germans going to"
"do?"" It was clear that they had been able to withdraw many divisions"
from their Eastern Front. Would they be numerically equal or superior to
the Allies on the Western Front?
"On the whole we were of opinion that, whatever happened, our positions"
"would prove impregnable, although we observed with some astonishment"
that there were no extensive trench systems or fortified places behind
our lines. I doubted whether the Germans would even attempt to break
through--I thought they would merely hold the Western Front and throw
"the Allies out of Macedonia, Palestine, and Mesopotamia."
The winter was over and the fine weather had set in. For several months
we had been working in a wood-yard and saw-mills. Our lives had become
"unspeakably monotonous, but the coming of warm days banished much of our"
dreariness. The hazy blue sky was an object of real delight. I often
contrived to slip away from my work and lean idly against a wall in the
mild sunshine. At times I was so filled with the sense of physical
"well-being, and so penetrated by the sensuous enjoyment of warmth and"
"colour, that I even forgot the war."
"At the bottom of the wood-yard was a little stream, and on the far bank"
clusters of oxlips were in bloom. Here we would lie down during the
midday interval and surrender to the charm of the spring weather. It
"seemed unnatural and almost uncanny that we should be happy, but there"
"were moments when we felt something very much like happiness. Moreover,"
"(170*) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1/2 inch to"
"the left of the second sacral spine; _exit_, immediately below"
the left anterior superior iliac spine; the patient was
"kneeling at the time, and the same bullet traversed his left"
"thigh in the lower third. When seen on the third day, the"
"lower part of the abdomen was motionless, tumid, and tender."
The bowels had been confined for three days; there had been no
"sickness, and the tongue was moist and clean. Temperature 100°,"
"pulse 90, fair strength, respirations 38. The patient had once"
"had an attack of acute appendicitis, and he himself said he was"
"sure he now had 'peritonitis,' as he had pain exactly similar"
in the belly to that he had suffered in his previous illness.
"No further signs, however, developed under an expectant"
"treatment, and he remained some two months in hospital, while"
the wound in the thigh and a third injury to the elbow-joint
were healing.
"(171) _Entry_ (Mauser), at the highest point of the left crista"
"ilii; _exit_, through the right ilium, 2 inches horizontally"
anterior to the posterior superior spine. Absolutely no
abdominal symptoms followed. The bowels were confined five
"days, and then opened by enema. The patient complained of some"
"stiffness in the lumbo-sacral region, but the right"
synchondrosis was no doubt implicated in the track.
(172) Wounded at Paardeberg (range 800 yards). _Entry_
"(Mauser), 2 inches diagonally below and to the right of the"
"umbilicus; _exit_, not discoverable. For the first two days the"
patient had to lie out with the regiment; on the fourth he was
removed to the Field hospital. During the first three days the
"patient vomited (green matter) frequently, and the belly was"
"""And so on it goes,"" he said, ""indicating that at some devilish"
distance--I've forgotten the figure but we had the master computer chew
it out on the big machine at Radiation once--an additional kilowatt
just shoves the signal coverage distance out by a micron. But if you
"don't put in your honest kilowatt, you don't excite the infraspace that"
"carries infrawaves. And if you put in a kilowatt and a half, you have"
"to dissipate the half."""
"Wilson grunted. ""Nice to have things come out even. Who'd have thunk"
that the Creator wanted the Terran kilowatt to equal one quanta of
"infrawave distance?"""
"Allison laughed. ""Poor argument, Commodore Wilson. Actually, the figure"
"is point nine, eight three four plus. Close, but no cigar. We've"
"just come to accept the figure as a kilowatt, just as for everyday"
"calculation we accept the less refined figure of two point, one eight"
"parsecs, or even two point, two. At any rate--"""
"There was a puff of something, and a sound like the puncture of a tire."
The green speckles on the dome merged with one another and became
a riot of flaming green. There were shouts and cries and a lot of
haphazard orders and several techs scrambled to snap toggle switches.
Down the room one of the techs went head-first into a rack with a pair
of pliers and a soldering iron. He backed out carrying a smoking little
shapeless thing that had lost any character it once possessed. The tech
"picked up a nice, shiny new doodad from a small box and went into the"
rack again. When he came out this time he gave a hoarse cheer. Toggles
were snapped back and the spreckles reappeared.
"One of the techs came up to Allison and said, ""See that spot up there,"
"sir? The one just this side of the eighty-one degree longitude circle,"
"the Field hospital three days, during which time he exhibited"
"no serious abdominal symptoms, but during the journey to Orange"
River (53-1/2 miles) he was sick. He remained at Orange River
"two days, and while there an enema was administered, producing"
a normal motion. The abdomen was slightly distended; it moved
"fairly, there was slight rigidity, but little tenderness."
"Temperature 100.8°, pulse 120. No appearance of fæces in wound."
When seen on the sixth day the condition was as
follows:--Patient cheerful and not in great pain. Temperature
"99.2°; pulse 120; respirations 48, very shallow. Abdomen soft,"
"moving freely, no distension or general tenderness. Fluid fæces"
escaping in abundance from the wound in loin. Redness of skin
"and swelling below level of wound, and cellular emphysema"
above. Fæcal-smelling fluid was also escaping from the thoracic
wound.
"The wound was enlarged, but the patient rapidly sank, and died"
of septicæmia on the seventh day.
(183*) An exactly similar case came under observation from the
"battle of Modder River, except that the opening in the loin was"
"somewhat larger, and earlier and freer escape of fæces took"
place from it. In this also fæcal matter passed freely into the
"left pleural cavity, and fæcal matter was expectorated, while"
there was an almost complete absence of abdominal symptoms.
Death occurred on the fourth day.
"No _post-mortem_ examination was made in either case, but I"
believe in both the extra-peritoneal aspect of the colon was
implicated and that the septicæmia was in great part due to
"absorption from the pleural rather than the peritoneal cavity,"
"pronounced it to be first-class petrol. There were seven drums, each"
containing four gallons.
"""This means we'll motor, not walk into Robat after all, sir,"" said"
"Allan, with a grin and sigh of relief. The thought of those miles of"
desert--nearly two hundred of them--which confronted us after the
mishap had been haunting us both like a nightmare.
"At this moment the _chokidar_ returned, in great trepidation, fearing"
a dressing-down for being absent from duty. But I was far too elated
at the turn of events to want to swear at anyone.
"I asked him where the petrol had come from, and whose it was. He"
"shook his head, and said he had no idea. It had always been there. It"
"belonged to no one, and no one had put it there, so far as he knew."
"He had never seen a car there before; in fact, he had never seen a"
"car anywhere before, and could not understand how it was that men"
"could travel on a thing which was not alive, which was not like any"
horse or camel he had ever seen.
"This was all very good hearing, so I proceeded to tell him that the"
"petrol belonged to me, and, as he quite cheerfully acquiesced, I gave"
him a receipt which he could show to any Government official in case
of needed absolution in the future. As we now had means to finish our
"journey by car, I decided to spend the night at the rest-house."
"After a simple camp meal Allan, worn out with the strenuous work of"
"the past two days and night, was quickly snoring in the deep sleep of"
"exhaustion, so I went for a stroll."
As I paced up and down I tried to draw up some preliminary plan
"for the coming campaign. But such occupation was somewhat futile,"
"perverse, sportsmen's brains tingled and thrilled; they had successfully"
"eluded all the resorts on the way, and arrived here without being caught."
"There was the Blue Peak, like a mast against the sky! They hurried up so"
fast that Solem was hardly able to keep pace with them. They would have
felt for ever disgraced if they had neglected to stand on this admirable
"site of a disaster, this most excellent abyss. Some said it would be a"
lifelong source of regret to them if they did not climb the Blue Peak
"forthwith; others had no desire but to gloat over the lawyer's death fall,"
"and to shout down the abyss, gaping at the echo, and advancing so far out"
on the ledge that they stood with their toes on death.
"But it's an ill wind that blows good to none, and the resort earned a"
"great deal of money. Paul began to revive again, and the furrows in his"
face were smoothed out. A man of worth grows strong and active with good
fortune; in adversity he is defiant. One who is not defiant in adversity
is worth nothing; let him be destroyed! Paul stopped drinking; he even
"began to take an interest in the harvesting, and worked in the field in"
Solem's place. If only he had begun when the weather was still slow and
patient!
But at least Paul began to tackle things in the right spirit again; he
only regretted that he had set aside for the cotters those outlying fields
from which they were used to getting half the hay; this year he would have
"liked to keep it himself. But he had given his word, and there was nothing"
to be done about it.
"Besides, it was raining now. Haymaking had to stop; they could not even"
"stack what had already been gathered. Outside, three cartloads of fodder"
were going to waste.

his shoulder.
"Boswell and Trent, each with a little missive burning his pocket, turned"
"red, fidgeted, glared at the ocean, and made no remark. Severance darted"
"a glance at each of the three in succession, and then looked at the"
ground with a contemplative stare. At this moment Mrs. Pendleton
appeared.
Three of the men advanced to meet her with an awkward attempt at
"surprise, but she waved them back."
"“I have something to say to you,” she said."
The cold languor of her face had given place to an expression of haughty
triumph. A gleam of conscious power lay deep in her scornful eyes. The
"final act in the drama had come, and the dénouement should be worthy of"
her talents. She looked like a judge who had smiled encouragement to a
guilty defendant only to confer the sentence of capital punishment at
last.
"“Gentlemen,” she said, and even her voice was judicatorial, “I have"
"asked you all to meet me here this morning”—(three angry starts, but"
she went on unmoved)—“because I came to the conclusion last night that
"it is quite time this farce should end. I am somewhat bored myself, and"
"I have no doubt you are so, as well. Your joke was a clever one, worthy"
of the idle days of autumn. When I received your four proposals by the
"same mail, I appreciated your wit—I will say more, your genius—and"
"felt glad to do anything I could to contribute to your amusement,"
especially as all the world is away and I knew how dull you must be. So
"I accepted each of you, as you know, had four charming interviews and"
one memorable one of a more composite nature; and now that we have all
agreed that the spicy and original little drama has run its length I
confinement of Sicily. Room--give me room--give me room for my spirit:
and you can have all the toppling crags of romance.
"So we ran on through the gold of the afternoon, across a wide, almost"
"Celtic landscape of hills, our little train winding and puffing away"
"very nimbly. Only the heath and scrub, breast-high, man-high, is too big"
"and brigand-like for a Celtic land. The horns of black, wild-looking"
cattle show sometimes.
"After a long pull, we come to a station after a stretch of loneliness."
"Each time, it looks as if there were nothing beyond--no more"
habitations. And each time we come to a station.
Most of the people have left the train. And as with men driving in a
"gig, who get down at every public-house, so the passengers usually"
alight for an airing at each station. Our old fat friend stands up and
"tucks his shirt-tail comfortably in his trousers, which trousers all the"
"time make one hold one's breath, for they seem at each very moment to be"
"just dropping right down: and he clambers out, followed by the long,"
brown stalk of a wife.
"So the train sits comfortably for five or ten minutes, in the way the"
"trains have. At last we hear whistles and horns, and our old fat friend"
running and clinging like a fat crab to the very end of the train as it
sets off. At the same instant a loud shriek and a bunch of shouts from
"outside. We all jump up. There, down the line, is the long brown stork"
"of a wife. She had just walked back to a house some hundred yards off,"
"for a few words, and has now seen the train moving."
"Now behold her with her hands thrown to heaven, and hear the wild shriek"
"""Madonna!"" through all the hubbub. But she picks up her two skirt-knees,"
and with her thin legs in grey stockings starts with a mad rush after
brother-in-law forbidden information from a loyal desire to help him
and with no knowledge of the base use to which it would be put. When
"detected, he had sought at any cost to shield him."
"""I will do my best to help you,"" I said."
"His head drooped down till it rested upon his bent arms, and he"
groaned and panted under the torture of tears. His was not the stuff
of which criminals are made.
"I found Dawson's chuckling joy rather repulsive. I felt that, being"
"successful, he might at least have had the decency to dissemble his"
satisfaction. He might also have given me some credit for the rapid
clearing up of the problem in detection. But he took the whole thing
"to himself, and gloated like a child over his own cleverness. I"
neither obtained from him thanks for my assistance nor apologies for
"his suspicions. It was Dawson, Dawson, all the time. Yet I found his"
egotism and unrelieved vanity extraordinarily interesting. As we sat
together in his room waiting for the Carlisle train to come in he
"discoursed freely to me of his triumphs in detection, his wide-spread"
"system of spying upon spies, his long delayed ""sport"" with some, and"
his ruthless rapid trapping of others. Men are never so interesting as
"when they talk shop, and as a talker of shop Dawson was sublime."
"""If,"" said Dawson, as the time approached for the closing scene, ""our"
much-wanted friend has himself handed in the parcel at Carlisle--he
"would be afraid to trust an accomplice--our job will be done. If not,"
I will pull a drag net through this place which will bring him up
within a day or two. What a fool the man is to think that he could
"escape the eye of Bill Dawson."""
"A policeman entered, laid a packet upon the table before us, and"
little resemblance to the fields of Aalu.

SYRIA.
The religions of Syria never had the same solidarity in the Occident as
those from Egypt or Asia Minor. From the coasts of Phoenicia and the
"valleys of Lebanon, from the borders of the Euphrates and the oases of the"
"desert, they came at various periods, like the successive waves of the"
"incoming tide, and existed side by side in the Roman world without uniting,"
in spite of their similarities. The isolation in which they remained and
the persistent adherence of their believers to their particular rites were
"a consequence and reflection of the disunited condition of Syria herself,"
where the different tribes and districts remained more distinct than
"anywhere else, even after they had been brought together under the"
domination of Rome. They doggedly preserved their local gods and Semitic
dialects.
It would be impossible to outline each one of these religions in detail at
"this time and to reconstruct their history, because our meager information"
"would not permit it, but we can indicate, in a general way, how they"
"penetrated into the Occidental countries at various periods, and we can try"
to define their common characteristics by showing what new elements the
Syrian paganism brought to the Romans.
"The first Semitic divinity to enter Italy was {104} _Atargatis_, frequently"
"mistaken for the Phoenician Astarte, who had a famous temple at Bambyce or"
"Hierapolis, not far from the Euphrates, and was worshiped with her husband,"
rotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a
"muted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until"
he could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.
*       *       *       *       *
"Remembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which he"
instantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate
level from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as
"quaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have"
had enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered
if he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth
"their relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would"
"send her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,"
that special power of his over her was reserved for far more important
purposes.
Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence
"into his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed."
No covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them
"unnecessary. He stepped into his clothing--the severe tunic, tights and"
sockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message
"tape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme"
"tablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly"
"planted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face"
broke into a smile.
"It had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making"
"up his life--and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of"
"his best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving"
"technique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as"
somno-learning.
"The Syrians' love of lucre was proverbial. Active, compliant and able,"
"frequently little scrupulous, they knew how to conclude first small deals,"
"then larger ones, everywhere. Using the special talents of their race to"
"advantage, they succeeded in establishing themselves on all coasts of the"
"Mediterranean, even in {108} Spain.[12] At Malaga an inscription mentions a"
corporation formed by them. The Italian ports where business was especially
"active, Pozzuoli, Ostia, later Naples, attracted them in great numbers. But"
they did not confine themselves to the seashore; they penetrated far into
"the interior of the countries, wherever they hoped to find profitable"
trade. They followed the commercial highways and traveled up the big
"rivers. By way of the Danube they went as far as Pannonia, by way of the"
Rhone they reached Lyons. In Gaul they were especially numerous. In this
new country that had just been opened to commerce fortunes could be made
rapidly. A rescript discovered on the range of the Lebanon is addressed to
"sailors from Arles, who had charge of the transportation of grain, and in"
of his relinquished hopes—and cried aloud profane words of holy
rapture.
"From the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving, snowy,"
"fluttering, wonderful, divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy."
"By came a citizen, rotund, comfortable, home-hurrying, unknowing of the"
delights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly-lit parks.
"“Will you oblige me with the time, sir?” asked the young man; and the"
"citizen, shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe, dragged it out and"
announced:
"“Twenty-nine and a half minutes past eight, sir.”"
"And then, from habit, he glanced at the clock in the tower, and made"
"Usually, however, the peasants of the South have left off the costume."
"Usually it is the invisible soldiers' grey-green cloth, the Italian"
"khaki. Wherever you go, wherever you be, you see this khaki, this"
"grey-green war-clothing. How many millions of yards of the thick,"
"excellent, but hateful material the Italian government must have"
"provided I don't know: but enough to cover Italy with a felt carpet, I"
should think. It is everywhere. It cases the tiny children in stiff and
"neutral frocks and coats, it covers their extinguished fathers, and"
sometimes it even encloses the women in its warmth. It is symbolic of
"the universal grey mist that has come over men, the extinguishing of all"
"bright individuality, the blotting out of all wild singleness. Oh"
democracy! Oh khaki democracy!
*       *       *       *       *
This is very different from Italian landscape. Italy is almost always
"dramatic, and perhaps invariably romantic. There is drama in the plains"
"of Lombardy, and romance in the Venetian lagoons, and sheer scenic"
excitement in nearly all the hilly parts of the peninsula. Perhaps it is
the natural floridity of lime-stone formations. But Italian landscape is
"really eighteenth-century landscape, to be represented in that"
romantic-classic manner which makes everything rather marvelous and very
"topical: aqueducts, and ruins upon sugar-loaf mountains, and craggy"
ravines and Wilhelm Meister water-falls: all up and down.
"Sardinia is another thing. Much wider, much more ordinary, not"
"up-and-down at all, but running away into the distance. Unremarkable"
"ridges of moor-like hills running away, perhaps to a bunch of dramatic"
"peaks on the southwest. This gives a sense of space, which is so lacking"
"in Italy. Lovely space about one, and traveling distances--nothing"
"finished, nothing final. It is like liberty itself, after the peaky"
"have gained admission by some secret passage!"""
With Rollo Blair to think was to act. So in another moment he had
"slipped off his shoes, and treading noiselessly on his stocking soles"
and with a naked sword in his hand he made his way swiftly and carefully
down towards the place whence he had heard the noise.
Descending by the grand _escalier_ he found himself in one of the narrow
corridors which communicated by private staircases with the left wing of
the palace. Rollo stood still in the deepest shadow. He was sure that he
"could hear persons moving near him, and once he thought that he could"
distinguish the sound of a muttered word.
The Egyptian darkness about him grew more and more instinct with noises.
"There was a scuffling rustle, as of birds in a chimney, all over the"
basement of the house. A door creaked as if a slight wind had blown it.
"Then a latch clicked, and the wind, unaided, does not click latches."
Rollo withdrew himself deeper into a niche at the foot of the narrow
winding-stair which girdled a tower in the thickness of the wall.
"The young man had almost resolved to summon his whole force from above,"
so convinced was he that the enemy had gained a footing within the tower
"and were creeping up to take them in the rear, when a sound altered his"
intention. There is nothing more unmistakable to the ear than the
rebellious whimper of an angry child compelled to do something against
its will.
Rollo instantly comprehended the whole chain of circumstances. The
treachery touched him more nearly than he had imagined possible. Those
for whom he and his party were imperilling their lives were in fact to
leave them to perish as best they might in the empty shell of the
palace. The royal birds were on the point of flying.
"Louvain objected, 'if you do not really approve of any of them?' And"
"Erasmus answers with Horace's word: 'In the first place, because I"
cannot sleep'.
"A sleepless energy, it was that indeed. He cannot rest. Still half"
"seasick and occupied with his trunks, he is already thinking about an"
"answer to Dorp's letter, just received, censuring the _Moria_. We should"
"fully realize what it means that time after time Erasmus, who, by"
"nature, loved quiet and was fearful, and fond of comfort, cleanliness"
"and good fare, undertakes troublesome and dangerous journeys, even"
"voyages, which he detests, for the sake of his work and of that alone."
"He is not only restless, but also precipitate. Helped by an incomparably"
retentive and capacious memory he writes at haphazard. He never becomes
anacoluthic; his talent is too refined and sure for that; but he does
repeat himself and is unnecessarily circumstantial. 'I rather pour out
"than write everything,' he says. He compares his publications to"
"parturitions, nay, to abortions. He does not select his subjects, he"
"tumbles into them, and having once taken up a subject he finishes"
"without intermission. For years he has read only _tumultuarie_, up and"
down all literature; he no longer finds time really to refresh his mind
"by reading, and to work so as to please himself. On that account he"
envied Budaeus.
"'Do not publish too hastily,' More warns him: 'you are watched to be"
"caught in inexactitudes.' Erasmus knows it: he will correct all later,"
he will ever have to revise and to polish everything. He hates the
"labour of revising and correcting, but he submits to it, and works"
"passionately, 'in the treadmill of Basle', and, he says, finishes the"
work of six years in eight months.
In that recklessness and precipitation with which Erasmus labours there
"and kicked the world about like a football, and striven to dig up the"
roots of the Universe--the Why and the Wherefore and the Whence and the
Whither.”
Netherby sighed:
"“Ah, Noll, the old room is gone. I have to begin all over again. These"
stiff prude seats compel me to order--tell me harshly that I must not
"be dreaming overmuch, nor thinking--which is next door to dreaming--but"
"nag me to be up and doing, boiling pots or eggs or hitting something"
or pushing at things. I don’t seem to fit in anywhere. The medieval
rigours warn me to be done with visions and the reading of the visions
of others; and their hard oaken seats rise up and assault me where I
would sit upon them.... But that is nothing. They have left me not even
my books. I am bewildered--bewildered--wholly bewildered.”
"He sighed sadly, and went on:"
"“Ah, Noll, he only knows the whole delight of having possessed a"
child who has lost it.... Books are one’s most intimate friends--they
never change--never play us a shabby trick. How they eat into one’s
"friendship, each dressed in his individual habit! the very ugliness"
of some a reason for seeking to win their confidence; perhaps a
reason for an easy familiarity--we dog-ear them the more--mark them
"the more--love them the more. Put them in handsome ranks uniform, and"
their individuality is gone--like sisters that are primly arrayed to
the same pattern to simper through a tedious garden-party. We begin to
find faults where was once only affection; and their outward seeming
"being now alike, like critics we seek to taste not the delights"
"within, but carp because this has not Shakespeare’s wit nor that the"
"thunders and the music of Carlyle. These that were once our closest,"
"most garrulous, most intimate friends have gone to join the silent"
"the girls seeking orchids, nor the hunter after his prey, dared to"
trespass upon that enchanted ground.
"'What would happen,' I asked once, 'if anyone went into that wood? Would"
"he be killed, or what?'"
"And I was told that no one could tell what would happen, only that he"
"would never be seen again alive. 'The Nats would confiscate him,' they"
"said, 'for intruding on their privacy.' But what they would do to him"
after the confiscation no one seemed to be quite sure. I asked the
"official who was with me, a fine handsome Burman who had been with us in"
"many fights, whether he would go into the wood with me, but he declined"
"at once. Enemies are one thing, Nats are quite another, and a very much"
"more dreadful thing. You can escape from enemies, as witness my"
"companion, who had been shot at times without number and had only once"
"been hit, in the leg, but you cannot escape Nats. Once, he told me,"
"there were two very sacrilegious men, hunters by profession, only more"
"abandoned than even the majority of hunters, and they went into this"
"wood to hunt 'They didn't care for Nats,' they said. They didn't care"
"for anything at all apparently. 'They were absolutely without reverence,"
"worse than any beast,' said my companion."
"So they went into the wood to shoot, and they never came out again. A"
"few days later their bare bones were found, flung out upon the road near"
the enchanted wood. The Nats did not care to have even the bones of such
"scoundrels in their wood, and so thrust them out. That was what happened"
"to them, and that was what might happen to us if we went in there. We"
did not go.
Though the Nats of the forest will not allow even one of their beasts to
"be slain, the Nats of the rivers are not so exclusive. I do not think"
fish are ever regarded in quite the same light as animals. It is true
It may be added that neither in the one Lagoon nor in the other are
"there any private, proprietary rights to coral outcrops. The whole"
"community of Sinaketa have their fishing grounds in the Lagoon,"
"within which every man may hunt for his spondylus shell, and catch"
"his fish at times. If the other spondylus fishing community, the"
"Vakutans, encroached upon their grounds, there would be trouble,"
"and in olden days, fighting. Private ownership in coral outcrops"
"exists in the Northern villages of the Lagoon, that is in Kavataria,"
and the villages on the island of Kayleula.
III
We must now follow the later stages of the kaloma industry. The
technology of the proceedings is so mixed up with remarkable
sociological and economic arrangements that it will be better to
indicate it first in its main outlines. The spondylus consists of a
"shell, the size and shape of a hollowed out half of a pear, and of a"
"flat, small lid. It is only the first part which is worked. First"
it has to be broken into pieces with a binabina or an utukema
(green stone imported from Woodlark Island) as shown on Plate L
"(A). On each piece, then, can be seen the stratification of the"
"shell: the outside layer of soft, chalky substance; under this, the"
"layer of red, hard, calcareous material, and then the inmost, white,"
crystalline stratum. Both the outside and inside have to be rubbed
"off, but first each piece has to be roughly rounded up, so as to form"
"a thick circular lump. Such a lump (see foregrounds of Plates L (A),"
L (B)) is then put in the hole of a cylindrical piece of wood. This
latter serves as a handle with which the lumps are rubbed on a piece
of flat sandstone (see Plate L (B)). The rubbing is carried on so far
"""My lord,"" he said, ""I have to thank you for many acts of kindness and"
"courtesy, and a certain liberality of treatment which I have received at"
"your hands and within your doors.  In taking my farewell, I wish freely"
to acknowledge all this debt.  But other matters which I need not
"specify, yet which are well understood by your lordship, have transpired"
to change the relations betwixt us; and I wish to add that I desire to
be beholden to no man.  In the rooms allotted to me in your lordship’s
"house there is a quantity of wearing apparel, jewels, trinkets, for"
"which I have no more use.  I pray you have them sold, and the amount"
thus realized will reimburse you for all charges you have been at in my
maintenance during the time I have dwelt beneath your roof. That is all
"I have to say.—Gentlemen, I wish you a very good day."""
"And lifting his hat with quiet dignity and grace, Grey made them a"
general salute and turned upon his heel.
"But Lord Sandford’s voice came thundering after him. ""Do you desire to"
"insult me, sir?  Am I a beggarly inn-keeper, that I should sell a"
guest’s belongings to pay my bill?  What do you mean by such words?  Do
"you desire that I should demand satisfaction for them at your hands?"""
Grey did not know whether this man desired to fasten a quarrel upon him
"or not, and, truth to tell, he did not care.  He just turned his head"
"over his shoulder, and threw back an answer in tones of scarcely veiled"
contempt.
"""That is for your lordship to decide.  I shall have pleasure in giving"
"any satisfaction demanded at any time, and in any place appointed.  For"
"the rest, a man who has sought to compass the death of a comrade by a"
foul trick need scarcely fear to soil his hands by the touch of his
"gold.  Again I wish you good-day, my lord."""
beliefs remain.
It is true that the taking of life is against Buddhist commands. No life
at all may be taken by him who adheres to Buddhistic teaching. Neither
"for sport, nor for revenge, nor for food, may any animal be deprived of"
the breath that is in it. And this is a command wonderfully well kept.
"There are a few exceptions, but they are known and accepted as breaches"
"of the law, for the law itself knows no exceptions. Fish, as I have"
"said, can be obtained almost everywhere. They are caught in great"
"quantities in the river, and are sold in most bazaars, either fresh or"
salted. It is one of the staple foods of the Burmese. But although they
"will eat fish, they despise the fisherman. Not so much, perhaps, as if"
"he killed other living things, but still, the fisherman is an outcast"
from decent society. He will have to suffer great and terrible
punishment before he can be cleansed from the sins that he daily
"commits. Notwithstanding this, there are many fishermen in Burma."
A fish is a very cold-blooded beast. One must be very hard up for
something to love to have any affection to spare upon fishes. They
"cannot be, or at all events they never are, domesticated, and most of"
them are not beautiful. I am not aware that they have ever been known to
"display any attachment to anyone, which accounts, perhaps, for the"
comparatively lenient eye with which their destruction is contemplated.
"For with warm-blooded animals it is very different. Cattle, as I have"
"said, can never be killed nor their meat sold by a Burman, and with"
other animals the difficulty is not much less.
"I was in Upper Burma for some months before the war, and many a time I"
could get no meat at all. Living in a large town among prosperous
"people, I could get no flesh at all, only fish and rice and vegetables."
"When, after much trouble, my Indian cook would get me a few fowls, he"
He was near singing more than once. The place was astir with the sound
"of Betty’s skirts, the echo of her gaiety, the sound of her light"
footstep. The air was sweet with the breath of her uncomplaining
good-nature.
"He shut up the bag, tied a label upon it, put on his cloak and hat,"
"blew out the candle, and softly let himself out of the room."
In the darkness Noll stood upon the bridge at the end of the Boule
"Miche, the pleasant highway of youth. But he now knew no indecisions."
He realized that his mere intellect had led him into the veriest
pedantries--had nearly led him into irretrievable blunders. He saw that
"man’s highest was rooted in the body, that heaven was no fantastic"
"dream, but here and now for the winning on this healthy brown earth."
"He had been letting it slip by him, whilst he dreamed of pasteboard"
nothingnesses.
He realized that the emotion felt was nearer to the centre of life than
"all thought. He cast from him the devil of mere intellect, and it went"
"out of him demurely into the darkness, like some poor thin-souled nun,"
who crushes down into barrenness the splendid emotions of the life
"within her which are her very godhood, in fantastic hope to win an"
"eternity of vague bliss, she who by the very act shows her inability"
"to enjoy bliss--for, heaven and hell and all the eternities shall"
yield her no such bliss as the dear human loves may do--the æons of
immortality shall never bring her the delight that she might know in an
hour of a lover’s embrace or the dear touch of a nestling child at her
lean breasts.
"As the awakened youth stood there, the black night passed over the edge"
churches were ringing; some had services. I had to push my way to
reach Herr Krapp's house in time; but once there the crowd of passers
"served my purpose by screening me, as I loitered, from farther remark;"
"while I took care, by posting myself in a doorway opposite the window,"
to make it easy for any one who expected me to find me.
And then I waited with my heart beating. The clocks were striking a
"half after seven when I took my place, and for a time I stood in a"
"ferment of excitement, now staring with bated breath at the casement,"
"where I had seen Marie, now scanning all the neighbouring doorways,"
and then again letting my eyes rove from window to window both of
Krapp's house and the next one on either side. As the latter were
"built with many quaint oriels, and tiny dormers, and had lattices in"
"side-nooks, where one least looked to find them, I was kept expecting"
"and employed. I was never quite sure, look where I would, what eyes"
were upon me.
"But little by little, as time passed and nothing happened, and the"
"strollers all went by without accosting me, and no faces save strange"
"ones showed at the windows, the heat of expectation left me. The chill"
of disappointment took its place. I began to doubt and fear. The
clocks struck eight. The sun had been down an hour. Half that time I
had been waiting.
"To remain passive was no longer bearable, and sick of caution, I"
"stepped out and began to walk up and down the street, courting rather"
than avoiding notice. The traffic was beginning to slacken. I could
see farther and mark people at a distance; but still no one spoke to
"me, no one came to me. Here and there lights began to shine in the"
"houses, on gleaming oak ceilings and carved mantels. The roofs were"
growing black against the paling sky. In nooks and corners it was
"dark. The half-hour sounded, and still I walked, fighting down doubt,"
stood beside Socrates. And Beatus Rhenanus devotes to him a life of
earnest admiration and helpfulness that was to prove of much more value
than these exuberant panegyrics. There is an element of national
exaltation in this German enthusiasm for Erasmus: it is the violently
stimulated mood into which Luther's word will fall anon.
"The other nations also chimed in with praise, though a little later and"
"a little more soberly. Colet and Tunstall promise him immortality,"
"Étienne Poncher exalts him above the celebrated Italian humanists,"
Germain de Brie declares that French scholars have ceased reading any
"authors but Erasmus, and Budaeus announces that all Western Christendom"
resounds with his name.
This increase of glory manifested itself in different ways. Almost every
"year the rumour of his death was spread abroad, malignantly, as he"
"himself thinks. Again, all sorts of writings were ascribed to him in"
"which he had no share whatever, amongst others the _Epistolae obscurorum"
virorum_.
"But, above all, his correspondence increased immensely. The time was"
long since past when he asked More to procure him more correspondents.
"Letters now kept pouring in to him, from all sides, beseeching him to"
reply. A former pupil laments with tears that he cannot show a single
note written by Erasmus. Scholars respectfully sought an introduction
"from one of his friends, before venturing to address him. In this"
"respect Erasmus was a man of heroic benevolence, and tried to answer"
"what he could, although so overwhelmed by letters every day that he"
"hardly found time to read them. 'If I do not answer, I seem unkind,'"
"says Erasmus, and that thought was intolerable."
"We should bear in mind that letter-writing, at that time, occupied more"
"or less the place of the newspaper at present, or rather of the literary"
plunder the palace from top to bottom and to give all within the
neighbouring town of San Ildefonso to the sword.
"The programme, as thus baldly announced, was indeed one to strike all"
"men with horror, even those who had been hardened by years of"
fratricidal warfare in which quarter was neither given nor expected.
"Besides the plunder of the palace and its occupants, the leaders of the"
gipsies expected that they would obtain great rewards from Don Carlos
for thus removing the only obstacles to his undisputed possession of the
throne of Spain.
The heart of Rollo beat violently. His Scottish birth and training gave
"him a natural reverence for the sanctity of sickness and death, and the"
"idea of these men plotting ghoulishly to utilise ""the onlaying of the"
"hand of Providence"" (as his father would have phrased it) for the"
"purposes of plunder and rapine, unspeakably revolted him."
"Immediately he called a council of war, at which, in spite of the frowns"
"of Sergeant Cardono, little Concha Cabezos had her place."
"La Giralda was summoned also, but excused herself saying, ""It is better"
"that I should not know what you intend to do. I am, after all, a"
"black-blooded Gitana, and might be tempted to reveal your secrets if I"
knew them. It is better therefore that I should not. Let me keep my own
"place as a servitor in your company, to cut the brushwood for your fire"
and to bring the water from the spring. In those things you will find me
"faithful. Trust the gipsy no further!"""
"Rollo, remembering her loyalty in the matter of Dolóres at the village"
"of El Sarria, was about to make an objection, but a significant gesture"
from the Sergeant restrained him in time.
"would often be waylaid and forced to release them. An old woman, say,"
"anxious to do some deed of merit, would come to him as he returned"
"triumphantly home with his fowls and tender him money, and beg him to"
release the fowls. She would give the full price or double the price of
"the fowls; she had no desire to gain merit at another person's expense,"
and the unwilling cook would be obliged to give up the fowls. Public
"opinion was so strong he dare not refuse. The money was paid, the fowls"
"set free, and I dined on tinned beef."
And yet the villages are full of fowls. Why they are kept I do not know.
Certainly not for food. I do not mean to say that an accidental meeting
"between a rock and a fowl may not occasionally furnish forth a dinner,"
but this is not the object with which they are kept--of this I am sure.
You would not suppose that fowls were capable of exciting much
"affection, yet I suppose they are. Certainly in one case ducks were."
There is a Burman lady I know who is married to an Englishman. He kept
"ducks. He bought a number of ducklings, and had them fed up so that they"
might be fat and succulent when the time came for them to be served at
"table. They became very fine ducks, and my friend had promised me one. I"
"took an interest in them, and always noticed their increasing fatness"
"when I rode that way. Imagine, then, my disappointment when one day I"
saw that all the ducks had disappeared.
"I stopped to inquire. Yes, truly they were all gone, my friend told me."
"In his absence his wife had gone up the river to visit some friends, and"
"had taken the ducks with her. She could not bear, she said, that they"
"should be killed, so she took them away and distributed them among her"
"friends, one here and one there, where she was sure they would be well"
treated and not killed. When she returned she was quite pleased at her
"success, and laughed at her husband and me."
"Miss Lindon's heart sank. She had lived in suburbs all her life, and"
found Croydon--the Lord knows why--the most delectable of them all. She
had sat under Mr. Moneyfeather of Saint Michael's for many years--such
"a dear, good man who preached such eloquent sermons! You could always"
"understand him, too, which was a great comfort. And the church was just"
"round the corner. In London folks had to go to church by omnibus, a most"
"unpleasant and possibly irreverent prelude to divine worship. Besides,"
"when you did get to the sacred edifice, you found yourself in a"
"confusing land where all the clergy, even to the humblest deacon,"
"were austere and remote strangers, who looked at members of their"
congregation with glassy and unsympathetic eyes when they passed them
"in the street. Here, in Croydon, on the contrary, when she met Mr."
"Moneyfeather in public places, he held her hand and patted it and"
inquired affectionately after Dandy's health. With a London vicar she
could not conceive the possibility of such privileged terms of intimacy.
"London, where you did not know your next-door neighbor, and where you"
took no interest in the births of babies over the way; where no one
"ran in for a gossip in the mornings; where every street was a clashing,"
dashing High Street.
"But though her face pictured her dismay, she was too generous to"
translate it into words. John never guessed her sacrifice.
"“We 'll go somewhere quiet,” said he, after a while."
"“We 'll go wherever you like, dear,” replied Miss Lindon, meekly, and"
she rang the bell for tea.
"The main point decided, they proceeded to discuss the details of the"
"scheme, the minds of each suffused in a misty wonder. If John had told"
the simple lady that she could serve him by taking command of a cavalry
"regiment, she would have agreed in her unselfish fashion, but she would"
"five minutes after leaving the house, reached the bank of the little"
creek I have mentioned.
"Here we paused and waited, a group of huddled figures, while Steve"
"groped about for a plank he had hidden. Before us lay the stream,"
behind us the camp. At any moment the alarm might be raised. I
"pictured the outcry, the sudden flickering of lights, the galloping"
"this way and that, the discovery. And then, thank Heaven! Steve found"
"his plank, and in the work of passing the women over I forgot my"
"fears. The darkness, the peril--for the water on the nearer side was"
"deep--the nervous haste of some, and the terror of others, made the"
task no easy one. I was hot as fire and wet to the waist before it was
"over, and we all stood ankle-deep in the ooze which formed the farther"
bank.
Alas! our troubles were only beginning. Through this ooze we had to
"wade for a mile or more, sometimes in doubt, always in darkness; now"
"plashing into pools, now stumbling over a submerged log, often up to"
"our knees in mud and water. The frogs croaked round us, the bog moaned"
and gurgled; in the depth of the marsh the bitterns boomed mournfully.
If we stood a moment we sank. It was a horrible time; and the more
"horrible, as through it all we had only to turn to see the camp lights"
"behind us, a poor half-mile or so away."
None but desperate men could have exposed women to such a labour; nor
could any but women without hope and at their wit's end have
"accomplished it. As it was, Fraulein Max, who never ceased to whimper,"
"twice sank down and would go no farther, and we had to pluck her up"
"roughly and force her on. My lady's women, who wept in their misery,"
"were little better. Wet to the waist, draggled, and worn out by the"
"clinging slime and the reek of the marsh, they were kept moving only"
"with difficulty; so that, but for Steve's giant strength and my lady's"
picked from among them to act as her nurse.
And if it did not occur to her to question either his power or his
"perfect right to dispose of her future also as he might see fit, had not"
"all her experience gone to prove that might is right everywhere, that"
law and justice are merely additional pretexts devised by the strong for
oppressing the weak? She had had to choose between remaining on board
"the _Olive Branch_, or paying Jasper Slyne his price for the chance of"
escape he had offered her in pursuance of his own aims.
She disliked and distrusted Slyne scarcely less than before. But she did
"not see how she could have chosen otherwise. And, in any case,--it was"
too late now to revoke the promise she had made him.
She was still afraid to place any faith in the promises he had made
her. She had no idea how he had come at his alleged discovery of her
real identity. But Mr. Jobling's obvious belief in that recurred to her
"mind, and she fell to wondering timidly what life would be like as Lady"
Josceline Justice.
"Her impressions on that point were very hazy, however, and she had still"
to puzzle out the problem added by Justin Carthew. But she finally gave
"up the attempt to solve that at the moment, contenting herself with the"
"tremulous hope that she might soon be on her way toward that dear,"
"unknown, dream-home for which her hungry heart had so often ached."
Of the exorbitant price so soon to be paid for the brief glimpse of
"happiness Slyne had agreed to allow her, she took no further thought at"
all. She had already made up her mind to meet that without complaint.
"An hour or more later, when Slyne looked in to tell her that it was time"
"to start, she was still seated at the window, gazing out over the"
"swarm of angry wasps, and above us they seemed to remain, hovering and"
circling. We awaited the downward rush and the deafening thunder-clap
that would destroy us all. One man was groaning loudly. Another
shivered. I could hear the chattering of many teeth. My neighbour
trembled violently and cowered beneath his blankets. But his fear grew
so strong that he could not bear it any longer. He got up and said in a
"strained voice, trying to appear calm, ""I'm goin' to 'ave a look at"
"'em."" He ran out of the marquee and disappeared. I found my powers of"
resistance ebbing. I was unable to control my imagination. I saw my
comrades and myself blown to pieces. I saw the clerk in the office of
the C.C.S. write out the death-intimations on a buff slip and filling in
a form. I saw a telegraph boy taking the telegram to my home. He stopped
on the way in order to talk to a friend. Then he whistled and threw a
stone at a dog. He sauntered through the garden gate and knocked at the
"front door. The door opened ... but I could not face the rest, and with"
a tremendous mental impulse I turned my mind away to other things. But
my terrible thoughts lay in wait for me like tigers ready to rush upon
"me as soon as my will relaxed its efforts. I tried to compromise, and I"
imagined myself killed and invented all the details of a post-mortem
"examination and burial. I found some relief in these imaginings, but"
soon that implacable telegram claimed my attention once more and drew me
on to what I dared not face. I sought distraction by muttering some
"verses of poetry to myself. They had no meaning to me, they were just"
empty sound and their rhythm had a hideous pulsation like that other
pulsation overhead:
"""He above the rest"
In shape and gesture proudly eminent
"Stood like a tower...."""
"and so on, line after line. The dreariness of the verses grew so intense"
as to be almost intolerable. At the same time I was dimly conscious of
"as Tannin, etc."
CONVULSANT.--A medicine which causes violent and unnatural contractions
"of muscles (convulsions) as Nux Vomica or its derivative, etc."
CORDIAL.--A medicine which increases the strength and raises the
"vitality when depressed, as Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia, Alcohol, etc."
CORRECTIVE or CORRECTANT.--A substance used to modify or make pleasant
"the action of a cathartic or other medicines, as Acacia, Coriander, etc."
CORROSIVE.--A substance that destroys organic tissue either by direct
"chemical means or by causing inflammation and suppuration, as Mercuric"
"Chloride, Nitric Acid, etc."
COUNTER IRRITANT.--A substance or medicine which produces superficial
"inflammation artificially in order to exercise a good effect, by"
"stimulating functional activity of a part, thus promoting repair upon"
"some adjacent or deep-seated morbid process, as Blistering or Firing,"
etc.
CUMULATIVE POISON.--A medicine which finally acts as a poison after
several successive doses have been taken with little or no apparent
"effect, as Arsenic, Strychnine, etc."
"DEBILITANT.--A medicine which diminishes the energy of organs, as"
"Bromide of Potassium, Lobelia, etc."
"DEFERVESCENT.--A medicine that reduces temperature, as Quinine Sulphate,"
"Aconite, etc."
"DELIRIANT OR DELIRIFACENT.--A medicine which produces delirium, as"
"the new light. Away to the left there is even a row of small houses,"
like a row of railway-mens' dwellings. Strange and familiar sight. And
the station precincts are disorderly and rather dilapidated. I think of
our Sicilian host.
"The brown woman gives us coffee, and very strong, rich goats' milk, and"
bread. After which the q-b and I set off once more along the road to the
village. She too is thrilled. She too breathes deep. She too feels
"_space_ around her, and freedom to move the limbs: such as one does not"
"feel in Italy and Sicily, where all is so classic and fixed."
"The village itself is just a long, winding, darkish street, in shadow,"
of houses and shops and a smithy. It might almost be Cornwall: not
"quite. Something, I don't know what, suggests the stark burning glare of"
"summer. And then, of course, there is none of the cosiness which"
climbing roses and lilac trees and cottage shops and haystacks would
"give to an English scene. This is harder, barer, starker, more dreary."
An ancient man in the black-and-white costume comes out of a hovel of a
cottage. The butcher carries a huge side of meat. The women peer at
us--but more furtive and reticent than the howling stares of Italy.
"So we go on, down the rough-cobbled street through the whole length of"
"the village. And emerging on the other side, past the last cottage, we"
"find ourselves again facing the open country, on the gentle down-slope"
"of the rolling hill. The landscape continues the same: low, rolling"
"upland hills, dim under the yellow sun of the January morning: stone"
"fences, fields, grey-arable land: a man slowly, slowly ploughing with a"
pony and a dark-red cow: the road trailing empty across the distance:
"and then, the one violently unfamiliar note, the enclosed cemetery lying"
"outside on the gentle hill-side, closed in all round, very compact,"
with high walls: and on the inside face of the enclosure wall the marble
"slabs, like shut drawers of the sepulchres, shining white, the wall"
"The natives of Sinaketa, as we have seen in the last chapter, acquire"
"a certain amount of the Koya produce by means of trade. There are,"
"however, certain articles, useful yet unobtainable in the Trobriands,"
"and freely accessible in the Koya, and to these the Trobrianders"
"help themselves. The glassy forms of lava, known as obsidian, can be"
found in great quantities over the slopes of the hills in Sanaroa
"and Dobu. This article, in olden days, served the Trobrianders"
"as material for razors, scrapers, and sharp, delicate, cutting"
instruments. Pumice-stone abounding in this district is collected
"and carried to the Trobriands, where it is used for polishing. Red"
"ochre is also procured there by the visitors, and so are the hard,"
basaltic stones (binabina) used for hammering and pounding and for
"magical purposes. Finally, very fine silica sand, called maya, is"
"collected on some of the beaches, and imported into the Trobriands,"
"where it is used for polishing stone blades, of the kind which serve"
as tokens of value and which are manufactured up to the present day.
II
But by far the most important of the articles which the Trobrianders
"collect for themselves are the spondylus shells. These are freely,"
"though by no means easily, accessible in the coral outcrops of Sanaroa"
Lagoon. It is from this shell that the small circular perforated
"discs (kaloma) are made, out of which the necklaces of the Kula"
"are composed, and which also serve for ornamenting almost all the"
articles of value or of artistic finish which are used within the
"Kula district. But, only in two localities within the district are"
"these discs manufactured, in Sinaketa and in Vakuta, both villages in"
"Southern Boyowa. The shell can be found also in the Trobriand Lagoon,"
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The physical history of the period is recorded
in the succession of its formations. The sandstones of the Upper
"Cambrian, as we have learned, tell of a transgressing sea which"
gradually came to occupy the Mississippi valley and the interior
of North America. The limestones of the early and middle
Ordovician show that now the shore had become remote and the lands
had become more low. The waters now had cleared. Colonies of
brachiopods and other lime-secreting animals occupied the sea
"bottom, and their debris mantled it with sheets of limy ooze. The"
sandy limestones of the Calciferous record the transition stage
from the Cambrian when some sand was still brought in from shore.
The highly fossiliferous limestones of the Trenton tell of clear
water and abundant life. We need not regard this epicontinental
"sea as deep. No abysmal deposits have been found, and the"
"limestones of the period are those which would be laid in clear,"
warm water of moderate depth like that of modern coral seas.
The shales of the Utica and Hudson show that the waters of the sea
now became clouded with mud washed in from land. Either the land
"was gradually uplifted, or perhaps there had arrived one of those"
"periodic crises which, as we may imagine, have taken place"
whenever the crust of the shrinking earth has slowly given way
"over its great depressions, and the ocean has withdrawn its waters"
into deepening abysses. The land was thus left relatively higher
and bordered with new coastal plains. The epicontinental sea was
"shoaled and narrowed, and muds were washed in from the adjacent"
lands.
THE TACONIC DEFORMATION. The Ordovician was closed by a
deformation whose extent and severity are not yet known. From the
"St. Lawrence River to New York Bay, along the northwestern and"
"western border of New England, lies a belt of Cambrian-Ordovician"
"""Yes, and I own everything in the village,"" asserted the imp. ""If you"
"want anything here you must pay me for it!"""
The Sergeant found it even as the cripple had said. There was not a
single living inhabitant in the village. Here and there a shut door and
a sickening smell betrayed the fact that some unfortunates had been left
to die untended. Etienne and John Mortimer were for different reasons
"unwilling to taste of the ham and bread he had brought back, thinking"
"that these might convey the contagion, but La Giralda and the Sergeant"
"laughed their fears to scorn, and together retired to prepare the"
evening meal.
"As the others made their preparations for the night, watering their"
"beasts and grooming them with the utmost care, the little crook-backed"
"imp from the village appeared on the brink of the _barranco_, his"
"sallow, weazened face peeping suspiciously out of the underbrush, and"
his crutch performing the most curious evolutions in the air.
There was something unspeakably eerie in the aspect of the solitary
"survivor of so many living people, left behind to prey like a ghoul on"
the abandoned possessions of the fear-stricken living and the
untestamented property of the dead.
"Concha shrank instinctively from his approach, and the boy, perceiving"
"his power over her, came scuttling like a weasel through the brushwood,"
till little more than a couple of paces interposed between him and the
"girl. Frozen stiff with loathing and terror, it was not for some time"
"that Concha could cry out and look round hastily for Rollo, who"
(doubtless in his capacity of leader of the expedition) was not slow in
hastening to her assistance.
"Hurrying on, Bob presently caught up with a throng of his own men, who"
"had apparently just landed from the dangerous, constantly shifting"
"surface of the river. They looked at him with a frank curiosity, as if"
wondering what he meant to do in this emergency. On the faces of a few
"were expressions of grim, anticipatory amusement, but Bainbridge heeded"
these no more than he had the others. Without pausing even glancing to
"right or left, he strode on, and reached the scene of action."
"On the same bank, a little way back from the water, stood a small"
"building, so hastily thrown together that the roof was not yet"
"completed. One or two men were standing near it, staring interestedly at"
the crowd gathered about something at the water’s edge which Bob at once
"saw to be one end of a massive, well-constructed log boom. The other"
"end, out beyond the middle of the river, was supported by some stout"
"spiles, and the whole affair took up so much of the stream’s width that"
Bainbridge’s drive had jammed against it hard and fast.
All this Bob took in without slackening his pace. Reaching the outer
"edge of the circle, he pushed through to where Jack Peters, his jam"
"boss, stood facing a compact group of six or eight strangers, gathered"
"closely about the end of the boom, Jack was florid with rage, and"
choking with impotent fury. The strangers composing the little group
instantly struck Bob as being singularly strong and rugged. They looked
as if they had been picked for their physical efficiency. Each one was
"armed with rifle or pistol, while their leader, a competent-looking"
"person with red hair and whiskers, held in one hand a snub-nosed,"
businesslike automatic.
"“Well, Jack,” Bainbridge said curtly, as he reached the foreman’s side,"
“what’s the trouble?”
"not seem to remember, for he looked at them all, was silent and smiled"
... in a guilty way. Those men spoke very little to each other about
"their past, and they recalled it very seldom and then only its general"
"outlines.  When they did mention it, it was in a cynical tone."
"Probably, this was just as well, since, in many people, remembrance of"
the past kills all present energy and deadens all hope for the future.

"On rainy, cold, or dull days in the late autumn, these ""creatures that"
"once were men"" gathered in the eatinghouse of Vaviloff. They were well"
"known there, where some feared them as thieves and rogues, and some"
"looked upon them contemptuously as hard drinkers, although they"
"respected them, thinking that they were clever."
"The eating-house of Vaviloff was the club of the main street, and the"
"""creatures that once were men"" were its most intellectual members.  On"
"Saturday evenings or Sunday mornings, when the eating-house was packed,"
"the ""creatures that once were men"" were only too welcome guests.  They"
"brought with them, besides the forgotten and poverty-stricken"
"inhabitants of the street, their own spirit, in which there was"
something that brightened the lives of men exhausted and worn out in
"the struggle for existence, as great drunkards as the inhabitants of"
"Kuvalda's shelter, and, like them, outcasts from the town.  Their"
"ability to speak on all subjects, their freedom of opinion, skill in"
"repartee, courage in the presence of those of whom the whole street was"
"in terror, together with their daring demeanour, could not but be"
"pleasing to their companions.  Then, too, they were well versed in law,"
"and could advise, write petitions, and help to swindle without"
incurring the risk of punishment.  For all this they were paid with
vodki and flattering admiration of their talents.
but none could give the answer.
*      *      *      *      *
"A wild, wet September day was drawing to its close, amid pelting squalls"
"of cold rain, when a tall young man, gaunt and hollow-eyed, pushed his"
way into a small coffee-house in an obscure thoroughfare somewhere in
"the region of Drury Lane, and took a seat in a dark corner as near to"
"the stove as he could get, for he looked pinched with cold, and his"
plain and rather threadbare black suit was pretty well wet through.  As
"soon as he was seated, he drew from his breast a roll of paper, which he"
"regarded with solicitude.  That at least was dry, and he heaved a sigh"
that sounded like one of satisfaction.
"In this narrow street the daylight had completely faded, though it was"
not yet six o’clock.  The room was furthermore darkened by clouds of
tobacco smoke which the guests were puffing forth.  The smell of coffee
"mingled with the ranker fumes of the tobacco, and the clink of cup and"
"spoon made ceaseless accompaniment to the talk, which went on in a"
continuous stream.
"Grey (for it was he) leaned his head on his hand wearily, and fell into"
something like a doze as he sat in his shadowy corner.  He was exhausted
"in mind and in body.  He was faint with hunger, and yet half afraid to"
"order food; for his funds were dwindling almost to the vanishing point,"
and as yet he had found no means of replenishing his exchequer. But he
had not been able to resist the temptation to escape from the buffetings
"of the tempest, and when the boy in attendance upon the guests came to"
"ask his pleasure, he ordered some coffee and bread, and devoured it with"
a ravenous appetite when it was set before him.
"The pangs of hunger stayed, if not appeased, he began to look about him,"
And thus they speak till far on in the night or till they have
"quarrelled, the usual result of drink or of passions engendered by such"
discussions.
"The rain beats on the windows, and outside the cold wind is blowing."
"The eating-house is close with tobacco smoke, but it is warm, while the"
"street is cold and wet.  Now and then, the wind beats threateningly on"
"the windows of the eating-house, as if bidding these men to come out"
and be scattered like dust over the face of the earth.  Sometimes a
stifled and hopeless groan is heard in its howling which again is
"drowned by cold, cruel laughter.  This music fills one with dark, sad"
"thoughts of the approaching winter, with its accursed short, sunless"
"days and long nights, of the necessity of possessing warm garments and"
plenty to eat.  It is hard to sleep through the long winter nights on
"an empty stomach.  Winter is approaching.  Yes, it is approaching..."
How to live?
These gloomy forebodings created a strong thirst among the inhabitants
"of the main street, and the sighs of the ""creatures that once were men"""
"increased with the wrinkles on their brows, their voices became thick"
and their behaviour to each other more blunt.  And brutal crimes were
"committed among them, and the roughness of these poor unfortunate"
"outcasts was apt to increase at the approach of that inexorable enemy,"
who transformed all their lives into one cruel farce.  But this enemy
could not be captured because it was invisible.
"Then they began beating each other brutally, and drank till they had"
drunk everything which they could pawn to the indulgent Vaviloff.  And
"thus they passed the autumn days in open wickedness, in suffering which"
"was eating their hearts out, unable to rise out of this vicious life"
and in dread of the still crueller days of winter.
"will attribute such qualities as are predominant in themselves, as they"
"consider admirable; and, indeed, all supernatural beings are but the"
magnified shadows of man cast by the light of his imagination upon the
mists of his ignorance.
"Therefore, when you find that a people make their spirits beautiful and"
"fair, calm and even tempered, loving peace and the beauty of the trees"
"and rivers, shrinkingly averse from loud words, from noises, and from"
"the taking of life, it is because the people themselves think that these"
"are great qualities. If no stress be laid upon their courage, their"
"activity, their performance of great deeds, it is because the people who"
"imagine them care not for such things. There is no truer guide, I am"
"sure, to the heart of a young people than their superstitions; these"
"they make entirely for themselves, apart from their religion, which is,"
"to a certain extent, made for them. That is why I have written this"
chapter on Nats: not because I think it affects Buddhism very much one
"way or another, but because it seems to me to reveal the people"
"themselves, because it helps us to understand them better, to see more"
"with their eyes, to be in unison with their ideas--because it is a great"
key to the soul of the people.

"DEATH, THE DELIVERER"
"'The end of my life is near at hand; seven days hence, like a man"
"who rids himself of a heavy load, I shall be free from the burden"
of my body.'--_Death of the Buddha._
CHAPTER XX
"WHEREIN ""FINGERLESS"" FRASER RETURNS"
"Big George had lost no time, and already the tow-boats were overboard,"
while a raft of timber was taking form alongside the ship. As soon as
"it was completed, it was loaded with crates and boxes and paraphernalia"
"of all sorts, then towed ashore as the tide served. Another took its"
"place, and another and another. All that night the torches flared and"
the decks drummed to a ceaseless activity. In the morning Boyd sent a
"squad of fishermen ashore to clear the ground for his buildings, and"
all day new rafts of lumber and material helped to increase the pile at
the water's edge.
"His early training as an engineer now stood him in good stead, for a"
thousand details demanded expert supervision; but he was as completely
at home at this work as was Big George in his own part of the
"undertaking, and it was not long before order began to emerge from what"
seemed a hopeless chaos. Never did men have more willing hands to do
their bidding than did he and George; and when a week later _The
"Juliet_, with Willis Marsh on board, came to anchor, the bunk-houses"
"were up and peopled, while the new site had become a beehive of"
activity.
"The mouth of the Kalvik River is several miles wide, yet it contains"
"but a small anchorage suitable for deep-draught ships, the rest of the"
harbor being underlaid with mud-bars and tide-flats over which none but
small boats may pass; and as the canneries are distributed up and down
"the stream for a considerable distance, it is necessary to transport"
all supplies to and from the ships by means of tugs and lighters. Owing
"to the narrowness of the channel, _The Juliet_ came to her moorings not"
"""And I,"" retorted Concha, ""am as strictly forbidden to reveal mine to"
"General Cabrera or even to that notable young officer, Colonel Don Rollo"
"of the surname which resembles so much a _borrico's_ serenade!"""
That speech would have been undoubtedly rude save for the glance which
"accompanied it, given softly yet daringly from beneath a jetty fringe of"
eyelash.
Nevertheless all Rollo Blair's pride of ancestry rose insurgent within
him. Who was this Andalucian waiting-maid that she should speak lightly
of the descendant of that Blair of Blair Castle who had stood for Bruce
"and freedom on the field of Bannockburn? It was unbearable--and yet,"
"well, there was something uncommon about this girl. And after all, was"
it not the mark of a gentleman to pay no heed to the babbling of women's
"tongues? If they did not say one thing, they would another. Besides, he"
cared nothing what this girl might say. A parrot prattling in a cage
would affect him as much.
So they rode on together over the great tawny brick-dusty wastes of Old
"Castile, silent mostly, but the silence occasionally broken by speech,"
"friendly enough on either side. Behind them pounded La Giralda, gaunt as"
"the sergeant himself, leather-legginged, booted and spurred, watching"
"them keenly out of her ancient, unfathomable gipsy eyes."
And ever as they rode the Guadarrama mountains rose higher and whiter
"out of the vast and hideous plain, the only interruption to the circling"
horizon of brown and parched corn lands. But at this season scrub-oak
"and juniper were the only shrubs to be seen, and had there been a"
"Cristino outpost anywhere within miles, the party must have been"
discerned riding steadily towards the northern slopes of the mountains.
"But neither man nor beast took notice of them, and a certain large"
uncanny silence brooded over the plain.
will touch his soul or disturb the image he has made of himself. The
attitude of warding off reveals itself as fastidiousness and as
bashfulness. Budaeus hit the mark when he exclaimed jocularly:
'_Fastidiosule!_ You little fastidious person!' Erasmus himself
interprets the dominating trait of his being as maidenly coyness. The
excessive sensitiveness to the stain attaching to his birth results from
"it. But his friend Ammonius speaks of his _subrustica verecundia_, his"
"somewhat rustic _gaucherie_. There is, indeed, often something of the"
"small man about Erasmus, who is hampered by greatness and therefore"
"shuns the great, because, at bottom, they obsess him and he feels them"
to be inimical to his being.
It seems a hard thing to say that genuine loyalty and fervent
gratefulness were strange to Erasmus. And yet such was his nature. In
characters like his a kind of mental cramp keeps back the effusions of
"the heart. He subscribes to the adage: 'Love so, as if you may hate one"
"day, and hate so, as if you may love one day'. He cannot bear benefits."
In his inmost soul he continually retires before everybody. He who
"considers himself the pattern of simple unsuspicion, is indeed in the"
"highest degree suspicious towards all his friends. The dead Ammonius,"
"who had helped him so zealously in the most delicate concerns, is not"
"secure from it. 'You are always unfairly distrustful towards me,'"
"Budaeus complains. 'What!' exclaims Erasmus, 'you will find few people"
who are so little distrustful in friendship as myself.'
When at the height of his fame the attention of the world was indeed
"fixed on all he spoke or did, there was some ground for a certain"
feeling on his part of being always watched and threatened. But when he
"was yet an unknown man of letters, in his Parisian years, we continually"
find traces in him of a mistrust of the people about him that can only
be regarded as a morbid feeling. During the last period of his life this
"feeling attaches especially to two enemies, Eppendorf and Aleander."
"the pearl was afterward sold in Paris for $12,000 it is quite evident"
"that the share of the middleman, of whom political economists just now"
"talk so much, was heavy. The Panama pearls are sometimes of beautiful"
"colors, green, pale blue and a delicate pink. On the Chiriqui coast a"
"year or two ago a pearl weighing about forty-two carats, about the size"
"and shape of a partridge egg, greenish black at the base and shading to"
"a steel gray at the tip, was found. It was sold in Paris for $5000."
"[Illustration: A DAY’S SHOOTING, GAME MOSTLY MONKEYS]"
It is a curious fact that the use of mussels from our western rivers is
one cause for the decadence of the Panama pearl industry. For years the
actual expense of maintaining these fisheries was met by the sale of the
shell for use in making buttons and mother-of-pearl ornaments. The
"pearls represented the profit of the enterprise, which was always"
therefore more or less of a gamble--but a game in which it was
"impossible to lose, though the winnings might be great or small"
according to luck. Now that the demand for pearl oyster shells has
"fallen off, owing to the competition of mussels, the chances in the game"
are rather against the player and the sport languishes.
[Illustration: THE GOVERNMENT SCHOOL OF HAT MAKING]
[Illustration: BEGINNING A PANAMA HAT]
The authorities of the Republic are making some effort to establish a
system of industrial schools which may lead to the fuller utilization of
the natural resources of the country. Every tourist who visits the
Isthmus is immediately taught by one who has been there a day or two
longer than he that Panama hats are not made in Panama. This seems to
be the most precious information that anyone on the Zone has to impart.
Most of the hats there sold are indeed made in Ecuador and the name
CHOCO INDIAN OF SAMBU VALLEY
Silver beads about his neck and leg. Face painted in glaring colors]
As a rule these Indians--men or women--are not pleasing to the eye. The
"lips are thick, the nose flat and broad, the hair coarse and always jet"
black. Yet the children are not infrequently really beautiful. Any
traveler in Panama who forsakes the beaten track up and down the Canal
Zone will be impressed by the wide extent to which beauty is found among
"the children, whatever their race or combination of races. But the charm"
soon fades. It is seldom that one sees a mature woman who is attractive
to Caucasian eyes. Among the women of the Guaymies face painting is
"practiced only on great occasions, black, red and white being the usual"
"colors. The men go painted at all times, the invariable pattern being a"
"sort of inverted V, with the apex between the eyes, and the two arms"
"extending to points, half an inch or so from the corners of the mouth."
"The lips are colored to make them seem thicker than normal, and heavy"
shadows are painted in under the eyes.
Among some tribes the wealth of a man is reckoned by the number of his
"cattle; among the Guaymies by the number of his wives. For this reason,"
"perhaps, the attainment of marriageable age is an occasion of much"
festivity for children of both sexes. The boy is exposed to tests of his
"manly and war-like qualities, and, in company with his fellows of equal"
"age, is taken by the wisemen of the tribe into the solitude of the"
forest that by performing tasks assigned to him he may prove himself a
"man. There, too, they learn from the elders, who go masked and crowned"
"with wreaths, the traditions of their tribes told in rude chants like"
the Norse sagas. Until this ceremony has been fulfilled the youth has no
name whatsoever. After it he is named and celebrates his first birthday.
The ceremonies in which the girls play the chief part are less
"But we had parted.  She had announced her intention of leaving Paris,"
"accompanied by her mother, on the morrow, and had begged and implored"
that I would never seek her again.
"""I shall take care to evade you,"" she had said.  ""To-day we meet for the"
last time.  We must each go our own way and strive our hardest to
"forget."""
"Ah! to forget would, I knew, be impossible.  When a man has loved as"
"ardently and intensely as I loved Yolande, memories cling to him and are"
"carried to the grave.  You, reader, have loved in those half-forgotten"
"days of long ago, and even now, with age creeping on, and, perchance,"
"with grey hairs showing, sometimes give a passing thought to that fair"
one who in youth's golden days was your all in all.  The sound of a
"song, the momentary perfume from a woman's chiffons as she passes, the"
"sight of some long-forgotten scene, stirs the memory and recalls those"
hours of love and laziness when the world was so very pleasant and
"seemed to have been made for you alone.  You recollect her sweet smile,"
"her calm, womanly influence, her full red lips, and the fervency of her"
"kisses.  The tender memory to-day is sweet, even though it be tinged"
"with bitterness, for you wonder whom she has married, and how she has"
"fared; you wonder, too, if you will ever meet again, or whether she is"
already dead.  The most charming reflection permitted to man is the
memory of a half-forgotten love.
I had been a fool.  This bitter truth was forced upon me as I sat there
"ruminating.  I had cast aside that patience and discretion which I, as a"
"diplomatist, had carefully cultivated, and had actually contemplated"
marriage with a woman who had been denounced by Kaye as a secret agent.
"My own peril had been a grave one indeed, and as I reflected I began to"
wonder how it was that I should have so completely lost my self-control.
"Although these words were written nearly half a century ago, they are"
so specially applicable to-day that they seem quite “up-to-date”:
"indeed, I think they will hold equally good fifty years hence."
In spite of a strong taste on the part of children for what is ugly
"and brutal, I am sure that we ought to eliminate this element as far"
as possible from the school stories--especially among poor children.
Not because I think children should be protected from all knowledge
"of evil, but because so much of this knowledge comes into their life"
outside school that we can well afford to ignore it during school
"hours. At the same time, however, as I shall show by example when I"
"come to the positive side, it would be well to show children by story"
illustration the difference between brute ugliness without anything
"to redeem it and surface ugliness, which may be only a veil over the"
"beauty that lies underneath. It might be possible, for instance, to"
show children the difference between the real ugliness of a brutal
"story of crime and an illustration of it in the sensational papers,"
"and the apparent ugliness in the priest's face of the “Laocoon” group,"
because of the motive of courage and endurance behind the suffering.
Many stories in everyday life could be found to illustrate this.
VIII.--_Stories of infant piety and death-bed scenes._ The stories
"for children forty years ago contained much of this element, and the"
following examples will illustrate this point:
"Notes from poems written by a child between six and eight years of age,"
"by name Philip Freeman, afterwards Archdeacon of Exeter:"
"Poor Robin, thou canst fly no more,"
Thy joys and sorrows all are o'er.
"Through Life's tempestuous storms thou'st trod,"
"Fairy Tale element presented to him. In “Father and Son,” Mr. Edmund"
Gosse says:
"“Meanwhile, capable as I was of reading, I found my greatest pleasure"
"in the pages of books. The range of these was limited, for story-books"
"of every description were sternly excluded. No fiction of any kind,"
"religious or secular, was admitted into the house. In this it was to"
"my Mother, not to my Father, that the prohibition was due. She had a"
"remarkable, I confess, to me somewhat unaccountable impression that to"
"‘tell a story,’ that is, to compose fictitious narrative of any kind,"
was a sin.... Nor would she read the chivalrous tales in the verse of
"Sir Walter Scott, obstinately alleging that they were not true. She"
"would read nothing but lyrical and subjective poetry.... As a child,"
"however, she had possessed a passion for making up stories, and so"
"considerable a skill in it, that she was constantly being begged to"
"indulge others with its exercise.... ‘When I was a very little child,’"
"she says, ‘I used to amuse myself and my brothers with inventing"
"stories such as I had read. Having, as I suppose, naturally a restless"
"mind and busy imagination, this soon became the chief pleasure of"
"my life. Unfortunately, my brothers were always fond of encouraging"
"this propensity, and I found in Taylor, my maid, a still greater"
"tempter. I had not known there was any harm in it, until Miss Shore (a"
"Calvinistic governess), finding it out, lectured me severely and told"
me it was wicked. From that time forth I considered that to invent
a story of any kind was a sin.... But the longing to invent stories
grew with violence. The simplicity of Truth was not enough for me. I
"must needs embroider imagination upon it, and the folly and wickedness"
which disgraced my heart are more than I am able to express....’ This
"(the Author, her son, adds) is surely a very painful instance of the"
repression of an instinct.”
"In contrast to the stifling of the imagination, it is good to recall"
"Church and State and society, seemed simple. Nothing was required but"
"restoration and purification by a return to the original, unspoilt"
"sources of Christianity. A number of accretions to the faith, rather"
"ridiculous than revolting, had to be cleared away. All should be reduced"
"to the nucleus of faith, Christ and the Gospel. Forms, ceremonies,"
speculations should make room for the practice of true piety. The Gospel
was easily intelligible to everybody and within everybody's reach. And
"the means to reach all this was good learning, _bonae literae_. Had he"
"not himself, by his editions of the New Testament and of Jerome, and"
"even earlier by the now famous _Enchiridion_, done most of what had to"
"be done? 'I hope that what now pleases the upright, will soon please"
all.' As early as the beginning of 1517 Erasmus had written to Wolfgang
"Fabricius Capito, in the tone of one who has accomplished the great"
"task. 'Well then, take you the torch from us. The work will henceforth"
be a great deal easier and cause far less hatred and envy. _We_ have
lived through the first shock.'
Budaeus writes to Tunstall in May 1517: 'Was anyone born under such
inauspicious Graces that the dull and obscure discipline (scholasticism)
"does not revolt him, since sacred literature, too, cleansed by Erasmus's"
"diligence, has regained its ancient purity and brightness? But it is"
still much greater that he should have effected by the same labour the
"emergence of sacred truth itself out of that Cimmerian darkness, even"
though divinity is not yet quite free from the dirt of the sophist
"school. If that should occur one day, it will be owing to the beginnings"
made in our times.' The philologist Budaeus believed even more firmly
than Erasmus that faith was a matter of erudition.
It could not but vex Erasmus that not everyone accepted the cleansed
"truth at once. How could people continue to oppose themselves to what,"
"to him, seemed as clear as daylight and so simple? He, who so sincerely"
"would have liked to live in peace with all the world, found himself"
seemed a laudable purpose--that is if hanging is ever laudable--but the
Panama officials are quite as determined to keep the wheels of their
criminal law moving. The proprietors of machines like to see them
run--which is one of the reasons why too many battleships are not good
for a nation.

"To return, however, to the statistics of the Zone. Its population is"
"shifting, of course, and varies somewhat in its size according to the"
extent to which labor is in demand. The completion of a part of the work
"occasionally reduces the force. In January, 1912, the total population"
"of the Zone, according to the official census, was 62,810; at the same"
"time, by the same authority, there were employed by the Canal Commission"
"and the Panama Railroad 36,600 men. These figures emphasize the fact"
"that the working force on the Zone is made up mainly of unmarried men,"
"for a working population of 36,600 would, under the conditions existing"
"in the ordinary American community, give a population of well over"
"100,000. Though statistics are not on hand, and would probably be"
"impossible to compile among the foreign laborers, it is probable that"
not more than one man in four on the Zone is married. From this
situation it results that the average maiden who visits the Zone for a
brief holiday goes rushing home to get her trousseau ready before some
young engineer’s next annual vacation shall give him time to go like a
"young Lochinvar in search of his bride. Indeed, the life of the Zone for"
"many reasons has been singularly conducive to matrimony, and as a game"
"preserve for the exciting sport of husband-hunting, it has been"
unexcelled.

"double wall of cells inclosing a body cavity, and with an opening,"
the primitive mouth. Each of these early embryological stages is
"represented by living animals,--the undivided cell by the"
"PROTOZOA, the blastosphere by some rare forms, and the gastrula in"
"the essential structure of the COELENTERATES,--the subkingdom to"
which the fresh-water hydra and the corals belong. All forms of
"animal life, from the coelenterates to the mammals, follow the"
same path in their embryological development as far as the
"gastrula stage, but here their paths widely diverge, those of each"
subkingdom going their own separate ways.
"We may infer, therefore, that during the pre-Cambrian periods"
organic evolution followed the lines thus dimly traced. The
earliest one-celled protozoa were probably succeeded by many-
"celled animals of the type of the blastosphere, and these by"
gastrula-like organisms. From the gastrula type the higher sub-
"divisions of animal life probably diverged, as separate branches"
from a common trunk. Much or all of this vast differentiation was
accomplished before the opening of the next era; for all the
subkingdoms are represented in the Cambrian except the
vertebrates.
EVIDENCES OF PRE-CAMBRIAN LIFE. An indirect evidence of life
during the pre-Cambrian periods is found in the abundant and
"varied fauna of the next period; for, if the theory of evolution"
"is correct, the differentiation of the Cambrian fauna was a long"
process which might well have required for its accomplishment a
large part of pre-Cambrian time.
"Other indirect evidences are the pre-Cambrian limestones, iron"
"ores, and graphite deposits, since such minerals and rocks have"
been formed in later times by the help of organisms. If the
which proceeding I speak of later in detail. (See Chapter on Questions.)
We now come to the question as to what proportion of _Dramatic
Excitement_ we should present in the stories for a normal group of
"children. Personally, I should like, while the child is very young"
"(I mean in mind, not in years) to exclude the element of dramatic"
"excitement, but though this may be possible for the individual child,"
it is quite Utopian to hope we can keep the average child free from
"what is in the atmosphere. Children crave for excitement, and unless we"
"give it to them in legitimate form, they will take it in any riotous"
"form it presents itself, and if from our experience we can control"
"their mental digestion by a moderate supply of what they demand, we"
may save them from devouring too eagerly the raw material they can so
easily find for themselves.
There is a humorous passage bearing on this question in the story of
"the small Scotch boy, when he asks leave of his parents to present the"
pious little book--a gift to himself from his Aunt--to a little sick
"friend, hoping probably that the friend's chastened condition will make"
him more lenient towards this mawkish form of literature. The parents
"expostulate, pointing out to their son how ungrateful he is, and how"
ungracious it would be to part with his Aunt's gift. Then the boy can
"contain himself no longer. He bursts out, unconsciously expressing the"
normal attitude of children at a certain stage of development: “It's
a _daft_ book ony way; there's naebody gets kilt en't. I like stories
"about folk getting their heids cut off, or stabbit through and through,"
wi' swords an' spears. An' there's nae wile beasts. I like Stories
"about black men gettin' ate up, an' white men killin' lions and tigers"
an' bears an'----”
"Then, again, we have the passage from George Eliot's “Mill on the"
Floss”:
policy of emperor and pope. People wanted to use his name and make him
choose sides. And that he would not do for any consideration. He wrote
evasively to the Pope about his relations with Luther without altogether
disavowing him. How zealously he defends himself from the suspicion of
"being on Luther's side as noisy monks make out in their sermons, who"
summarily link the two in their scoffing disparagement.
But by the other side also he is pressed to choose sides and to speak
out. Towards the end of October 1520 the coronation of the emperor took
place at Aix-la-Chapelle. Erasmus was perhaps present; in any case he
"accompanied the Emperor to Cologne. There, on 5 November, he had an"
interview about Luther with the Elector Frederick of Saxony. He was
persuaded to write down the result of that discussion in the form of
twenty-two _Axiomata concerning Luther's cause_. Against his intention
they were printed at once.
Erasmus's hesitation in those days between the repudiation and the
approbation of Luther is not discreditable to him. It is the tragic
defect running through his whole personality: his refusal or inability
ever to draw ultimate conclusions. Had he only been a calculating and
"selfish nature, afraid of losing his life, he would long since have"
altogether forsaken Luther's cause. It is his misfortune affecting his
"fame, that he continually shows his weaknesses, whereas what is great in"
him lies deep.
"At Cologne Erasmus also met the man with whom, as a promising young"
"humanist, fourteen years younger than himself, he had, for some months,"
"shared a room in the house of Aldus's father-in-law, at Venice:"
"Hieronymus Aleander, now sent to the Emperor as a papal nuncio, to"
"persuade him to conform his imperial policy to that of the Pope, in the"
"matter of the great ecclesiastical question, and give effect to the"
papal excommunication by the imperial ban.
Panamanian farmer will never incur the scriptural curse laid upon them
"that lay field unto field. He farms just enough for his daily needs, no"
more. The ambition that leads our northern farmer to always covet the
lands on the other side of his boundary fence does not operate in
"Panama. One reason is, of course, the aggressiveness of the jungle."
"Stubborn to clear away, it is determined in its efforts to regain the"
land from which it has been ousted. Such a thing as allowing a field to
lie fallow for two or three years is unknown in Panama. There would be
no field visible for the new jungle growth.
[Illustration: A FORD NEAR ANCON]
"Agriculture therefore is conducted in a small way only, except for the"
great corporations that have just begun the exploitation of Panama.
Whether the country affords a hopeful field for the individual settler
is at least doubtful. Its climate is excellent. The days are warm but
never scorchingly hot as are customary in Washington and frequent in New
York. The nights are cool. From December to May a steady trade wind
"blows over the Isthmus from north to south, carrying away the clouds so"
"that there is no rain. In this dry season the fruits mature, so that it"
corresponds to the northern summer; on the other hand such vegetation as
"sheds its leaves, or dies down annually, does so at this season, giving"
it a seeming correspondence to the northern winter. In a temperature
"sense there is neither summer nor winter, and the variation of the"
thermometer is within narrow limits. The highest temperature in years at
"Culebra, a typical inland point, was 96 degrees; the lowest 61."
The list of natural products of the Isthmus is impressive in its length
"and variety, but for most of them even the home demand is not met or"
supplied by the production. Only where some stimulating force from the
"outside has intervened, like the United Fruit Company with the banana,"
has production been brought up to anything like its possibility. In the
"nursing, not to speak of some excellent whisky that she happened to have"
"stored away in her cabin, had pulled him through. With a sigh of relief"
she threw herself down on the rug for a much-needed rest.
"The man woke just before the sun rose. His first thought, that he was"
"home in the foothills, was dissipated by the sight of the snow ranges."
"Through the window of the cabin, as far as the eye could see, nothing of"
"green was visible. Snow was everywhere; everything was white, save at"
the eastern horizon where silver was fast changing into rose and rose to
a fiery red as the fast-rising sun sent its shafts over the snow-coated
mountains.
And now there came to him a full realisation of what had happened and
"where he was. To his amazement, though, he was almost without pain. That"
"his wound had been dressed he was, of course, well aware for when he"
attempted to draw back still further the curtain at the window the
"movement strained the tight bandage, and he was instantly made conscious"
of a twinge of pain.
"Nevertheless, he persevered, for he wisely decided that it would be well"
"to reconnoitre, to familiarise himself, as much as possible, with the"
lay of the land and find out whether the trail that he had followed to
"reach the cabin which, he recalled, was perched high up above a ravine,"
was the only means of communication with the valley below. It was a
"useless precaution, for the snow would have wholly obliterated any such"
"trail had there been one and, soon realising the fact, he fell back"
exhausted by his effort on the pillows.
"A half hour passed and the man began to grow restless. He had, of"
"course, no idea whatever of the length of time he had been in the cabin,"
and he knew that he must be thinking of an immediate escape. In
"desperation, he tried to get out of bed, but the task was beyond his"
and helpful experiment.
To take a concrete example: let us suppose the story of Andersen's Tin
"Soldier told to a child of five or six years. At the first recital, the"
point which will interest the child most will be the setting up of the
"tin soldiers on the table, because he can understand this by means of"
"his own experience, in his own nursery: it is an appeal to conditions"
to which he is accustomed and for which no exercise of the imagination
"is needed, unless we take the effect of memory to be, according to"
"Queyrat, retrospective imagination."
"The next incident that appeals is the unfamiliar behaviour of the toys,"
"but still in familiar surroundings; that is to say, the _unusual_"
activities are carried on in the safe precincts of the nursery--in the
_usual_ atmosphere of the child.
I quote from the text:
"“Late in the evening the other soldiers were put in their box, and the"
people of the house went to bed. Now was the time for the toys to play;
"they amused themselves with paying visits, fighting battles and giving"
"balls. The tin soldiers rustled about in their box, for they wanted to"
"join the games, but they could not get the lid off. The nut-crackers"
"turned somersaults, and the pencil scribbled nonsense on the slate.”"
"Now, from this point onwards in the story, the events will be quite"
"outside the personal experience of the child, and there will have"
to be a real stretch of imagination to appreciate the thrilling and
"blood-curdling adventures of the little tin soldier, namely, the"
"terrible sailing down the gutter under the bridge, the meeting with"
"the fierce rat who demands the soldier's passport, the horrible"
"sensation in the fish's body, etc. Last of all, perhaps, will come"
In physiognomy the San Blas Indians are heavy of feature and stocky of
"frame. Their color is dark olive, with no trace of the negro apparent,"
for it has been their unceasing study for centuries to retain their
"racial purity. Their features are regular and pleasing and, among the"
"children particularly, a high order of beauty is often found. To get a"
"glimpse of their women is almost impossible, and a photograph of one is"
"practically unknown. If overtaken on the water, to which they often"
"resort in their cayucas, the women will wrap their clothing about their"
"faces, rather heedless of what other portions of their bodies may be"
"exposed, and make all speed for the shore. These women paint their faces"
"in glaring colors, wear nose rings, and always blacken their teeth on"
being married. Among them more pains is taken with clothing than among
"most of the savage Indians, many of their garments being made of a sort"
"of appliqué work in gaudy colors, with figures, often in representation"
"of the human form, cut out and inset in the garment."
So determined are the men of this tribe to maintain its blood
"untarnished by any admixture whatsoever, that they long made it an"
invariable rule to expel every white man from their territory at
nightfall. Of late years there has been a very slight relaxation of this
severity. Dr. Henri Pittier of the United States Department of
"Agriculture, one of the best-equipped scientific explorers in the"
"tropics, several of whose photographs elucidate this volume, has lived"
much among the San Blas and the Cuna-Cuna Indians and won their
friendship.

[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 2.--Secondary Hæmorrhages in a case of
Hæmothorax. Case No. 151]
"(151) The wound was received at short range, probably at from"
"100 to 200 yards. _Entry_, 1 inch from the left axillary margin"
"in the first intercostal space; _exit_, at the back of the"
right arm 1-1/2 inch below the acromial angle; both pleuræ were
"therefore crossed. The patient expectorated at first fluid,"
"then clotted, blood in considerable quantity. When brought into"
"the advanced Base hospital on the third day, there were signs"
"of blood in the left pleura, cellular emphysema over the right"
"side of the chest, and signs of collapse of the right lung. The"
temperature chart gives shortly the course of the case: the
"right pneumo-thorax cleared up spontaneously, also the"
emphysema; but the left pleura needed tapping to relieve
"symptoms of pressure on four occasions, the 13th, 15th, 19th,"
and 25th days respectively. On the first two occasions blood
"was removed, on the third blood serum only, and on the last"
pus. The patient was relieved after each aspiration; after the
"third, the temperature fell to normal, the general condition"
"also improved, and he promised to do well. None the less,"
"reaccumulation took place, the evacuated fluid assumed an"
"inflammatory character, and an incision to evacuate pus was"
eventually followed by death on the twenty-seventh day. The
"amount of hæmoptysis throughout was considerable, and the case"
"was possibly one of pulmonary hæmothorax, as after death no"
source of hæmorrhage could be localised in the intercostal
"space. The track in the lung was almost healed, and although a"
part of it allowed the introduction of a probe for about an
"inch, it could be traced no further even on section of the"
"organ, and no special vessel could be located as the original"
This table shows in its second column the prices paid by the
"Sinaketans to the industrial villages of Kuboma, a district in the"
Northern Trobriands. In the third column what they receive in Dobu
"is recorded. The table has been obtained from a Sinaketan informant,"
"and it probably is far from accurate, and the transactions are sure"
"to vary greatly in the gain which they afford. There is no doubt,"
"however, that for each article, the Sinaketan would ask the price"
which he paid for them as well as some extra article.
Thus we see that there is in this transaction a definite gain obtained
by the middlemen. The natives of Sinaketa act as intermediaries
"between the industrial centres of the Trobriands and Dobu, whereas"
their hosts play the same rôle between the Sinaketans and the men
from the outlying districts.
"Besides trading and obtaining of Kula valuables, the natives of"
"Sinaketa visit their friends and their distant relatives, who, as we"
"saw before, are to be found in this district owing to migrations. The"
"visitors walk across the flat, fertile plain from one hamlet to the"
"other, enjoying some of the marvellous and unknown sights of this"
"district. They are shown the hot springs of Numanuma and of Deyde'i,"
"which are in constant eruption. Every few minutes, the water boils up"
"in one spring after another of each group, throwing up jets of spray"
"a few metres high. The plain around these springs is barren, with"
nothing but here and there a stunted kind of eucalyptus tree. This
is the only place in the whole of Eastern New Guinea where as far
"as I know, eucalyptus trees are to be found. This was at least the"
"information of some intelligent natives, in whose company I visited"
"the springs, and who had travelled all over the Eastern islands and"
the East end of the mainland.

"When the two were established at a well-appointed table, with a"
"promising waiter hovering in attendance, Chandler began to experience"
the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him.
The restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down
"Broadway, which he always preferred, but it was nearly so. The tables"
"were well filled with prosperous-looking diners, there was a good"
"orchestra, playing softly enough to make conversation a possible"
"pleasure, and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism. His"
"companion, even in her cheap hat and dress, held herself with an air"
that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure.
"And it is certain that she looked at Chandler, with his animated but"
"self-possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes, with"
something not far from admiration in her own charming face.
"Then it was that the Madness of Manhattan, the frenzy of Fuss and"
"Feathers, the Bacillus of Brag, the Provincial Plague of Pose seized"
"upon Towers Chandler. He was on Broadway, surrounded by pomp and style,"
and there were eyes to look at him. On the stage of that comedy he had
assumed to play the one-night part of a butterfly of fashion and an
"idler of means and taste. He was dressed for the part, and all his good"
angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it.
"So he began to prate to Miss Marian of clubs, of teas, of golf and"
riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints
of a yacht lying at Larchmont. He could see that she was vastly
"impressed by this vague talk, so he endorsed his pose by random"
"insinuations concerning great wealth, and mentioned familiarly a few"
names that are handled reverently by the proletariat. It was Chandler’s
"short little day, and he was wringing from it the best that could be"
the insecurity deter him. In England the servitude which was required of
"him there revolted him. But in the Netherlands themselves, he did not"
"feel at his ease, either: 'Here I am barked at a great deal, and there"
"is no remuneration; though I desired it ever so much, I could not bear"
to stay there long'. Yet he remained for four years.
Erasmus had good friends in the University of Louvain. At first he put
"up with his old host Johannes Paludanus, Rhetor of the University, whose"
house he exchanged that summer for quarters in the College of the Lily.
"Martin Dorp, a Dutchman like himself, had not been estranged from him by"
their polemics about the _Moria_; his good will was of great importance
"to Erasmus, because of the important place Dorp occupied in the"
"theological faculty. And lastly, though his old patron, Adrian of"
"Utrecht, afterwards Pope, had by that time been called away from Louvain"
"to higher dignities, his influence had not diminished in consequence,"
but rather increased; for just about that time he had been made a
cardinal.
Erasmus was received with great complaisance by the Louvain divines.
"Their leader, the vice-chancellor of the University, Jean Briard of Ath,"
"repeatedly expressed his approval of the edition of the New Testament,"
to Erasmus's great satisfaction. Soon Erasmus found himself a member of
the theological faculty. Yet he did not feel at his ease among the
Louvain theologians. The atmosphere was a great deal less congenial to
him than that of the world of the English scholars. Here he felt a
spirit which he did not understand and distrusted in consequence.
"In the years in which the Reformation began, Erasmus was the victim of a"
"great misunderstanding, the result of the fact that his delicate,"
"aesthetic, hovering spirit understood neither the profoundest depths of"
the faith nor the hard necessities of human society. He was neither
mystic nor realist. Luther was both. To Erasmus the great problem of
the queen and her train of ladies to the place kept for her. Guards were
put all about to prevent the people crowding; and then came the
"soldiers, and in the midst of them the blacksmith; and amid many cries"
"of 'Traitor, traitor!' and shouts of derision, he was bound to the iron"
"post within the wood and the straw, and the guards fell back."
"The queen sat and watched it all, and said never a word. Fire was put to"
"the pyre, and it crept rapidly up in long red tongues with coils of"
"black smoke. It went very quickly, for the wood was very dry, and a"
light breeze came laughing up the river and helped it. The flames played
"about the man chained there in the midst, and he made never a sign; only"
"he looked steadily across at the purple mountain where his home lay, and"
it was clear that in a few more moments he would be dead. There was a
deep silence everywhere.
"Then of a sudden, before anyone knew, before a hand could be held out to"
"hinder her, the queen rose from her seat and ran to the pyre. In a"
"moment she was there and had thrown herself into the flames, and with"
her arms about her brother's neck she turned and faced the myriad eyes
"that glared upon them--the queen, in all the glory of her beauty,"
"glittering with gems, and the man with great shackled bare limbs,"
"dressed in a few rags, his muscles already twisted with the agony of the"
"fire. A great cry of horror came from the people, and there was the"
movement of guards and officers rushing to stop the fire; but it was all
"of no use. A flash of red flames came out of the logs, folding these"
"twain like an imperial cloak, a whirl of sparks towered into the air,"
and when one could see again the woman and her brother were no longer
"there. They were dead and burnt, and the bodies mingled with the ashes"
"of the fire. She had cost her brother his life, and she went with him"
into death.
man had a hare to hunt; no one lacked irrefragable arguments to prove
what must happen; no one knew exactly what was going to happen. The
"elder men gathered round Puttock and Jewell, and listened to a"
demonstration that the Premier's public life was at an end; the younger
"rallied Coxon, whose premature stateliness sometimes invited this"
"treatment, dubbing him ""Kingmaker Coxon,"" and hilariously repudiating"
the idea that he did not enjoy the title. Captain Heseltine dropped in
about eleven; cross-questioning drew from him the news that
"communications had passed, informal communications, he insisted, from"
"the Governor to Sir Robert, as well as to the Premier."
"""In fact,"" he said, ""poor old Flemyng's cutting up and down all over"
"the place. Glad it's his night on duty."""
"Presently Mr. Flemyng himself appeared, clamorous for cigars and drink,"
"but mighty discreet and vexatiously reticent. Yes, he had taken a letter"
"to Medland; yes, and another to Perry; no, he had no idea what the"
missives were about. He believed Medland was to see the Governor
"to-morrow, but it was beyond him to conjecture the precise object of the"
"interview. Was it resignation or dissolution? Really, he knew no more"
"than that waiter--and so forth; very likely his ignorance was real, but"
he diffused an atmosphere of suppressed knowledge which whetted the
curiosity of his audience to the sharpest edge.
A messenger entered and delivered a note to Puttock and another to
"Coxon. The two compared their notes for a moment, and went out together."
"The arguments rose furiously again, some maintaining that Medland must"
"disappear altogether, others vehemently denying it, a third party"
preferring to await the disclosures at the inquest before committing
themselves to an opinion. An hour passed; the noise in the streets began
"to abate, and the clock of the Roman Catholic cathedral hard by struck"
"twelve. Captain Heseltine yawned, stretched, and rose to his feet."
The young man had not been a fortnight in town before finding his
"capital doubled, as well as all bills paid to the astonished tradesmen,"
who seldom looked to receive their money within a twelvemonth.  He was
disposed to be troubled at this easy fashion of making money; but Lord
Sandford laughed him to scorn.
"""Zounds, man, what does it matter?  Those young popinjays are bound to"
lose their money to some one. Why not then to honest fellows like you
"and me, who pay our bills and do good to the community with the money?"
Scruples!  Faugh! you must rid yourself of them!  Sir Hugh Dumaresq’s
"son need not trouble himself thus.  Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow"
"we die.  Isn’t that good Scripture?""  But the reckless young lord paled"
a little at the sound of his own words.  He had seen sudden death once
too often for his peace of mind of late.
"In sooth, Grey felt but little scruple in taking his winnings.  The"
"young man was not greatly in advance of his age, although he was indued"
with a nature more finely strung and aspirations more lofty than
belonged to most.  Gambling was so much a matter of course both in this
"and in other lands, and the devotees of the amusement so numerous and so"
"bent upon their sport, that it would have needed stronger convictions"
than Grey as yet possessed to make any stand on such a point.  He took
"the same risks as the others, and if his coolness of head, steadiness of"
"hand, and quick observation and memory served to make for success in his"
"case, he rather regarded this as a witness to his superiority, and felt"
only a small sense of reluctance in pocketing his gains; which
reluctance he could only attribute to a lingering memory of words spoken
"by his mother when he was a growing boy, and news came to them from time"
"to time of Sir Hugh’s losses over cards, and the necessity for further"
retrenchments upon the already impoverished estate.
"with fifteen thousand of his soldiers around him, lifted this same"

"That men who, like Charlemagne and Napoleon, had reached the highest"
"pinnacle of human power, should seek to enhance their influence by"
"crowning their heads with one of the nails which, as their followers"
"believed, had pierced the Galilean's foot, is a richly suggestive fact."
But we must keep our tempted thoughts to another and less edifying line
at present.
When we had examined all the parts of the famous crown to our
"satisfaction, we stepped to the desk in the ante-room and paid our five"
"francs (one dollar), the regular price for the exhibition of the Iron"
"Crown, then left the cathedral, bought one or two post-card pictures of"
"the crown, and took the tram through the dreary weather back to Milan,"
well pleased with the results of our first pilgrimage to the shrine of
a real Roman Catholic relic in Italy.

"But on our arrival at Rome, a month later, we found that, interesting"
"as were the relics which we had seen or read of elsewhere, they were"
"nothing to those in the Eternal City itself. In this, as in everything"
else except such little matters as cleanliness and morality and
"truthfulness and honesty, Rome outvies all her rivals. It is only fair"
"to add, however, that, since the overthrow of the papal sovereignty and"
"the establishment of a capable government, Rome has improved immensely"
"in the matter of cleanliness, and even her immorality is not so"
"flaunting as it was. This is attested by the Hon. Guiseppe Zanardelli,"
"coins, and had thrown it into the pond because it was stolen money. ""But"

"water, there would be but little honesty left in the world. And if"
"the money had been stolen ten times over, still you had found it, and"
"charity begins at home. If you had kept the money, we might have passed"
the rest of our lives in peace and comfort. But you are a dunderhead and
"will stay a dunderhead, and I won't be tormented and burdened with you"
"any longer. Now you must get out and earn your own living."""
"So the boy had to go out into the wide world, and wandered about far"
and near looking for service. But wherever he went people found him too
"small or too weak, and said that they could make no use of him. At last"
"he came to a merchant. There they kept him to work in the kitchen, and"
he had to fetch wood and water for the cook. When he had been there for
"some time, the merchant decided to journey to far countries, and asked"
all his servants what he should buy and bring back home for them.
"After all had told him what they wanted, came the turn of the little"
fellow who carried wood and water for the kitchen. He handed him his
"four-shilling piece. ""Well, and what am I to buy for it?"" asked the"
"merchant. ""It will not be a large purchase."" ""Buy whatever it will"
"bring, it is honest money, that I know,"" said the boy. His master"
"promised to do so, and sailed away."
Now when the merchant had discharged his cargo in foreign parts and had
"reloaded, and had bought what his servants had desired, he went back to"
"his ship, and was about to shove off. Not until then did he remember"
"that the scullion had given him a four-shilling piece, with which to"
"buy him something. ""Must I go up to the city again because of this"
four-shilling piece? One only has one's troubles when one bothers with
"such truck,"" thought the merchant. Then along came a woman with a bag on"
"Rupert Greppel, strutting with hidalgic air, was concerned in bringing"
about several affairs. No one was hurt. There was much braying of asses.
"The Lord Montagu Askew, dainty, foppish, in the mode, and the"
"Honourable Rupert Greppel, hidalgic, head in air, stood before a shop"
window in the Rue de la Paix and gazed at their splendid reflections;
whilst past them moved on the pavement or whirled by in barouches
"the great world of Paris--_hig-lif_ sunning its butterfly wings,"
"honey-questing, sipping at any dew that the gods left lying abroad."
"Montagu Askew held his jade-handled cane mincingly, and he glowed with"
"a gentleman-like glow, for his dove-coloured little book of poems"
tinted all the bookstalls.
More than one woman of high rank this morning had stopped her carriage
to congratulate him on the exquisite lyric wherein the vast firmament
"at break of dawn was likened to the grey of a woman’s glove--indeed, it"
became the vogue of the drawing-rooms--people sang it.
"As a fact, Montagu Askew was acknowledged lord of chamber music."
"Indeed, in his slender careful verse was no rude hint of the"
full-blooded Rabelaisian love of life; it was innocent of the
suggestion of a large emotion; he played upon the accepted measures and
the well-authenticated rhyme; he startled with no surprises; he sounded
no new note--Montagu never forgot he was a gentleman. Not for him the
uncouthness to fling open loud-clanging gates to a new world. He was
"pretty and serenely mannered before everything, disdainful of them that"
"skipped a foot to the hot jigging blood, or such as showed a strong"
disdain; nor was he wanting in contempt for the natural emotions.
"When he condescended to so low an act as to seek nature, he walked"
"through the well-groomed spaces of the world, well-trimmed parks at the"

"To my mind the United Fruit Company, next to the Panama Canal, is the"
great phenomenon of the Caribbean world today. Some day some one with
knowledge will write a book about it as men have written the history of
"the British East India Company, or the Worshipful Company of Hudson Bay"
"Adventurers, for this distinctly American enterprise has accomplished a"
creative work so wonderful and so romantic as to entitle it to equal
literary consideration. Its coöperation with the Republic of Panama and
the manner in which it has followed the plans formulated by the Isthmian
Commission entitles it to attention in a book treating of Panama.

"The banana business is the great trade of the tropics, and one that"
"cannot be reduced in volume by new competition, as cane sugar was"
checked by beet sugar. But it is a business which requires special
machinery of distribution for its success. From the day the banana is
picked until it is in the stomach of the ultimate consumer the time
"should not exceed three weeks. The fruit must be picked green, as, if"
"allowed to ripen on the trees, it splits open and the tropical insects"
"infect it. This same condition, by the way, affects all tropical fruits."
All must be gathered while still unripe. The nearest wholesale market
"for bananas is New Orleans, five days’ steaming. New York is seven days"
away. That means that once landed the fruit must be distributed to
commission houses and agents all over the United States with the utmost
expedition lest it spoil in transit. There can be no holding it in
"storage, cold or otherwise, for a stronger demand or a higher market."
This means that the corporation must deal with agents who can be relied
upon to absorb the cargoes of the ships as regularly as they arrive.
know it!  I feel it!  The Old Lion is not dead yet!  He shall roar again
"in his native forest.  Say, boy, will you be my helper in this thing?"
"And in the gains which we shall make we will share and share alike."""
It was a very different sort of fame from anything Grey had pictured for
"himself, and for a moment he hesitated; for he realized that were this"
"dramatic sketch to take hold of the imagination of the town, and draw"
"fashionable audiences, he could scarcely avoid recognition, disguise"
himself as he might.  But as against this there was the pressing need of
the moment.  He was well-nigh penniless; his romance seemed likely to be
"but so much waste paper.  He was hiding now even from Dick, who"
"periodically visited London to see him, lest the honest fellow should"
insist upon maintaining him from his own small hoard.  Here was an
"opening, as it seemed, to something like prosperity; and the alternative"
of being drafted into the army as a pauper recruit was scarcely
"sufficiently attractive to weigh in the balance.  Moreover, there was"
something so earnest and pathetic in the glance bent upon him by the Old
"Lion that he had not the heart to say him nay, and he held out his hand"
with a smile.
"""I will be your helper; and as for the gains, let them be yours, and you"
"shall give me what wage I merit.  The play is yours, the thought is"
yours: it is for you to reap the harvest.  I am but the labourer—worthy
"of his hire, and no more."""
"The compact was sealed, and the old man then insisted that Grey should"
"take his bed for the night, as he must sit up and remodel his play upon"
"lines indicated by the young man, who had seen the field of Ramillies"
and the disposition of troops.  Grey furnished him with sundry diagrams
"and notes, and left him perfectly happy at his task, which would"
"doubtless occupy him during the night, whilst the weary guest slumbered"
peacefully upon the humble bed in the little alcove beyond the larger
previously opposed him at the Royal Society. The plagiarism was
subsequently discovered and led to much unpleasantness. It is not
necessary to refer any more to the subject except as explanation of the
fact that the determined hostility and misrepresentations of one man
succeeded for more than ten years to bar all avenues of publication for
his discoveries. But every cloud has its silver lining; this incident
"secured for him many true friends in England who stood for fair play,"
and whose friendship has proved to be a source of great encouragement to
him.
FURTHER DIFFICULTIES
Dr. Bose's next work in 1903 was the discovery of the identity of
response and of automatic activity in plant and animal and of the
nervous impulse in plant. These new contributions were regarded as of
such great importance that the Royal Society showed its special
appreciation by recommending it to be published in their Philosophical
transactions. But the same influence which had hitherto stood in his way
"triumphed once more, and it was at the very last moment that the"
"publication was withheld. The Royal Society, however, informed him that"
"his results were of fundamental importance, but as they were so wholly"
"unexpected and so opposed to the existing theories, that they would"
"reserve their judgment until, at some future time, plants themselves"
could be made to record their answers to questions put to them. This was
interpreted in certain quarters here as the final rejection of Dr.
"Bose's theories by the Royal Society, and the limited facilities which"
he had in the prosecution of his researches were in danger of being
withdrawn. And everything was dark for him for the next ten years. The
only thought that possessed him was how to make the plant give testimony
by means of its own autograph.
"There was a great deal of traffic between the town and station, and it"
"was supposed that the passenger traffic would pay the contractor well,"
apart from his mail subsidy. For Burmans are always free with their
"money, and the road was long and hot and dusty. I often passed that"
"coach as I rode. I noticed that the ponies were poor, very poor, and"
"were driven a little hard, but I saw no reason for interference. It did"
"not seem to me that any cruelty was committed, nor that the ponies were"
actually unfit to be driven. I noticed that the driver used his whip a
"good deal, but then some ponies require the whip. I never thought much"
"about it, as I always rode my own ponies, and they always shied at the"
"coach, but I should have noticed if there had been anything remarkable."
"Towards the end of the year it became necessary to renew the contract,"
and the contractor was approached on the subject. He said he was
willing to continue the contract for another year if the mail subsidy
was largely increased. He said he had lost money on that year's working.
When asked how he could possibly have lost considering the large number
"of people who were always passing up and down, he said that they did not"
ride in his coach. Only the European soldiers and a few natives of India
"came with him. Officers had their own ponies and rode, and the Burmans"
either hired a bullock-cart or walked. They hardly ever came in his
"coach, but he could not say what the reason might be."
"So an inquiry was made, and the Burmese were asked why they did not ride"
"on the coach. Were the fares too high?--was it uncomfortable? But no, it"
was for neither of these reasons that they left the coach to the
soldiers and natives of India. It was because of the ponies. No Burman
would care to ride behind ponies who were treated as these ponies
"were--half fed, overdriven, whipped. It was a misery to see them; it was"
twice a misery to drive behind them. 'Poor beasts!' they said; 'you can
"see their ribs, and when they come to the end of a stage they are fit to"
fall down and die. They should be turned out to graze.'
"refusal of Buddhists to take life. 'Buddhists,' they say, 'believe in"
the transmigration of souls. They believe that when a man dies his soul
"may go into a beast. You could not expect him to kill a bull, when"
perchance his grandfather's soul might inhabit there.' This is their
"explanation, this is the way they put two and two together to make five."
"They know that Buddhists believe in transmigration, they know that"
"Buddhists do not like to take life, and therefore one is the cause of"
the other.
I have mentioned this explanation to Burmans while talking of the
"subject, and they have always laughed at it. They had never heard of it"
before. It is true that it is part of their great theory of life that
"the souls of men have risen from being souls of beasts, and that we may"
so relapse if we are not careful. Many stories are told of cases that
"have occurred where a man has been reincarnated as an animal, and where"
what is now the soul of a man used to live in a beast. But that makes no
"difference. Whatever a man may have been, or may be, he is a man now;"
"whatever a beast may have been, he is a beast now. Never suppose that a"
"Burman has any other idea than this. To him men are men, and animals are"
"animals, and men are far the higher. But he does not deduce from this"
that man's superiority gives him permission to illtreat or to kill
animals. It is just the reverse. It is because man is so much higher
than the animal that he can and must observe towards animals the very
"greatest care, feel for them the very greatest compassion, be good to"
them in every way he can. The Burman's motto should be _Noblesse
"oblige_; he knows the meaning, if he knows not the words."
For the Burman's compassion towards animals goes very much farther than
a mere reluctance to kill them. Although he has no command on the
"subject, it seems to him quite as important to treat animals well during"
their lives as to refrain from taking those lives. His refusal to take
life he shares with the Hindu; his perpetual care and tenderness to all
"the article which is sold under the name of sago in our groceries, but"
"is mealy, tough, and almost elastic. The natives consider it a great"
"delicacy, and bake it into little cakes, or boil it into dumplings."
The main fleet of the Dobuans started some time in the second half of
"March from their villages, and went first to the beach of Sarubwoyna,"
"where they held a ceremonial distribution of food, eguya'i, as it is"
"called in Dobu. Then, offering the pokala to Aturamo'a and Atu'a'ine,"
"they sailed by way of Sanaroa and Tewara, passing the tabooed rock"
"of Gurewaya to the Amphletts. The wind was light and changeable,"
weak S.W. breezes prevailing. The progress of this stage of the
journey must have been very slow. The natives must have spent a
"few nights on the intermediate islands and sandbanks, a few canoes'"
crews camping at one spot.
"At that time I had already succeeded in reaching the Amphletts, and"
"had been busy for two or three weeks doing ethnographic work, though"
"not very successfully; for, as I have already once or twice remarked,"
the natives here are very bad informants. I knew of course that the
"Dobuan fleet was soon to come, but as my experience had taught me to"
"mistrust native time-tables and fixtures of date, I did not expect"
"them to be punctual. In this, however, I was mistaken. On a Kula"
"expedition, when the dates are once fixed, the natives make real and"
strenuous efforts to keep to them. In the Amphletts the people were
"busy preparing for the expedition, because they had the intention of"
joining the Dobuans and proceeding with them to the Trobriands. A few
"canoes went to the mainland to fetch sago, pots were being mustered and"
"made ready for stowing away, canoes were overhauled. When the small"
"expedition returned from the mainland with sago, after a week or so,"
"a sagali (in Amphlettan: madare), that is, a ceremonial distribution"
"of food was held on the neighbouring island, Nabwageta."

"He showed no interest whatever in the new plant, refusing even to look"
it over or to express an opinion upon the progress of the work; so they
"sent him out to the ship, where for days he remained in a toad-like"
"lethargy, basking in the sun, sleeping three-fourths of the time and"
spending his waking hours in repeating the awful tale of his
disgraceful peonage.
"To unload the machinery, particularly the heavier pieces, was by no"
"means a simple matter, owing to the furious tides that set in and out"
of the Kalvik River. The first mishap occurred during the trip on which
"the boilers were towed in, and it looked to Boyd less like an accident"
than a carefully planned move to cripple him at one stroke. The other
ships were busily discharging and the roadstead was alive with small
"craft of various kinds, when the huge boilers were swung over the side"
of _The Bedford Castle_ and blocked into position for the journey to
the shore. George and a half-dozen of his men went along with the load
"while Emerson remained on the ship. They were just well under way when,"
"either by the merest chance or by malicious design, several of the"
rival Company's towboats moored to the neighboring ships cast off. The
anchorage was crowded and a boiling six-mile tide made it difficult at
best to avoid collision.
"Hearing a confused shouting to shoreward, Boyd ran to the rail in time"
to see one of the Company tugs at the head of a string of towboats
bearing down ahead of the current directly upon his own slow-moving
lighter. Already it was so close at hand as to make disaster seem
inevitable. He saw Balt wave his arms furiously and heard him bellow
"profane warnings while the fishermen scurried about excitedly, but"
still the tug held to its course. Boyd raised his voice in a wild
"alarm, but had they heard him there was nothing they could have done."
and loved him. And so it was without the slightest feeling of misgiving
that she watched her lover quickly take down his coat and hat from the
"peg on the wall and start for the door. On the other hand, it must have"
required not a little courage on the man's part to have torn himself
"away from this lovely, if unconventional, creature, just as he was"
"beginning to love truly and appreciate her. But, then, Johnson was a man"
of no mean determination!
"Not daring to trust himself to words, Johnson paused to look back over"
his shoulder at the Girl before plunging forth into the night. But on
opening the door all the multitudinous wild noises of the forests
"reached his ears: Sounds of whispering and rocking storm-tossed pines,"
"sounds of the wind making the rounds of the deep canyon below them,"
"sounds that would have made the blood run cold of a man more daring,"
"even, than himself. Like one petrified he stood blinded, almost, by the"
"great drifts of snow that were being driven into the room, while the"
"cabin rocked and shook and the roof cracked and snapped, the lights"
"flickered, smoked, or sent their tongues of fire upward towards the"
"ceiling, the curtains swayed like pendants in the air, and while"
"baskets, boxes, and other small furnishings of the cabin were blown in"
every direction.
But it was the Girl's quick presence of mind that saved them from being
"buried, literally, under the snow. In an instant she had rushed past him"
"and closed both the outer and inner doors of the cabin; then, going over"
"to the window, she tried to look through the heavily frosted panes; but"
"the falling of the sleet and snow, striking the window like fine shot,"
made it impossible for her to see more than a few inches away.
"""Why, it's the first time I knew that it--"" She cut her sentence short"
"and ended with: ""That's the way we git it up here! Look! Look!"""
"was the pure voice of tragic sorrow. It is in the terrible moment when,"
"after the heroic strain of the sacrifice is over, Virginius realizes the"
"meaning of what he has done. Presumably wild with grief, he raves in"
language so startlingly akin to the ludicrous despairs of Pyramus and
"Thisbe that the modern reader, acquainted with the latter, is almost"

"Of such eloquence we might truly say with Theseus, 'This passion, and"
"the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad.'"
"In 1562 Tragedy, as we have said, took refuge in an imitation of the"
Senecan stage: translations of Seneca's tragedies had begun to appear in
"1559. _The Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex_, or _Gorboduc_, as it was"
"originally and is now most commonly named, marks a new departure for"
English drama. To understand this we ought perhaps to say something
"about the essential features of a Greek tragedy (Seneca's own model),"
and make a note of any special Senecan additions. What strikes one most
in reading a play of Aeschylus is the prominence given to a composite
and almost colourless character known as the Chorus (for though it
"consists of a body of persons, it speaks, for the most part, as one),"
"the absence of any effective action from the stage, the limited number"
"of actors, and the tendency of any speaker to expand his remarks into a"
"set speech of considerable length. This tendency, especially noticeable"
"in the Chorus, whose speeches commonly take the form of chants,"
"encouraged the faculty of generalizing philosophically, so that one is"
constantly treated to general reflections expressive rather of broad
wisdom and piety than of feelings directly and dramatically aroused;
"of undue friendliness with Sir Jhon the Priest, but he dare not say so."
"Tyb guesses his doubts, and in her turn suspects that he is inclined to"
rebel. So she makes the yoke heavier. Johan Johan has to invite Sir Jhon
"to eat a most desirable pie with them; but throughout the meal, with"
jealousy at his heart and the still greater pangs of unsatisfied hunger
"a little lower, he is kept busy by his wife, trying to mend a leaky"
bucket with wax. Surely never did a scene contain more 'asides' than are
uttered and explained away by the crushed husband! Finally overtaxed
"endurance asserts itself, and wife and priest are driven out of doors;"
but the play closes with a very pronounced note of uncertainty from the
victor as to what new game the vanquished may shortly be at if he be not
there to see.
The all-important feature to be noticed in Heywood's work is that here
we have the drama escaping from its alliance with religion into the
"region of pure comedy. Here is no well planned moral, no sententious"
"mouthpiece of abstract excellence, no ruin of sinners and crowning of"
"saints. Here, too, is no Vice, no Devil, although they are the chief"
"media for comedy in other Interludes, nor is there any buffoonery; even"
"of its near cousins, scuffling and fighting, only one of the three plays"
"has more than a trace. Hence the earlier remark, that Heywood was before"
his time. It is not devils in bearskins and wooden-sworded vices that
create true comedy; they belong to the realm of farce. Yet they
"continued to flourish long after Heywood had set another example, and"
"with them the cuffing of ears and drunken gambolling which we may see,"
"in the works of other men, trying to rescue prosy scenes from dullness."
"In _Johan Johan_ is simple comedy, the comedy of laughter-raising"
"dialogue and 'asides'. We do not say it is perfect comedy, far from it;"
but it is comedy cleared of its former alloys. It is the comedy which
Shakespeare refined for his own use in _Twelfth Night_ and elsewhere.

as an armed force ready to fight for the right of passage. In 1786 the
"Spaniards sought to subdue the territory, built forts on both the"
Atlantic and Pacific coasts and established a line of trading posts
connecting them. But the effort failed. The posts were abandoned. Today
the white man who tries to enter the Darien does so at the risk of his
life.
"In 1854 a navy exploring expedition of twenty-seven men, under command"
"of Lieutenant Isaac C. Strain, entered the jungle of the Darien at"
"Caledonia Bay, on the Atlantic side, the site of Patterson’s ill-fated"
colony. They purposed crossing the Isthmus and making a survey for a
"canal route, as an English adventurer not long before had"
asserted--falsely as it proved--that he had discovered a route by which
a canal could be built with but three or four miles of cutting. The
party carried ten days’ provisions and forty rounds of ball cartridge
"per man. They expected to have to traverse about forty or fifty miles,"
for which the supply of provisions seemed wholly adequate. But when
"they had cut their way through the jungle, waded through swamps and"
climbed hills until their muscles were exhausted and their clothing torn
"to tatters, they found themselves lost in the very interior of the"
Isthmus with all their food gone. Diaries kept by members of the party
show that they lived in constant terror of the Indians. But no attack
was made upon them. The inhabitants contented themselves with
"disappearing before the white men’s advance, sweeping their huts and"
fields clear of any sort of food. The jungle not its people fought the
invaders. For food they had mainly nuts with a few birds and the diet
"disturbed their stomachs, caused sores and loosened their teeth. The"
"bite of a certain insect deposited under the skin a kind of larva, or"
"worm, which grew to the length of an inch and caused the most frightful"
"torments. Despairing of getting his full party out alive, after they had"
"been twenty-three days fighting with the jungle, Strain took three men"
and pushed ahead to secure and send back relief. It was thirty-nine days
shall change all that some day; but what does a bachelor want with such
a house as this?  What should I be the better for a crowd of liveried
"servants, eating off their heads, idling away their time dicing and"
drinking?  What have I to give an army of scullions and cooks to do—I
"who seldom take a meal at home after my morning chocolate?  No, no; I"
know a trick worth two of that. I don’t ruin myself to keep a crew of
"fat, lazy rogues about me, cheating me at every turn.  Half a dozen"
fellows and a few kitchen wenches do well enow for me; but when Lady
Sandford comes to her husband’s home—ah well! then we shall see the
"difference."""
But though he talked jestingly from time to time of the Lady Sandford
"that was to be, he gave Grey no hint as to whether his fancy inclined"
more to one or another of the many gay maidens with whom he chatted and
"flirted, danced and romped, in the fashion of the day; and so"
bewildering and dazzling were these young madams and their surroundings
"that the newcomer was lost in a maze of wonder and bewilderment, and"
"found it hard to distinguish one face from another, until he met one,"
different from all the rest.
But Grey was not left idle; he had small time for musing.  The very
first day of his sojourn in London he was surrounded by a fluttering
"crowd of tailors, glove-sellers, barbers, fencers, sellers and purveyors"
"of every imaginable ware, who all professed their eagerness to serve"
"him, and quoted Lord Sandford as a patron who could swear to their"
honesty and the excellence of their goods.
"Into the midst of this motley throng Lord Sandford thrust himself,"
"laughing his great hearty laugh, and quickly sent to the right-about"
"two-thirds of the importunate crowd—a jest here, a keen thrust there, a"
"slap on back or shoulder in another quarter, emphasizing his forcible"
"hints.  And when the room was cleared of all but the lucky few, he flung"

"In modern times, the nurse, who is now receiving such complete"
"training for her duties with the children, should be ready to"
imitate the “dreamer” of the Indian tribe. I rejoice to find that
regular instruction in Story-telling is being given in many of the
institutions where the nurses are trained.
Some years ago there appeared a book by Dion Calthrop called “King
"Peter,” which illustrates very fully the effect of story-telling. It"
is the account of the education of a young prince which is carried on
"at first by means of stories, and later he is taken out into the arena"
of Life to be shown what is happening there--the dramatic appeal being
always the means used to awaken his imagination. The fact that only
_one_ story a year is told him prevents our seeing the effect from day
"to day, but the time matters little. We only need faith to believe that"
"the growth, though slow, was very sure."
"There is something of the same idea in the “Adventures of Telemachus,”"
"written by Fénélon for his royal pupil, the young Duke of Burgundy; but"
whereas Calthrop trusts to the results of indirect teaching by means of
"dramatic stories, Fénélon, on the contrary, makes use of the somewhat"
"heavy, didactic method, so that one would think the attention of the"
young prince must have wandered at times; and I imagine Telemachus was
"in the same condition when he was addressed at some length by Mentor,"
"who, being Minerva (though in disguise), should occasionally have"
displayed that sense of humour which must always temper true wisdom:
"Take, for instance, the heavy reproof conveyed in the following"
passage:
“Death and shipwreck are less dreadful than the pleasures that attack
Half-a-dozen problems of extreme national importance confront every
thinking English man and woman in 1907. The air is thick with their
"stir and movement, and so great is the noise and reverberation of them"
that true “royalty” of “_inward_ happiness” seems a thing impossible
"and past by in these troubled times. Be that as it may, it is quite"
certain that one of the most real and pressing of these problems is
that summed up in the stock phrase “Record Low Birth-rate.”
We hear a great deal about the doings of a class of people who are
"referred to as “The Smart Set,” and it is actually said that its"
influence is having a serious effect upon the national character. I do
not believe it for a moment. It seems a folly to suppose that a
handful of champagne corks floating on a cess-pool has any
far-reaching influence upon the English home. I mention that small
"section of society constituted by the idle and luxurious rich,"
"because, whatever their vices are, they are being used as whipping-boy"
for enormous numbers of people whose lives are equally guilty with
theirs in at least one regard--in the matter of which I am writing
now.
I propose in this essay to discuss the question of the decline in the
birth-rate from the Christian and Catholic standpoint. There is only
"one perfect philosophy, and all other half-true philosophies in the"
"light of which we might consider such a momentous matter as this, lead"
only to the conclusion that expediency is the highest good. Without
the incentive of the Christian Faith and without the light of the
Incarnation one may sit in a corner and think till “all’s blue in
cloud cuckoo land.” Christianity can alone be reconciled with
"Economics, theory and practice celebrating always the marriage of the"
"King’s son, the wedding of Heaven and Earth, the spiritual and the"
material. Plato knew that it was impossible to raise the Greek state
"to the level of his philosophic principles, and Aristotle frankly"
"In the twelve preceding chapters, we have followed an expedition"
from Sinaketa to Dobu. But branching off at almost every step from
"its straight track, we studied the various associated institutions"
"and underlying beliefs; we quoted magical formulæ, and told"
"mythical stories, and thus we broke up the continuous thread of the"
"narrative. In this chapter, as we are already acquainted with the"
"customs, beliefs and institutions implied in the Kula, we are ready"
to follow a straight and consecutive tale of an expedition in the
"inverse direction, from Dobu to Sinaketa."
"As I have seen, indeed followed, a big uvalaku expedition from"
"the South to the Trobriands, I shall be able to give some of the"
"scenes from direct impression, and not from reconstruction. Such"
a reconstruction for one who has seen much of the natives' tribal
life and has a good grip over intelligent informants is neither very
"difficult nor need it be fanciful at all. Indeed, towards the end"
"of my second visit, I had several times opportunities to check such"
"a reconstruction by witnessing the actual occurrence, for after my"
first year's stay in the Trobriands I had written out already some
"of my material. As a rule, even in minute details, my reconstructions"
"hardly differed from reality, as the tests have shown. None the less,"
it is possible for an Ethnographer to enter into concrete details
with more conviction when he describes things actually seen.
"In September, 1917, an uvalaku expedition was led by Kouta'uya"
"from Sinaketa to Dobu. The Vakutans joining them on the way, and the"
"canoes of the Amphletts following them also, some forty canoes finally"
arrived at the western shore of Dawson Straits. It was arranged then
and there that a return expedition from that district should visit
"Sinaketa in about six months' time. Kauyaporu, the esa'esa (headman)"
"of Kesora'i hamlet in the village of Bwayowa, had a pig with circular"
So after the small and imperious royal maid had been carried screaming
"and battling upstairs by Doña Susana and the globular major-domo, La"
"Giralda, richly rewarded in golden coin of the realm, and with all the"
"requisite information as to the palace, betook herself back to the gate"
"by which she had left the ass. This she loaded again, and driving it"
"before her she retraced her steps past the corner of the palace, and so"
to the porter's lodge by the great gate.
Here she was presently ushered out by a mumbling old woman who informed
"her that her husband and son had both gone to Madrid with the troops,"
"but would undoubtedly return in an hour or two, a statement which with"
her superior information the old gipsy took leave to doubt.
"The town of San Ildefonso lay beneath the chateâu, and to her right as"
La Giralda issued from the gates. The houses were of an aspect at once
"grave and cheerful. They had been built mostly, not for permanent"
"residence, but in order to accommodate the hordes of courtiers and their"
"suites who, in the summer months, followed the royal personages over the"
mountains from Madrid.
"As most of these had fled at the first invasion of the cholera, the"
"windows, at this period of the year generally bright with flowers and"
"shaded with emerald barred _jalousies_, were closely shut up, and upon"
several of the closed doors appeared the fatal black and white notices
"of the municipality, which indicated that there either was or had been a"
case of the plague within the infected walls.
La Giralda went down the streets uttering the long wailing cry which
indicated that she had firewood to sell. But though she could have
"disposed of the milk from the goats over and over again, there appeared"
"but little demand for her other commodity, even though she called,"
"""_Leña-a-a-a! Ah, leña-a-a-a!_"" from one end of San Ildefonso to the"
He has made out of the teaching a new teaching that is very far from
"that of the Buddha, and the teaching is this: When a man dies his soul"
"remains, his 'I' has only changed its habitation. Still it lives and"
"breathes on earth, not the effect, but the soul itself. It is reborn"
"among us, and it may even be recognised very often in its new abode."
"And that we should never forget this, that we should never doubt that"
"this is true, it has been so ordered that many can remember something of"
these former lives of theirs. This belief is not to a Burman a mere
"theory, but is as true as anything he can see. For does he not daily see"
"people who know of their former lives? Nay, does he not himself, often"
"vaguely, have glimpses of that former life of his? No man seems to be"
"quite without it, but of course it is clearer to some than others. Just"
"as we tell stories in the dusk of ghosts and second sight, so do they,"
"when the day's work is over, gossip of stories of second birth; only"
that they believe in them far more than we do in ghosts.
A friend of mine put up for the night once at a monastery far away in
the forest near a small village. He was travelling with an escort of
"mounted police, and there was no place else to sleep but in the"
"monastery. The monk was, as usual, hospitable, and put what he had, bare"
"house-room, at the officer's disposal, and he and his men settled down"
for the night.
"After dinner a fire was built on the ground, and the officer went and"
sat by it and talked to the headman of the village and the monk. First
"they talked of the dacoits and of crops, unfailing subjects of interest,"
and gradually they drifted from one subject to another till the
"Englishman remarked about the monastery, that it was a very large and"
fine one for such a small secluded village to have built. The monastery
"was of the best and straightest teak, and must, he thought, have taken a"
"very long time and a great deal of labour to build, for the teak must"
"advantage, was now slightly in advance."
The black stallion had just reached the downward dip leading to the deep
ditch filled with gorse bushes. His rider had had perforce to pull him
"up somewhat, lest he should slip and fall, for the ground was sandy and"
treacherous.  But Don Carlos had been born and bred to this sort of wild
"work, and dashing onwards and downwards with the agility of a deer, came"
"neck and neck with his rival, and having passed the Arab, cleared with a"
"bound the treacherous gully, landing true and safe upon the opposite"
"side.  The Arab followed in his tracks, his rider taking advantage of"
"the lead given; but the black stallion slipped and snorted, could not be"
"made to try the leap till another of the horses came up and took it,"
after which he sprang across with a vicious energy which tried the
"horsemanship of his rider, and tore like a wild thing after the leading"
pair.
These had cleared one after the other the wall and ditch; but the Arab
"was showing signs of distress, whilst Don Carlos looked fresh and eager"
as at the start.  There now remained only a quarter of a mile of smooth
"sward, and then the last critical jump; and Grey, knowing himself first,"
"and not knowing what had betided his rivals, sailed happily onward,"
"secure of victory, though he heard behind him the thud of flying horse"
"hoofs, and knew that the black stallion was not beaten yet.  It was he"
"who snorted with such excitement and fury, and seemed to awaken thunders"
with his iron-shod hoofs.
"One glance over his shoulder, and Grey passed his whip very lightly"
across the neck of Don Carlos. The gallant animal sprang forward like an
"arrow from a bow, showing how well within himself he had been travelling"
so far.  The sound of other beating hoofs was fainter now.  Grey looked
"keenly at the great obstacle looming up in his path, and measured the"
"height at various places, deciding where the leap could best be taken."
"sitting in my room talking to them, when a knock came at the door, and"
"I found there a poor woman belonging to the neighbourhood, but who also"
combined in my dream the page-boy at a dear friend's house. From this
"friend, whom I had not heard from for some time, the woman bore a large"
"letter. She tore it open in my presence, saying, ""It says here that the"
"bearer is to open this,"" and produced from it another letter, a large"
document of a legal character in my friend's handwriting. When the woman
began to open the second letter I remonstrated; I was sure that there was
"some mistake, that that letter was private, and that no one else ought to"
"see it. The woman, however, firmly insisted that she must carry out her"
instructions; so we had a long discussion. After a time I called Mrs. F.
and appealed to her. She agreed with me that the instructions must only
"mean that the bearer was to open the outer envelope, not the inner letter."
"At last I took out five shillings and gave it to the woman, telling her"
that I would assume all the responsibility for opening the letter myself.
"With this she went away well satisfied, saying (as she would in real"
"life), ""All right, Mrs. ----, you're a lady, and you know. All right,"
"my dear."" Then at last I was able to tear open my letter and read these"
"words: ""_Always use Sunlight Soap_."" My vexation was extreme.'"
On another occasion the same dreamer experienced remorse. She imagined she
"was in a restaurant, and the girl behind the counter pointed to a barrel"
"of beer--a golden barrel, she said, with a magic key--which could only be"
"opened by the owner. The dreamer declared, however, that she could open"
"it, and, producing a key, proceeded to do so, handing round beer to the"
"bystanders. Then she realised that she had been stealing, and was full of"
"remorse. She asked a friend if she ought to tell the owner, but the friend"
"replied, 'By no means.' This conclusion of the dream seems to indicate"
"that the moral sense, though present in dreams, is apt to be impaired."
In yet another dream this dreamer exhibited a curious combination of moral
"sensibility and criminal indifference. She imagined that, while walking"
envy and undeserved hatred borne to me by the Lord Keeper.'[161] It is
not difficult to see in the Archbishop's relations to the Lord Keeper an
explanation of his dream.
"If, however, wishes, conscious or unconscious, are often fulfilled"
"in dreams, and if, as we have seen reason to conclude, symbolism is"
"a fundamental tendency of dreaming activity, it is inevitable that"
"wish-dreams should sometimes take on a symbolic form. It is thus, for"
"instance, that I interpret my dream of being in an English cathedral and"
seeing on the wall a notice to the effect that at evensong on such a day
"the edifice will not be illuminated, in order to avoid attracting moths;"
"I awake with a slight headache, and the unilluminated cathedral was"
the symbol of the coolness and absence of glare which one desires when
suffering from headache.
"There cannot, also, be any doubt that erotic wishes frequently make"
"themselves felt as dreams, both in the infantile and the symbolic form."
It is sufficient to bring forward one illustration. It is furnished
"by a young lady of somewhat neurotic tendencies and heredity, aged"
"twenty-three, musical and intelligent, who was in love with her"
"music-master, the organist at her church. The dream was written down at"
"the time. 'I was at the school of my childhood, and I was told that I"
"was St. Agnes Virgin and Martyr, and in five minutes' time I was to be"
beheaded with a large knife. The sheen of the blade frightened me so much
that I asked if instead I might be strangled by the man I was in love
with. Permission was given if I could induce him to come in time. I ran
"to our church (saying to myself that I knew it was a dream, but that I"
"_must_ see what he would say) over huge stones that cut my bare feet, and"
"wondered what age I was living in, longing to meet some women in order to"
"find out. When I did, they all wore crinolines. I rushed up the central"
"aisle, which was full of people, thinking that, as I was going to be"
"killed, nothing could matter. Mr. T. (the organist) was giving a choir"
"eclipses them."" The Revolution was evidently gaining completer hold"
"over his mind and was somewhat blurring his insular sentiments, when a"
rebuff from Paoli further weakened his ties to Corsica. Buonaparte had
"dedicated to him his work on Corsica, and had sent him the manuscript"
"for his approval. After keeping it an unconscionable time, the old man"
now coldly replied that he did not desire the honour of Buonaparte's
"panegyric, though he thanked him heartily for it; that the"
consciousness of having done his duty sufficed for him in his old age;
"and, for the rest, history should not be written in youth. A further"
request from Joseph Buonaparte for the return of the slighted
"manuscript brought the answer that he, Paoli, had no time to search"
"his papers. After this, how could hero-worship subsist?"
"The four months spent by Buonaparte at Auxonne were, indeed, a time of"
disappointment and hardship. Out of his slender funds he paid for the
"education of his younger brother, Louis, who shared his otherwise"
"desolate lodging. A room almost bare but for a curtainless bed, a"
"table heaped with books and papers, and two chairs--such were the"
surroundings of the lieutenant in the spring of 1791. He lived on
"bread that he might rear his brother for the army, and that he might"
"buy books, overjoyed when his savings mounted to the price of some"
coveted volume.
Perhaps the depressing conditions of his life at Auxonne may account
for the acrid tone of an essay which he there wrote in competition for
"a prize offered by the Academy of Lyons on the subject--""What truths"
"and sentiments ought to be inculcated to men for their happiness."" It"
was unsuccessful; and modern readers will agree with the verdict of
one of the judges that it was incongruous in arrangement and of a bad
"and ragged style. The thoughts are set forth in jerky, vehement"
"clauses; and, in place of the _sensibilité_ of some of his earlier"
"effusions, we feel here the icy breath of materialism. He regards an"
This same lady was always terribly distressed when she had to order a
"fowl to be killed for her husband's breakfast, even if she had never"
"seen it before. I have seen her, after telling the cook to kill a fowl"
"for breakfast, run away and sit down in the veranda with her hands over"
"her ears, and her face the very picture of misery, fearing lest she"
should hear its shrieks. I think that this was the one great trouble to
"her in her marriage, that her husband would insist on eating fowls and"
"ducks, and that she had to order them to be killed."
"As she is, so are most Burmans. If there is all this trouble about"
"fowls, it can be imagined how the trouble increases when it comes to"
goats or any larger beasts. In the jungle villages meat of any kind at
all is never seen: no animals of any kind are allowed to be killed. An
officer travelling in the district would be reduced to what he could
"carry with him, if it were not for an Act of Government obliging"
"villages to furnish--on payment, of course--supplies for officers and"
troops passing through. The mere fact of such a law being necessary is
sufficient proof of the strength of the feeling against taking life.
"Of course, all shooting, either for sport or for food, is looked upon as"
disgraceful. In many jungle villages where deer abound there are one or
two hunters who make a living by hunting. But they are disgraced men.
"They are worse than fishermen, and they will have a terrible penalty to"
pay for it all. It will take much suffering to wash from their souls the
"cruelty, the blood-thirstiness, the carelessness to suffering, the"
"absence of compassion, that hunting must produce. 'Is there no food in"
"the bazaar, that you must go and take the lives of animals?' has been"
"said to me many a time. And when my house-roof was infested by sparrows,"
"who dropped grass and eggs all over my rooms, so that I was obliged to"
"shoot them with a little rifle, this was no excuse. 'You should have"
"built a sparrow-cote,' they told me. 'If you had built a sparrow-cote,"
they would have gone away and left you in peace. They only wanted to
"At one point, indeed, they passed near enough to distinguish in the far"
"north the snow-flecked buttresses of the Sierra de Moncayo. But these,"
"they knew, were the haunts of their Carlist allies. The towns and"
"villages of the plain, however, were invariably held by Nationals, and"
"it had often gone hard with them, had not Sergeant Cardono detached"
"himself from the cavalcade, and, venturing alone into the midst of the"
"enemy, by methods of his own produced the materials for many an"
"excellent meal. At last, one day the Sergeant came back to the party"
"with an added gloom on his long, lean, leathern-textured face. He had"
"brought with him an Estramaduran ham, a loaf of wheaten bread, and a"
double string of sausages. But upon his descending into the temporary
"camp which sheltered the party in the bottom of a _barranco_, or deep"
crack in the parched plateau overgrown with scented thyme and dwarf
"oak, it became obvious that he had news of the most serious import to"
communicate.
"He called Rollo aside, and told him how he had made his way into a"
"village, as was his custom, and found all quiet--the shops open, but"
"none to attend to them, the customs superintendent in his den by the"
"gate, seated on his easy chair, but dead--the presbytery empty of the"
"priest, the river bank dotted with its array of worn scrubbing boards,"
"but not a washerwoman to be seen. Only a lame lad, furtively plundering,"
had leaped backward upon his crutch with a swift drawing of his knife
and a wolfish gleam of teeth. He had first of all warned the Sergeant to
"keep off at his peril, but had afterwards changed his tone and confessed"
"to him that the plague was abroad in the valley of the Duero, and that"
he was the only being left alive in the village save the vulture and the
prowling dog.
"""The plague!"" Sergeant Cardono had gasped, like every Spaniard stricken"
sick at the very sound of the word.
"western colleague, and last but not least, the point of view of the"
Indian pupils themselves. In all these respects his experience had been
wide and varied. He had both been an undergraduate and a graduate of the
Calcutta University with vivid realization of an Indian student's
aspirations; he had then become a student of conservative Cambridge and
democratic London. And during his frequent visits to Europe and America
he had become acquainted with the inner working of the chief
universities of the world. Finally he had the unique privilege of being
"connected with the Presidency College for thirty-one years, from which"
no temptation could sever him. He had the deepest sense of the sacred
vocation of the teacher. They may well be proud of a consecrated
"life--consecrated to what? To the guidance of young lives, to the making"
"of men, to the shaping and determining of souls in the dawn of their"
"existence, with their dreams yet to be realised."
Education in the West and in the East showed how different customs and
"ways might yet express a common ideal. In India the teacher was, like"
"the head of a family, reverenced by his pupils so deeply as to show"
itself by touching the feet of their master. This in no servile act if
we come to think of it; since it is the expression of the pupils' desire
"for his master's blessings, called down from heaven in an almost"
"religious communion of souls. This consecration is renewed every day,"
calling forth patient foresight of the teacher. As the father shows no
"special favour, but lets his love and compassion go out to the weakest,"
so it is with the Indian teacher and his pupil. There is the relation
"something very human, something very ennobling. He would say it was"
essentially human rather than distinctively Eastern. For do we not find
something very like it in Mediaeval Europe? There too before the coming
of the modern era with its lack of leisure and its adherence to system
"and machinery, there was a bond as sacred between the master and his"
"pupils. Luther used to salute his class every morning with lifted hat,"
"""I bow to you, great men of the future, famous administrators yet to be,"
"about 40 years of age at the time of his death. He was remarkable, even"
"among his remarkable companions, for several things. First of all, he only"
drank tea--thus being the only total abstainer known to the fraternity.
"Also he was a strict disciplinarian, and on board his ships all lights had"
"to be extinguished by 8 p.m., any of the crew who wished to continue"
drinking after that hour had to do so on the open deck. But try as he
would this ardent apostle of abstemiousness was unable to put down
"drinking. If Roberts had lived to-day, no doubt he would have been on the"
council of the local vigilance committee. He would allow no women aboard
"his ships, in fact he made it a law that any man who brought a woman on"
board disguised as a man was to suffer death. Roberts allowed no games at
"cards or dice to be played for money, as he strongly disapproved of"
"gambling. He was a strict Sabbatarian, and allowed the musicians to have a"
"rest on the seventh day. This was as well, for the post of musician on a"
"pirate ship was no sinecure, as every pirate had the right to demand a"
tune at any hour of the day or night. He used to place a guard to protect
"all his women prisoners, and it is sadly suspicious that there was always"
the greatest competition amongst the worst characters in the ship to be
appointed sentinel over a good-looking woman prisoner. All quarrels had to
"be settled on shore, pirate fashion, the duellists standing back to back"
armed with pistol and cutlass. Roberts would have no fighting among the
crew on board his ship.
Bartholomew must have looked the very part of a pirate when dressed for
"action. A tall, dark man, he used to wear a rich damask waistcoat and"
"breeches, a red feather in his cap, a gold chain round his neck with a"
"large diamond cross dangling from it, a sword in his hand, and two pairs"
of pistols hanging at the end of a silk sling flung over his shoulders.
"We first hear of Roberts as sailing, in honest employ, as master of the"
"_Princess_ (Captain Plumb), from London in November, 1719, bound for the"
"coast of Guinea to pick up a cargo of ""black ivory"" at Anamaboe. Here his"
"her eyes.  It was the first he had ever seen bent on him, and he was"
struck afresh with the pure unsullied beauty of this girl’s face.  Truth
"to tell, his first attraction towards her had been the rumour of her"
"fortune, for he was more deeply in debt than he wished the world to"
know; but something in the remoteness and isolation in which she seemed
to wrap herself piqued and interested him; for his jaded palate required
"fresh food when it was to be had, and the vein of manliness and strength"
which his life had never altogether warped or destroyed responded to the
sincerity he read in Lady Geraldine’s fair face.
The curtain was down now.  For a few minutes he spoke of the play and
"the water apparatus, worked by a windmill on the roof, which was"
exciting so much interest in London.  Geraldine’s eyes meantime
travelled round the box.  She saw her mother engrossed in gay talk with
a small circle of admirers; but one of these edged himself somewhat away
"from the rest, and finally stood apart, leaning against the wall of the"
box and surveying the house from that vantage point.
"Geraldine’s eyes were riveted with some interest upon this newcomer,"
whom she was certain she had never seen before.  In some indefinable way
he was different from the men she had been used to meet at such places.
"For one thing, he wore his own hair; and the floating brown curls, like"
"Cavalier love-locks, seemed to her infinitely more becoming than the"
mass of false hair which was so much in vogue in all ranks save the
"lowest.  His dress, too, though far more simple than that of the beaux"
"fluttering round her mother, seemed to her far more graceful and"
"distinguished.  His stockings, breeches, and vest were all of white,"
"with a little silver frosting.  His coat was of pale blue, with silver"
"buttons; and his lace cravat, though small and unostentatious, was rich"
"in quality, and fastened by a beautiful pearl.  He carried neither muff"
"nor snuff-box, cane nor toothpick.  He did not simper nor ogle, nor look"
as though he desired to attract the eyes of the house upon himself.  But
written and spoken.
I speak from personal experience; and when I look back upon the
"reviews I wrote ten years ago, it is with invariable consternation,"
and sometimes a real sense of shame.
"Nevertheless, there is some criticism of the religious novel which"
must be taken seriously. I have maintained that men generally in
"England are in a state of theological confusion, but that they are"
interested in religion if they can be induced to consider it. There
"is, as the great African Presbyter wrote seventeen hundred years ago,"
a natural response in the hearts of men to the chief articles of the
Christian Faith. There is a _Testimonium animæ naturaliter
christianæ_. But there are some who can only be described by a
quotation: “They are the enemies of the cross of Christ.” They are
determined that the Catholic creed shall have no place in the counsels
and considerations of social legislation. Of Jesus Christ they have
"said, “We will not have this man to reign over us;” and if there be"
any chance that a man’s books may catch the eye of the public and
"rouse people to think whether opportunism is really statesmanship, and"
"empiricism in politics really prudent, if, in a word, the principles"
"of Christianity are offered as a solution of social problems, then"
the author is attacked on every side. It is suggested that his
"intention is insincere, that his knowledge is inadequate. The things"
which have been part of his painful discipline and development are
described as his accepted environment. If a Bishop happens to find an
"illustration for a sermon in his pages, or a prominent Nonconformist"
"divine recognizes that the laity like to read them, and says so; if"
any of those true hearts who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity
"have been ready to see that men who have been rescued _de profundis_,"
men who have had experience of [Greek: ta bathea tou satana] are not
"thereby disqualified for duty in the field of Faith; if, in a word,"
"till the outside and inside layers are gone, and there remains only a"
"red, flat tablet, polished on both sides. In the middle of it, a hole"
"is drilled through by means of a pump drill--gigi'u--(see Plate LI),"
"and a number of such perforated discs are then threaded on a thin,"
"but tough stick (see Plate LII), with which we have already met in"
the myth. Then the cylindrical roll is rubbed round and round on
"the flat sandstone, until its form becomes perfectly symmetrical"
"(see Plate LII). Thus a number of flat, circular discs, polished"
"all round and perforated in the middle, are produced. The breaking"
"and the drilling, like the diving are done exclusively by men. The"
polishing is as a rule woman's work.
This technology is associated with an interesting sociological relation
between the maker and the man for whom the article is made. As has
"been stated in Chapter II, one of the main features of the Trobriand"
organisation consists of the mutual duties between a man and his
wife's maternal kinsmen. They have to supply him regularly with yams
"at harvest time, while he gives them the present of a valuable now and"
then. The manufacture of kaloma valuables in Sinaketa is very often
associated with this relationship. The Sinaketan manufacturer makes his
"kutadababile (necklace of large beads) for one of his relatives-in-law,"
"while this latter pays him in food. In accordance with this custom, it"
happens very frequently that a Sinaketan man marries a woman from one
"of the agricultural inland villages, or even a woman of Kiriwina. Of"
"course, if he has no relatives-in-law in one of these villages, he"
"will have friends or distant relatives, and he will make the string"
"for one or the other of them. Or else he will produce one for himself,"
and launch it into the Kula. But the most typical and interesting
"case is, when the necklace is produced to order for a man who repays"
"it according to a remarkable economic system, a system similar to"
"the payments in instalments, which I have mentioned with regard to"
"canoe making. I shall give here, following closely the native text,"
standing motionless against the wall. The fellow seemed as startled at
"the encounter as Emerson, and with a sharp exclamation leaped away and"
vanished into the gloom. Boyd lost no time in gaining the plank runway
"that led to the dock, and finding an angle in the building, backed into"
"it and waited, half-suspecting that he had stumbled into a trap. He"
reflected that both the hour and the circumstances were unpropitious;
"for in case he should meet with foul play, Marsh might plausibly claim"
"that he had been mistaken for a marauder. He determined, therefore, to"
proceed with the greatest caution. From his momentary glimpse of the
"man as he made off, he knew that he was tall and active--just the sort"
of person to prove dangerous in an encounter. But if his suspicions
"were correct there must be others close by, and Boyd wondered why he"
"had heard no signal. After a breathless wait of a moment or two, he"
"stole cautiously out, and, selecting the darkest shadows, slipped from"
one to another till he was caught by the sound of voices issuing from
the yawning entrance of the main building on his right. The next moment
his tension relaxed; one of the speakers was a woman. Evidently his
"alarm had been needless, for these people, whoever they were, made no"
"effort to conceal their presence. On the contrary, the woman had raised"
"her tone to a louder pitch, although her words were still"
undistinguishable.
"Greatly relieved, Boyd was about to go on, when a sharp cry, like a"
"signal, came in the woman's voice, a cry which turned to a genuine wail"
"of distress. The listener heard a man's voice cursing in answer, and"
"then the sound of a scuffle, followed at length by a choking cry, that"
"brought him bounding into the building. He ran forward, recklessly, but"
before he had covered half the distance he collided violently with a
piece of machinery and went sprawling to the floor. A glance upward
"revealed the dim outlines of a ""topper,"" and showed him farther down"
"the building, silhouetted briefly against the lesser darkness of the"
"windows, two struggling figures. As he regained his footing, something"
"began to prescribe them, not only as a vehicle for the exhibition of"
"wholesome but unattractive information, but as having a remedial value"
"of their own. “The intellectual anodyne of the nineteenth century,” I"
remember that somebody called them--perhaps it was Sir Arthur Helps.
It came about that those who had a secret and timid predilection for
"the story-book, but blushed a little if at Mudie’s counter they"
"ventured to ask for a novel, found that their ordinary reading of"
Biography and Memoirs revealed some unsuspected sympathies of the
illustrious and wise. Who would have thought that Darwin devoured
"novels and Dean Church did not disdain them, and that Mr. Gladstone"
sat up all night to finish _John Inglesant_? The respectable
"pater-familias has long ceased to proscribe novel reading, and the"
most austere biographer no longer hides as a revelation of weakness
"his hero’s literary divertisements. Finally, in this year of Grace"
1906 we are boldly told that Archbishop Temple could stand an
"examination in Miss Yonge’s novels, and on one occasion was heard"
keenly discussing with Lord Rosebery the careers of the May family in
the _Daisy Chain_ as though they were living acquaintances. From being
"recognized as a recreation the novel has developed into a power, and"
Charles Dickens was a pioneer in its progress. It is the custom
amongst certain “superior persons” to sneer at the novel with a
"purpose, and to suggest that authors attained remunerative results by"
taking some subject which was already ripe for discussion and weaving
round it a web of fiction.
"Undoubtedly there is danger to-day of such artifice, but I maintain"
that the great reforms of the past century owed much to writers whose
purpose was perfectly innocent. Cardinal Newman has told us of the
"literary influence of Sir Walter Scott, who turned men’s minds in the"
direction of the Middle Ages.
"“The general need,” he said, “of something deeper and more attractive"
"purged away, leaving to the author complete liberty alike in character"
"and action. When that came, Tragedy returned to the stage, a stranger"
with strange stories to tell. Persia and Ancient Rome sent their tyrants
and their heroines to contest for public favour with home-born knaves
and fools. Nor were the newcomers above borrowing the services of those
"same knaves and fools. The Vice was given a place, low clownish fellows"
"were admitted to relieve the harrowed feelings, and our old"
"acquaintance, Herod, was summoned from the Miracles to lend his aid."
Yet even so--and probably because it was so--Tragedy was ill at ease.
"She had called in low comedy and rant to please the foolish, only to"
"find herself infected and degraded by their company. Moreover, the"
"bustle of incident, the abrupt changes from grave to gay and to grave"
"again, jangled her sad majestic harmonies with shrill interrupting"
discords. It had not been so in Greece. It had not been so even in
"Italy, where Roman Seneca, fearing the least decline to a lower plane of"
"dignity and impressiveness, had disciplined tragedy by an imposition of"
artificial but not unskilful restraints. In place of the strong
"unbroken sweep of a resistless current, which characterized the"
"evolution of an Aeschylean drama, he had insisted on an orderly division"
"of a plot into acts and scenes, as though one should break up the sheer"
plunge of a single waterfall into a well-balanced group of cascades. Yet
"he was wise in his generation, securing by this means a carefully"
"proportioned development which, in the absence of that genius which"
"inspired the Greek dramatists, might otherwise have been lost. Once"
"strong and free in the plays of Aeschylus and his compeers, hampered and"
constantly under guidance but still dignified and noble in the Senecan
"drama, Tragedy now found herself debased and almost caricatured in the"
English Interlude stage. Fortunately the danger was seen in time.
"English writers, face to face with self-conscious tragedy, realized that"
here at least was more than unaided native art could compass. Despairing
"of success if they persisted in the old methods, they fell back"
"practice in the vestry. I ran up to him and said: ""Come at once, I am"
"going to be killed."" He became very angry, and said: ""Do go away; you are"
"always interrupting my choir practice."" I said: ""Don't you understand? I"
"am going to be killed at once; there is a knife hanging over my head, but"
"I would rather be strangled by you, and they said I could if I fetched you"
"in time."" As soon as he understood that he came at once. Then it seemed"
"in the dream that we were married, and had a son, who was to be a musical"
"composer. I said I must say goodbye to this son first, and told the nurse"
"to bring him to me. When he came I said: ""Good-bye, I am going to be"
"killed."" He said, ""Mother, am I a boy or a girl? When I am with boys I"
"don't seem like them, and they call me a girl, and yet I don't look like"
"a girl."" I replied: ""You are both in one, because you are going to be a"
"perfect musical genius.""' In this dream, which represents the fulfilment"
"in sleep of an affection unsatisfied in life, we see side by side the"
"infantile and the symbolic fulfilments of the erotic wish, culminating in"
a gifted musical child. The wish to be strangled is an undoubted erotic
"symbol,[162] and it is significant that in the course of the dream the"
"accepted death by strangulation became fused with marriage, although the"
"idea of death still inconsistently survives, doubtless because dream"
consciousness failed to realise that the accepted form of death was a
subconsciously furnished symbol of the consummation of marriage.
The wish-dream of Freud's type has presented itself for consideration
"here, because it is a special and elaborate illustration of symbolism"
in dreaming. The important place of symbols in dreaming is by no means
"dependent on the validity of this particular type of dream, and we may now"
proceed to continue the discussion of the significance of the symbolic
tendency during sleep in its most important form.
The symbols we have so far been mainly concerned with have been the
result of a tendency of dreaming consciousness to objectify feelings and
affections within the organism in concrete objects or processes outside
ONE AGAINST MANY.
The beautiful and socially popular Duchess de la Santoisie sat her at
"brilliantly appointed dinner-table, and flashed her bright eyes"
"comprehensively round the board,--her party was complete. She had"
secured twenty of the best-known men and women of letters in all
"London, and yet she was not quite satisfied with the result attained."
"One dark, splendid face on her right hand had taken the lustre out of"
"all the rest,--one quiet, courteous smile on a mouth haughty, yet"
"sweet, had somehow or other made the entertainment of little worth in"
"her own estimation. She was very fair to look upon, very witty, very"
"worldly-wise,--but for once her beauty seemed to herself defective and"
"powerless to charm, while the graceful cloak of social hypocrisy she"
was always accustomed to wear would not adapt itself to her manner
"tonight so well as usual. The author of ""Nourhalma"" the successful poet"
"whose acquaintance she had very eagerly sought to make, was not at all"
"the kind of man she had expected,--and now, when he was beside her as"
"her guest, she did not quite know what to do with him."
"She had met plenty of poets, so called, before,--and had, for the most"
"part, found them insignificant looking men with an enormous opinion of"
"themselves, and a suave, condescending contempt for all others of their"
"craft; but this being,--this stately, kingly creature with the noble"
"head, and far-gazing, luminous eyes,--this man, whose every gesture was"
"graceful, whose demeanor was more royal than that of many a crowned"
"monarch,--whose voice had such a singular soft thrill of music in its"
"tone,--he was a personage for whom she had not been prepared,--and in"
whose presence she felt curiously embarrassed and almost ill at ease.
And she was not the only one present who experienced these odd
"sensations. Alwyn's appearance, when, with his friend Villiers, he had"
"During his meteoric career as a pirate, the name of Blackbeard was one"
that created terror up and down the coast of America from Newfoundland to
"Trinidad. This was not only due to the number of ships Teach took, but in"
"no small measure to his alarming appearance. Teach was a tall, powerful"
"man, with a fierce expression, which was increased by a long, black beard"
which grew from below his eyes and hung down to a great length. This he
"plaited into many tails, each one tied with a coloured ribbon and turned"
"back over his ears. When going into action, Teach wore a sling on his"
"shoulders with three pairs of pistols, and struck lighted matches under"
the brim of his hat. These so added to his fearful appearance as to strike
"terror into all beholders. Teach had a peculiar sense of humour, and one"
that could at times cause much uneasiness amongst his friends. Thus we are
"told that one day on the deck of his ship, being at the time a little"
"flushed with wine, Blackbeard addressed his crew, saying: ""Come let us"
"make a Hell of our own, and try how long we can bear it,"" whereupon Teach,"
"with several others, descended to the hold, shut themselves in, and then"
"set fire to several pots of brimstone. For a while they stood it, choking"
"and gasping, but at length had to escape to save themselves from being"
"asphyxiated, but the last to give up was the captain, who was wont to"
boast afterwards that he had outlasted all the rest.
"Then there was that little affair in the cabin, when Teach blew out the"
"candle and in the dark fired his pistols under the table, severely"
"wounding one of his guests in the knee, for no other reason, as he"
"explained to them afterwards, than ""if he did not shoot one or two of them"
"now and then they'd forget who he was."""
"Teach kept a log or journal, which unfortunately is lost, but the entries"
"for two days have been preserved, and are worth giving, and seem to smack"
"of Robert Louis Stevenson in ""Treasure Island."" The entries, written in"
"Teach's handwriting, run as follows:"
gratified that a subject of his should be performing the important
"duties of Secretary to the Brussels Government, and his notice of"
"von Giesselin gave the latter considerable prestige, for a time; an"
influence which he certainly exercised as far as he was able in
softening the edicts and the intolerable desire to annoy and
exasperate on the part of the Prussian Governors of province and
kingdom. He even interceded at times for unfortunate British or
"French subjects, stranded in Brussels, and sometimes asked Vivie"
about fellow-countrymen who sought this intervention.
This caused her complicated annoyances. Seeing there was some hope
"in interesting her in their cases, these English governesses,"
"tutors, clerks, tailors' assistants and cutters, music-hall singers,"
grooms appealed to Vivie to support their petitions. They paid her
"or her mother a kind of base court, on the tacit assumption that"
she--Vivie--had placed Colonel von Giesselin under special
"obligations. If in rare instances, out of sheer pity, she took up a"
case and von Giesselin granted the petition or had it done in a
"higher quarter, his action was clearly a personal favour to her; and"
"the very petitioners went away, with the ingratitude common in such"
"cases, and spread the news of Vivie's privileged position at the"
Hotel Impérial. It was not surprising therefore that in the small
circles of influential British or American people in Brussels she
was viewed with suspicion or contempt. She supported this odious
"position at the Hotel Impérial as long as possible, in the hope that"
Colonel von Giesselin when he had realized the impossibility of
using herself or her mother in any kind of intrigue against the
British Government would do what the American Consul General
professed himself unable or unwilling to do: obtain for them
passports to proceed to Holland.
"Von Giesselin, from December, 1914, took up among other duties that"
"In 1832, Ferrier became an advocate at Edinburgh, but it does not"
appear that he had any serious idea of practising at the Bar. This is
the period at which we know that the passion for metaphysical
"speculation laid hold of him,--a passion which is unintelligible and"
"inexplicable to those who do not share in it,--and as Ferrier could not"
"clearly say in what direction this was leading him, as far as practical"
"life was concerned, he probably deemed it best to attach himself to a"
"profession which left much scope to the adopter of it, to strike out"
lines of his own. What led Ferrier to determine to spend some months of
the year 1834 at Heidelberg it would be extremely interesting to know.
The friend first quoted writes: 'I cannot tell of the influences under
which he devoted himself to metaphysics. My opinion is that there were
"none, but that he was a philosopher born. He attached himself at once"
"to the fellowship of Sir William Hamilton, to whom he was introduced by"
a common friend--I think the late Mr. Ludovic Colquhoun. I know that he
looked on Sir William at that time as his master.'
Probably the friendship with Hamilton simply arose from the natural
attraction which two sympathetic spirits feel to one another. It is
"clear that at this time Ferrier's bent was towards metaphysics, and"
"that, as Mr. Inglis says, this bent was born with him and was only"
beginning to find its natural outlet; therefore it would be very
natural to suppose that acquaintance would be sought with one who was
"at this time in the zenith of his powers, and whose writings in the"
_Edinburgh Review_ were exciting liveliest interest. A casual
acquaintanceship between the young man of three-and-twenty and the
matured philosopher twenty years his senior soon ripened into a
"friendship, not perhaps common between two men so different in age. It"
is perhaps more remarkable considering the differences in opinion on
philosophical questions which soon arose between the two; for it is
just as difficult for those whose point of view is fundamentally
"value--all the greater because a child is familiar with the subject,"
and the stories gain fresh significance from the spoken or winged word
as compared with the mere reading. Whether we should keep to the actual
"text is a matter of individual experience. Professor R. G. Moulton,"
whose interpretations of the Bible Stories are so well known both in
"England and the States, does not always confine himself to the actual"
"text, but draws the dramatic elements together, rejecting what seems to"
"him to break the narrative, but introducing the actual language where"
it is the most effective. Those who have heard him will realise the
success of his method.
"There is one Bible story which can be told with scarcely any deviation,"
"and that is the story of Nebuchadnezzar and the Golden Image. Thus, I"
"think it wise, if the children are to succeed in partially visualizing"
"the story, that they should have some idea of the dimensions of the"
Golden Image as it would stand out in a vast plain. It might be well
to compare those dimensions with some building with which the child is
"familiar. In London the matter is easy, as the height will compare,"
"roughly speaking, with that of Westminster Abbey. The only change in"
the text I should adopt is to avoid the constant enumeration of the
"list of rulers and the musical instruments. In doing this, I am aware"
"that I am sacrificing something of beauty in the rhythm,--on the other"
"hand, for narrative purpose, the interest is not broken. The first time"
"the announcement is made, that is, by the Herald, it should be in a"
"perfectly loud, clear and toneless voice, such as you would naturally"
use when shouting through a trumpet to a vast concourse of people
scattered over a wide plain; reserving all the dramatic tone of voice
for the passage where Nebuchadnezzar is making the announcement to the
three men by themselves. I can remember Professor Moulton saying that
all the dramatic interest of the story is summed up in the words “But
"if Not....” This suggestion is a very helpful one, for it enables us to"
"work up gradually to this point, and then, as it were, _unwind_, until"
of the capital which had seldom or never been equalled in the history of
the Colony. He had caused them to be called together in order to raise
"their enthusiasm, and to elicit from them a visible, unmistakable pledge"
"of support. But, when he stood before them, bareheaded, in vain"
"beckoning for silence, their cries and cheers told him that his task was"
"rather to moderate than to stir up, and the first part of his speech was"
a somewhat laboured proof of the consistency of gatherings of that
nature with the proper independence of representative assemblies. The
"people heard him through this argument in respectful silence, clapping"
"their hands when, at the end of it, he paused before he passed to the"
"second part of his speech. At the first sign of attack, at the first"
quietly drawn contrast between what the seceders had promised and what
"they were doing, his audience was a changed one. Fierce murmurs of"
"assent and groans became audible now, and when Medland, caught by the"
"contagion that spread to him from his listeners, gave rein to his"
"feelings, and launched into a passionate declaration that, to his mind,"
the liberty claimed for members did not mean liberty to betray those
"who had trusted them, the murmurs and groans rose into one tumult of"
"savage applause, and men raised both hands over their heads and shook"
"them, as though they would have clenched every word that fell from him"
with a blow of the fist.
"Daisy Medland sat just behind her father, exulting in his triumph, and,"
"at every happy stroke, glancing at Norburn, and by sharing her joy with"
"him doubling his. When the Premier had finished, and the last resolution"
"had been carried, she ran to him, crying, ""Splendid! I never heard you"
"so good. Wasn't he splendid?"" and looking so completely joyful that"
Medland was sure she must quite have forgotten Dick Derosne. She took
"his arm, and they made their way together to a carriage which was in"
"waiting. An escort of police surrounded it, to save the Premier from his"
"friends, and he, with Daisy, Norburn, and Mr. Floyd, the Treasurer, got"
in without disturbance. The coachman drove off rapidly down the main
"still a great and mighty future before us, a future that will justify"
"our ancestry. In talking about ancestry, do we ever realise that the"
only way in which we can do honour to our past is not to boast of what
our ancestors have done but to carry out in the future something as
"great, if not greater than they. Are we to be a living nation, to be"
proud of our ancestry and to try to win renown by continuous
achievements? These mighty monuments that I see around me tell us what
has been done till very recent times. I have travelled over some of the
greatest ruins of the Universities of India. I have been to the ruins of
the University of Taxilla in the farthest corner of India which
attracted the people of the west and the east. I had been to the ruins
"of Nalanda, a University which invited all the west to gain knowledge"
under its intellectual fostering. I had been all there and seen them. I
have come here also and want to visit Conjeevaram. But are you to foster
the dead honours or to try to bring back your University in India and
drag once more from the rest of the world people who would come down and
derive knowledge from India? It is in that way and that way alone we can
win our self-respect and make our life and the life of the nation
worthy. The present era is the era of temples of learning. In order to
erect temples of learning we require all the offerings of our mighty
"people. We want to erect temples and ""viharas"" which are so"
indispensable to the study of nature and her secrets. It is a problem
which appeals to every thoughtful Indian. It is by the effort of the
people and by their generosity that all these mighty temples arose; and
now are we to worship the dead stones or are we to erect living temples
so that the knowledge that has been made in India shall be perpetuated
in India? I received requests from the different Universities in America
and Germany to allow students from those countries to come and learn the
"science that has been initiated in India. Now, is this knowledge to pass"
beyond our boundaries to that again in future time we may have to go to
the west to get back this knowledge or are we to keep this flame of
learning burning all the time?
disapproved. But at the same time he hardly dared to expect that the
labours of a lifetime could be set aside at the bidding of a man so
"much his junior, and to say the truth it is doubtful whether Hamilton"
"ever fully grasped his opponent's point of view. Still, Ferrier tells"
us that from first to last his whole intercourse with Sir William
Hamilton was marked with more pleasure and less pain than ever attended
"his intercourse with any human being, and after Hamilton was gone he"
cherished that memory with affectionate esteem. A touching account is
given in Sir William's life of how during that terrible illness which
"so sadly impaired his powers and nearly took his life, Ferrier might be"
seen pacing to and fro on the street opposite his bedroom window during
"the whole anxious night, watching for indications of his condition, yet"
"unwilling to intrude on the attendants, and unable to tear himself from"
the spot where his friend was possibly passing through the last agony.
Such friendship is honourable to both men concerned.
"Perhaps, then, it was this intercourse with kindred spirits (for many"
such were in the habit of gathering at the Professor's house) that
caused Ferrier finally to determine to make philosophy the pursuit of
"his life--this combined, it may be, with the interest in letters which"
he could not fail to derive from his own immediate circle. He was in
"constant communication with Susan Ferrier, his aunt, who encouraged his"
"literary bent to the utmost of her power. Then Professor Wilson, his"
"uncle, though of a very different character from his own, attracted him"
by his brightness and wit--a brightness which he says he can hardly
"bring before himself, far less communicate to others who had not known"
"him. Perhaps, as the same friend quoted before suggests, the attraction"
was partly due to another source. He says: 'How Ferrier got on with
Wilson I never could divine; unless it were through the bright eyes of
his daughter. Wilson and Ferrier seemed to me as opposite as the poles;
"the one all poetry, the other all prose. But the youth probably yielded"
to the mature majesty and genius of the man. Had they met on equal
"and Persian frontiers meet, as well as that of the district known as"
"the Sarhad, with the least possible delay, and as I knew the Raiders"
"were across my path even before I left Quetta, I saw no reason for"
altering previously made plans or for delaying my departure.
Accordingly I started on the journey to Robat early on the morning of
the 27th. I reckoned it would take at least five days to reach that
"town, as the route it would be necessary to follow would be fully"
three hundred and seventy-five miles. I already knew that it would
be essential to make many long détours round freshly formed sand
"dunes and other obstacles, for it must be remembered that there was"
no proper road but only a rough camel-track continually blown over
"and obliterated by sand, along which supplies were taken from India"
"to Robat, and the small garrison posts which we had established at"
various points Northward.
The mention of small garrison posts may lead the reader to suppose
"that this area of wild activity was fairly well policed, but, as a"
"fact, one battalion of Indian infantry, a regiment of Indian cavalry"
"and, I believe, four mountain guns, constituted the entire force"
of regulars holding a front of close upon three hundred miles. It
"was small wonder, then, that the Sarhad tribes, commonly known as"
"Raiders, from their raiding proclivities, who knew every inch of the"
"country, could climb like cats, and could do long marches on short"
"rations, had succeeded in cutting our lines of communication, and in"
carrying off our supplies.
"I could, therefore, look for no further help for the time in the"
matter of supplies and so took with me all that I thought would be
necessary for our three hundred and seventy-five mile trek across the
sandy wastes lying between Nushki and Robat.
"and the tithes being parcelled among the landowners, the king, and the"
"clergy. Naturally a large part of the lands, as before, was divided"
"among the nobles,[680] who were in this way converted to Protestantism."
Thus whereas heathen kings had originally embraced Christianity to
"enable them to consolidate their power, Christian kings embraced"
Protestantism to enable them to recover wealth and power from the
Catholic Church. Creed all along followed interest;[681] and the people
had small concern in the change.[682]
"Norway, being under the same crown, followed the course of Denmark. In"
Sweden the powerful Gustavus Vasa saw himself forced at the outset of
his reign to take power and wealth from the Church if he would have any
"of his own; and after the dramatic scene in the Diet of Westeras (1527),"
in which he broke out with a passionate vow to renounce the crown if he
"were not better supported,[683] he carried his point. The nobles, being"
"""squared""[684] by permission to resume such of their ancestral lands as"
"had been given to churches and convents since 1454, and by promise of"
"further grants, forced the bishops to consent to surrender to the king"
"their castles and strongholds, and to let him fix their revenues; all"
which was duly done. The monasteries were soon despoiled of nearly all
"their lands, many of which were seized by or granted in fief to the"
barons;[685] and the king became head of the Church in as full a degree
"as Henry VIII in England;[686] sagaciously, and in part unscrupulously,"
creating for the first time in Scandinavia a strong yet not wholly
"despotic monarchy, with such revenues from many sources[687] as made"
"possible the military power and activity of Gustavus Adolphus, and"
"later the effort of Charles XII to create an ""empire""--an effort which,"
"necessarily failing, reduced Sweden permanently to her true economic"
basis.
"Apart from those remarkable episodes, the development of the"
"Scandinavian States since the sixteenth century has been, on their"
"What had he ever been taught of theology, the Divine word to man? In"
"his school-days, if his father was an income tax payer he probably had"
"a weekly lesson in “Divinity,” when he construed a few verses of the"
"Gospels in the Greek Testament, and showed up to his master, now and"
"then, a map of the journeying of the Apostle Paul in Asia Minor and"
"Eastern Europe. If his father expected him to be confirmed, in due"
"course, some lessons in the catechism were added for his benefit, but"
prudent pedagogues took care not to endanger the popularity of a
"school, whether public or private, by any definite teaching which"
might be accused of being dogmatic. The head-master was probably a
"person of unsuspected orthodoxy, with a possible deanery or bishopric"
in view for his days of superannuation. His sermons in chapel used to
"set a fine standard of conduct before the boys, and were gracefully"
free from all mention of controversial questions. In due course they
"were published with the title _Sermons at Yarrow_, and enterprising"
parents turning over their pages would find little to criticize and
"much to admire. The Cross, if presented at all in these publications,"
was so bespangled with rhetorical jewellery that “Jews might kiss and
Infidels adore.” And the children of Israel as public-school boys were
never painfully conscious of any great difference between themselves
and their baptized companions. But unfortunately only a few of the
boys came under the civilizing instruction of the Chief. Bright young
"athletes from Oxford and Cambridge, lured into the ranks of pedagogy"
"by their love of football and cricket, were the assistant-masters. A"
"regular salary with holiday for a fourth of the year, the prospect of"
"early marriage, and a remunerative boarding-house, attracted them to a"
"pleasant position, and they had no wish to rebel against the"
time-table which made them teachers of “Divinity” for at least one
hour in the week. All educated people should be tolerably familiar
"with a book so largely used in quotation as the Bible, and the"
succession of the Kings of Israel and Judah could be used in
"would have made it illegal, during the War, to teach the doctrine that"
"the Kaiser’s Government should be overthrown by force; and, since then,"
the support of Kolchak or Denikin against the Soviet Government would
"have been illegal. Such consequences, of course, were not intended, and"
result only from bad draughtsmanship. What was intended appears from
"another law passed at the same time, applying to teachers in State"
schools. This law provides that certificates permitting persons to teach
in such schools shall be issued only to those who have “shown
satisfactorily” that they are “loyal and obedient to the Government of
"this State and of the United States,” and shall be refused to those who"
"have advocated, no matter where or when, “a form of government other"
than the Government of this State or of the United States.” The
"committee which framed these laws, as quoted by the _New Republic_, laid"
it down that the teacher who “does not approve of the present social
"system......must surrender his office,” and that “no person who is not"
eager to combat the theories of social change should be entrusted with
the task of fitting the young and old for the responsibilities of
"citizenship.” Thus, according to the law of the State of New York,"
Christ and George Washington were too degraded morally to be fit for the
"education of the young. If Christ were to go to New York and say,"
"“Suffer the little children to come unto me,” the President of the New"
"York School Board would reply: “Sir, I see no evidence that you are"
"eager to combat theories of social change. Indeed, I have heard it said"
"that you advocate what you call the _kingdom_ of heaven, whereas this"
"country, thank God, is a republic. It is clear that the Government of"
your kingdom of heaven would differ materially from that of New York
"State, therefore no children will be allowed access to you.” If he"
"failed to make this reply, he would not be doing his duty as a"
functionary entrusted with the administration of the law.
"The effect of such laws is very serious. Let it be granted, for the sake"
"of argument, that the government and the social system in the State of"
"When I was a boy I made an occasional invasion of my father’s study,"
and in the absence of more congenial matter tried to extract some
amusement from the shelves devoted to Christian apologetics. At any
"rate the pictures of the portly divines, which sometimes prefaced"
"their polemics, interested me, and I was sometimes allured to read a"
few pages of their scripture. I remember that I enjoyed the sub-acid
"flavour of Bishop Butler’s advertisement, prefixed to the First"
"Edition of his _Analogy_, at an early age, and I have thought lately"
that in certain circles one hundred and seventy years have not greatly
modified the mental attitude.
"Hear what the Rector of Stanhope who, as Horace Walpole said, was"
"shortly to be “Wafted to the see of Durham in a cloud of metaphysics,”"
says about his literary contemporaries--
"“It is come, I know not how, to be taken for granted, by many persons"
"that Christianity is not so much as a subject for inquiry, but that it"
"is now at length discovered to be fictitious, and accordingly they"
"treat it as if, in the present age, this were an agreed point among"
"all people of discernment, and nothing remained but to set it up as a"
"principal subject of mirth and ridicule, as it were, by way of"
reprisals for its having so long interrupted the pleasures of the
world.”
Perhaps the difference between the times of George the Second and
Edward the Seventh may be best discerned in the status and calibre of
"the popular penmen who in either age have found, or furnished"
amusement in a tilt against the Catholic Faith.
"The man in the street, as we know him, did not exist in the eighteenth"
"century. He is the predominant person to-day, and he requires the"
"services of able authors to assure him of immunity, when he is"
"awkwardly upon classical imitation and, by assiduous study tempered by a"
"wise criticism, achieved success."
Only two plays with any claim to the designation of tragedies have
"survived to us from the Interludes, neither of them of much interest."
"_Cambyses_ (1561), by Thomas Preston, has all the qualities of an"
"imperfect Interlude. There are the base fellows and the clowns, Huff,"
"Ruff, Snuff, Hob and Lob; the abstractions, Diligence, Shame, Common's"
"Complaint, Small Hability, and the like; the Vice, Ambidexter, who"
"enters 'with an old capcase on his head, an old pail about his hips for"
"harness, a scummer and a potlid by his side, and a rake on his"
shoulder'; and the same scuffling and horseplay when the comic element
is uppermost. Incident follows incident as rapidly and with as trifling
"motives as before. In the course of a short play we see Cambyses, king"
"of Persia, set off for his conquests in Egypt; return; execute"
"Sisamnes, his unjust deputy; prove a far worse ruler himself; shoot"
"through the heart the young son of Praxaspes, to prove to that too-frank"
counsellor that he is not as drunk as was supposed; murder his own
"brother, Smirdis, on the lying report of Ambidexter; marry, contrary to"
"the law of the Church and her own wish, a lovely lady, his cousin, and"
then have her executed for reproaching him with the death of his
"brother; and finally die, accidentally pierced by his own sword when"
"mounting a horse. All these horrors, except the death of the lady, take"
"place on the stage. Thus we have such stage-directions as, 'Smite him in"
"the neck with a sword to signify his death', 'Flay him with a false"
"skin', 'A little bladder of vinegar pricked', 'Enter the King without a"
"gown, a sword thrust up into his side, bleeding.' Of real tragedy there"
"is little, the hustle of crime upon crime obliterating the impression"
which any one singly might produce. Yet even in this crude orgy of
bloodshed the melancholy voice of unaffected pathos can be heard
mourning the loss of dear ones. It speaks in the farewells of Sisamnes
"and his son Otian, and of Praxaspes (the honest minister) and his little"
to illustrate and to inculcate the doctrine of the marriage of men
"and gods, the information given by Clement with respect to the ritual"
makes it clear that such was their object. But in that other rite of
"the same goddess, that namely which celebrated the story of Adonis,"
the whole _motif_ of the drama was the continuance of Aphrodite’s love
"for him after his death, a love so strong that it prevailed upon the"
gods of the lower world to let him return for half of every year to
"the upper world and the arms of his mistress. Here, though expressed"
"in different imagery, is the same doctrine as that which underlay the"
"drama of Eleusis. Here again is an illustration, or rather, for those"
"who were capable of religious ecstasy, a proof, of the doctrine that"
"the dead yet lived, and in that life were both in body and in soul one"
with their gods. For ‘thrice-beloved Adonis who even in Acheron is
beloved[1458]’ was the type and forerunner of all those who had part in
his mysteries.
In another version this legend of Adonis is brought into even closer
relation with the Eleusinian mysteries by the introduction of
"Persephone[1459]. To her is assigned the part of a rival to Aphrodite,"
and being equally enamoured of the beautiful Adonis she is glad of his
"death whereby he is torn from the arms of Aphrodite in the upper world,"
and enters the chamber of the nether world where her love in turn may
"have its will; but in the end Aphrodite descends to the house of Hades,"
and a compact is arranged between the two goddesses by which each in
turn may possess Adonis for half the year. This version of the story is
"cruder, but its teaching is obviously the same--Adonis, the favourite"
"of heaven in this life, and the precursor of all who by initiation in"
"the mysteries win heaven’s favour, survives in the lower world with"
"both body and soul unimpaired by death, and is admitted to wedlock with"
the great goddess of the dead.
The same doctrine again seems to have been the basis of certain
"industry and capital, exasperated even the Catholic ministers in"
"Flanders by his proposed taxes, and finally by imposing them enraged"
"into fresh revolt the people he had crushed and terrorised, till they"
were eager to offer the sovereignty to the queen of England. When
"Requesens came with pacificatory intentions, it was too late; and the"
Pacification of Ghent (1576) was but a breathing-space between grapples.
What finally determined the separation and independence of the Dutch
"Provinces was their maritime strength. Antwerp, trading largely on"
"foreign bottoms, represented wealth without the then indispensable"
weapons. Dutch success begins significantly with the taking of Brill
"(1572) by the gang of William van der Marck, mostly pirates and"
"ruffians, whose methods William of Orange could not endure.[780] But"
they had shown the military basis for the maritime States. It was the
"Dutch fleet that prevented Parma's from joining ""the"" Armada under"
"Medina-Sidonia,[781] thereby perhaps saving England. Such military"
genius and energy as Parma's might have made things go hard with the
"Dutch States had he lived, or had he not been called off against his"
judgment to fight in France; but his death well balanced the
"assassination of William of Orange, who had thus far been the great"
sustainer and welder of the movement of independence. Plotted against
"and vilified by the demagogues of Ghent, betrayed by worthless fellow"
"nobles, Teutonic and French alike; chronically insulted in his own"
"person and humiliated in that of his brother John, whom the States"
treated with unexampled meanness; stupidly resisted in his own
"leadership by the same States, whose egoism left Maestricht to its fate"
"when he bade them help, and who cast on him the blame when it fell;"
thwarted and crippled by the fanaticism and intolerant violence of the
Protestant mobs of the towns; bereaved again and again in the
"vicissitude of the struggle, William turned to irrelevance all"
imputations of self-seeking; and in his unfailing sagacity and fortitude
he finally matches any aristocrat statesman in history. Doubtless he
the gas leaped into flame.
The old attic was gone.
In its place was a picturesque medieval room of quaint nooks and
"demure corners, with stiff wooden settles of curving line against the"
"wall, and low bookshelves round the rest of the walls; and above, on a"
"deep coloured frieze under the low ceiling, was a long space of rigid"
"trees from the land of Morris, green trees that yielded vasty purple"
and golden fruits on close-bunched foliage--and in the blue intervals
between the stilted trees sailed white-sailed many-coloured galleons
and purple triremes--and on the wall beneath the frieze and above
the long curves of the low bookshelves was a yellow space splashed
"with huge orange-coloured dogs, with emerald eyes and scarlet mouths,"
that leaped along on hind legs to the chasing of each other and an
occasional orange stag amidst mighty flowering plants that seemed
"to whirl in autumn tints with cunning running lines half-flower,"
"half-leaf. And here and there was a knight in armour, and a hawk upon"
"his wrist, and clothes upon his horse, and about him was always written"
_Soe sirre Gallahydde gotte hyme pryckynge to hys pilgrymmynges_; and
when the knight was faded blue the writing was russet green; but when
the knight was russet green the writing about him was faded blue. And
"here and there was a lady with hair in plait, and she wove at a loom,"
"and sang with ruddy lips, and the writing about her was _Chaunted the"
Queene ande weaved hyre tale righte Fyttyngelye_; and when the queen
"was orange yellow the writing was white, and when the queen was white"
"the writing was orange yellow. The old bookshelves, with their gay"
"untidiness of many-coloured books, were gone; and in their place in"
more severe order on dark oaken bookshelves of suave design were ranked
books all bound exactly alike in uniform yellow half-calf bindings. The
"floor was rich-stained and polished, and in the middle of it lay a rug"
of the yellow of saffron.
"our faces towards Nuremberg, and in a greater degree after we reached"
"that city, we embarked on a wider current of adventure, a fuller and"
"less selfish life. If we had still our own cares and griefs, hopes and"
"perils--as must be the case, I suppose, until we die--we had other"
"common ones which we shared with tens of thousands, rich and poor,"
gentle and simple. We had to dread sack and storm; we prayed for
relief and safety in company with all who rose and lay down within the
walls. When a hundred waggons of corn slipped through the Croats and
"came in, or Duke Bernard of Weimar beat up a corner of the Burgstall"
"and gave Wallenstein a bad night, we ran out into the streets to tell"
"and hear the news. Similarly, when tidings came that Tzerclas with his"
"two thousand ruffians had burned the King of Sweden's colours, put on"
"green sashes, and marched into the enemy's camp, we were not alone in"
"our gloomy anticipations. We still had our private adventures, and I"
"am going to tell them. But besides these, it should be remembered that"
"we ran the risks, and rose every morning fresh to the fears, of"
"Nuremberg. When bread rose to ten, to fifteen, to twenty times its"
"normal price; when the city, where many died every day of famine,"
"plague, and wounds, began to groan and heave in its misery; when"
through all the country round the peasants crawled and died among the
"dead; when Wallenstein, that dark man, heedless of the fearful"
"mortality in his own camp, still sat implacable on the heights and"
"refused all the king's invitations to battle, we grew pale and gloomy,"
stern-eyed and thin-cheeked with the rest. We dreamed of Magdeburg as
they did; and as the hot August days passed slowly over the starving
"city and still no end appeared, but only with each day some addition"
"of misery, we felt our hearts sink in unison with theirs."
"And we had to share, not their lot only, but their labours. We had not"
"been in the town twenty-four hours before Steve, Jacob, and Ernst were"
"enrolled in the town militia; to me, either out of respect to my lady,"
"or on account of my stature, a commission as lieutenant was granted."

"In the case of Astrology,--a relatively more advanced method of"
"divination,--the underlying theory rested on the supposed complete"
correspondence between movements and phenomena in the heavens and
"occurrences on earth. The gods, being identified with the heavenly"
"bodies,--with the moon, sun, planets, and fixed stars--or as we might also"
"put it, the heavenly bodies being personified as gods, the movements in"
the heavens were interpreted as representing the activity of the gods
"preparing the events on earth. Therefore, he who could read the signs in"
the heavens aright would know what was to happen here below. Astrology
corresponded in a measure to the modern Weather Bureau in that it enabled
"one to ascertain a little in advance what was certain to happen,"
"sufficiently so in order to be prepared for it. Compared with Hepatoscopy,"
Astrology not only represents a form of divination that might be
designated as semi-scientific--only relatively scientific of course--but
"also occupies a higher plane, because there was no attempt involved to"
induce a deity unfavorably disposed to change his mind. The signs were
there; they pointed unmistakably to certain occurrences on earth that were
certain to occur and it was the task of the diviner--the =bârû= or
'inspector' as the Babylonian called him--to indicate whether what the
gods were preparing would be beneficial or harmful. Both Hepatoscopy and
Astrology as developed by the Babylonians and Assyrians =bârû=-priests
"exerted a wide influence, the former spreading to the Hittites and"
"Etruscans and through the one or the other medium to Greeks and Romans[6],"
while Babylonian-Assyrian Astrology passing to the Greeks became the basis
"for Graeco-Roman and mediaeval Astrology, profoundly influencing the"
religious thought of Europe[7] and in a modified form surviving even to
our own days. The chain of evidence has recently been completed[8] to
prove the direct transfer of the cuneiform astrological literature to
Greek astrologers and astronomers. The possibility also of a spread or at
least of a secondary influence of both systems to the distant East is also
Slowly the great side-doors of the Cathedral swung back on their
"hinges,--and out on the steps in a glorious blaze of sunlight came Poet"
"and Angel together. The one, a man in the full prime of splendid and"
"vigorous manhood,--the other, a maiden, timid and sweet, robed in gray"
"attire with a posy of white flowers at her throat. A simple girl, and"
"most distinctly human,--the fresh, pure color reddened in her"
"cheeks,--the soft springtide wind fanned her gold hair, and the"
sunbeams seemed to dance about her in a bright revel of amaze and
curiosity. Her lustrous eyes dwelt on the busy Platz below with a
vaguely compassionate wonder--a look that suggested some far
"foreknowledge of things, that at the same time were strangely"
"unfamiliar. Hand in hand with her companion she stood,--while he,"
"holding her fast, drunk in the pureness of her beauty, the love-light"
"of her glance, the holy radiance of her smile, till every sense in him"
was spiritualized anew by the passionate faith and reverence in his
"heart, the marvellous glory that had fallen upon his life, the nameless"
"rapture that possessed his soul!--To have knelt at her feet, and bowed"
"his head before her in worshipping silence, would have been to follow"
"the strongest impulse in him,--but she had given him a higher duty than"
"this. He was to ""LEAD HER,""--lead her ""into the world!""--the dreary,"
"dark world, so unfitted to receive such brightness,--she had come to"
him clad in all the sacred weakness of womanhood; and it was his proud
"privilege to guard and shelter her from evil,--from the evil in others,"
but chiefly from the evil in himself. No taint must touch that spotless
"life with which God had entrusted him!--sorrow might come--nay, MUST"
"come, since, so long as humanity errs, so long must angels"
"grieve,--sorrow, but not sin! A grand, awed sense of responsibility"
"filled him,--a responsibility that he accepted with passionate"
gratitude and joy ... he had attained a vaster dignity than any king on
"any throne, ... and all the visible Universe was transfigured into a"
"golden pageant of loveliness and light, fairer than the fabled Valley"
mode of life with the serene indifference of a veteran. We naturally
"supposed that, being so young, she would give us more or less trouble"
"on so long a journey, and this proved to be true on the cold and rough"
"sea voyage, but, from the day that we landed on this side of the ocean,"
"she has been a delight to our whole party, a maker of friends wherever"
"we have gone, and an immensely interesting object to the populace of"
"the cities through which we have passed. At Leyden, in Holland, as we"
"passed along the streets, we were followed all over town by an admiring"
"throng of Dutch children, just out of school, to whom our baby's bright"
red coat and cap were no less interesting than their wooden shoes were
to us; and so we found out how the elephants and monkeys and musicians
and other people who make up the street parade of a circus may be
supposed to feel when they pass through a town followed by the motley
"gang of school boys, ragamuffins, and general miscellanies of humanity."
[Sidenote: Something New in Venice.]
"At Wiesbaden, in Germany, we bought one of those odd little German"
"baby carts with two wheels and two handles, like plow handles, between"
"which the person who pushes it walks, the baby really riding backwards,"
"instead of forwards, as in our American baby carriages. You will see"
from this description that German baby carriages are like the German
"language--all turned the wrong way, though it must be said for this"
arrangement that the baby is not so likely to be lonesome as when
"riding face forward, since she always has some one to look at. Well,"
"at Venice, which is almost a dead town now, so far as business is"
"concerned, and which has perhaps as large a leisure class--that is,"
"street loafers--as any city of equal size on this terraqueous planet,"
a lady of our party essayed to take the baby out for an airing in her
German cart. It would appear that it was the first time since the
foundation of that pile-driven city in the sea that a pair of wheels
"was ever seen on her streets. At any rate, from the moment that the"
"being made up of Flemish and French cities, was hampered by the divided"
allegiance of its members and by their national jealousies;[721] while
"the German cities, sharing in the free German scramble under a nominal"
"emperor much occupied in Italy, could combine with ease. Cologne, having"
"early Hansa rights in London, sought to exclude the other cities, but"
had to yield and join their union;[722] and the Hansa of London dwindled
and broke up before their competition. As the number of leagued cities
"increased, it might be thought, something in the nature of an ideal of"
"free trade must have partly arisen, for the number of ""privileged"""
towns was thus apparently greater than that of the outside towns traded
"with. To the last, however, the faith seems to have been that without"
monopoly the league must perish; and in the closing Protestant period
"the command of the Baltic, as against the Dutch and the Scandinavians,"
was desperately and vainly battled for. But just as the cities could not
"escape the play of the other political forces of the time, and were"
"severally clutched by this or that potentate, or biassed to their own"
"stock, so they could not hinder that the principle of self-seeking on"
which they founded should divide themselves. As soon as the Dutch
affiliated cities saw their opening for trade in the Baltic on their own
"account, they broke away."
"While the league lasted, it was as remarkable a polity as any in"
"history. With its four great foreign factories of Bruges, London,"
"Bergen, and Novgorod, and its many minor stations, all conducted by"
celibate servitors living together like so many bodies of friars;[723]
"with its four great circles of affiliated towns, and its triennial and"
"other congresses, the most cosmopolitan of European parliaments; with"
"its military and naval system, by which, turning its trading into"
"fighting fleets, it made war on Scandinavian kings and put down piracy"
on every hand--it was in its self-seeking and often brutal way one of
the popular civilising influences of northern Europe for some two
hundred and fifty years; and the very forces of separate national
Closely related with this line of thought is Croce's distinction of
"the practical from the poetical personality of the artist, and of"
"biography from Ã¦sthetic criticism, as we find it in the essay of"
"_Alcune massime critiche_, and in the first chapter of his study on"
Shakespeare (1919). The knowledge of the facts of an artist's life is
undoubtedly required for the purposes of biographical or practical
history; but their relation with the Ã¦sthetic personality of the artist
"is not, as it is generally assumed, a relation of cause and effect."
They may have an indirect utility for the definition of the Ã¦sthetic
"personality, and especially for the recognition of that which in the"
"works of art themselves is still purely practical, not yet stamped"
with the seal of the Ã¦sthetic activity. But in the apprehension of
"art, the critic must prescind from the biographical elements, because"
"""the artist himself has prescinded from them in the act of creation of"
"his work of art, which is a work of art inasmuch as it is the opposite"
"of the practical life, and is accomplished by the artist raising"
"himself above the practical plane, abandoning the greatest part of"
"his practical feelings, and transfiguring those even that he seems"
"to preserve, because putting them into new relations. The artist, as"
"we say, 'transcends time,' that is, the 'practical time,' and enters"
"the 'ideal time,' where actions do not follow actions, but the eternal"
lives in the present. And he who pretends to explain the ideal time by
"the practical time, the imaginative creation by the practical action,"
"art by biography, unwittingly denies art itself, and reduces it to"
"a practical business, of the same kind as eating and making love,"
"producing goods or fighting for a political cause.""[4]"
"This concept of the Ã¦sthetic personality, which we find clearly"
"defined in Croce's most recent essays, was the guiding principle"
"of all his literary criticism, since the time when he started his"
series of studies on modern Italian literature. He had inherited
"it from De Sanctis, whose work, in so far as it is Ã¦sthetic and"

He did it.
"Hurry up, we only have 20 seconds."
Here it is.
All right.
What would have happened if he hadn't given himself away?
This is a dangerous game.
That's a passenger plane!
Now the myth of Carrasco is finished.
"Damn it, Enrique, they're simply cleverer than us."
They should have got them by now.
Let's go.
- We can't get through there in the Jeep.
- I want Carrasco!
Don't you dare come back without him!
Over there!
Find him!
Find him!
Enrique!
We'll get you out of here.
- Did you shoot the bastard down?
- No.
It wasn't him.
- We were set up.
- I knew it would go wrong.
I sensed it from the start.
"Come on, we must get away."
Help me.
"Hurry up, but be careful."
They'll remember us for a while.
Bastards!
I've always wished for something like this.
The bloody bastards!
Huge.
I'm the most wanted man on this planet.
Bounty hunters of all types are after me skin.
My face is plastered on wanted posters in every town on seven countries.
"Oh, yeah."
I'm infamous.
No.
I don't believe it.
Got it!
I think they're gone.
Are you sure?
"Aye, it's quiet."
Jump now!
- This might not work.
- Of course it works.
We're a lethal pair.
Behind you!
The arrow relies on the bow.
"The bow, on the arrow."
But they are not tied together.
"That would be pointless now, wouldn't it?"
Exactly.
"Together we are formidable but shackled, our power is pointless."
- We must be free.
"- Aye, free."
And we'll take them together!
Is that the best you can do?
I'd say we've wiped out our bounty-hunter problem.
- For now.
- Aye.
For now.
I was wrong about you.
I don't know.
But we can't go back.
I need to um see my guests.
Can we talk?
Always.
Is something wrong?
I know you have high aspirations for me
So in the spirit of full disclosure
There's something you need to know
Something that may... it may come out.
I'm intrigued.
Last summer...
I had an affair
With an older woman.
Oh my boy.
Welcome to washington.
She was married at the time.
Go on.
And she...
Well she paid me.
Well...
Whatever happens i'll protect you.
Let's hope it doesn't come out.
Yeah.
Have you seen your girlfriend?
- You don't know?
- What?
Blair and i broke up.
This party is not so hot.
There's a killer doughnut place around the corner.
Can you guys believe gossip girl?
"""the--the insider""?"
Open it.
"Sure, There's nothing illegal."
And you know my nature.
Why?
Are you my cousin?
You nature depends on my future.
What's all this?
It's all mine.
You wear this!
"No, I sell these."
I was here on work so thought I should bring it.
I thought I'd make some money for the fare.
Please come...
Madam it's a perfect fit.
Show me the bag.
Which one Ma'am?
Right or Left?
Left.
Your left or my left?
Were you born in military?
"Doing left right, left right."
Show me the other one.
Open the zip.
"Ma'am there are two zip, which one, front or back?"
Take him away.
"Check him, open every zip on him."
And if you can't find the zip then rip it then put a zip there.
Then open the zip and then check him.
Everything is sold.
"It's the last one, for you."
Where is the dirty canal?
Why?
Who was it?
Do you want me to sort him out for you?
"Sure, I already offered..."
"Grow up, will you?"
No bullets?
No.
"Well, what's the point of giving you a gun... if they don't give you Jesus bullets?"
So we wouldn't shoot anyone.
I thought that was the point.
How else you supposed to keep the bleedin' peace?
"That's crazy, that is."
"It was no joke, all right?"
You had to look straight at 'em.
- Who?
- The Arabs.
Straight at them.
Straight into their eyes.
Mesmerize them.
"Easier said than done, I'd say."
Who are you telling?
Thanks.
"Hit me, will you?"
Get out!
"Hey, Sharon."
You forgot your piss.
Urine.
Da!
"Next time you try that, you better watch it."
"For God's sake, are you daft?"
He's not only daft.
He's such a roving eye for everybody in this hospital.
Did you see him?
"You'll have to be patient, I'm afraid."
We have the situation under control... but there might be some damage to the skull and brain.
"We have to do a CT-scan, but we can't do it here."
And we can't get a helicopter in weather like this.
Can't you drive her there?
It's too much of a risk.
Her condition is critical.
We might lose her then.
Lose her?
A coma.
"What's a coma, Dad?"
Go home and get some sleep.
There's nothing you can do here.
It was...
It was like a snake.
Shaped like a snake.
Pardon?
Has he been treated yet?
"No, I'm OK."
It's nothing.
Come on.
"Hello, sweetheart."
I just can't get you out of my mind.
I miss you.
Really.
Do you actually love me?
Then come over here right now.
"I'll undress you, you'll undress me..."
- Why don't you answer?
- Hello?
- It's me.
What are you doing?
I will wait for you.
Some people are born to wait.
I will come.
But I will be late.
Okay?

I saw your designs.
You seem very talented.
But why did you take so much time to express your talent?

My designs were ready since a long time.
What do you mean?
Who?
I don't want to take anybody's name.
Fine.
Don't take names.
I understand a bit.

Okay.
Let's go outside and talk.
What is this?
It's quite noisy outside.
What silent kind of a conversation do you want to have?
"We talk a lot, don't we?"
But we don't listen to this.
I think they are both conspiring against us.
We have no control.
So what now?
"So now, let's leave them alone."
They are acting smart.
"It's all about trust, right?"
So let's see what they do when they are alone.
One week.
Away from each other.

I am going to die here?
Stay calm and continue to seek the treasure!
I'm hungry...
I want to eat monjayaki ...
I do not get any fish or fish... right?
Wow!

My mama collected these today!
What?
You know.
The ones with the drugs that make you go crazy.
His blood was full of that shit.
And there were tons of dried mushrooms at his place.
You really believe that?
It's what the results said!
Didn't you ever try those mushrooms as a kid?
Hell no.
"All I know is, mushrooms don't do that to you."
You saw that poor guy.
Mushrooms would never make you that way.
But I'm right about the Japanese guy.
"If everyone's talking about him, there's likely a good reason."
What the hell?
Power's gone out again.
Fuck.
I keep telling the Captain to get that damn wiring fixed.
Never listens!
What the fuck!
- What's wrong?
- What the Christ was that?
- That thing outside.
- What's outside?
"- Outside, that... fuck!"
- What's your problem?
"What is it, man?"
You check it out.
- Me?
"- Yes, you!"
Dammit.
You want me to go out?
I'm sorry.
No need to be sorry.
It's my fault.
I knew this day would come.
I thought I'd be okay.
"But in reality, I can't take it."
I am sorry too.
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to leave you hanging.
"But there comes a time when we have to choose, right?"
And I just didn't choose work like you did.
Can I ask you to do one thing for me?
"Even if there's no work, call me sometime."
I'll call for sure.
"As soon as I give birth, you'll be the first person I call."
Oh shit.
I can't.
I have to call my dad.
Then I will call you 2nd.
You go do whatever you want to do then.
That photo I have lots of pimples.
Erase them for me.
No hurry.
Your deadline is 2 days.
Beyotch.

"I'm telling you, asshole, to get your ass out there!"
For crying out loud...
"Okay, I'll go."
The aunt is jealous of me!
"You mustn't say that, dear!"
This is only a trailer.
Had I shot the whole show we'd have had a video-library!
You're lying!
Stop this nonsense!
"Let me talk to her, sir."
"Well, Kaushi?"
Why did you do that?
"You dare steal here, Kaushalya!"
Impudent woman!
"Dangerous woman, sir!"
She's playing the Bandit Queen!
"You, too?"
Shut up!
"Who else, if not I?"
!
The neighbours won't ask if my house is robbed!
"I ran out of battery, or I'd have shot the night-scene..."
The day-scene is all so obvious!
Why'd we need night-scenes?
"Call the police, Banwa."
"That's not necessary, sir!"
I'll personally throw her out!
Shameless creature!
You dare bite the hand that feeds!
"Will you do all that in my presence, Banwa!"
Yes.
The garden is the ideal place.
Let's go...
"The plate, Banwa..."
Sure.

Quiet.
No bombings Tuesdays apparently.
!
Yes!
Good!
Then I'll have to go it alone.
You work here?
I wanted to tell you...
You're here in this bar?
Toni promised that he wouldn't steal you away.
You're ruining the hotel!
I should have known.
Where is Toni?
In his office.
"Franz, we had no contract."
I said that I would help you.
But you never paid me.
That's why.
Is that the only reason?
Among others.
You did steal Nora away!
You might as well hire Tom!
Then we'll all leave and you can build your luxury hotel  or your recreation center or whatever!
You've already prepared contracts?
Where are they then?
"Calm down, Franz."
Is that loaded?
You promised me that you wouldn't take Nora away from me.
And you gave Josphine money so she'd leave?
!
You're pointing a gun at me?
We're cousins right?
As far as Nora is concerned...
She applied at the bar.
You wouldn't listen!
I told you to tell him!
Keep your pants on!
"All right, boys, break it up!"
"The other eye, Nelson!"
Close the other eye!
"Ten seconds, Stoke!"
Get in your shell!
Cover up!
Cover up!
"Break it up, break it up!"
Go to your corners!
"Break it up, the bell rang!"
- What's got into him?
- He's got to make it look good!
"Yeah, yeah!"
"But we finish him the next heat, don't we?"
"Yeah, the next heat!"
"Here you are, get your fresh-roasted peanuts!"
"Get all the peanuts you need right now, folks!"
There's not many left!
"I told you to get in a shell, didn't I?"
You see his face when I gave him that right?
- He'll murder you now!
"Won't he, Tiny?"
- Red's got something!
- What do you mean?
- Play it smart!
"Keep away from him, and you'll go the distance!"
My only chance is to deck him!
It's better to go the distance than get your head knocked off!
Get your cold beer here!
"- Couldn't lend us a ten-spot, could you?"
"- Yeah, course, our kid."
"Cheers, bro."
"- Nicely, nicely!"
- That's a bit of a relief.
Bit of a relief?
Bit of a relief?
I feel like I've just done a dump the size of a man's head.
Troy?
"Look, about that tenner."
There's... no rush for paying' us back.
As long as it's within one calendar month.
"- Moz, I know we've never been close..."
"- No, we hate each other."
"- No, we don't."
"- We do, don't we?"
We might.
"Look, I don't want to see you get hurt."
You can't always trust your friends.
- Aye aye!
- Or the law.
"Yeah, well, sayonara, Señor Paranoia!"
"All right, filth?"
Still got that tattoo of a Dalek on your arse?
"I can't stay long, Moz."
I'm mounted.
"What, you left Shergar outside?"
You'd best leave.
The kids round here'll melt him down for glue.
"Right, then, Moz, we'll be off..."
"Right, then."
"See you, lads."
"Oh, my goodness."
Look at that power.
'The training had paid off.'
Well done!
Look at the speed of this man.
'Sort of...'
"Oh, mate!"
"Are you all right, mate?"
Talk us through it again.
Which one was a professional boxer(?
)
I was in the blue on the floor.
You were in the blue?
Looking ripped.
Yeah.
I look like somebody's made a human out of mashed potato.
JIMMY GUFFAWS

I would pay?
40 to see you fight Vladimir Klitschko.
I'd love to see that.
Yeah.
"He didn't like me when we met, either."
Why?
"Ah, I kept on, I said to him, ""If you win..."""
"He went, ""I will win."" I went on, ""If you win..."""
"""I will win."" Then I went,"
"""Isn't there any part of your head telling you you might not?"
"""How are you being that positive?"""
"And he went, ""Don't ask a fighter"
"""a question he can't answer with words."""
"And I tell you, I was that close."
Who are you?
I know what you're doing in this village.
I saw that room.
And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.
"If you don't leave, you'll die."
"If you heard me, say something."
Or at least nod your fucking head!
Please answer.
"So, you're..."
"Shut up, bitch!"
You're blowing me off?
"Oh, I'm just not worth answering."
Is that it?
"You're not even gonna listen, right?"
Ain't that right?
"I'm trying to speak to you, but you're not listening!"
What's this?
What the fuck is this?
What the hell is all this?
What the...
What the fuck are these rituals you're doing?
!
What the fuck are you doing in my town!
Do you know whose daughter you're messing with?
Let's get her on the phone.
I'll tell her myself.
You leave my wife out of this.
You dragged her into it when you broke the law with your boss.
"You pay, she pays."
Hmm.
He's about to fold.
And admit what?
"If I had my way, damn near everything."
This guy washes stark's underwear.
He knows.
"Hey, it's just getting good."
I should get back to my station.
I'm sure the last thing you want is to put anna on a plane
And have to explain why.
"All right, I'll let you take my shift."
"It's a one-time offer, carter."
Carter!
"Excuse me, chief dooley."
"I need your signature, sir."
What?
Can't it wait?
I'm afraid the codes are ready for analysis.
I need your approval.
Thank you.
Why don't you sit here awhile?
Think about it.
I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want something?
That's my cue.
What do you think?
I think he's on the verge of telling you
I came to offer you true happiness.
"I'll marry you, Elise, you'll live in luxury!"
"You can even bring the child, if you want to."
You're a lucky girl.
"I was happy with my Henry, but then my luck flew away."
"Except for - look, they have the same eyes."
I'm sick of your comedy.
Keep your palace.
I don't want it.
And get out!
I'll stay true to Henry even though he's gone!
Impossible!
You must marry me!
Leave Elisa alone!
She's got to marry me!
She must marry me!
"So you won't let her be, you nasty wretch?"
We've had really enough of you.
We saw right through you!
Get out or I'll change you into a limping mare!
- You said you can't do it.
"- I know, but he doesn't."
Let's scare him out of his wits!
"Climb on my back, quick."
Don't drop me!
"Jean, it's me!"
The Duke!
"It's all her fault, and she's waiting for you!"
- Who?
- The old witch!
Our salvation!
But your Grace...

Was I too loud?
"No, that wasn't bad at all."

I loved it.
Would you like to hear it again?
Please.
Will you wait here?
* From the land you hear the
Mm-hmm.
"Need anything else, agents?"
"Yeah, is Sheriff Hanscum around?"
Sorry.
She's out for the rest of the week.
"Hell of a time to take a vacation, right?"
"Okay, so, we have two victims, with seemingly nothing in common except, uh -- a love for eclairs."
Check this out.
What is that?
A birthmark?
Huh.
"So the weight had to come off somehow, right?"
What if it's a suction mark?
A suction mark?
Okay.
"Uh, changeling?"
"Yeah, but changelings don't take over kids."
Neither of the vics had any.
And we don't know if Wayne McNut had a suction mark.
Unless we missed it.
Yeah.
"Well, we should, uh, split up."
One of us should hit the morgue.
The other should stay here and question the staff.
I'll stay.
Ain't gonna happen.
Why?
Because you're weird around girls.
"What does that mean, weird?"
You're awkward.
"You know, weird -"
- Sam Weird.
I would know!
Nothing you see can harm or even touch you.
It's purely audio-visual.
- There's no physical sensation.
- Fuck!
"Yes, there was!"
"- Cooper, you need to calm down."
"- I know because I felt it, okay?"
"I felt her arm, it was warm, and I felt her fucking stab me in the shoulder."
- That's not possible.
"- Oh, my God."
"- It's not possible, Cooper."
"- Yeah, it is!"
"Yeah, it is!"
Physical sensations shouldn't be possible.
"- Unless, I mean..."
"- Oh, God."
Unless what?
I don't know.
"The neuron net, it could have maybe worked out some means of replicating physical experiences,"
- but that would be unprecedented.
- Jesus Christ.
"Okay, you know what?"
Stop the game.
I want out.
Just pull me out now.
"Stop, stop, stop."
Safe word.
Fucking stop!
"- Okay, okay, just let us work it out."
"- Oh, God."
"No, I want this fucking thing out now."
"Well, it ain't my fault, is it?"
"If you're worrying about that dame, I'll call her up."
No cracks.
I don't want her to know anything about this or me.
"Yeah, I see."
- Get back to that hospital and find out--
"- Jeez, I've been sleeping in the halls."
Get out of here.
Get back to that hospital.
Stay with him.
Get in bed with him.
- Back.
Move it on those two sides.
- Stay in line.
Move it faster.
Come on.
"Come on, get in here."
Come on.
"Come on, boys, hurry up."
"- Mr. Thompson, look at that."
"- Well, what's the matter with it?"
- Can you eat it?
Those boys can't.
"- Well, they don't have to."
It's worse now than it ever was.
"Miss Griffith, kindly understand that I want no more interference in things that don't concern you."
This does concern me.
We started something.
It was successful.
"Every day, bit by bit, you're tearing it down."
- That will do.
"- No, it won't."
He was in for sex crimes.
Just got released two weeks ago.
Thanks.
Hello.
How are you holding up?
Fantastic.
What's a five-letter word for a cooking utensil?
A whisk?
That would be it.
We're all rooting for you.
I want you to know that.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
You here to see Johnny Holt?
"Yes, I am."
We found his blood on Vince Nelson's throat.
Holt's a bad dude.
"If he gives you any problems, let me know."
I'll get in there and beat him up for you.
Whisk.
I knew that.
Never seen him before.
There's traces of your blood on him.
My blood's all over this city.
"Been shot nine times, knifed five."
We believe the victim was involved in child pornography.
Do you recognize this boy?
You implying I'm into kids?
Because I sure as hell don't fly that way.
Right.
"Right, you prefer to rape grown women. forgot."
They said it was rape.
Traitor you get your hands off of me!
I can't breathe!
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the Führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind?"
It was not to be cherie.
"You bastard, I'll get you for this!"
"Indiana Jones, adieu!"
Nooo!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Oh my god this whole place is slithering!
Indy!
"Aow, Jesus!"
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
Where the hell were you
"- Watch it, watch it!"
What are you doing?
Helping the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
"I'm working on it, I'm working on it!"
"Whatever you're doing, do it faster!"
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
Just get ready to run whatever happens to me.
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
I looked through your suitcase.
How often do you shave?
Once every day.
That's better.
"Well, you're not going to give me away, are you, Mike?"
It's very important to Nancy that you don't.
She'll be in very big trouble if you do.
"Now, why are you dressed up like that?"
"Oh, well, to help Nancy."
"Okay, but why are you dressed up like that?"
To help Nancy.
"You see, I can't explain it now, Mike, except that if they find out, see, that I'm a grown-up man, it can get Nancy in all kinds of trouble, see."
We don't want that to happen.
"So you'll help me out, huh?"
Okay.
Good.
"Do you collect rocks, too?"
"No, not really."
Then what are you doing with this?
"Oh, that ain't mine."
I found this in your suitcase in your pants' pocket.
Oh.
It still ain't mine.
Can I have it?
"Sure, be my guest."
Thanks.
I'll run a test on it.
I'm going to be a geologist.
"Oh, that's swell."
What do we do now?
Let's go.
Let's go.
A flower van.
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.
"Seriously, and I don't mean to disrespect but if you put cops in the back of a garbage truck there's no way I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck."
"It's a freebie, yo."
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys."
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on.
I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaining about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kind of.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I wanna buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
Oh my God.
"You covered ""how will I know"""
And you dedicated it to me
And I sat there trying not to laugh.
Oh God.
I was so in love with you.
What are we doing?
Things were so much easier when we were younger.
Unlike our kids we just jumped into things.
"I mean, why can't we just be more like that"
Just figure it out as we go along?
Maybe this didn't turn out to be
The romance we thought it would be when we first met.
Well.
It's more like choose your own adventure.
Maybe it just wasn't the right time.
Maybe it never will be.
What if it is?
What if we're just too stubborn to see it?
I don't want to miss out.
Well...
Neither do I.
I don't have a ring
So this will have to do.
Rufus.
What are you doing?
"Marry me, Lily."
Marry me.
I know that'll make me your... uh your fifth husband.
So?
Yes.
Give me your hand.
Is the bar open?
I mean can I get a decent cup of coffee?
Now that's a classic portrait.
What do you think Angie?
I'm not a fan of black and white photos.
I had a black and white photo taken of me as well.
I looked really great.
"Just fabulous, like a film star."
But I don't look like that at all.
Exactly.
That's why I like black and white photos.
So you lie to yourself quite a bit.
Right?
I think you are beautiful.
- Hi.
"Angie, clean up back there!"
"One thing after another, boss."
"This one is good too, by the way."
"Right, quite good."
"Okay, I'll take that."
You want to buy me a drink?
Why not?
Thank you for the sign.
Now go to your brother and pull the money off the wall.
Go fuck yourself Toni.
"You could stay outside as well, or sit in the lobby and drink tap water."
- Can we get a coffee here?
Sure.
Two coffees?
- Black.
Me too.
Thank you.
Lots of cake.
We love cakes.
"I got the green one for you, that's your favourite, right?"
I'll have the marzipan cake.
"No, the Goosey Whipped Cream."
"- You're far out, Thomas."
- Sure I am.
I'm expected to be.
- Stop it.
- Bums like me are skinny.
"I'll get so fat, people won't see the bum."
They'll nod and say:
What a good citizen with a double chin and all.
- Why don't you eat your cake?
"- I want to stop, Thomas."
I can't take it anymore.
Really?
Then I'll have it.
I can go on all day.
I don't know why.
Stop it!
You know what I mean.
"I'm talking about us, not the cakes."
About us?
Our relationship and stuff?
"Crisis, intimacy, presence, closeness."
- I'm serious.
"- Listen, the two of us have a pact."
We love each other.
"Even when we're apart, we're together, anyway."
"It can't be any different, Tilde."
- It's an old pact.
- Who the fuck are you?
Why do we care what you think?
"What are you, an intern?"
Yes.
What about that last intern?
"She had those bug eyes, looked like Courtney Cox on chemo."
Let me give you two pieces of advice:
Always wear black and... you never finish shitting until you piss again.
Remember that and you'll be fine here.
"- Thank you, I'll keep it in mind."
- I'm just busting your balls!
- Come on!
- You can laugh!
"- I like her vibe, though!"
- Nice vibe.
Good vibe!
Come visit me in my office and...
We'll chat sometime.
A little less rouge.
Are we working or are we chatting?
Pardon me?
Yeah!
Obviously you!
Who else would I be talking to?
"- Rocky, the camera man?"
"- Director ""odd"" Photography."
"Oh, great!"
Come here now!
Chop-chop!
You remember when I asked you to do a special project for me?
- Did you see it...
"- Yeah, I saw it!"
- It's a nice word for titties.
- Where's Mom?
- What doyou mean?
What do you think she's doing right now?
I don't know.
Screwing her new boyfriend probably.
- I think she's buying us presents.
"- Yeah, Robby."
Right now she's probably buying us each a car!
- It's a man.
- I think it's a woman.
I can tell it is.
What should wewrite?
"""I have a big wiener""?"
I want to poop back and forth.
What?
What does that mean?
"Like, I'll poop into her butt hole... and then she'll poop it back... into my butt hole."
And then we'll just keep doing it back and forth... with the same poop.
"Oh, my God."
I'm going to put that!
"""I want to poop... back and forth."""
"Oh, God."
"She's gonna think we're a crazy, perverted person."
- Ooh!
She thinks we're crazy!
"- No, tell her like how I said it."
"No, she'll never write back."
"We have to sound like we're a man, you know?"
That's just lame.
It's stupid.
"But you said I could do half, and you've done all of them before this."
"Just get off of him the best you can, but don't let him roll in that saddle."
I think that...
I need that horse!
Shit.
Stop that horse!
I need that horse.
Get that horse.
I can understand you smaller children... but you older children have no excuses.
"So, we're going to stay until you get it right."
"Now, I don't want any erasures, so turn the page and start fresh."
Put that mouse in your pocket.
I brung you a horse.
Class dismissed.
"Lord, it's like a stampede."
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Sure.
Go on home.
Go on.
- I'm not dressed for riding.
"- Why, sure you are."
"Why, women ride all the time dressed like that."
I busted that horse for you.
"Come on, I'll boot you up on him."
- He's beautiful.
- He's a good horse.
"Come on, I'll put you up there."
Okay.
Done.
You all right?
- How do I get...
- Take hold of these reins.
"Grab his reins, grab a little handful of his mane."
That's a ghost.
All the things happening around here are his doing.
"If nothing is done, it's not just your daughter, but everything that walks on two feet will perish."
Sir!
This is Park Chun-bae.
He owns this house.
"He killed his wife, too?"
It appears so.
What's that bastard's name?
Park Shun-baa.
Then what?
"What do you mean, what?"
Gotta get rid of it.
"Either banish it, or kill it."
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow at the hour of the dog.
"Yes, sir."
You got the money?
How much?
"About 1O grand, don't you think?"
LWlhaveitready.
Good.
Listen.
What I'm doing tomorrow- it's no ordinary ritual.
I'll be casting a death hex.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So you can't do anything that would taint it.
No intercourse.
Watch what you eat and drink.
Or the spell will backfire.
"Yes, sir."
Okay then.
You can go.
honesty is all we ask from those who work for us.
There is no honor in deceit.
Death doesn't frighten you?
"No, not if it is for the right reason."
"No, not if it is for the right reason."
My business requires a handy man.
Oh yeah?
What are you offering?
What you gave me.
A life.
Do I have to drink that shit?
When do I start?
There you go.
That is dino campanela.
The head of the campanela family.
We believe he was behind the attack.
Are you sure about that?
Are you sure about that?
I will be.
What do you want me to do?
You will find what you need under the seat.
"If there is trouble, use it."
There you are.
How are you doing shuji?
"Listen, I heard what happened."
I'm sorry.
If there is anything I can do.
Thank you.
I'm glad you can make this meeting.
"Like I said, anything I can do."
Let's sit.
I want to know why you have ignored our agreement.
I haven't felt that from you in years.
I'm sorry about that.
"Okay, so now, finally,"
Are you guys gonna get back together?
- I don't know.
- Me either.
- I have no clue.
- Me either.
- It's all new to me.
- Me too.
But look at you.
Look at the way you finish each other's sentences.
"Look how upset you were when she didn't call you back,"
And look how you didn't want him to know that you were back.
Look at all of it.
Can't you see?
This is who you are.
You're mom and dad.
"We are, but we're not alan and elaine anymore."
We're alan and elaine.
I'm glad you stopped by.
Me too.
I'll see you on the strolling path?
Until the strolling path.
"Got to hand it to you, David."
You make one hell of a wingman.
"Thanks, dad."
Where are you going?
To get Rita.
I'm not leaving you here alone with that whore.
Inspired by the events that occurred on social networks.
That is all.
Thank you.
The meeting's over.
Send the car.
Any new transfers recently?
Just a moment.
"No, not a single one."
"The police identified the body of reporter Takeshi Kurosaki, age 35."
His investigative reports unveiled a series of university scandals.
"The cause of death is unknown, but foul play isn't ruled out."
That was close!
Did you hit these?
I think so.
You broke the dolphin.
Who's that?
From the Administration.
And who are you?
Haven't seen you around.
This is Rin.
Department?
I'm not a student.
So you can't join the team.
"Ryuji, Iet her apply."
"If you can hit that strong, you should apply."
Alright!
I'm soaked!
Right down to the underwear.
This way.
It's quite easy to apply.
What's that?
A special training facility.
It's a restricted area.
Help!
- Guerrilleros!
"- Get over there, everybody!"
Block that side!
Take cover!
That bastard won't get away from me.
Hurry up!
Take off!
Enrique!
They're trying to get away in their copters.
We might still get them.
- Why are they shooting?
"- We're safe, Padre."
We're safe.
A new magazine.
Try to get into the hospital.
"Shit, we're trapped!"
"Concepción and the others, where are they?"
They're... they're dead.
"Come on, hurry up!"
I think they're all gone.
Enrique!
They nearly killed me.
That priest over there saved my life.
"Come on, we must flee before they come back and kill us all."
You are Enrique Carrasco?
You have to stop this madness.
"Hey, that doesn't look good."
Make sure it doesn't get infected.
"- Héctor, the lorries."
- Get these people to safety.
"When the militia return, they'll kill you all."
"Jeeves, you don't mean you're leaving me still."
How are we gonna manage?
"The young lady may have some idea, sir."
I hear they generally have.
That's right.
I hadn't thought of that.
- Shall I have a go at it till the blacksmith arrives?
"- Yes, please."
"- Thank you, sir."
"- Thank you, Jeeves."
"Go on, take a card, any card at all."
Now look at it.
Put it back.
Ace of spades.
"- When did you change the act, Pop?"
- I didn't.
He did.
He did?
"Yes, he said straight magic is too old-fashioned."
"Wait a minute, take a bow."
"No, you take it."
I got to get married.
"Come here, they're applauding you."
They like it.
Lucky.
Now what?
"- I want to reason with you, if I can."
- But you already did.
Have you really made up your mind to leave me... just to marry some girl you happen to know?
"It's kind of customary to know the bride, isn't it?"
I hate to see you leave show business.
- What?
- I...
- Hurry up and say it!
This office...
The person who is renting and using this office...
I was... doing something here...
- On the side.
- What did you do on the side?
Something similar to a detective agency...
What the heck were you going around doing?
You don't have to worry too much.
I... saw the faces of our suspects.
What are you talking about?
I saw two guys running out of here.
"I know who they are, so we can go and catch them together."
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Wait one second.
"So... these guys that you know, were in your office..."
"And they murdered a guy, that you know... and ran away."
"But on their way out, they happened to run into you?"
"Sir, this is the place."
Get ready.
Open the door!
It's the police!
- Open the door!
- Who is it?
- It's the police.
Open the door!
- What's going on?
My arm!
My arm!
Hold on a second!
Bye-bye.
And we're out.
"Eddie, you did it again."
Please don't cue the music until I'm waving goodbye.
Sorry.
It's not rocket science.
"Stan, there you are."
Did you get my email?
About?
My new idea.
About all the fan letters I've been getting.
I thought I could read a few of them on the air.
"Well, I don't really think we have time."
"Oh, sure, we have time."
I'll just pick the lotto numbers faster.
"Well, you see, Natalie, the show is about the numbers."
That's why people are watching.
It's not really about you.
Really?
Is that what you're hearing?
Because that's not what I'm hearing.
Why don't we discuss this later?
I'll see you Monday.
Okay.
Jesus.
Excuse me.
Do these cables have to be right here?
"Yes, they do."
Because they carry your voice from this microphone to that sound board.
"Well, can't you put them someplace else?"
I almost broke my neck.
Almost doesn't count.
So many choices.
It's not even practice and that one there is doing laps.
Isn't she pushing herself hard enough?
Remember when I pushed you?
It was just upstairs in the music room.
"Yes, I remember."
Do you remember the music you made?
[Piano playing]
It was perfect.
It made you perfect.
She can be perfect.
She shouldn't have to be.
[Gasps]
How long ago?
She was seen heading toward the pool about five minutes ago.
Where is it?
Just around the corner.
He can't get you now.
You're safe.
Open them up.
I can't. they lock from the inside.
That area is shelter in place.
Get around the corner.
Get around the corner!
There's something else about me that you should probably know.
[Groaning]
[Metallic clatter]
James:
There you are.
- You shouldn't have bothered.
- Come on.
Just breathe.
It's not staph.
The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.
Which I would have seen in your MRI.
Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.
Let me see the MRI.
There was no abscess on the image.
"Let me see it, then."
I liked you better when you were jolly.
MRI was taken over an hour ago.
That soft spot could now be an abscess.
"If it was staph, you'd have a fever."
Which you don't!
101.6.
What idiot gave you that?
Put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.
Triangle.
This one?
Uh... circle.
Next.
"Foreman, why aren't you answering?"
Is there a problem?
"Uh, s-square."
Tell me your date of birth.
Is that House?
- Yeah.
Next.
A square again.
Why is he here?
Because my neurologist is having surgery.
Thought I was just another patient.
"You didn't believe that crap, did you?"
Date of birth.
This high council is adjourned.
[âª]
Mace?
Follow da veiga.
Tap into his tracer frequency.
He'll see the power spike.
It will be too late.
"Thanks, karen."
I'm not surprised you can't find
Any information on the scabbard.
"Well, I still have a few more"
People to hear back from.
Do you want me to wait?
No.
It seems we've stirred up
The hornet's nest here.
"I need you to pack up,"
Get out of there
And just keep your phone on.
You don't have to ask me twice.
"Okay, thanks, kate."
"No, interpol have no information"
On the scabbard either.
Looks like we've reached a dead end.
What about your father's house?
"Yes, it's possible"
He already has the scabbard.
You don't mean go there?
We'd be sitting ducks.
I know the combination to his safe.
Great.
And I think I can get us past the alarms.
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover.
Perhaps there's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps...
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
She was in possession of the original piece for years.
"She may know much, if properly motivated."
"I tell you, the girl knows nothing."
I'm surprised to find you squeamish.
That is not your reputation.
But it needn't concern you.
I have the perfect man for this kind of work.
Heil Hitler.
Indy!
Here!
We've hit stone!
Clear it off.
"Come on, find the edges."
"Good, good, good."
"You see, Indy?"
You see?
"Okay, bring the pry bars in."
"As a team, boys!"
As a team!
Push!
Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.
"Good, good, that's it."
Watch your toes.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"Sorry, Indy."
Indy... why does the floor move?
Stop!
Francis!
Bash!
Stop!
Stop!
"Please, stop!"
You don't have to marry him!
It's all over!
"My mother, nostradamus,"
They say we can be wed.
What do you mean?
There is no prophecy keeping us apart.
"Please, listen..."
Does it matter?
"Mary, nothing needs to change."
We can still be wed.
"What do you mean, no prophecy?"
Even nostradamus will tell you.
Your fate is your own when it comes to who will you marry.
Him or me.
I knew he would get to you in time.
"Did your seer tell you that, too?"
Is this a game to you?
Nostradamus told me the prophecy was fulfilled.
With clarissa's death.
How can I believe you when you have so much to lose?
"oh, god, what are you doing?"
"Do nothing, and I will die."
"Watch me, if that's what it takes"
To convince you I'm not putting
My life ahead of my son's.
I never have.
"We saved her, too."
My God.
Your brother.
"This time, the governor won't have Serena to use as P.R."
He won't have to die.
We did it.
We sure did.
My husband must be sending out a search party by now.
I left my car at the hospital.
Will you take me?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey."
Friends don't let friends drive in a state of shock.
I'll drive you home.
They stopped looking for me.
They stopped looking for me.
They stopped looking for me.
Does this have anything to do with Ruby?
"No, it's..."
It's the police.
That's who's supposed to look for guys like... him.
Seat belt's stuck.
- Thanks for the ride.
"- Hold on, wait."
- I'll walk you.
- That's okay.
"If I let a girl walk herself to the door on a dark night,"
I'd have to commit ritual suicide.
"You don't want my death on your conscience, do you?"
Or your blood on my sidewalk.
Yeah.
"Well, hold on, hold on."
What is it that you want to ask?
"You see, I think Changwook and I both want you."
"If you happen to like both of us, who would you choose?"
"You see, this situation is making us awkward."
I think it would help if things are set clear.
So who's your pick?
"I like you better, Joongrae."
I understand.
Thanks.
You should get back.
How long did you stay in Germany?
Quite a long time.
You must be fluent in German.
Just enough to get by.
She's good.
Very good.
- Were there Koreans there?
- Not really.
"It was a small tourist city, so I saw some Korean travelers."
- What are people like there?
- A bit boring.
But they are honest.
Very much so.
They express their feelings as they are.
They seem more laid back than people here.
Have you dated foreigners?
"- Men, I mean."
"- Ah, men."
Do you really want to know?
"- Well, I think..."
"- No, don't say it."
I don't care what you did there.
X-ray shows another reason for his condition.
There's a bullet-like metal thing in his brain.
The metal thing is moving.
It's pressing on his nerves.
"If we don't remove it, he'll go into a coma in 3 weeks."
He may even die.
Can't it be removed?
"We want to, but we are not confident."
Sorry.
Thanks.
You're awake.
How are you?
OK.
"What's wrong, Lisa?"
Why didn't you tell me?
What's that thing in your head?
Doctor says if it's not removed... you've only 3 weeks to live.
You tell me now.
It's nothing.
I got shot 3 years ago when on duty.
"I didn't remove it, afraid it'd affect me."
It's been in there since.
I've fainted many times before.
Don't worry.
Only it was longer this time.
I scare of such an unconscious feeling.
I'm afraid to sleep.
Afraid I'll never wake up again.
Lucky you guys were with me this time.
What's wrong?
3 years ago...
Is this reason you stopped courting me?
The universe is cold and unfeeling.
The only constant is chaos.
Was that place out of chocolate-chip pancakes again?
We were all almost killed by a truck.
Ay!
Idios mío!
"Are you okay, papi?"
"This was all Phil's fault, wasn't it?"
He's always blaring that damn new wave music!
No.
He swerved to avoid it.
Saved my life.
But the game of life is rigged.
Death always win.
"Okay, I know what you need right now..."
A trip to the ice-cream shop.
He doesn't need ice cream.
He needs to talk about what just happened to him.
"Well, I could go for some ice cream."
I know how to fix my son.
"So, this is fixed."
Go around.
"Normally, I'd be avoiding these cracks out of respect of your back, mom, but after today, it seems pointless."
- That's it.
Get in.
"- No, no."
"No, Jay, he's afraid!"
It's only gonna get worse.
In.
Trust me.
"Five minutes in here, he'll be happy as a clam."
Aah!
"But I'm not referring to you, Moonsook."
You're different from your films.
"Sorry, but you're actually just another Korean man."
What are you sorry about?
"No, I take that back."
My point is you are a Korean man.
"Hey, I'm going back to our room."
I'll be back shortly.
Not coming with me?
That was a hit-by-pitched ball.
Stricter rules will apply to this.
"If you let the ball hit you when you could've dodged it, it's either a ball or a strike."
Like a regular strike or ball.
"Even if you get hit, it may not be a hit-by-pitched ball."
- Doesn't apply to intentional hits.
"- Yes, that's right."
He's in the bathroom.
Want to get some fresh air?
"Yeah, sure."
Wait.
This way.
I don't think we can go any farther.
Shoes are all wet.
- You know what?
- Yes?
"As I get older, I like the west coast."
It's where the sun sets.
And also where the stars rise.
That's right.
Why are you laughing?
Come on.
"Ah, I got a question."
You can't possibly be.
Yes.
The new owner of the Standish Tavern.
Banks are delighted to sell paper on imminent foreclosures.
Foreclosure?
You don't have to thank me.
I knew that you'd just about die with embarrassment.
I just dropped by to make final arrangements.
I can't leave without ensuring that my interests...
... arelookedafter by someone I can trust.
"Oh, no."
Never.
I will never work for you.
"Fine, if that's your attitude."
I'll find another bartender.
Bartender?
Then who's the manager?
I came. I saw. I conquered.
Wait.
Just tell me one thing.
Why?
Why here?
Why me?
"Somebody's got to keep you sharp, son."
We're business people.
And we're the best at what we do.
Don't ever forget that.
"Yes, indeed."
Previously on Vanished...
Jeffrey's home.
Please never call here again.
"No, sir, it's from that solar system ahead."
Any interference?
Resistance?
"No, sir, just scanning beams."
It's on an unusual wavelength.
Mr. Spock?
It would appear someone is curious about us.
"Mr. Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar system?"
"Yes, sir."
"We're closing, sir."
"Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?"
"There's no hostility, sir."
"They're not tractors or weapons of any sort, just increasing in intensity."
Steady.
Regular.
"It's growing stronger, sir."
- Captain!
"- Yes, what is it?"
"The alien, it's slowing down."
"Warp 5, 4, 2."
"It's going sublight, sir."
Sir...
- It stopped dead in space.
- He may be turning to fight.
"No, sir."
They're just dead out there.
Are you sure?
"Yes, sir."
Unmoving.
Then we've got him.
Go to red alert.
Prepare to fire phaser banks.
"Kim Seon Joo, did I order the curry?"
I don't think I heard.
I clearly heard you order the curry.
Me too.
Weird...
"Maybe you were thinking of pork cutlet in your head when you ordered the curry, you may have accidentally said curry instead of pork cutlet."
"No, I didn't."
"Team Manager, you can switch with me."
It doesn't matter to me.
I like curry too.
It's fine.
I'm sorry.
"She said she was buying, and she's just leaving."
I'll pay.
I'll pay.
But why is she getting so angry?
"She's not the type to get so worked up, it's weird."
What's there to get angry about?
I was mistaken.
Tell them to enjoy and that I'm sorry.
"It's okay, things like that can happen."
Enjoy.
How can I help you?
Excuse me.
We can make it for you as well.
Turkey sandwich and a coffee.
All right.
Stay seated!
Stay right there.
"I can take this off, right Doctor Kang?"
"Yes, please."
Now you're finally worth looking at.
I should've killed that bastard.
"- What are you going on about, Louise?"
"- It's only a song, Bosco."
A story about wreckers.
There are no wreckers nowadays.
It's just a song.
As long as it's just a song.
I don't want to hear your damn song!
It makes me sick!
Bloody hell!
There's a curse on this village.
The demons are free.
What did you see?
Tell me!
There were two ghosts.
They were staggering about.
"Pale and covered in blood, with crazed eyes."
- There were two women.
- Where did you see them?
"Over there, by the ship cemetery, near the haunted ruins."
"Come with me, you two."
Hurry
The devil has been set free!
God help us.
He has been imprisoned in the ruins for centuries.
Now he is free.
Misfortune is upon us!
I can sense that he's still in the ruins!
Maybe now his long wait will be over.
They're here.
We must drive them out.
They won't come out alive!
Come on in.
"Hey, you want a beer?"
Or an apple martini?
"Oh, that's funny."
[ALEX LAUGHS]
Have you told your parents?
It's for work.
I'm trying to expand my client base.
By pretending to be gay?
"No, by being more gay-friendly."
"Or, in real estate terms, ""gay-adjacent."""
Nice.
I'm gonna use that.
I should change this.
It's maybe a little much.
I don't know.
"Dressing like that, seeing a girl who won't sleep with you I think you can pull it off."
"It's not that she won't sleep with me, douche bag."
I have slept with her.
"It's just she, you know..."
Won't sleep with you anymore.
"Pretty much, yeah."
What do you think?
"I think you got a problem because you're gonna have to beat them away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man."
Holy shit.
Observe your breath.
"Inhale, belly rise."
"And exhale, belly fall."
Bring your hands together in front of your chest.
Bow your head in gratitude.
- Namaste.
- Namaste.
- Okay.
Where you going?
- Subway.
- I thought we were gonna walk.
It's 15 blocks.
"Come on, I think you'll like it."
- Do they allow hot dogs in the subway?
- You are so an out-of-towner.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I'm one of the graduates.
Wow.
You're hours early.
I just wanted to beat traffic... and have time to get ready and relax and also I've heard... the early bird gets the unwrinkled gowns without the mysterious stains.
- This is true.
Take your pick.
- Thank you.
This is so exciting.
Isn't this exciting?
This is my eighth year of doing this.
So not so exciting for you.
Got it.
You're being so cryptic.
Do you need a power source or not?
My batteries are all fully charged.
It just depends on how fast they deplete.
- So we need one just in case.
- Mom.
"Lorelai, it's hours before the ceremony."
What are you doing here?
"I'm sorry, what are you doing here?"
How do you even know about this?
Obviously.
The lash will loosen their tongues.
Put 'em onboard the ship.
Won't find it so easy to launch an escape from there.
No!
You take 'em!
And you stay with them till I send for you!
Excuse me.
I got hit over the head by two men over there.
Shut up!
You lad.
Come here.
Mr. Atkins obviously needs all the help he can get.
So you go with him.
What will happen to the women?
You leave the women here.
It'll give Captain Taylor something to consider if he tries to plan another escape.
And what are you gonna do about those two men?
What I always do to people who try and cross me.
We have to get those women to safety.
Come on.
Who are you?
Bless you.
Don't be afraid.
He's a friend.
I need you to take them to the tree house.
But he's a savage.
"Far from it, madam."
He's my best friend and he's your salvation.
And where are you going?
I've got to find a way onto that boat.
You'll be fine.
What did you think of yourself?
Angel?
I lifted them for your sake.
"Now you can marry her, or just keep her."
Brother!
What's this you have done?
You have crossed all limits.
You showed your standings.
"You have misunderstood me, Sheen."
Stop your performance.
What did you think?
You will gain me like this?
"Faiz, this was a big mistake by you."
Victory is not in forcing.
Victory is in defeating hate.
Well!
You and your brother won't understand this.
These are professional killers.
Might have lifted up even the women your family.
Be in your limits and speak!
You speak badly about our women?
"Step away, brother!"
Move!
What are you doing?
What are you all doing?
Leave me.
I will shoot her.
"Making fusses, bloody!"
"What else can be expected of you, Impotent?"
"Stop it, girl!"
You call us Impotent?
Shall I show you our manhood?
Thank you.
There is the possibility that we might not actually win this thing.
"Oh, yeah?"
Bite your tongue!
Bite your damn tongue!
"Look, guys, we don't date, we don't travel, we don't have any money."
The only thing that we do have is the 2.09 Competition.
"If we can't even win that, what's the point?"
"Hey, hey."
Look at this!
"No, no, no, no."
Yeah.
We suck.
"Your father would be so proud of you, Ben."
Yeah.
Do you remember anything about him?
Not really.
Maybe when he shaved?
"Yeah, I think I watched him shave."
"So, what are your plans for the rest of the night?"
I don't know.
I'll probably just go back and work on that essay.
"Ben, you're working too hard."
"Between the job and school and the 2.09, you've had no time for just yourself."
"You have to squeeze in a little time for fun, Ben."
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.
Okay.
All right.
- Good night.
"- All right, good night."
- Don't come home before 3:00.
ELl JOE:
You're thinking it's cowardly.
I think it's smart.
"See, I know all about your six amigos."
You all been making quite a name for yourselves around here.
"Real proud of yourself, ain't you?"
ELl JOE:
"Yeah, I suppose."
But it had to be done.
"See, I haven't been sleeping too well ever since I pinned that murder on you."
Your conscience bothering you?
[chuckling ] I ain't got a conscience.
How about Jess Kincaid?
You killed an innocent farmer just to frame me for murder.
"Got you off my trail, didn't it?"
This little voice inside keeps telling me...
... VinTanner'sgonnacome looking for me.
Settle out both scores.
So I figured I'd find you first.
I'm glad I did.
Let's do this.
Gotta get back on the trail.
MAN:
Take cover.
YATES:
Don't let him get away.
Get him.
What took you so long?
I thought you might need this.
Yah!
"Now, now."
No need to rush in all at once.
Call it a gut feeling.
"Oh, that's still annoying, you know."
What is?
You talking in riddles and intuition.
You never change.
Yeah.
So has he?
"You know, contacted you?"
I haven't seen or heard from James in 15 years.
"And, uh, the irony's not lost on me"
That you're the one who's asking.
Carol.
Carol.
Look at me.
"No matter what you think,"
I'm not the one who drove him away.
You made things intolerable for all of us.
"Well, if it--if it makes you comfortable to blame me,"
Then you should go ahead and blame me.
I don't care.
But the truth is that you made choices.
And the choices you made--you chose badly.
I'm not the one who disappeared.
"Oh, there it is."
How did I not know?
What?
What--not know what?
"Oh, stop it, Artie."
You're in town for whatever reason and you decide to twist the knife
For old time's sake.
Rub it in that I chose the wrong guy.
Right.
- He's skin and bones.
I lost money on this one.
"But the price of the others went up by 200 liras, right?"
"Mr. Eduardo, it's going to be hard to win the war this way."
"Win or lose, I refuse to be trampled on."
"No, that's not an option."
Am I clear?
"No, no."
"They're too fat, too ugly!"
Too German!
"On top of that, they're too expensive!"
Am I making myself clear?
- It's unthinkable.
"- Alright, I understand."
There's no need to shout.
Fat is always useful.
We'll make soap out of them.
"Come, let's go."
They're going to turn these prisoners into soap...
That's their problem.
Tale a look at that.
Queen of the Skies.
"Queen of publicity, that's what she is..."
- What do you think?
"- Well, she's photogenic."
What did you say?
That they'll make soap out of them?
There's a shortage.
Soap is worth more than 200 liras a kilo.
and god knows people in Naples need it.
- You must be joking.
"- No, General."
"When mom gives orders, you have to obey..."
"You are still in college, are they sick or what?"
Bankruptcy!
He's broke.
They can't afford to support both of us.
I fucked up your life as well.
Never mind.
I'll pay for that too.
You take care of yourself.
"Murat, I need your help."
I am pregnant...
I want this child but not marriage.
If we get to the point...
Sis?
"Yeah, we are all fine."
Can?
"No, that's not what I meant."
I was going to go to the army recruiting centre... a German photographer was studying my art.
Are you a faggot?
Did you apply for an exemption?
Would you like coffee?
I want to take you to Germany.
What would I do there?
You'll stay with me.
My house big.
I'll do everything for you.
The military won't let go of me.
What kind of photos do they want?
Holy shit.
Disgusting.
They must really enjoy this.
"Sukran, could you make tea for us?"
"You don't want to die, huh?"
"Well, don't worry about it, sonny."
I'm gonna let you live.
"Oh, boy, thanks."
"Oh, boy, you're welcome, but on one condition."
"You gotta keep your mouth shut, you understand?"
Sure.
You don't talk to nobody.
You just keep your mouth shut.
(AGREEING) Don't say a word to no one.
You keep everything quiet.
You don't say nothin'.
Nothin'.
Nothin'.
You don't say nothin' to anybody.
You keep your mouth shut and be sure you just do like I tell you.
Then you won't get into any trouble.
Shut up!
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Someone's at the door.
Let's see who it is.
"Well, let's go."
You get the door.
"Okay, sure."
"But be sure when you open the door, you don't say nothin'."
Remember what I told you.
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't say nothin' to nobody.
"Just open the door, see who's there, and that's all."
You don't talk to nobody.
You understand?
"Just open the door, that's all I'm askin' you to do."
The nearest one is two hours from here and it's not even that nice.
We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and... you can sleep in the living room on the convertible. but we really should go.
We can leave early in the morning.
as it were.
Pop?
Okay.
Sit.
you want some dessert? and hardly any sleep.
I'm fucking 90.
that's 101 reasons to keep moving.
Logan.
then what?
Then we take her to her friends in Eden.
And then we buy the Sunseeker.
Take the pills.
shit!
- What's going on?
- Nate!
Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure.
check the sink.
They shut it off again.
They are just not going to let this thing go.
you might as well handle it now.
It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.
We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes.
all right.
The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here.
Sometimes it gets itself shut off.
- By assholes.
- Hey!
No.
Shannon is on the trail of a creature known locally as The Beast.
She's brought us to the exact spot where we stand the best chance of seeing it tonight.
The full moon is about to rise and the creatures of the night are coming out to play.
And cut.
Nice.
Very poetic.
Don't let me get too fancy.
I don't want to lose the audience.
"So, how do you want to do this?"
Steve!
What is that?
A secure container.
Harmless but inescapable.
We're going to catch The Beast.
Our first time as a family.
I feel like I should make a speech.
You'd better make it quick if you don't want to end it growling.
Come on.
The moon won't wait.
Maddy?
I'm sorry.
- Maddy!
- Open this door.
Don't you dare!
Maddy!
Open this door now!
I'll see you in the morning.
"- Maddy, I mean it!"
- You are in trouble...
Are you sure about this?
No.
So hurry before I lose my nerve.
- What did he have to drink?
- A bit too much vodka.
- It's Tuesday afternoon.
- We were celebrating his grades.
- You must be really proud of him.
- We certainly are.
"We are, too."
I'm taking you home.
- Get better soon.
"- We'll phone tomorrow, babe."
What are you at?
The last one sort of didn't work.
Alex went diving.
- Come on.
"That's not X, it's coke."
- I said I didn't want any.
You never want anything.
DRUGS
I started using drugs...
Somebody offered me some.
"Everyone does them, so I did too."
When we use them...
nothing can stop us.
"Drugs are a way of escaping from your problems, yes."
My world without drugs Emptiness.
Coke makes you cooler because you are part of the crowd.
You feel you can do anything.
Nothing's impossible.
You can have whoever you want.
Nobody's better than you.
"The line between life and death, right?"
That's the best high of all.
- You spent what?
"Yes, we spent a lot of money."
"So, what?"
How much?
Why do you want to know?
Just tell me.
"Apart from our savings, we have borrowed some."
Varun!
"- Varun, stop!"
Your eyes are very sensitive to light now.
It will take some time to get used to excessive light.
You will have to use spectacles.
"- Okay, doctor."
'Calling Deepa'.
Varun.
Think practically.
You say that she used to come to the restaurant everyday.
But you don't know what she looks like.
You neither have her photo nor her address.
How do we search for her?
I promised to help her.
She must have pinned her hopes on me.
Would she have any idea about my accident?
She would have thought that I had cheated her.
There is no wrong from your side.
Don't think too much.
Varun.
Excuse me.
Do you remember the girl who used to come with me?
Everyday I see lot of people.
Thank you.
Tell me if you see her.
- A retarded woman in her thirties.
I didn't notice she was retarded so we went back to her parents' place.
I overlooked certain telltale signs.
"""It's okay with my mum and dad."" The Bambi poster in her room."
"Anyway, don't tell anyone."
People have a hard time with it.
And sex!
Imagine the uproar.
"I didn't know, and the sex was fine."
- The sex was fine?
Very interesting.
"- Her boobs weren't retarded, okay?"
I prefer a retard with good boobs over a bright girl with stupid boobs.
That's where you eat and sing and read and so on.
"- Nice, isn't?"
- Indeed.
WELCOME BODIL
"The room needs to be furnished, but..."
Look.
Your idea?
Super.
What a nice... square room.
I'd like a moment alone with Bodil.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Do you like it?
- Yes.
- I painted it.
- Isn't that nice?
- I painted it with my mouth.
- You painted that with your mouth?
- Yes.
But it's pretty!
This for a party?
Mi?
"ka, you won't look good in this."
How can you say that?
I've got something to go with it...
A different material!
"I wanted to, but there wasn't anything."
Hardly anything at all.
But this is nice!
Then I'll hurry...
And now this.
So how do you want it?
"I don't know, you can advise us."
One meter twenty.
How much did they give me?
"One meter twenty, but double width."
- That's enough for the whole dress!
- From this?
She'll have one more dress.
Isn't it some mistake?
Good evening.
What can I bring you?
Good evening.
Looks nice here.
"Good wine and good prices, if only we had hard currency to pay for it."
We've only got ordinary crowns.
Bring us some good cheap wine.
"Two Martells, please."
And seven decilitres of wine.
Just a moment. I must know what it will cost.
"Grenadine for my daughter, please."
"My strong advice, sir, would be to appoint some of them to the jury."
"It would be not only prudent, but fair."
Fair?
They was gonna hang that man without a trial.
"All right, Litefoot."
You're appointed prosecutor.
Tell Sheriff Stains I'll pick some people for the jury from Eagle Bend.
"It's unorthodox, but I want this trial to be fair for everyone."
You can also tell the sheriff we're on the job here.
"That he will, gentlemen."
That he will.
Good day.
Can I have a cell like that?
-Ma'am.
-Nathan.
-Ma'am.
-l'll get you some blankets.
Make it real comfortable for you.
Daddy?
"Daddy, you all right?"
Fine. I'm fine.
Look at you.
Grown into a fine man.
After I knew you made it north...
... Iusedto dreamaboutyou...
... livingasafreeman.
"Daddy, you didn't have to stay."
You could have come with me.
I would have slowed you down.
"-You, uh, want some supper?"
-After a while.
All right.
No.
Marius ran.
Leaving you with me.
Maybe I should thank him.
You know?
Well?
"Well, what?"
"Well, isn't there any part of you that has a bad feeling about this?"
You thought Lance was cheating on you with some lady named Victoria.
I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
Victoria's a character he created
- to scam Grandma.
- Do you have any idea how fucking preposterous that sounds?
That doesn't make it untrue.
"Carly, move it!"
"Lance claims to have lost more money than Audrey on that deal, yet he's buying a boat."
Where is he getting the money from?
"For fuck's sake, let's ask him."
"Ask a question, you get an answer."
That doesn't necessarily get you the truth.
I can get you the truth.
I just need a day.
- That's it?
- That's it.
And one more thing.
[door opens]
Can I help you?
Ex...
Ex-ex-ex...
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
This is private property.
"Don't sell it, you owe us."
So find someone who knows how to cook it.
Son of a bitch!
Get out of here or I'll peg you in the head!
- Find anything?
"- No, nothing."
In the well?
Garbage.
"Tie up the geese, I need to take a leak."
Abelardo!
"Abelardo, come here!"
Carmen.
Estrellla.
"Go back to the oar, I forgot my notebook."
- Where was that?
- Back there.
Then why are you putting it here?
- With the other stuff.
- What stuff?
The pile.
All together so nothing gets lost.
I'll put it back if you want.
"No, leave it there."
Don't touch anything else.
Write this down.
"""Apart from the breasts..."
"""Several cuts, apparently stab wounds."
"First degree burn on the left hand."""
Let's move to the other body.
"Write down that she has cuts across her neck, abdomen and thorax."
Three fingers cut off on her left hand.
Signs of vaginal injury.
"You know, I'm almost sad this negotiation is over."
Why?
I was just starting to enjoy your company.
Same here.
What do you say you and I bill our clients for another two hours?
Let's make it three.
"Oh, hi."
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
"Uh, I followed the flyers."
Well... you found me.
"So unless you're gonna help look for Gabriel,"
I'm kind of busy.
"Well, you know..."
"You know, I was serious the other night."
I mean...
I'd love to see you again.
If you're interested.
I am interested.
But that's the problem.
I don't understand.
How... how is that a problem?
"Look, first off..."
It feels a little like you and your wife haven't totally worked out the open marriage thing.
So that's a little more complicated than I'd like.
And second...
"if I have to be honest,"
I like you.
Which means...
I don't want to share you with anyone.
Oh.
"I'm sorry, Elliot."
Say it again in Japanese if you dare
Say it again!
- Get out of my way!
- I dare you!
"Come on, guys!"
Faster!
Tado!
"Baso, kill him!"
I'm holding down his feet!
Beat him up!
I'm holding down his feet again!
Stop!
All of you!
What is it?
What the hell?
Let me cut off this pig head of yours!
Stop!
Stop!
Yoshi...
Yoshimura
You're in big trouble
You have the nerve to beat me up
Let's kill him!
Shut your mouth!
Excuse us!
Let us through!
I'll kill all you Mehebu clansmen
I'll kill you all
"Let's do it, Father, before the Japanese kill us all"
Why the hell did you provoke him when you knew he'd kill us all?
You're nothing but a bunch of hounds that can only chase and hunt and know nothing of self-restraint
How much longer do I have to put up with you?
"- No, I can't deal with this."
- You have a strange way of dressing.
"- See you, Sis."
I'll see myself out.
Locker rooms abound in peckers.
- He positioned himself oddly.
- You're such a prude.
"Christ, it's not really that bad."
- I rather like it.
- It's sweet.
But it's not art.
It's crap.
"Artistically, it's a piece of crap."
- It is bad.
- But not for an old lady.
"Still, do we want to buy it or burn it?"
"You're such a snob, Casper."
"Because a handicapped person painted it, you think it's crap."
- I think it's crap because it is.
- Only because a handicapped...
I've got nothing against handicapped people.
I like them.
- Sometimes your view of people...
- I've got nothing against retards.
Not the slightest.
Casper even shagged a retard.
You've been with a retard?
"Casper, have you?"
"- Yes, but it was before your time."
- I don't care when it was.
"Jesus Christ, you always think with your prick!"
At least I don't give monotonous head.
She was probably raped like her sister.
Help me turn her over.
She was forced from behind too.
They have been in the water for two days.
- Where does this road lead?
- To the river.
- What are those photos for?
- El Caso.
- How did you find out?
- I got a call.
- Who?
- I don't know.
Get out of here.
Weren't you listening?
Get the hell out of here!
"I'm leaving, I'm leaving!"
Go on.
Handle this discreetly and solve it as soon as possible.
I promise you'll be rewarded.
"The harvest begins soon, and we can't lose it."
We already have enough problems with the strike.
Your ticket back to Madrid.
"They weren't killed here, there's no blood."
Someone drove them here and dumped them.
The tire tracks double back.
He changed his mind and turned around.
Maybe he saw someone and got nervous.
Someone has to tell the parents.
"You're from here, they know you."
You guys do it.
We have to see them every day.
I'll do it.
"She swings like Tarzan, through the vine."
I don't think that Paul chews that.
Can you believe Antoniette?
Watching her in predator mode is better than...
Shark week on the Discovery Channel.
"- Hello, whores!"
- There is special China Chow...
He' s probably giving some hints on how to remain in the spotlight... without actually doing anything.
- I gotta take notes.
- I think I'll follow you.
"How are you doing, sweetie?"
I don't know.
"Kind of tired, I don't feel so well."
I think I'll just go home and get some sleep.
Have a drink of bourbon it hits the head for 15 hours.
You'll be a million times better.
We changed the ceramics?
- I think so.
Then.
It's normal.
There's always smoke the first time.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
You don't look too well.
- I'm fine.
The vacuum cleaner is not the reason.
Is it?
No.
I have other problems.
A woman.
I bet.
- What makes you think that?
- into a POW camp.
- Why would he do that?
After what he's been through?
Maybe it's not so bad.
"- Yeah, how's that?"
- Now we have someone on the inside.
"If the prisoners know we're trying to break them out during work detail, we'll have a better shot."
"But when we get them out, where do we hide them?"
I saw an abbey not far from here.
I'll go and make contact and see if they'll take them in.
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- There was nothing you could have done.
About Alfred running?
About René.
Nothing any of us could have done.
So let yourself off the hook.
They got him.
Doesn't mean they're going to get Alfred.
Let's make sure they don't.
This was Eric's bunk.
- Are you American?
- Any news from England?
He's Canadian.
And he goes by Eric Darcy now.
What happened to Eric?
His heart gave out.
On work detail.
- How far are we into Europe?
- I'm sorry.
It's not going well.
There is no Western front.
He has the sight problem.
Prestige problem to wear spectacles.
Where is your husband?
He has the ego problem.
He doesn't come unless called.
Hubby!
"Suzuki Subramanyam alias Tukaram, He transformed as the sadist husband now."
Qualities:
Infinite doubt.
Sadism:
Speechless amount.
Ego:
Unbearable amount.
Why are you shouting?
Do you think I am deaf?
I have not thought so.
- Why are you shouting then?
Tell me.
Cool brother-in-law..
How dare you touch me?
Am I your brother-in-law  [Informal] ?
I am your brother-in-law  [Formal] .
"If you can touch me, I will kick you off.."
Who are you all?
Have you come for donations?
"No sir, we came on an important work with you,"
What is that?
Look at this once.
What is this dark angle?
From how long is this going on?
Tell me how long is this happening?
"Do not hit brother-in-law, sister is like fire."
Buy passage far from Capua and the things that have been done to you.
- Where did you get this?
- Spirited from Gaia's things.
They will not be missed.
You fade with each day.
Do not make me bear witness to your passing.
- Come with me.
- I attend Domina.
My absence would be noticed.
"Go, before contest is ended."
"I will see you again, one day."
I swear to you.
Go.
A match for the ages.
I shall miss this.
Water.
"Crixus, victor."
Why did you drop your guard?
You are champion now.
That is all that matters.
I would not thought it possible.
To be said of many things this day.
"Quintus, it's not too late..."
Father?
Fetch the Medicus!
"Your father burns high fever, a worrisome condition for a man of his years."
"Well, is there nothing to be done?"
I have not the herbs.
And the hour is late for us to procure them.
Go.
I'll watch over him.
I'll pound on every door in Capua until we have what is needed.
- Do we need to chain it up?
"- Nah, this will do."
- Cool?
- Cool.
"This is really the last time, I'm gonna say this to you."
Okay?
or anything else...
"I don't want you to send me anything anymore, I don't..."
I threw out those flowers.
You can't fix it.
And I'm really... done with you.
"I don't want talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
"Please, okay?"
You don't know how to fix this.
You can't fix it.
"You, have no clue."
Just...
leave me alone.
I don't ever wanna hear from you again.
"Wake me up, when the latch turns."
But what if...
"This isn't exactly the residence of a renegade, Daze."
But...
Just keep a look out while I go in dream about the dress.
Oh my God!
Is that the guy?
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
- Why didn't he take our guns or...?
- I don't know.
- Should we wake him up or just pop him?
"Oh, it's gonna be okay."
- She's going down.
- She's going down.
Don't touch her.
- Yeah?
"- Sir, I'm sorry to contact you directly, but the crowd is drooling for you."
"Yep, floor is wet out here."
"- Okay, great."
Thank you.
- Tom James!
Tom James!
I'm gonna go rally the rally.
"With all due respect, you need to get your shit together now, lady."
Ma'am up.
You're still the leader of the free world.
Hmm?
Where's Tom?
"Oh, he's gone to talk to the crowd at the rally."
- What?
- The fuck he has.
Why would you let him do that?
"- Well, you don't work here."
"- Well, neither do you."
"All right, fuck all of you."
I'm going to the rally.
"Ma'am, ma'am, that would be unprecedented."
"No, I'll tell you what's unprecedented, Kent."
A tie is unprecedented.
So is becoming the first lady president.
So is that jackoff becoming president through the back door.
Okay?
The rule book's been torn up now and America is wiping its nasty ass with it.
"Look, all I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie."
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night after the show, she got somebody fired."
- Really?
"- One of the crew, the sound guy."
There were some wires on the floor.
She was like... complaining and
"I mean, I met the guy when I was."
He was a nice kid.
Now what's he gonna do?
What's he gonna do?
Wait.
Don't tell me.
"Sound engineer billy logan, right?"
My what are you doing here?
"My god, come in, come in!"
I can't believe this.
You've been taking pictures of me.
"Yeah, I thought I saw you."
I hope you don't mind.
"There was nothing on the web site, so I took a few candids."
They're for the next issue.
"Cast and crew after-hours, behind the scenes."
"While I have you here,"
"I have, well, a couple of questions."
It's not your lucky day.
What a shame.
Just a kid.
At least he didn't hit anybody when he jumped.
Are we sure he jumped?
"""Tired of losing."""
Not much of a note.
God damn it!
Is that your new waitress?
- You like her?
"You can have her, and give me Nora!"
I am not letting Nora go.
You can forget it!
Alright.
How's my money doing?
Still stuck to the wall.
"I'll stick you the wall too, my boy."
"I have a little time, and I have to show you this."
"Incidentally, I don't have any time."
You won't regret it.
"Listen, you just show up out of nowhere."
Couldn't you at least say please?
What's all this?
Why do you make everything so complicated?
Of course not then.
"I'm busy, goodbye."
Then at least stop singing.
"I have to get my show finished, you got that?"
Do you think you can just tell me what to do?
"Oh yeah, I think so."
"You're mistaken, my dear."
Put your lousy 10 Euros away.
I only take donations over a hundred.
I've thought about it.
In this case it's not a donation.
I would like something in return.
"What I want in return, is to touch you."
Go ahead.
What's going on here?
Bust that shit up!
Bust it like it's Dyson's douchey-ass face!
Yes!
That face is never kissing again.
- What else?
- We wallow.
Kenzi break-up mix on repeat all frigging afternoon.
- You have a break-up mix?
"- Dude, you have so much to learn."
Yes.
And then it's girls on the town.
"We're gonna burn this city to the ground, baby!"
I don't do that.
I'm not much of a party queen.
Drinking equals losing control equals someone gets dead.
"Yeah, but what a way to go, dude."
"Okay, fine."
We'll cut loose somewhere safe.
"You know, this is what I don't get, okay?"
"I did nothing wrong, and I'm the one whose day has gone to shit."
"For Dyson, it's like, ""Bo who?"" Totally unaffected."
Let's go.
Let's go.
We're gonna party.
We're gonna forget about it.
All right?
We'll see about that.
"Okay, this is me in the bar."
- And this is me going back to bed.
"- Oh, no."
We are not wasting hours of dress-up.
I don't care if I have to slather you with fairy dust.
He's worried about her.
So I hope we are ...
Yes?
What do you say?
We're talking about cultural abyss?
A colleague who cut the fire rope to protect her.
Not to mention that he exploded right after all.
Was it because he was afraid of her?
He was afraid that she would kill?
Or something?
"Nixon, where are you?"
Hi.
'I brought you coffee. 'I'm not drunk.
I did not find it.
I know encrenco me sometimes.
but I will be able to stand?
You can not be better than that?
I took these.
Do not worry.
Mom and I arrange.
He barely had become a full member.
A larger funeral costs more money.
We can do it be worth it even if it is small and intimate.
-Let's Take it together.
-What Do you think of the club?
They cared about him.
And me.
We should not think about it?
"I refuse to go there, even for a funeral ..."
It was my husband.
I who decides.
The Ferrymen is more than a club of motorcyclists.
She died in my arms.
"She begged me to take the baby, but  it was very late."
Liar!
"I understand, why do not you believe me."
"It's hard to accept, that your world is breaking."
"When you are in it, pick up the pieces."
But maybe...
You believe her.
"Come Aluxia, let's play somewhere else."
"Bishop, I'm sorry, my love."
I wanted to tell you.
I feared for your life.
I knew the truth too late.
I was wrong.
We were all wrong.
"We have created them, but we do not control it."
We are not their gods.
Your destiny is yours.
"Like us, they can love..."
They can create offspring.
"They have souls, who long for freedom."
The humanoids must release them.
"Remember when we said, that we were going to this place?"
Yes.
"Across the country, up here."
"Can you remember, what's the name of this place?"
-Selegna Sol.
"""All right, Selegna Sol."
We can leave this cave cold.
The Selegna Sol.
There it is wonderfully hot.
- Are you waiting for it?
- When did she lose her pulse?
- Never had one.
- Everybody.
On my count.
One-
- Hold transfer and compressions!
- Asystole!
- Abdomen's distended.
Pelvic instability.
Suction on high.
I need a Yankauer.
That's easily two liters.
"All right, amp of epi."
Don't bother.
Obvious C-spine fracture.
She's not even a good organ donor now.
- Is her family here?
- Trying to locate them.
- We can talk to them...
- It's fine.
Just let me know when they arrive.
...if it'd be easier for you.
I could pull the trigger right now if I wanted to.
Because it's all right here.
"Welcome back, Elizabeth."
Do you have time for a consult?
"As it turns out, yes."
What's he have?
Belly pain?
Only because he swallowed a handful of nitroglycerin.
No sudden moves unless you want me to blow!
Milo has right upper quadrant tenderness with rebound.
Why?
If the invalid eats one particular soup the maker's wish will come true.
Do you have a wish too?
"I have one, yes:"
to pass my exams.
I have another one too.
What is it?
I want Mrs Malek to get better.
- To get better?
- Yes.
Can you find us some milk for breakfast?
I don't have any cattle.
I'm alone.
Tell Farzad to fetch you some.
I don't understand...
"Ask the boy, he'll fetch you some."
"We're in the country, we'd like to consume local produce."
I don't have any.
I don't have any milk or cattle.
I have a lot of work.
Where are the people?
"Yesterday, walking around the village, I only saw children and old people."
The young men work the land.
They're farmers.
No one's idle here.
The old people and children stay in the village.
Where are the young people?
I just told you:
they're working the land.
The corn and barley are ready for harvesting.
The young people work for three months.
"In winter, they don't work."
Horatio.
So soon ?
I was just prepping the shooting vic from the condo.
"Alexx, is that a void in the blood ?"
I think our boy was wearing a wire.
"Yes, it looks that way."
You don't seem surprised.
Is that a fingerprint right there ?
Yeah.
"Whoever removed this wire, left his print in the adhesive."
Who was this guy ?
No one goes to this much trouble over a dead dealer.
We do.
We have an audience.
"Yes, we do."
"Give me a minute, will you, Alexx ?"
John... u can't be here.
How'd this mope get out ?
- Cop killers don't get early release...
"- John, I need you to stay out of this."
Stay out of this ?
Bob Keaton down there killed my partner.
Your brother.
What is it you're not telling me ?
I don't have that information yet.
You don't have that information ?
I've been on the outside since the day Raymond died.
"Yes, you have."
And it probably kept you alive.
What's this about ?
I don't know yet.
Just raises so many questions.
too hard for this guy.
No risk of getting hurt.
But is this right for me?
I'm kind of sensing a pattern here.
"You've got this great, beautiful chest on you with great definition."
You probably bench press quite a bit.
Is Seven right about me?
I hate for Seven to be right because he's always right about that kind of stuff.
"I mean, seriously I don't think that's jerky..."
I need a sign.
Is this right for me?
I got this great idea.
I know you're gonna love it.
Fitness fanatics.
It's my reality TV show.
Check please.
Separate checks?
Yeah.
Hi.
"Ready, Freddy?"
"We're walking, right?"
You don't want to drive?
"You guys, it's two blocks."
"They have valet parking, you know."
So where's Hallie this morning?
I don't know.
"I saw her on Tuesday, and I haven't seen her for the rest of the week."
You know that she changed her...
status to it's complicated?
What does that mean?
It's... complicated?
With who?
"Well, what if they find it on you?"
"Don't worry, they won't."
Wait a minute.
I think I just figured it out.
I'm sending a man around to the apartment.
He'll give you a scalp massage.
He'll have the merchandise in his pocket.
I got it.
Bye.
Which pocket?
Hello?
Would you like to try it one more time?
I should not like to try it one more time.
I should not like to see your face one more time.
"Allow me, sir."
Thank you.
Not at all.
"Could you help me, monsieur?"
It is lunchtime.
But my wife would like a treatment at home.
"Oh, the wife would like a treatment."
"Oh, monsieur!"
"Oh, but I cannot leave the shop."
"Oh, it'll be all right, Francois."
I am not Francois.
"Oh, I'll speak to him personally."
"Oh, well, if you think it will be all right, monsieur."
I should like very much to give the wife the treatment.
Thank you very much.
I shall get the equipment.
I think I have everything.
I appreciate this.
They can stand by.
"And when we're ready for somebody, they can be there."
MAN:
"How are they gonna be there, Lloyd?"
They can be right in the back.
"And then when we call for them, they can be there, right?"
I'm sorry.
I've been making movies for a long time.
People can stay off the set and be
Available when they're needed.
There's a little bit of-
- I'm not
Quite sure how to describe it.
But you can interview some people on the set.
There was a little bit of that actress stuff
"Going on yesterday, I'm afraid."
But I think we managed to nip it in the bud.
"No, not at all."
And I didn't plan on not doing it.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be fine."
[High-pitched noise]
"If we don't shut this off, we won't"
"Be able to hear the church bells when they start going, see."
"OK, camera is ready."
"Quiet on set, please."
Standing by.
WOMAN:
No more bell ringers.
[Bell ringing]
ALL:
Aw.
Niels.
He's in the Netherlands for another day and a half.
I got your gun and we're going now.
You can't say no.
You owe it to Arie.
What do you want with him?
Have you been sent as a provocateur or something?
Bullshit.
It's exactly as I say.
Niels is in Amsterdam.
Put that thing away!
You can't be serious.
"Damn, you're serious."
-Of course.
"No, I'm not doing it."
So you risked your life for this mess.
I'm selling a lot.
-I bet you are.
I have to.
My son's studying medicine and I'm paying for everything.
"When he'll be finished, he won't have any debt."
What has really changed after the war?
The fascists are in power again.
Except they have a bigger mouth now and they're keeping the people stupid.
That's true.
-And what are they using to do it?
That nonsense that you're selling.
What did we say to each other back then?
Those bastards from the war will never know any peace.
Down with the fascists!
Or not?
You're good.
"- I was just making the point, sir, that you've been screwing every girl in here with your eyes since we arrived, which suggests that sex ranks higher than substance."
"And I'll pass, thanks."
"You see, I don't really find intellectual thrust that sexy..."
"Or fake tan, for that matter."
"Oh, you think that's funny, do you?"
- It's possibly funny...
- Possibly funny.
"The thing is, I don't actually have to put up..."
OK.
Cool.
See you!
I think you should join her.
"Don't you, Tony?"
Toodle-oo.
You.
You really fucked up in there.
I really fucked up?
"Wait, what are you even doing here, anyway?"
Same thing you are.
Wow!
Check it out.
Ah...
Shall we?
No.
No way.
"First of all,"
I can't really swim very well any more and secondly...
"Ahh, boo-hoo."
What the fuck?
!
"I told you, I can't..."
I can't...
"You'll admit, as a secondary school teacher..."
The salary's also a deciding factor.
So cheap and good quality.
Bring something.
Here you are.
You pay in advance.
How much will it cost?
A hundred and twenty-nine.
It'll be the death of me.
"Hubert, and Extra at that - Sixty-six crowns!"
That's what we expected.
I must work out how much this dance of yours will cost.
That music's terrible.
"For that money no one... lf someone comes and asks you, don't go and dance."
This music. lt's awful.
Awful?
"What are you doing here, boys?"
"Dad, for heaven's sake stop that!"
"Do you mind, I know them."
"Okay, but you're not going to force anyone on me."
- Can't I introduce them?
"- No, that's not done."
Mi?
"ko, isn't your daughter dancing?"
"Not for the moment, maybe she will."
Don't you dance to this?
- She doesn't dance to this.
- And what will she dance to?
That's just what we needed!
What did we need?
This!
Did we need this?
- What happened to Tino Zapatti?
"- He's dead, isn't he?"
I'm talking about 2 years ago.
He got probation.
What sentence did you recommend?
Ten to twenty.
I saw the rap sheet.
Tino was pushing drugs to kids.
"Not doing it himself, but having kids deal for him."
Weapon from a previous homicide?
Disappeared in the second report.
Who ordered it?
That I don't know.
Why didn't you ask?
Sudden urge to move to the country.
I forgot about it.
Now if you'll excuse me you'd better get out of here.
My lumbago tells me that snow is coming.
You better hurry.
Buffalo gets socked in pretty fast.
Thank you for your time.
Watch your step.
It's slippery.
Thank you.
- How long?
- About an hour.
You don't want to suffocate in a tunnel.
They got to dig one out ahead.
"Meanwhile, enjoy the snow."
We can't eat snow.
- Try that diner over there.
- Any good?
How are you?
How did school go?
"You OK, Grandma?"
"Yes, I'm fine."
"""Oh yes, I know it's cold"
"""That the sky is all... askew"
"""I know that neither..."""
"- ""Primroses."" - ""Primroses"
"""Nor lambs are here yet"
"""The earth spins;"
"spring will come back..."""
"- ""on its green horse."" - ""On its green horse"
"""What's a wood without woodpeckers, A garden without lilac?"
"""Everything passes, even..."""
"- ""Even winter."" - ""Even winter."""
- Grandma.
"- Yes, darling?"
I'm coming to live with you.
Isn't it a good idea?
I don't know.
"Yes, a very good idea."
But it's not possible.
You have a mum and dad who'd be sad if you left them.
"Sorry, Mum, there was an accident just as I was leaving."
Weekend emergencies.
And the boss came 2 hours late.
"I sent loads of messages, you didn't answer."
I lost my phone.
And the landline...
- Have you eaten?
- I can't stay.
I have appointments very early.
How's that for over?
"You let me find the body, Jenny."
- You pretended to be upset.
"- I'm sorry I lied, Bo."
But that was before I understood this thing we have between us.
But everything's different now.
I'll never be separated from the one I love.
"What did you do, Jenny?"
You can learn a lot from the Internet like how to turn ordinary fertilizer and paint into explosives.
When I push this button we'll be together forever.
- Okay.
"Okay, but if we're gonna go out with a bang I want it to be in your arms."
"Oh, I'd like that."
- Okay.
- Slowly.
How convenient.
They're together.
One-stop shopping.
Liar.
You're just like everyone else.
I didn't bring them.
Just calm down.
- Who are you?
- Our sister's dead because of you.
"And you took part, so you both pay."
Don't.
Don't.
She's got a bomb.
No.
This isn't supposed to go like this.
"Everybody, calm down."
We're gonna talk.
Throw down your weapons.
On the ground!
Throw down your weapons.
Silence.
"(LOLA) Let's go, there's no time to lose."
"How dare you speak to us, harpy?"
The Ministry has fallen and by your fault.
I'm helping you.
"The Ministry has it's defenses, it's own soldiers."
And I have sent the Nazis into a trap from which they can't escape.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
"And what do you think you're laughing at, ""dumbass""?"
That you think you will defeat our glorious army.
We'll see about that.
To where?
To the Ministry.
It's the only way we'll know what's going on.
These will be our shields.
I hope that the Germans are good soldiers.
"Why, so they'll kill us?"
"No, because a good army would never let their General die."
Stay with her.
"No, I'll stay."
"The more of you there, the better."
Are you sure?
Yes.
The Ministry is what matters.
Let's go.
(HITLER) Oh. (YELLING IN GERMAN)
-Pardon.
"Sorry, sorry, eh... (SPEAKING GERMAN)"
Why are you smiling?
Glad to see you've started to eat again.
You've been gone a long time.
I had business to do.
Did it have anything to do with me?
Maybe.
I have a right to know.
Have you sent the ransom note to my husband?
"My dear lady, the less you know, the better it's gonna be for both of us."
Especially for you.
Don't leave.
Please.
You mean that.
Do you?
I just wanted you to know that I read the books that you brought me.
Ah.
What did you think of them?
I liked them.
What I could read of them.
It's so dark in here.
It isn't easy to read.
No problem.
I'll bring you another lamp.
Anything else you want?
Do you think I could have a television set?
Smart.
"You think you're pretty damned smart, don't you?"
What do you mean?
You think your kidnapping will be on TV and you can find out what's going on.
I'm not thinking that.
"Well, it won't do you any good."
It won't help you get out of here.
I've thought of everything.
Proof?
"Hell yes, proof!"
I'm not the kind to talk shit without backing it up.
Come look at this.
You ready?
Look.
You see?
"Empty, right?"
I stayed the hell away from the mountains since that day.
Even put the store up for sale.
How is that proof?
What?
Damn you...
That's not the point.
"The point is, when I opened my eyes, there he was- stark naked except for a diaper."
A diaper?
That's right.
A grown man?
I'm telling you.
- Grown men can wear diapers.
- Get outta here.
Bladder control problems are surprisingly common in adults.
But why go into the woods to treat incontinence?
- Inconfinencen.
- Am I talking to myself here?
"Anyway, he had his face buried in the carcass, his body covered in blood... his eyes all bloodshot."
"Then he looked up, and all of a sudden..."
I haven't slept since that day.
- He was chewing on the guts?
- That's right.
- You saw him eating raw flesh?
- Yeah...
"Of course, and I cut her hair, dyed it, did her nails and I scrubbed her down well, front and back."
"My mother wasn't disabled, or mad."
"She was just a bit lazy, you know?"
My mother was beautiful and I didn't want her to let herself go.
What did your father say?
"Nothing, what could he say?"
Is he dead?
"Heavens, no."
He's living in Sweden.
"I guess, because..."
I haven't heard from him in ages.
Doesn't he come to see you?
No.
"He formed another family a long time ago, when he left my mother."
We're not in touch.
Why have you come to see me?
Me?
None.
What's your problem?
You must have one if you've come to see a psychiatrist.
"Loneliness, I guess."
Have you had sexual relations with a woman?
No.
Or with a man?
No.
I'd like to see you next week.
Am I not well?
"No, it isn't that, but..."
Your adolescence was what we might call special.
It wasn't that special.
It was.
Very special.
Who is this Babette?
"This is a new one, a friend."
"Tomorrow, you are welcome to get a room."
"You go to the reception desk like everyone else, so you won't have to sneak in here at night."
Then I'll introduce you to everyone else.
Fine.
I don't know if everything is fine.
At least it's not for me.
"Franz, just leave."
"Franz, please!"
Can't we lock the door?
No.
We're talking about months worth of work here!
Intellectual work!
100 Euros for you.
No more!
No less!
Thanks.
No way then.
I promised the people an event.
I want the seats full.
"And next year, we make your place into a respectable hotel."
"Alfons, this isn't just some quiz show here."
I'll make it sound captivating...
This quiz show is the dawn of a new era.
Who's dreaming here now?
Last offer... 300 Euros for me and you can call it a 99 cent show.
100!
"Thanks, then I'll look for someone else."
Who?
Where would he go?
Television perhaps.
Since when do they pass up Sunday brunch?
"Your grandfather's at the office, and Taylor's busy."
Too busy to save his immortal soul?
Funny.
But not the part where you burn in hell.
I liked the sermon this morning.
"Oh, nice pandering."
I'm serious.
"Okay, okay, first off, it was a homily."
Sermons are for Protestants.
Filthy heathens.
We're glad you came.
I was glad to be included.
"While you're here, would you mind looking at some paperwork for me?"
No such thing as a free brunch.
We have to pick up the kids from my folks.
On it.
Stay with Audrey.
Earn some Brownie points.
Can I get a ride?
"I mean, I can always hitch."
Maybe get picked up by some harmless-looking guy in a panel van.
Go get ready.
Wheels up in five minutes.
- Thank you.
- I'll be at the car.
Meaning you'll be having a cigarette.
I'll be having a cigarette.
Ohh now.
You smoke?
Only crack.
"Hey, I got to talk to you about something."
Was she just about to tell me she loved me?
I'm so glad we came.
Blair£¬I need to talk to you.
Gossip girl knows.
Ominous.But ill-timed.
You can tell me tomorrow or never.
About new year's?
"Look,the mean girls want the best piece of gossip"
In exchange for keys to the kingdom.
I just thought you'd want to know.
If gossip girl were gonna post that information
She would have done it this morning.
"and like I said,the mean girls don't control anything."
"Blair, wake up."
You're not queen anymore.
You haven't been for a while.
And you're not going to be either
If you tell anyone what you know.
I'm sorry I wasted my time on you.
You don't have what it takes.
You never did.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Bring me your leader.
It's not midnight.
My gossip's too juicy to wait.
I wanna talk.
I prefer to talk after.
What do you think about my coat?
I like it.
Why?
- And now?
- Even better.
It tore her apart.
My father'll be happy now.
"""Not the girl."""
My mother and I were always telling him that.
But she turned out just like him.
Don't upset yourself.
What time is it?
It's been four hours.
THREE WEEKS LATER
You're going home?
Yes.
"I'd like to stay, but I can't."
You know there's nothing more we can do here.
Our bar's been closed for three weeks.
The kids are with a neighbor and I've neglected this man.
If anything should happen you can get here in two hours.
You can be sure of that.
We must have faith.
Faith?
"I keep lighting candles, but I'm finding it hard to have faith."
When can we put her medals back on?
Not yet.
"With all that she's got, the injuries, the tracheotomy..."
She never took them off.
- I'll get a vase.
- Thank you.
I have to go to America for three months.
My agent says it's important.
But...
The way things are here...
I don't want to go.
Can you go outside for a moment?
Let's celebrate!
This is not a celebration!
This is a nightmare!
Dr. Lonsdale is obsessed.
He won't quit asking me things about you.
"Oh, and now I'm doing surgical procedures that are way over my head."
Let me guess.
- This is all my fault.
- This is all your fault.
You make things so messy.
Like now!
Oh!
Your underwear is in our communal sink when you have a perfectly functional sink of your own!
"Actually, I clogged my sink up hard."
It's a funny story.
"See, I was trying to wax my..."
Stop.
"The point is, I need you to get your thongs out of the sink of my career."
- What?
- Break it off with Lonsdale.
For real.
"I mean, leave the poor guy no hope."
None.
I can do that.
Consider Dr. Everett Lonsdale completely dumped.
"- Although, you never know."
"- No, no, no."
This time I need you to know.
- Tell me you know.
- All right.
"And don't think, ""you never know,"" either."
- Fine.
RB is very confident this time.
It's RB's habit to tell tall tales.
You should never underestimate your competitor.
Right?
I want only Flora Enterprises to get Umbrella Creations' order.
For that we will have to make such designs that Umbrella Creations..
..signs the next 10 years' agreement only with our company.
"Don't worry, sir."
We will try our best.
Not try.
Results.
Definitely.
You are working so hard.
It's very late.
Go to sleep.
Coming.
I will just finish this and come.
Okay?
Hey.
- Hey.
I will see you.
- Yeah.
The designs.
What is this?
Along with your time why are you wasting our time as well?
But have a look..
If our company starts working on the sketches made by you..
..we will even stop getting the few contracts that we have got.
Unbelievable!
Hey.
- Hey.
What happened?
There are bills to be paid.
Take a check from the drawer and pay at the bank.
There's a checkbook with signed checks.
Alright.
"Do it by tomorrow, otherwise there'll be a fine."
Okay.
And sell some of the short-term deposit at the bank.
Tell Yaffa she promised me higher interest.
I'll handle everything.
Did you move all yourthings?
How's the apartment?
I brought everything back home.
Why?
Daddy...
Come on...
I brought yourthings from home and the play from your nightstand.
Do you need anything else?
I don't need anything.
What'll you do with the contract?
It's a waste if you pay and don't live there.
I feel bad about all this.
I ran out of licorice.
Okay.
I'll relieve you.
"Hello, Mr. Director."
"Once again, you took things to heart."
"I'm going, will you be alright?"
Of course.
"Goodbye, my child."
I'll be back later.
Those dancers don't have a contract?
"Sorry, I don't work like that."
How careless of me.
I left my cigarettes at home.
Then you won't need the matches.
"I'm afraid that won't work, unless you have a needle and thread."
"Excuse me, have you change for a quarter?"
Thank you very much.
You shouldn't have done that just for me.
I could've gotten along without them.
- You hold it.
- All right.
Looks like a jackpot.
"Go and get your lucky quarter back, quick."
I beg your pardon.
You probably think I'm silly.
"Yes, I'm afraid I do."
Just a moment.
"That quarter, I wonder if I could have it back?"
This isn't getting you anywhere.
You don't understand.
I'm not trying to get acquainted.
All I want to know is...
"It's all my fault, too."
I'm awfully sorry.
"Yes, I know."
You've been trying so hard to avoid me.
"All right, give it back."
- Give what back?
- The quarter you stole from my purse.
"Come on, will you?"
Hand it over or I'll call a policeman.
I haven't got it.
I gave it to you at the cigarette machine.
Wait a bit.
- How much do you charge?
- Let go of me!
Fuck.
- That's what I'm asking about.
- Go eat shit.
Alright.
- So what are you doing right now?
"- Nothing, nothing."
There's some boys that need a medic.
- Come with me.
- I didn't finish my studies.
"If you don't say anything then I won't either, alright?"
Come.
- Jimmy!
- I thought you weren't coming.
We have to stop along the way.
Pasqualino's coming too.
Let's go!
"As you can see, the interior of Vesuvius isn't dormant."
"And examining the seismographs, we can see that activity... has increased in recent weeks."
- Does that always happen?
- Absolutely not.
This is the first time I see this phenomenon.
- Strange...
- Yes.
"Maria, we..."
"Excuse me, one moment."
Maria!
Where are you going?
What about the picnic?
Tell my father we're going to see the nuns.
"- From their denture cup, so that should count for two!"
- I'd say three.
If aunt Edie asks me one more time
If I've had my BM...
Why does she care?
!
You know what?
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
You should want to go over there and soak up every bit of wisdom
You can get from them!
"If I were you, I would consider it a privilege!"
Then why don't you go?
Because I'm trying to teach you to respect your elders...
And I did my time.
And you know what?
"Since you're fighting about it,"
You're both going.
That's not fair!
"Ohh, no!"
I don't want to hear another word.
Go.
No!
I don't...
ohh!
"We're useless, mike."
We can't even help our kid with third grade math.
Well...
maybe you should go
Talk to his teacher and get him some help.
"We were both banned, but I was banned first, so you have to go."
"Oh, I was banned last, so you should go."
"Okay, you know what?"
- That's a pretty good call.
"- That's nice, yeah."
Hey.
Here's a little bit of everything.
Let your education begin.
This place is perfect.
"Seriously, it's totally safe."
"Ryan, how perfect is this place, right?"
"Seriously, what else could you need?"
Anyone bring any food?
Um...food.
Guess we're going on a mission.
Faster!
"Go, Ryan!"
Whoo!
"Well, call me if someone meeting that description comes in."
Thank you.
Nothing at the hospitals.
I'm sure he'll turn up.
Not if he's smart.
I think Seth knows where he is.
Are you accusing him of lying?
That'll be really good for your relationship.
Let the police handle this.
"Oh, I wish you hadn't called the police."
They don't have the resources or the manpower.
Ryan'll just slip through the cracks.
"Sandy, how many of these cases have you seen?"
Or passed across your desk.
What is it about this kid?
I thought I could help him... make a difference.
I was this kid.
You might as well.
I'll be grand.
I can always slip downstairs.
"I was so embarrassed, I was scarlet."
"I'm not joking yous, I was burnin'!"
How are yous?
- Go on.
"- How are you, Sharon?"
He was holding the eclair in his hand like this.
"The place was full, and he says..."
"""Why did you rob the cream out of me eclair?"""
"- The head on him, Jesus!"
- And did you rob it?
"Well, I paid for the bleedin' thing."
Why shouldn't I have?
I told him to cop on.
"""I seen ya,"" he says, ""with your finger."""
So I gave him the finger.
I'd shag the elephant man before I'd let him near me again.
The prick.
"Here, young fella!"
"Give us three vodkas, two cokes, and a glass of Furstenberg."
"Have you got that now, chicken?"
"Hey, handsome, give us a packet of crisps as well, will ya?"
And do you have any nuts?
Whoo!
You dirty bitch!
I'm only messing with you.
He's a nice little bum on him... like two eggs in a hankie.
"He'll be nice-looking when he's older, won't he?"
Are you going to break it off with him anyway?
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
What the dog do?
Spit gold dust?
He's the best dog you've ever seen.
He could pull that load of yours without any help at all.
- Sure!
I'll bet you he could.
"- Well, he could."
"How'd you like to make a little bet on that, partner?"
Haven't any money to bet.
I hear of one dog in Nome... he pull 800 pound.
But he dies dead to do that.
"Ah, no dog can pull 1,000 pounds."
It's impossible.
"Well, then it's impossible."
Let's drop it.
"Is it all right to look at him, mister?"
It ain't every day we can see a dog that can pull a thousand pounds.
"Come on, boss."
Let's get outta here.
"What's the matter, gentlemen?"
If I overheard correctly... the argument is whether or not this dog can pull a thousand pounds.
I'm willing to bet a dollar a pound he can't.
He won't bet.
Says he's broke.
"I don't want money from you, my friend."
"If your dog is able to do it, I'll give you the $1,000."
- If he can't-
- Well?
"Why, then, I'll take the dog."
No.
"Say, that sounds fair to me."
We tesseract to theandromeda.
"All right, all right, just give me a minute first."
This is incredible.
Why are you doing this?
"Helping us, i mean."
"That's what people do, isn't it?"
Help each other.
"Yeah... people, but haven't you heard?"
"I'm not exactly ""people."""
I feel my pulse racing.
And the warmth of your lips... how can i feel all that and not be human?
You're so much more than you know.
I love you for that.
There's one thing i don't get-
Why your employer
Would tell you so much about his plan.
It's complicated.
"You wanted to see theandromeda,"
But are you willing to pay the price?
Harper!
Why are you doing this?
Because i love you.
This is not love.
"Well, not you exactly."
I love your power.
"Tell me,"
Are you afraid of death?
You shouldn't be.
"I can't kill you, unless you believe i can."
"You're machine,"
Nothing organic in you.
"It's you who should kill me, like a machine must."
What's he waiting for?
I'll get it out of him.
Crates are loaded up.
I want a lead and a chase car.
Don't do the scenic route.
Let's get it behind ssr walls a.S.A.P.
"I'll wake up the eggheads,"
Start figuring out what the hell this stuff is.
"And, boys, drive carefully."
I don't want to be the one who sunk manhattan.
"I don't envy you, buddy."
My pal jack... he's got a special gift for interrogations.
"He's real convincing, gets guys to spill their guts."
That's not an expression.
We've had to use a mop.
I need a doc.
My arm's broke.
What's the point of fixing you up if we're just gonna break you again?
Was that dame working for you?
What dame?
The one on the boat...
"English broad, solid right hook."

Yeah.

You do not.

- do you love me?
"- if wink wasn't here, i'd show you just how much."
- don't mind me.
"- but since he is, i'm just gonna take the minivan and i'm gonna get used to it."
"i'll see you back at home, okay?"
"- wink, please don't make him work too late."
"- [mockingly] no, i won't."
- [chuckles]
- see?
she does love me!
- get off!
"for as bright as you are, you are as dumb as a bag of hammers -- dumb, dumb, dumb!"
- oh.
[sighs] dang it.
- [echoing] you looking for this?
"- oh, not now."
really?
[sighs]
Right now.
And I also want authorization to question Corrales and Quini together.
I heard you were a troublemaker.
What did you say?
All you have is literature.
Your partner saw a man in a hat.
Nothing more.
Isn't that right?
That's right.
I wear a hat too.
Does that make me a suspect too?
I won't authorize anything until you bring me something conclusive.
Now please leave.
I'll call you when I hear back.
You're protecting him.
What?
You don't know how things work around here.
"Yes, I do."
Just like everywhere else.
You're going to be a father.
You should be more careful about what you do.
Get out.
Why didn't you say anything?
Whose side are you on?
Are you with them too?
I just want to solve this case.
I don't want to be taken off it.
You're just like the rest of them.
You'd rather things were like before.
I know what you used to do.
I know about Vallecas.
You don't know anything.
"We have, like, 8000 undocumented workers here daily."
"Okay, and you find an ashtray with cigarettes in it and you think..."
You automatically assume that they're mine.
"Oh, yeah."
"Honey, I'm not lying to you."
I think you are really freaking out.
This whole renovation thing's getting to you because nothing's happening.
Just say no.
Get it out.
Gonna take a shower.
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
Who'd have thought that a random girl from yoga would fix me up with such a good kisser?
"- Back at you, sister."
I can't wait to kiss you again.
But we're kissing right now.
"I know, next time."
The second-date kiss is way more intimate.
"Well, listen I'm leaving tomorrow, so I'll be out of touch for a little bit."
Can you excuse me a quick second?
Too many Diet Cokes.
Okay.
[PHONE RINGING]
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah?
"Hey, sorry to bug you again."
Quick question.
"Excuse me one minute, babe."
Sorry.

I can't go here or there.
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.

I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.
You've known this Tommy all your life.
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.
When I leave my house in the morning I look over both shoulders.
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.
I'll do it.
What could I do?
I would.
I'd like to help you out.
Tell him what we talked about.
take a piece of this joint.
It'd be good.
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?
It's a classy place.
You've been in here a million times.
Tommy taking over this joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.
but that's the way it is.
I'm begging you.
What can I say?
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?
I don't know anything about the restaurant business.

I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
A very important job.
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
"I don't understand it all, but there are a lot of leaks coming out -- we think -- of your office."
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
I don't know.
My math teacher?
Your math teacher?
You got through Harvard Medical School for your math teacher?
"Yeah, no."
I guess I was trying to prove myself to myself.
"You know, I needed..."
-...to prove that I wasn't a loser.
-A loser?
Why would you think you're a loser?
I was around a lot of losers growing up and....
"Not worthless-type loser or, you know, bad person."
Just....
Just lost.
People at loose ends.
And I didn't want to be that.
I wanted to be anything but that.
You're everything but that.
I set up a meeting with his mom.
"It's not protocol, but I think it'll help."
Is he still violent?
No.
"No, he was never violent."
I thought you had to restrain him.
"No, I sedated him."
"-Oh, I thought he was psychotic."
-Huh?
No.
He had a psychotic episode.
He OD'd on methamphetamines.
But he's not psychotic in general.
When did you start reading Spin magazine?
Talking to you?
Is she dead?
Yeah.
She used to say things like that when I was down about something.
Here.
Sorry.
There you go.
"If I start foaming at the mouth, just shoot me, OK?"
Found something.
- Here.
- I lost my appetite.
Have it later.
Do you hear those wolves?
They're all around here now.
They're not going anywhere.
They don't have anything better to do.
- Will they come over here?
- No.
You did OK.
It's good.
I can understand your point of view.
Now listen to mine.
Someday the world will be entirely populated with bureaucrats such as you because real people will do away with themselves out of frustration.
I myself do not want anything out of you.
They do.
They wanna be rescued.
This is what they would say if they could speak themselves.
- What's it look like?
- There's a hole over the Tuscarora mine.
- The whole front's breaking up.
- Everybody go!
Let's go!
Two weeks and still nothing!
- And now?
"- l promise, within three days."
What if it doesn't happen?
She seems to be better now.
Her son left yesterday.
"If she'd been in a bad way, he wouldn't have left."
How do you know that?
We just know.
It's not something you can hide from us.
"She's better, this is useless."
You say that you know but you know nothing.
"First of all, her son is a guard at Kermanshah."
He's gone back to warn his boss.
It's 45 miles away.
He can be back in a day.
"If we want to go to Tehran, it's 450 miles away."
"450 miles, understand?"
We have to go to Tehran.
450 miles in one day!
"We didn't say we'd come back... lf no one decides for us, we have to decide for ourselves."
I can't decide for you.
You decide.
I can't decide.
God's the one who decides.
Who drew up this shooting?
I can't strangle her!
What am I supposed to do?
We're not asking you to strangle her.
What then?
How much longer do we have to stay here?
What if the event never occurs?
Why did you run away then?
In time for the promotion.
There were only two of us:
"I, with 30 years of experience in the field."
And this kid from the academy.
It was full of extensions.
Artificially intelligent implants and so on.
There could only be one of us.
We treat it the same way.
Or your way.
"I guess the manager was probably good, so..."
Trajan son of a bitch...
Trajan became the new commander.
And I...
I was thrown out of this garbage.
Trajan?
General Trajan?
General?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, that suits you."
I always knew that son of a bitch would come up easily.
"At that moment he was so deep in the ass of his superiors,"
"I could smell, what they had for breakfast."
Duty calls!
That's where I meet the Noids right there.
Make sure you go straight.
The 306 cartridges you have.
"I do not want to have lead poisoning,"
Before it's all over here.
Too small for a humanoid.
Who you are?
- Shit!
Kix!
Let's call it a day.
I can still—
Hey...
Tohsaka!
Can't you see that Archer is acting strange?
we need to be on the same page.
I get it!
I'll go home.
I'll do as you say and go home.
then.
and good work today.
I was able to see you as a Master.
Archer!
we'll get to the bottom of this screw-up!
there it is.
The uncharacteristic lack of verbal abuse was troubling me.
look here...
Am I going to have to lay down the law?
You want to sleep in my room?
Of course.
To prevent a repeat of last night's error
I shall sleep in your room.
Surely you have no objections?
I do!
Big ones!
When it comes down to it it's your fault for falling victim to remote hypnosis from such a great distance.
I cannot protect you from Caster's magic so it's natural that I at least stay in the same room.
that's a perfectly sound argument.
tonight—
All right.
I'll have you sleep nearby.
Good.
You're weak and mute.
"God, damn you!"
You have no pride.
"You have no dignity, no honor."
Look at your honor...
It's being trampled on.
You're an absolute disgrace.
It's my conscience that stops me.
Do you think I am not sad?
Traditions matter more than ourconscience.
"Go ahead, hide in the barn, cover your head."
I told you when he was a little boy to get rid of the Zenne then.
You paid no heed.
God forgive us forwhat we've done or are about to do.
I can not act until I have concrete proof.
"We believe in the same God, Kezban."
He will whisperto me.
I wish you'd stay.
"When mom gives orders, you have to obey..."
"You are still in college, are they sick orwhat?"
Bankruptcy!
He's broke.
They can't afford to support both of us.
I fucked up yourlife as well.
Never mind.
I'll pay forthat too.
You take care of yourself.
"Murat, I need yourhelp."
I am pregnant...
I want this child but not marriage.
If we get to the point...
Sis?
Get him off!
Get him off!
"Come back here, you!"
I regret nothing!
I'm too young to have termites!
"I'm no termite, Pinocchio."
I'm a cricket.
You were the voice in my head this whole time?
That's right.
I'm the one who was putting all those thoughts in your noggin.
"I'm your conscience, and as long as you let me,"
I'll always be your...
The end.
That wasn't me.
I never had any bugs in my head.
Ask anyone.
"OK, then."
Why don't we start by asking your conscience.
Now who's cheating?
"Well, Donkey, looks like it's just you and me."
Go ahead.
There ain't nothing you can say that can scare me.
"Oh, well, I suppose there's nothing left to do but sit here in the dark and wait for the ghost."
Ghost?
What ghost?
"Farquaad's ghost, of course."
"As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly,"
I believe you had a hand in his untimely demise.
"Hey, man."
That was an accident.
"And besides, all that ghost stuff is just an urban legend."
- You know that.
"Ah, there would be some large shoes to fill."
"But what's in a name, Mr. Palmer?"
"""That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet."""
"That is Shakespeare, right?"
"No, no, no."
It's W.C. Fields again.
Oh.
He had a million of 'em.
"How's that angle for you, Tim?"
Can you see?
It's the west side entrance to the terminal.
"Yeah, a little higher, Jake?"
Higher.
Hm.
Okay.
How's that?
That's good.
Not bad.
"He's adorable, and he's tech-savvy."
"Yeah, that'll work, Jake."
Thank you.
"Not my first body on a toilet, Jethro, but always a disturbing sight."
Single blade to the left of the manubrium.
I'd wager that his heart was pierced in a single thrust.
- Do you need help?
"- Yeah, is there anything we can do?"
Yeah.
You can help McGee go through the manifest.
Both of you-- names and faces.
"Duck, take a look at the crowd-- looking for anything or anyone that doesn't look right."
At an airport?
Let me count the ways.
Something really boring happened to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
"Oh, thank you."
I'll see you guys later.
That is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
I wish you would get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?
Thanks.
Maybe later.
"-Gunther, can I get a scone?"
-Want anything?
I want a lot of things.
I wanna be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day.
I want her to love me back.
And I want relief from the wrenching pain of knowing that won't happen!
We have red bagels.
Okay.
So how do you guys like living together so far?
"-Oh, it's been good."
-Yeah.
Except Ross is more uptight about crumbs than you are.
There was a drumstick in the couch.
And I am not uptight about crumbs.
"It's just that, you know.."
crumbs attract mice.
And mice leave droppings.
And that's how the plague started.
So you wanna relive that again..
Mice didn't start the plague.
Rats did.
"Rattus norvegicus, to be exact."
"All right, go ahead."
I gotta go.
Baby!
You guys go ahead!
We'll meet you guys there!
"So, what are we gonna do about Trudy?"
"What are we gonna do about Cynthia, who just disappeared into the jungle?"
"Jason, she's upset."
Let her cool down.
You'll talk to her later.
"We still gotta get Trudy to do all the Marcel stuff, anyway, all right?"
So let's just get her ass and let's get back home.
"Cyn, please, slow down, honey."
I think we're almost there.
I think we might have taken a wrong turn.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Finally made it to the waterfall.
I think my marriage is over.
What?
"Honey, don't say that."
You're just exhausted.
I am.
I'm so tired of him trying to steer everything in the direction that he thinks is right all the time.
Listen.
Don't make any decisions right now.
You guys just need to take a breather.
"Get a little bit of space, you know?"
You'll be okay.
You know?
You guys have been on top of each other ever since we got here.
Just a minute.
Wait a minute.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
I want you to take these.
They'll relax you.
Relax me?
I'm so relaxed I'm tired.
- Maybe you need them.
"- These are for you, Jo."
- l'm the doctor.
Here.
- Ben -
You know what happens when you get excited and nervous.
Here.
Do me a favour.
Six months ago you told me I took too many pills.
Six months ago you weren't a witness to a murder.
You've been excited.
You've been talking a blue streak.
- You've been walking around in circles.
- l haven't!
"Jo, I make my living knowing when and how to administer medicine."
You'll feel better if you take these.
Nothing bad?
Look at us; do you call this a life?
"First my father, now Beatrice."
"I'm worse than him, much more wretched and vile."
I don't even have the courage to be cruel.
When will it end?
"It feels like I'm sinking more and more everyday, until eventually they'll unmask us."
"It won't happen, I promise."
I thought so too.
I made a mistake.
Now I've put it right.
Faster!
Keep moving!
Faster!
"Jump to it, you lazy dogs!"
- Jump to it!
- Mr. Scott-Padget!
I got them to fight well yesterday.
I'll have no officer carrying or using a rope's end.
- I couldn't find Kilpatrick.
- I'm suspending you.
- For the rope?
- For disobeying an order.
I shall take steps that will astound you.
- You have astounded me many times.
- What was that?
You need a hard lesson.
You'll keep watch.
"Four hours on and four hours off, day and night."
"I'm a senior officer, not a midshipman."
Not a midshipman.
- I apologize...
"- Damn you, get below!"
- I only want to say...
- Still you argue!
Mr. Ponsonby.
"This officer will report every two hours, fully equipped to the officer of the watch, who'll report to me."
Now get below!
They've forgotten the petition already.
"In our business, Scott-Padget was our best friend."
- Working with cars.
Right.
Ever wanted to work at a newspaper?
"No, sir."
- Have you ever read a newspaper?
- Not really.
"OK, it does seem there's been some sort of mistake here somewhere."
"That's OK, mistakes happen."
Shall I go the paper tomorrow?
You go to the garage.
It's all booked.
Is this a joke?
Do I make a lot of jokes?
- But sir...
- I can't change the placements.
Can't or won't?
You pick.
It's the same result.
Sutherland?
Does this mean I won't be driving any planes?
This is a fuck-up.
What experience will I get at a garage?
Apart from a depressing working-class one?
You get to look at horny calendars.
Why work for a paper?
I thought you were going into the family business.
- Which is...?
- Prostitution.
"Yep, nice one."
It'll be shit anyway.
The clue's in the name - work experience.
It won't be shit at my dad's firm.
Why would I drive his car?
Manoj said that you were fired because of you didn't maintain the car properly.
I was his driver for 3 years.
"If that was true, he could've fired me long ago."
My current employer verified with him before giving me this job.
You can cross-check if needed.
"If it wasn't you, who would've driven the car?"
I thought that he was going to sell the car.
He didn't say anything when I asked him.
"One day, I saw a lady driving his car."
I heard that she was staying with him.
I presumed that that might be the reason for firing me.
Do you know her?
No.
I have not seen her while I was working for him.
How did she look like?
"She was young, fair, and stylish."
Age?
She was a young lady.
Would you able to identify her?
I can't be very sure.
We will enquire again if required.
Give me your number.
You mustn't leave the town now.
"Okay, Sir."
"Yes, aunt."
How are you?
I'm okay.
Tell me.
What's the matter?
Did Varun call you?
I have deleted his number.
- I can go like this.
"-Yeah, do that."
- How does that feel on the toe?
- Good.
Good.
Why don't you walk around in them?
- Did you want to try these on?
"- No, I'm just driving him."
- So those are comfortable?
- I guess so.
"I mean, they kind of rub my ankles, but all shoes do that."
I have low ankles.
"You think you deserve that pain, but you don't."
- I don't think I deserve it.
"- Well, not consciously maybe."
My ankles are just low.
People think foot pain is a fact of life... but life is actually better than that.
I'll say.
You should get some.
Your whole life could be better.
Starting right now.
I can't believe I got these shoes.
"And they're exactly like my old shoes, except they're pink."
"I don't need these, and they're not orthopedic."
But you seemed to believe everything he said.
Yeah.
I think he really knew his stuff..
He was very professional.
"See, that's how gullible you are."
"- You know, you meet somebody-"
- Christine.
"Oh, God."
She's locked me out of the system.
"I can override her manually, but I need that control panel."
I'm uncomfortable with heights.
Okay.
Unauthorized entry.
I will not disable the security field.
Your actions are futile.
Do you think we are all created for a purpose?
I'd like to think so.
Denser alloy.
My father gave it to me.
I think he wanted me to kill you.
Security breached.
-How much longer is that gonna take?
-About six minutes.
-What if we didn't have six minutes?
-We'd have to climb down 30 stories to inject the nanites directly into her brain.
Why?
Because I seriously doubt that we have six minutes.
We gotta go!
Go!
Calvin!
Spooner!
Spooner!
Save her!
Save the girl!
Spooner!
But I must apply the nanites!
"Sonny, save Calvin!"
You are making a mistake.
My logic is undeniable.
You have so got to die.
"Although, all of you will have to be out of here by then."
- Where should I go?
Should I make myself invisible?
- Well I think It's cool here...
"No doors, wild."
"Tell me, how did you find this place?"
"Angie, three schnapps, and no objections!"
"Okay, my last offer... 150 per show, and only if it works."
Why wouldn't it work?
You never know.
And what happens if it doesn't work?
God damn it!
Don't you start up again with me.
Yes or no?
I just want to have it cleared up.
This guy's got an issue earning money.
"He's in debt, fiddles around on his show for a year  lives from nothing, and he gets stuck on the fine print."
Thanks.
"Alfons, you're my uncle."
You can't do anything about that and neither can I.
"I'm sorry to say this but  every time you get an opportunity, you blow it."
He's got a point.
Fuck you.
I think we got him.
"Ah, a tent!"
I haven't gone camping in a while.
Fine.
We got a lot done today.
"Got a lot done, but for what?"
For what?
Well good night then.
Can I sleep here?
"Whatever, corn chip man."
You got a problem with that?
"No, but..."
It's kind of low rent in the era of the cronut.
"""Cronuts""?"
What's a cronut?
Imagine a croissant had a baby with a doughnut.
"- Oh, that sounds like a delicious baby."
- Mm-hmm.
"Well, let's go right now."
"The only bakery that makes them is, uh, a few blocks away."
Fresh cronuts...
Full day's calories in one bite.
I can't.
I-I'm swamped.
I can't leave.
You always say that.
"You know, the only time I see you is when I come here."
"Well, I-I practically live here."
You're gonna have to deal with that.
At some point... soon...
"You're gonna have to let me take you on a proper date so we can, you know, move this thing forward."
Thing?
What thing?
"Hey, hey!"
Nice!
"Dad, you look tired."
Would you like to lie down?
"Well, I am tired a little bit after chemo, but I'm stronger than I have been."
Being with you and Jackson is the best medicine I've got.
This new treatment sounds so hopeful.
It is.
"Please, continue to pack up."
Don't worry about us.
We have about 30 minutes left.
I'm... sorry.
I'll pay you back for the flyers.
- How... much is it?
"- It's probably around 30,000 won."
"Hey, give me 10,000 won."
"Kid, you should do your job right next time, okay?"
There are times when good guys get the short end of the stick.
But still...
I'm not really wasting my life away...
"Like Park Seon Woo said, am I?"
You're working very hard to clear the names of those wrongfully accused.
"This may be the time in your life, during which you shine the brightest."
Let's go.
"Oh, yes..."
He didn't show up?
He didn't call either?
I understand.
We will withdraw.
Yes.
The suspect must have had a change of heart.
- You got lucky this time.
- Yes.
Start being a decent citizen.
Hello.
"As I told you before, I found a good restaurant for you."
I'm thankful for your concern...
But I'll just stay here.
Mother...
If you continue to stay here...
A beauty like yours never changes.
"Come, my dear."
I'll lead you.
It was to discover your thoughts.
You didn't answer me yet.
Well... it is yes.
Yes?
You mean...
"Yes, yes really?"
Yes.
I agree to become your wife.
Now let me.
Come and get me shortly.
Do not be afraid.
Sleep.
Sleep.
"In the violent effort made by the thief to snatch the necklace and earrings from the princess his fingers, pressing on the neck of Princess Danidoff, left a slight trace of sweating."
I spilled the silver nitrate on the princess' neck
You see the results.
Effectively.
The print is very clear.
It needs to be indentified.
We are not at the end of our inquiry.
"Wait a moment, my little Fandor, you have not seen everything."
Look at the details.
"The small scar, on both shots."
These two fingerprints are identical.
Absolutely identical.
And where does the second impression come from?
The anthropometric file.
The name.
The name of the culprit.
- I don't think so madam.
"Lawyers won't even get office space, then how would they get house?"
"- Hey fast-food, tea for both of us."
- I want milk.
"If you drink this tea, you won't live to drink milk tomorrow."
-How much is your commission?
- Why?
"Don't you know it is 10,000?"
"- OK, find out that girl's profession."
- Alright.
- What?
- What is that girl's profession?
- Lawyer
Seems like I am gonna lose the money!
"She is a software engineer, it seems."
Your accent is wrong.
It is software engineer
Yes you got it.
I must change my house now.
Check out his profession.
- What now?
- What is that guy's job?
Lawyer
"- Manager in some marketing sector, it seems."
"- OK for me, then ."
How long would you count the cash?
Give it.
"Now that you have successfully clinched your deal, won't you give me a treat?"
- Treat?
You want sambar rice from Saravana Bhavan?
- No.
I want booze.
DONALD MACKAY:
"Well, there's no law against carrying a rifle."
DONALD MACKAY:
"Well, there's no law against carrying a rifle."
You do so yourself.
"Not a bloody machine gun, I don't."
You do so yourself.
"Not a bloody machine gun, I don't."
And they made sure we know.
And they made sure we know.
WOMAN:
"Yeah, to put the wind up us, Don."
WOMAN:
"Yeah, to put the wind up us, Don."
I reckon they got a tonne of that weed on the go.

"Well, any chance you can jot down their numberplate"
"Well, any chance you can jot down their numberplate so I can take it to the police, give them something concrete?"
"so I can take it to the police, give them something concrete?"
"Yeah, sure."
OK.
"Yeah, sure."
OK.
"Look, I'll keep it for 14 days."
"Look, I'll keep it for 14 days."
Give me a bell when you've made up your mind.
Give me a bell when you've made up your mind.
"Nice to see you, Margaret."
"Yeah, thanks, Don."
"Nice to see you, Margaret."
"Yeah, thanks, Don."
Do you always have to be such a hero?
Is there anyone remembers where we left off last time?
Actually I need to go to the bathroom.
Quiet!
"First, come to the board, then you can go."
Take a piece of chalk from there.
I took the chalk.
Draw a trapezoid for me.
"No way, Professor, I don't trap people."
I don't do things like that.
"I said draw a shape, a trapezoid."
Did I ask for something else?
"Sit down, zero!"
"You, you are a dead man!"
"Hey you, the one with the hood."
Stop there.
Come here.
Come here.
Take your hood off.
"Take if off, take it off."
How wonderful!
Very nice!
It's high time you have a makeover.
"Yeah, it's high time."
From now until the day you cut your hair...
I will be taking away some of it in small bunches like this.
Ok?
"Now, have a great lesson."
May God help you through the lessons.
"Again, a question from 2005 goes like this..."
The engine of my car doesn't start.
"So, I take it to a mechanic to see what... is wrong with it, and he says nothing."
"If p is, qpurely and simply..."
- Did you sleep with her too?
- I touched her.
That's all.
- You can't use your powers--
"- Save the lecture, okay?"
- She's taken Kenzi.
- Goddamn it.
Did you think you could get between me and Bo?
It wasn't on my radar one way or the other.
What are you gonna do?
Don't worry.
You're just the bait.
It'll be over quick once Bo gets here.
"Actually, I prefer slow and drawn out."
"There's no reason to rush anything, you know?"
I knew you'd come.
How could I resist such a romantic gesture?
- You're not mad?
- No.
At you?
"Jenny, no."
You're my destiny.
I love you.
Nobody ever loves me as much as I love them.
Everyone whoever said they loved me they all left.
But I always keep a piece of them close.
Samir was no different.
"A coward in the end, too scared to love me back."
- You killed him.
- I went to his home to tell him that I totally accepted it was over.
He was so relieved.
Then I drugged him and cut off his head.
"- My, oh, my, oh, my."
"But we'll get it, if we have to take a knife, stick somebody and take it away from 'em."
- Yeah!
"- Come on, Shorty."
Mush!
- Come on.
Let's go.
- All set.
Keep your fingers crossed till we get back.
"We've gotta make a touch, Shorty."
Something that means more to me now that just finding a mine.
"Yeah, I been noticing that."
You're the doctor.
You know what's good for ya.
"The way I figures it, hunting for gold's a full-time job."
"Anything that interferes with it, interferes with it."
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
Mind keeping that fat snoot of yours out of my affairs?
"All right, all right."
"No offense, boss."
No offense whatsoever.
- Where's Buck?
- Hmm?
Come on!
"My, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my!"
Can't you see that's poisoned meat?
That's the second time he's attacked me!
"Yeah, he's crazy about you!"
Can't you see?
"Wait a minute, partner."
I'll give you a chance to make some money.
- You followed me.
- He's the one?
- You're starting up with him again?
- I'd sooner chew glass.
"Choose your seconds and meet me at dawn, sir."
- No more duels!
- This is men's business.
- I accept.
- Men?
You're not fit to be men!
Morons!
Idiots!
"Choose your weapons, Mallefille."
Red or white?
Leave her alone!
She's going off to write about us.
It's time for her nightly regurgitation.
20 pages.
The only reason she needs you or me or anybody is to provide characters for her ghastly novels!
- I trust you have no objection to pistols.
- What?
- For tomorrow.
"- My boy, I really don't care."
"Thank you for the loan, my dear."
It was most instructive.
"You'll be up before dawn for the duel, so I shall sleep in my own bed."
Ooh!
I do wish I could be there tomorrow.
You will make sure nobody's killed?
"I abhor killing, but a good fight's something to see."
- Good night.
"- Good night, Claudette."
It's true.
The doctor declared him dead.
Yes.
He was put on the bed.
We didn't touch him.
"You may have kept your key, but the prisoner found another one."
The key to freedom.
It's extraordinary!
He could not crawl through the bars!
Chief.
"This man, was he dead, yes or no?"
"Mr Judge, to be dead is to be dead, and he was dead."
He lives.
He lives.
A boy is arrested for murder.
But he is innocent.
"Then he hangs himself, dies, and escapes from jail without being seen."
"If we don't double our readership with that, I will be hanged!"
Hold your horses!
One hanging man is enough.
One of two things:
"Either Jacques Dollon was not dead and he went out alone, or he was dead and someone took him out."
"Anyway, we must know how the escape took place."
An inexplicable mystery is worthy only of one man.
I'm sure of it now.
"He returns, unlike what I said earlier."
Fantômas?
Yes.
"I have to take the case, if only to avenge Juve."
What are you going to do?
Blood.
Get lost!
I gotta go to Canada.
That's fine.
I like maple syrup.
I gotta go to Canada alone.
Why?
"If I get caught and you're with me, you're in trouble, too..."
You're not gonna get caught.
How can you say that?
You think crossing the border's easy?
We get fake IDs and passports.
Those cost money.
We have a stolen car!
We make it legit.
We take a VIN number off of another car.
"Emma, I'm not going to have you in the seat next to me..."
"Wait, wait, wait, seriously, wait, wait, wait!"
What if I go and get the watches out of the locker?
No one's looking for me.
"We can fence them, and then we'll have the money."
We could do whatever we want.
"We can go wherever we want, right?"
We could change our identities and go to Tallahassee.
"So, you want to steal the watches to help me get away with stealing the watches?"
Yes.
That is exactly what I wanna do.
- I can't let you risk everything...
- I love you.
"I love you, too."
You think you can do it?
I know I can.
You ready?
Yeah.
"Enjoy your champagne and caviar at the Ritz, Your Highness."
I am not rich.
My pager.
- Maybe this suit was a little much.
- You're a fox.
"Now, don't start."
- No.
- What?
- Rory's running late.
- Late from what?
She doesn't say.
"She'll be here, but if she's not here by 7:00, she'll sneak in the back."
- That's weird.
- She'll be here.
Don't worry.
I hope so.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction, so please, eat something."
I must apologize for their treatment of you.
Yeah.
Whose idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
"At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils."
They're not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized."
It's beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
I'll bet you would.
"We're going for the Lincoln, OK?"
"Ok, we go for the Lincoln."
"Ok, we go for the Lincoln."
Wait a second.
What's happening?
In the car.
They're in the car.
In the car.
They're in the car.
Shoot em!
Aahhh.
Hang on.
"Luckily, the bullet passed right through."
Just missed a major artery though.
And he still lost a lot of blood.
Is he going to be all right?
What do you want a warranty?
"No, I want him checking out on me."
"No, I want him checking out on me."
You should have thought about that before you brought him here.
But this guy seems pretty tough though.
He'll probably pull through all right.
Man.
That's the biggest god-damn tattoo I've ever seen.
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus.
"Guy certainly isn't afraid of needles, huh?"
How long till he comes to?
You got me.
This stuff is supposed to keep him calmed down but I'm not sure for how long.
This stuff is supposed to keep him calmed down but I'm not sure for how long.
I haven't gotten into anesthetics yet you know.
What did he come for?
You could speak to me more gently!
Wasn't it for this shitty life that you married me?
Haven't you seen Niaré?
Don't talk to me about him.
I've got a thousand like him.
And he doesn't have shit.
"Sure, now you can slut around all you like, but when I build houses... and give your father cars, you don't say a word."
"Speak, then."
I know how you made your fortune.
"Your father, a common employee, corrupted... the public services, and you're even proud of it."
Go to hell!
I'll make you choke on that!
I'll choke you...
Calm down!
Everything will be settled... today.
Who went and told the cops?
You couldn't keep your mouths shut.
This was bound to happen.
Who could have betrayed us?
I don't know.
I'll go look for Sissoko.
Sissoko!
What's that on your pants?
- Is it here?
- Yes.
Wait for me!
Come and see.
I'll report it...
Get back to work!
- Get back to work!
- Never!
"It's OK, Tom, we'll get you to the hospital."
Are the paramedics still here?
Get the ambulance back!
Tom?
I don't wanna go.
You have to.
I don't wanna go there.
We just need to get you to the hospital and they'll be able to help.
I don't wanna die alone.
I'm afraid.
Someone called an ambulance?
I think it's time you took a sickly.
Let's see if we can get you more comfortable.
Don't be afraid.
All that struff about the resurrection.
About there being something else after this.
Do you believe it?
Don't say that you do to make me feel better.
I believe...
that you shouldn't be afraid.
Hi I'm here to see Victor Alexander.
"You're his daughter, yes?"
Yeah.
Your father left us yesterday.
What?
He's been released.
He didn't tell you?
No.
Failed to mention it.
So this is the cause of all the trouble.
Expecting something more impressive?
It's amazing what a collection of flesh and bones is capable of.
"They're still in your drawer, unsigned."
No!
I know very well that I...
I could have sworn I signed these.
Why didn't you remind me?
I did remind you.
Several times.
And there are at least three memos on your spike.
I must have overlooked it.
"See that they're mailed immediately, and attach a letter of apology."
Certainly.
"Well, what is it?"
"I hate to mention this, but the safe was open again this morning."
I distinctly remember locking it last night.
Maybe it was...
"No, I checked it."
There's nothing missing.
It wasn't a burglar.
Then it was somebody in the office.
"John, you're the only one who has the combination."
"Good evening, Ellen."
"Good evening, sir."
I lost my keys.
"Well, you left them on the table this morning, sir."
Here's John now.
I was sure I put them in my pocket.
You promised you'd be home early!
"Good evening, John."
"Oh, hello, Sam."
I was so busy I didn't notice the time.
"Why, are you working too hard?"
"Oh, no."
Yes.
That's what I was telling you.
"I only did mushrooms once, in high school, but I remember it like it was yesterday."
I'm returning what's left over tomorrow.
Excuse me.
Here.
Good news.
Dr. Black says you haven't had any seizure activity in 24 hours.
- You can go home now.
- Good.
"And as it turns out, we still have a home."
"Our lawyer says, if you're psychotic when you give away everything you own, it doesn't count."
"The nurse doesn't need to hear our problems, sweetheart."
I'm sorry.
You're right.
"You seem quite different today, Mr. Myers."
How are you feeling now?
Like I need to get back to the office.
We're fighting a hostile takeover.
We're in the middle of a new ad campaign.
I haven't been away from my desk this long in years.
Hear that?
I have my baby back.
- Mr. Myers.
- Ian.
- U look terrific.
"- Thank you, sir."
"Well, I turned in my toga."
Ian.
"- God, thank you so much for everything."
"- Yeah, yeah."
We're thinking what this place needs is a donor wall.
"I'm sorry, OK?"
It's something with my family.
I can't talk about it now.
"Look, I got to go."
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Hey.
"- Glad you called, man."
- It's been a while.
- Thanks for coming.
It's bad enough my dad was in love with another woman.
Like my mom wasn't enough.
- But another kid?
- I guess you weren't enough?
I almost died and yet there I am back in the same place.
- Ready to do it all again.
- But you didn't.
You didn't use.
"And that's good, man."
"- Yeah, but I came close, bro."
- Of course you did.
This whole thing is textbook you.
"Look, I know you, Justin."
You didn't become a medic for nothing.
You can't stand to see people in pain.
And right now you and your family are suffering.
There's nothing you can do to make that go away.
"If it gets overwhelming, you know the drill."
"Find a meeting, work the steps."
I don't get it.
"How could he lie to us about his own daughter, knowing what it would do to us when we found out?"
And her.
"Rebecca, right?"
It's not Paul.
Why am I having a hard time believing that?
Hmm.
I don't know.
Let's dig deep.
"Yeah, let's..."
let's do that.
Maybe because of your mother?
Excuse me?
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?
She told me all about her addiction and how she left you guys and how it fucked you up.
And I am starting to see that.
Have you even ever been to therapy?
"No, I haven't."
"Well, maybe you should try it."
Why are you letting this guy take care of you?
- He's not.
- He is.
He's giving you shelter.
So what are you doing in return?
"What the fuck are you giving him in return, Laura?"
!
You think I'm fucking him so that I can stay in this house?
"I think it's a fucking reasonable fucking suggestion, Laura!"
"- Oh, my God, Jay."
- Don't you think?
Not every relationship is transactional!
Every fucking relationship is transactional!
That's the fucking definition of a fucking relationship!
I can't do this.
"Laura, Laura, Laura, Laura!"
"Oh, look at this."
There's no place to park around here.
I don't know why they even sell cars here.
Don't complain.
At least you have your health.
"George, watch out for that man!"
"Hey, hey, get back here."
Newman?
The white whale.
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig?
- Would you do that?
"- No, definitely not."
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
Know what else?
He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
- The one who sits by herself?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
- Really?
Debby told me she fell in love with him because he has perspective.
She thinks a guy who lies about an illness so he can get some phoney hair has perspective?
- He picked her up?
- Walked right over to her table.
Wow.
Jake.
"Jake, take a look."
See?
You're not the only one who has them.
I have them too.
- Where did you get those?
This is an emergency.
"I repeat, this is an emergency."
What's going on?
I don't know.
Andfastenyourseatbelts.
"I repeat, this is.."
"Sir, we're under attack!"
It's clear that someone on the inside has orchestrated..
this takeover of the White House.
That's the only way..
"Mr. Speaker, we have confirmation of ground impact."
"We're going to need to swear you in, sir."
What?
Executive power passed to the vice president when he was sworn in..
which means the office now passes to you.
Sir.
Please follow these men.
"Sir, these are your new presidential launch codes."
Please keep them on your person at all times.
I need a moment here.
I need..
I need to call my wife.
"Of course, sir."
Thank you.
Emily Cale.
How are you enjoying your tour?
Remember these?
"You and I have a date, sweetheart."
You'll have to go through me.
Really?
You're gonna go to jail for that!
And who's gonna make me?
You didn't sign anything?
Why ask a question like that?
Do I look that stupid?
Just pretend I'm going off on a picnic.
That's all it'll amount to.
"We'll get Cutter out of that gold temple without firing a shot, just by strategy."
We've done things like this before.
It's just a lot of fun.
- Fun?
You want to go.
- Darling...
"- Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!"
"- Right, sir."
He called you sergeant.
Why?
You're not in the army.
"It's just an old habit, hard to break."
I'll see you tomorrow.
Why don't you come right out and say you don't want to get married?
You'd rather be with him.
Why fool me by telling me how you hated him and his ugly face... and all the ugly faces in the army?
- I didn't say quite that.
Be fair.
"- Please, sahib, hurry."
"- Come on, Sergeant!"
- Can't you wait a minute?
"Sure, I can wait, but I'm not so sure about Cutter."
- Can't you trust me?
Kiss me goodbye.
"- No, never."
They're probably slicing Cutter's ears off by now.
"- I'm coming, Mac!"
Why are you singing that...?
"Oh, my God."
You just had sex.
"No, I didn't."
I was peeing.
I thought I made that clear.
"No, no, no, no."
That's your sex song.
You always sing it after you... perform your act.
"- No, I don't."
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Who are you talking to, buddy?"
I was there.
"When we were married, I heard it many, many times."
And then not so much at the end.
"- All right, so I had sex."
- Yep.
Christine and I have been dating for over three months.
You can't be surprised.
"Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not surprised."
"I mean, I never really thought about it."
"But, hey, if you want to jump into the sack with the first girl who comes along, be my guest."
Be... my... guest.
"Actually, she's not the first."
"Right after you and I split up, I got one under my belt."
"""Under your belt""?"
"What are you, a pirate?"
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
"Obviously, you haven't had any and you're a little..."
"Anyway, it's nothing to be ashamed of."
"We've been divorced for two years, which means you haven't had sex in... just over three years."
-All done.
-Thank you.
Naked as the day they were born.
Not a stitch on them.
Saw them with my own eyes!
"Sorry, don't think it 'd be ethical to tell you their names."
Good-bye.
Marion?
-Thanks for today.
-Anytime.
"How about tomorrow, for instance?"
I can't remember when I had so much fun.
I'd almost forgotten the wonderful things there are for people to do.
It isn't over yet.
"Mike, please... I don't think... we'd better..."
I mean it!
"-All right, let's talk about this."
-I don't want to talk.
I just want you to leave.
-Just like that?
-That's right.
"-We're not kids, we're adults!"
-And we're going to behave as such.
"I kissed you, you kissed me."
"That's affection, not carnality or lust."
You ought to know the difference.
And what do you call a man who thinks about nothing but...
Human.
All men are alike.
"The approach is different, but the result is always the same."
"Sooner or later, we'd get around to this."
"If all I wanted was a woman, I could get one any place."
... don'thavejurisdictionoverthis .
You be careful with that sign.
That cost a lot of money.
MAN:
We'll be careful.
MAUDE:
Bring it up on the left.
"Make sure that's well secured, now."
That's it.
That's good.
That's good.
World Famous Ritz.
How optimistic.
MAUDE:
"I have every reason to be, dear."
"So, tell me, Mother, which con did you use..."
... onourrecentlydispossessed Swedish friend?
The floating king?
You're very good at that one.
There was no need to use sleight of hand.
That man's dumber than a shovel.
"Well, what do you think?"
"Frankly, of all the endeavors I thought you might undertake..."
... hotelproprietress was not one of them.
Why are you in town?
"Well, I just wanted to be close to my sweet little baby boy."
And look at you. I never thought you'd become a bartender.
"Owner, Mother."
I've become a man of commerce.
Madam.
May I have the pleasure of welcoming you back to our humble town.
"Why, thank you... ."
That's not what I mean.
I told her many times that she should be writing her own book.
So why are you giving this now?
I could because I was afraid I'd hurt her.
It'll be enough for a year.
"Until she can support herself by writing novels,"
I'll sponsor her.
- Take it back.
- Jae Min.
I've never told her I'd sponsor her so that she could write her own material.
"And even if I did, she'd never accept it."
You still don't know her at all.
You want to forget it with this?
You want to make me into some kind of matchmaker?
Should I take half and give the other half to her?
"Fine, the you that I know isn't that kind of person."
But this is an insult to the feelings she had for you.
She isn't someone you can console with money.
"Yeah, you're right."
I didn't think.
I was hoping you'd help.
How is she?
She's doing well.
She's strong.
"The harder it is, the stronger she acts."
I know.
How are you?
I'm just... being dragged along.
Let's get up.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Where's your car?
Would benefit if you were dead?
"Gentlemen, I'd appreciate it if you would leave."
I'm not going to stand by and have you impugn
The integrity of my niece.
I resent the implication that Audrey is a murderess.
"Oh, but please, uh, Ms..."
"Goodbye, gentlemen."
"Uh, one more question, Ms. Ramsey, if you please."
"We could find out without your help,"
But it'll just take more time.
"What is it, Detective Burris?"
OTIS:
Could you make a guess as to the total value
"Of your estate, please?"
I suggest that your superiors contact my attorney.
His name is Henry Claypool.
"This way out, please."
"All right, girl."
It's OK.
You'll get fed.
Jeff!
Why don't you take her out while I get her dinner?
"Come on, lady."
Out we go.
"Oh, come on, you old mutt."
Now do your thing.
"Jeff, don't talk to her like that."
Here.
Give her her dinner.
"If we're going out, I'm going to slip into the shower."
Do you mind?
"I don't mind, as long as I'm invited."
He can hear our conversation from ground floor itself.
Control yourself you flirt!
Who is she?
She is the milk vendor.
"If a house is available for rent, many would hop in to check."
"- Hey Paramasivam, is she yours?"
- I don't deserve her man.
With such a rotten face you need a charming girl like her?
- I asked if she is your client?
- Yes
- She is looking for office space.
- Do you like it?
"-Yes, I do."
- I am impressed too.
- I am very impressed.
How about the rent?
- I am very impressed too.
Why does he grope me for that?
I need this office.
How much is the rent?
"20,000 as rent, and an advance amount for 10 months."
- 20000?
- Yes madam.
- I can't afford that and I don't need such a big space..
"Don't miss the house gawking at this girl, Karthik!"
Ask!
"- Sir, I saw and confirmed the deal first."
Isn't it?
- Please fix it for me.
- Let me speak with the loud mouth.
- Sir fix it for me immediately.
- I shall do it madam.
The prodigal son came for a visit.
You shouldn't scare an old man.
How's daddy?
You've lost weight.
I thought I'd do some visiting.
"-Go ahead, I have work to do."
"Visit you, I mean."
Didn't you used to smoke these at Christmas?
It was a different brand.
Are you still working on your thesis about shopping bags?
That's why we moved here.
Twenty years ago.
Don't touch them!
It's my research material.
What do they tell you?
They correlate with the changes in the gross national product.
Don't laugh.
Kids flush them down the toilet.
Which sewer do you dig to find these?
The one at the waste water purification plant.
What brings you here?
-Doctor's orders.
Are you seeing a shrink?
The other option was to see the monkeys in the zoo.
I should get these calculations done.
You're getting bald.
"No of fence, dad."
Jesse!
Marjukka told us what you did.
-Garbage Jesse!
Is he the one who saved the children?
"He's the man, Garbage Jesse!"
And watch her bleed into her brain?
"No, thanks."
"- Push the meds, Inez."
- She's alert.
"- Pupils equal, good tone."
- Do it now.
.5 versed going in.
"Come on, Kerry, we've both seen enough head trauma to develop gut feelings about this."
"Yeah, and my gut says intubate."
She needs a tube.
Giving the vec.
Suction.
The scope.
- Where are they taking my daughter?
- She's going up to the CT.
But what are all those tubes?
Why isn't she moving?
The tube helps her breathe.
It's just a precaution.
Sometimes babies have to be sedated for CAT scans.
It doesn't mean anything's wrong.
Have the... police found anything?
It's still early.
They will.
I should have waited...
till it stopped raining.
No one can control the weather.
The good news is that your brain and belly CT are normal.
"Unfortunately, you've broken your breastbone and we'll need to monitor your heart to make sure it wasn't bruised."
But I didn't have to go out.
I...
I could have waited.
You left it blank.
Korean?
Korean?
I am not familiar with Korean.
Dealer's choice.
Whatever releases the most tension.
Mmm.
"Oh, that feels so good."
Thank you.
I can't tell you how much I need this.
It has been a long time.
"Oh, I love pleasuring people."
So do I.
"I mean, it's not my job, but it is a job that I love doing, if you know what I mean."
I know exactly what you mean.
"So, Joey, do you have any problem areas?"
I hold a lot of tension in my upper thighs.
We'll get to your upper thighs.
It's just the top of my quads.
"As a matter of fact, if you want to do, like, the full 80 minutes on the thighs, I'm good."
Whatever you want.
"Oh, I need this."
You have no idea.
"Oh, you got great hands."
"Okay, Joey, what I want you to do for me is just close your eyes."
"Quiet that mind, okay?"
Just listen to my voice.
Feel the sound slide down my throat and come out through my mouth.
"Down my throat, come out through my mouth."
Down my throat...
Keep...
"Keep going, keep going."
Why didn't you tell Mother that?
I didn't think of it.
"I'm a cowardly, despicable person."
For twenty years all I thought about was how to avoid being despised by your mother.
"And then one day, all of a sudden, a thick barrier had grown around her heart."
Forgive Mother.
I'm the one that has to be forgiven.
"What are you going to do, Shinako?"
Are you going to go live with your Mother?
"If she's going to live with Takehara, I'll stay with you."
I'd feel sorry for you.
The people who are really burned in all this are you and Takao.
So you've made up your mind?
You should leave that house.
That would be the thing for you to do.
He doesn't deserve to be with you.
I don't want you to insult him.
"Oh my, aren't we complex?"
"Ok, I won't insult him."
So are you going to build that studio?
I'm not going to see you again.
You're terrible!
This is really too much.
It's late.
Please go home.
"Mrs., listen."
waited twenty years.
So did I.
What are you doing?
I'm going to call someone.
Mrs.!
Let me go.
How many chances do you think you'll get to be a dickhead?
One more?
Wrong.
You're a nasty little virgin.
See ya.
"Right, fair enough."
OK.
"Best of a bad lot, deal with what we've got."
"I need you, we're in trouble."
I'm off.
Only popped in to check out your missus.
"Well, thanks for popping by and ruining my love life."
No problem.
I hope you and your ignorant boss get a good laugh out of it.
I'll tell you who'll be laughing last!
Me!
Cos I'm not the one who'll be working in a shitty garage doing manual labour for the rest of my life.
See you Monday.
No you won't!
Because I'll be at a local paper.
"That's right, a local newspaper."
"So my date, yes, date, was a disaster."
But at least my friends weren't hiding in the toilet.
"Oh, they were."
There was only one person for saving us now.
"Thanks for stepping in, mate!"
I was going to dive when you put your cock away.
"- Budge up a minute Jay, I need a piss."
"- You're not pissing in here, Neil."
- Why not?
It's a toilet.
- Go outside if you have to.
- Would you like to see them?
"- Oh, we will."
Indeed.
Don't spare the horses.
Take the next slipway.
"Off, here."
Here we go.
"Hang on, laddie."
Let's turn the tables on these buggers.
Tally ho.
Big Ben.
Akan is a cunt!
"Oh, my."
Looks like Akan's already begun.
"By tomorrow, these poor chaps will be super robotic soldiers like yourself."
Look out!
"On your feet, lad."
On your left.
Hang on.
I'm gonna buy you some time!
Seal the door.
Can't tell you the number of times I've dreamt that I was riding up in this lift.
It's a pity I can't...
"It's just the landing gear, laddie."
"Now, listen to me."
"When you kill Akan, I want you to look him right in those eyes until the rest of him is just as dead as they are, understood?"
"No, I'm afraid I shall not be coming with."
But you letting me get you this far has given an old sweat his grandest gift in all his years.
No.
It's lodged in his jugular.
"If you uncork it, I won't be able to..."
"The thingamajig in your pocket, quickly."
"Excuse me, but who are you?"
"- ""Introductions by Elise."""
Introduction...?
Intro...
Oh.
"- Oh, you're a dating service."
- Executive matchmaker.
Oh.
And a very large contributor.
I'm gonna cut right to the chase:
"You are the 200-pound tuna of bachelors, senator."
"You really don't have time to separate the wheat from the chaff,"
Grace Kellys from the Britney Spears.
That's where I come in.
- We need to meet the governor.
- Very nice meeting you.
- Lovely to meet you.
Think about it.
- You bet.
- Give me that.
- You didn't find her persuasive?
No.
"Objectifying, pushy, judgmental?"
"Yes, definitely."
She is trying to bring people together.
That is noble work.
- She looked at you like meat.
"- Tuna, actually."
If the press ever got wind of you using a madam...
- Matchmaker.
- They're gonna have a field day.
Can you think of a less romantic way to meet someone?
- How very impressive.
- Would you like to buy it?
- Do you want to sell it to me?
- Yes.
- How much?
"1,000 kroner."
"That's the best 1,000 kroner I've ever spent."
My colleague is a quite the art expert.
He'll be very impressed.
"- Hi, Frank."
- Well?
- It's mouth painted.
- But why?
I bought it from a crippled lady who paints with her mouth.
Impressive.
"- But still, it's a shitty painting."
- I think it's very... mouthy.
"- But impressive, eh?"
"- ""Mouthy"", you said it!"
- I'm happy.
- But you can't hang it anywhere.
The office.
You've got that...
It's not really office material.
We have people coming by and...
I'm at a stage in my life where I'm fascinated by the orally competent.
- Why?
- Mia says my technique is dull.
- She says you give bad head?
- That's another way to put it.
"I'm like a fiery Arab, and you're more the dray horse."
You toss your long tongue into her beaver.
Yeah.
"Of course, the liver."
"Come on, boys, belly up."
Toast to us.
"Uh, derek and tommy, I'm gonna pour you guys a little shot of ginger ale since you're girly boys who can't handle your booze."
"To us, gents."
"To, uh, garbage bags full of cash."
To liver cancer.
- Here.
- Cheers.Bam.
"Let's go, boys.The strippers aren't going to shove dollar bills between their own jugs."
"You know, you guys go ahead.I'm gonna stay and, you know, close up shop, take care of the money."
"No, it's ok, I got it."
Don't worry about it.
"No, no, it's fine."
I got like a place where I hide it.
"It's very secretive, you know."
"Yeah, well, I'm gonna keep it at lou's place."
So it's not a big thing.
"All right, but I know how to retain it and everything.It's my job."
"- You know what I mean, it's my job."
- It's not your job tonight.
I got it.
Ok?
- You got it?
- I just said I got it.
Ok.
"All right, you got it."
You guys go ahead.
Have a good time at scores.
All right?
"And, you know, I can give you guys a couple of tips that will actually help you guys out there."
"Ah, you're kidding, right?"
"No, I'm not kidding, coop."
"It's been a really, really good year, okay?"
"Now you, my friend, deserve a little bonus."
"Ladies, refreshers."
"You're under arrest,"
Mr. Daly.
Get this animal out of here.
"See you later, baby."
"Well, it's about time."
Do you mind telling me
"Why I have been here for over an hour, drinking this swill..."
With no access to a telephone?
"Well, I'll tell you what."
"You can borrow mine, mr."
Enright.
Use it to call your lawyer.
Let him know we're booking you for pandering
And possession of a controlled substance.
And we've got a good shot at tying you in to leslie stoltz's murder.
"Oh, please."
"You people just don't get it, do you?"
"You know, your good friend coop daly--"
He sold you out.
The actions you took led to leslie stoltz's death.
That's felony murder.
"Well, I could just say one little magic word."
What's that?
Car...
Do...
Za.
"The judge is going to toss this case out right away,"
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I changed my mind.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story is gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
Just stop!
"What are you gonna do, Allison?"
When your stupid bitch of a boyfriend turns on you?
They killed your aunt.
They almost killed Lydia.
Who do you really think is gonna be next?
So this is a test run to see if i can handle things
And not slip back into my old habits again.
"Well, speaking of handling things,"
I don't know how your mother's gonna handle
Seeing you after the way you two parted.
"Oh, she's been going through a very rough time lately."
But seeing you like this is gonna make her happy.
- I know it is.
"- I don't know, grandma."
We haven't spoken in months
And you know she wasn't really that happy with me
The last time we saw each other.
"Well, like you said, that was months ago."
We'll just have to see how she handles things today.
"Oh, she..."
Seeing you is gonna make her happy.
I just know it.
"mom, let me in."
I left my keys.
"Oh, y'all go and hide in the hall closet."
I'll see how she's feeling before you come in.
"mom, let me in."
- Where's your key?
- I don't know.
I forgot 'em.
- Oh.
"- Hey, mom,"
"So, ma, is that marcus's car out there?"
"Well, there's a lot of cars that look like marcus's car."
So that's...
I-I...
I thought...
That picture was from three days ago.
He's just going to think I was home scrolling through all of his photos!
Back-liking is so desperate!
Okay.
You know what?
Enough with the spying and social media.
Why don't you just go ask him how he feels about you?
You mean have a conversation?
I don't want to freak him out.
Right.
Let me get some clarity here.
You guys are-are boyfriend and girlfriend...
I love him.
"No, you don't, but that-that's fine."
So here's another question.
Have you two ever spoken?
Of course.
We talk all the time.
In person?
With actual words that the other person hears and then responds to?
"What are we, Amish?"
"You should try it, Sam."
And just be straight with him.
JEN:
"Yeah, guys love it when you're direct."
Like when I told Greg his dream hat was stupid.
(scoffs)
The old lady doesn't understand sweet lids.
"Hey, just think, in 12 years, we're gonna be able"
- to help Lark like this.
- JEN:
"Yeah, but I don't want to help her too much, you know?"
"But, brant's bio is not exactly call sparking."
"But, brant's bio is not exactly call sparking."
"He is a bit of a loner, but he's a solid agent."
The FBI is the only family he's got.
His parents were a horror story.
I don't give a shit about his family life.
Can we trust him?
"Sir, when I started out I worked in the field with brant."
"He'd run through a wall for you if he believes in you, but you betray him, you don't want to be on the same fucking planet."
You don't want to be on the same fucking planet.
"Wonder boy or not, I'm putting back up on this case."
You're the boss.
"So, so what kind of job?"
"Oh, don't worry Nick."
It's an easy job.
Easy.
Choose one.
"Easy job, huh?"
Don't you have a regular guy for this?
Don't you have a regular guy for this?
He's not with us anymore.
We must all make adjustments.
Let's go.
Wonderful.
So where are we gong boys?

"- Well, I hope and pray it's not her."
I have so few quality girls left.
"Oh, um..."
How long did Belshazzar last?
Till the end of the night.
(CLEARS THROAT)
"The prosecution have painted the defendant as a jealous ex-husband, as a cruel man with a vicious temper."
A ticking emotional time bomb just waiting to go off.
"I like paintings, but pretty as they are, they have absolutely no place in a court of law."
(SIGHS)
"It's been a very long trial, hasn't it?"
Let me give you the good news.
This is the last speech you will hear on this case.
I just want to focus on one word.
Doubt.
(CHEERING)
BARRISTER:
See you on Monday.
I'll catch up with you later.
Harry!
You...
I...
Were we supposed to meet today?
"- No, no."
I was just passing.
- Oh.
Um...
You were very impressive in there.
The faces on the cops said it all.
"Yeah, well, they've been an absolute joke."
"Shit, sorry."
They're probably your friends.
How much longer?
Not much longer.
"Look, I need to get Schmidt into this freezer."
The drugs work better if he's cold.
Come on.
We got one shot at this.
You want to do it right?
Well?
Do you want to do this or not?
Get in!
What are you doing?
!
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
We don't have a lot of time.
"I can get you out of this, but you have to do exactly as I say."
I'm going to inject you with a drug --
I already don't like this.
"Shh, shh, shh!"
"When I do, you have to resist for a moment and then tell me where you hid Jabbar's ex."
No!
No!
Do you know what he'll do to her if her finds her?
!
"If we pull this off, the last thing he'll be worrying about is his ex-wife."
T-t-this -- this drug -- w-w-what does it do?
I don't think you want to know.
"Hey, you know what?"
I'm sick of being the last guy who knows what's going on!
"Now, what does the drug do?"
It's going to paralyze your entire body and stop you from breathing.
I-I-I didn't need to know that.
Is that regulation?
I didn't know you government chaps carried those things.
Just beginning to filter through the Wooster brain that you're not government chaps.
"An amazing piece of detective work, Mr. Wooster."
"Here, sit down."
What are you doing?
"- Boss, you all right?"
- I don't know yet.
"From now on I shall hate ""The March of the Hussars. """
"Oh, we can't get out there."
Let's try here.
"Now, come on."
Come on.
Hurry up now.
I'm sorry to have messed this up.
I had no idea these people were thieves.
It seems you had no idea of anything.
"If it hadn't been for you, these men would be in the hands of the police."
- I'd do anything on earth to make amends.
- It's too late now.
- I'm not so sure.
- They match perfectly.
- These are the complete plans.
"- Well, I'm ready to leave."
What the—
- What's that?
"- Somebody playing games, probably."
They've got the plans.
Call everyone in the place.
Stop them!
"- Mr. Wooster, sir."
"- Jeeves, what are you doing here?"
Sorry.
"Yeah, everybody's sorry."
Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
Everybody's sorry for something.
"It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion."
Are you going to give it to me?
Maybe.
I don't know where it is.
"Well maybe, you can find it."
Three thousand bucks.
Well that would get me back.
But not with style.
I can get you another two when we get to the states.
It's important Marion.
Trust me.
You know the piece I mean?
You know where it is?
Come back tomorrow.
Why?
"Because I said so, that's why."
Ha!
See you tomorrow Indiana Jones!
Good evening freulein.
The Bar is closed.
We... we are not thirsty.
What do you want?
The same thing your friend doctor Jones wanted.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties?
Must have slipped his mind.
The man is nefarious.
I hope for your sake he has not yet acquired it.
Until we know where Balla is.
Do you know how he got here?
Attack them!
Slit their throats!
Kill him!
Murderer!

- Morning.
- Morning.
What do you want?
What do you want?
How much?
Twenty-four cents.
Cash.
"Don't put him in with any other horse, would you?"
Why not?
It'd just be better.
That'll be extra.
"Put him in with another horse, he's gonna kill him."
That'll be extra for you.
What the hell else does he do?
He can spin in half his own length in crossfire from either side.
"If you drop a dime over in that stall, don't stoop over to get it."
- Get it with your pitchfork.
- What do you keep him around for?
That's a mother-in-law horse.
Know what that is?
A mother-in-law horse is a horse you put your mother-in-law on.
Send them both up in the hills and hope they don't ever come back.
Here's your money.
He just all-around looks after my best welfare.
"I'm scared, uncle."
You will be fine.
Lord Hanuman will protect you.
He wants to play with me.
It's a very serious case.
She will live only if we perform an operation on her within 20 hours.
I told her parents about this.
I'm telling you again.
Operation will be performed on her only if you pay 20 lakhs by tomorrow morning.
Actually...
"Okay, I will bring it."
- Take a snap.
- Is it?
You're out of Health ministry.
But you're given Home ministry.
"Then, let's distribute sweets in jail."
Okay.
This is enough for today.
This is the last snap.
I need to go to jail.
Bye.
"Sir, I need 20 lakhs."
You have explained me very clearly.
I will explain you very clearly.
Try to understand.
Government can't help each and everyone.
There are few funds available.
Funds are available...for our benefits.
Let's not talk about that now.
"Since I like you, let me tell you the facts."
"Since it is a small girl, submit an application."
I will help you on some grounds.
"Lack of education, that's the problem."
That's why we're doing this demonstration :
For your education.
A beer.
A soda.
Thank you.
"That's Nora, she works for us now."
"I hope you pick up a lot from her,  Angela."
"Am I fired now, or what?"
"Angie, how can you pick up anything from Nora if your fired?"
"Won't work, right?"
I wanted to excuse myself for my faux pas.
- Faux pas.
"You have a problem with women, my dear, as large as this building."
"And you're resentful, stubborn, and complicated."
I don't even want to get into your problem with men.
Again with another attack against me.
You can go ahead and excuse yourself again.
- I wouldn't do that.
Fine then!
I'm a kind-hearted person.
Me too.
I'll be glad to get out of here.
I can imagine.
You'll give me a ride?
Of course.
Lie down next to me.
Get some sleep.
All these people are driving me crazy.
I don't understand what they are talking about.
I don't know what they want from me.
No discussion.
- How did he do that so well?
I mean...
This was also...
"We shot that, like, right before Thanksgiving."
- There's your ass again.
- Ass again.
But you look really cute there.
"Hey, look at this ridiculous bedazzled phone that Tris has."
It's a really revealing prop.
- I love the bedazzled phone.
- It's pink and it's sparkly.
"Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- Psycho.
This is an exciting commentary.
- I think so.
"- Oh, yeah."
"She's got the best mean looks, but she's such a sweetheart."
She is like the sweetest lady.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You all right?
Is she okay?
We should talk about commentary pet peeves.
What's one of your?
"When people are watching the commentary, they're like:"
"""I love this scene."" And everyone goes quiet and listens."
"But when you're listening to a commentary, it's quiet."
"You can't even hear it and you're like, ""Why aren't they saying anything?"""
But this could lull some people to sleep.
I watch these things to go to sleep.
"- Oh, that's sad."
- Me too.
Tell Carrasco we have heard that Ramírez is planning to visit this province.
- When?
- On Thursday.
He will have half an army with him.
"No, he's taking a plane full of foreign industrialists, in order to show them that everything's quiet here."
- Tell Carrasco that.
- You can count on it.
"- OK, that's all."
Are you ready?
- I've never been readier.
Take care.
- Take care.
Don't let them get you down.
- I'll try.
"- Hey, thanks a lot for everything."
- Good luck.
- Get in.
I hope you can swim.
- Shit!
What's in there?
You've just said it.
"Shit, of course."
"Come on, don't be embarrassed."
Corpses smell worse.
What's the matter?
"I wonder if there will ever be a time when we can think of ourselves, Enrique."
I'm sure there will be.
We'll become two fat bourgeois and get bored.
History's full of revolutionaries who've ended their lives like that.
"Yes, I can picture us sitting on the sofa, watching TV and nibbling nuts."
Why not?
We?
"Okay, who's been on the phone?"
Hi.
What happened?
Did you guys have a fight?
Ever hear of the earthquake of '71?
Who's been on the phone?
You're supposed to be reachable by phone.
- Nobody.
- You're supposed to be on court call.
"We're here all the time, sarge."
"Yeah, well, then why has the phone been busy?"
Move your feet.
No wonder nobody's called me all week.
"You know, Poncherello?"
I could put another Form 2 in your jacket.
"Hey, sarge."
What brings you out here?
Baby food.
Not here.
Did you guys cite a baby food truck?
"- Yeah, we did."
"- Yeah, loose load."
We almost got killed.
"Well, that loose load contained contaminated baby food, botulism."
There are two boxes missing.
Either they're out on the road or someone picked it up.
Do you remember anybody or anything?
I was seeing double from my steeplechase ride.
"Look, guys, think."
It's important.
That stuff's poison.
Like his wife!
You have to choose a page.
With those ice cream?
There are better machines!
"Without us, they have no future."
They were built for and by us!
"They are not our children, they are slaves."
Our survival depends on extermination!
"Open your eyes, Bishop!"
"We are surrounded by ice, this planet is dead!"
There are not enough resources to pick them up these days.
Would you choose those of your own kind?
If this is what we will become  then yes!
I choose them.
Your new rank is JMATR!
FUCK MORE THAN ALL RECOGNITION!
After your Spartan body.
"Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot!"
Also know as...
"Goodbye, motherfuckers."
Kill him!
What the...?
Something is wrong with the weapons Malfunction!
"Malfunction of the weapon, sir!"
"Welcome to the area of death, idiots!"
Come on!
Kill these weak heads!
What happens to you?
Come on!
This is not over yet!
You come to my death list!
I will hunt you personally!
I was just thinking about you.
That's nice.
I like the sound of that.
It's the craziest thing.
"All my life, the only thoughts I had were about one person."
Me.
I think it was mostly a survival instinct.
"Anyway, suddenly I'm walking along, alone, and then, bam!"
I think of you.
(CHUCKLES)
"And the next thing I know, I've got this dumb grin on my face, like I'm high or loaded or something."
Only I'm not high or loaded.
I'm just thinking of you.
Is that the grin?
Yeah.
I think that's it.
It's not so dumb.
"You want to kiss me, don't you?"
Yeah.
I do.
But not here at school.
We can't keep hiding out in people's cars.
Would your grandmother let us make out in the living room?
"I think she would, but I wouldn't be comfortable with that."
"Would your mother, your foster mother, let us make out in her living room?"
Not a chance.
Is this him?
Yeah.
What do you think?
"It's not bad, kind of the dark and brooding type."
"Like James Franco, just not as tall or good-looking."
He looks either really smart or really dumb.
Is it OK if we play a bit?
Any questions?
You can have one too if you want.
Maybe later.
Sofie's here.
But you can kiss me.
It's not just something you do with your boyfriend 'cause it's nice.
Everyone talks about it.
"Who's good in bed,   how he or she does it, ""You've got to try her"",   and you..."
It isn't natural any longer.
The way we have sex   is that we always try to push the limits and to go beyond them.
And then to go beyond new limits.
All the time.
Boys have to screw 20 or 30 chicks before they leave high school.
It's prestige for them.
"""I did it with two girls, three girls""."
Two girls and one boy.
With two guys and one girl the girl would be the important one.
That's not the idea.
We copy what we see in porn films.
That's why it gets crazier and crazier.
The more extreme and the more bodies the cooler it is.
But feelings don't come into it.
What's up?
I don't believe it!
Look at them!
"- Use the car, guys!"
- Sofie won't be pleased.
- Where is she?
- She was dancing.
- Sofie!
There you are!
- Los hermanos...
- The Geckos?
They can help you.
It's prophecy.
[slurping]
"Okay, okay, that's enough."
- [door opens]
- Did you hear that?
[man] Anybody home?
Ranger Gonzalez?
You in there?
"Well, it's about goddamn time."
I've been through hell and high water looking for you.
"Do me a favor, hon."
"You put that thing down, step on over here."
"- What are you doing here, Captain?"
- Shut your trap.
Slide your firearm.
This ain't a social call.
"Okay, okay."
Take it easy.
"Now, where the hell are those bonds?"
"I'm sorry, sir, what bonds?"
"Oh, don't get fresh with me, boy."
"You see, we found Tony Mendoza's car, and his GPS was all jacked up."
But hell if the techs still didn't still find that he was parked at your house the night he went missing.
So I got curious.
Turns out you borrowed four million dollars in bearer bonds from FBI Evidence.
"A federal offense, by the by."
So where the hell are those bonds?
"Okay, wait, you think I killed Tony?"
"And yet you come out here, all alone?"
"- You're crazy, you have an erection!"
- So?
Someone could come in.
I don't care-
"- Ricky, what is this?"
"Sorry, I can't control it."
I see you and I get a boner.
How can I talk to you when your thingie is pointing at me?
You don't have to look.
I won't have sex with you now.
Who asked you to?
And I'm not getting pregnant anymore.
Forget it.
Why do you have to punish yourself?
What are you guilty of?
- Did you ever count how many pregnancies I've lost?
- We've lost-
I don't remember you ever being pregnant.
"What is this, a suffering contest?"
You don't know what it's like to give birth to a dead child.
"Ricky, I'm not pretending."
I really don't want to adopt.
I don't want to be the one who poisons your soul.
You deserve Amuka.
You deserve sex in a sauna with a normal woman.
You deserve children.
I can't raise a child I'm not sure I'll be able to love.
What about me?
Please go home.
I'm not going.
Why don't you pick up?
- I thought it was...
Of course you are.
This is it.!
"Let go of the girl, Hammond!"
What are you doing?
Let's keep going.
"Look, Natalie, if I had things my way... you'd be the girl I'd run away to paradise with."
But I'm gonna be your hostage.
"Natalie, it's over."
I can't let you ruin your life because of me.
- I think it's time for you to go home now.
- You can't mean that.
"You know, until yesterday... the worst thing I ever did in my whole life was cheat on a biology exam."
"And now I'm a car thief... a kidnapper... cop-shooter, police-evader."
I can't do this to you.
I can't make you part of this anymore.
I care about you too much.
"Besides, I can't hold you hostage anymore."
We ate the gun.
But you have the real gun.
Uh... real guns make me nervous.
I do better with the candy ones.
"Jack, you're innocent."
We can make this work.
You...
You're really something.
You know that?
- Thank you.
- For what?
For believing in me.
"Let the girl go now, Hammond!"
"It's been a hell of a ride, huh, kid?"

Then...
You will fall in love eventually.
Anyway...
The only one...
I am the only one you can love.
Not even a kiss for your fiancé?
This is quite a strange beginning.
"Hi, good evening."
Glad you could make it.
"Hi, welcome."
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Everyone...

I think that's the tipster one.
"Oh, good."
'Cause those suicide guys will keep you on forever.
You're up.
Shuckton police.
Hello?
As a citizen
"I would like to say that I think it's odd that both the Mayor and Heather Weather were murdered, and don't you think that the true murderer is still out there?"
"Yeah, yeah."
You got any information for us?
"Well, I have plenty."
"I mean, have you checked out the drifter staying at the no tell motel."
And there's plenty of other suspects.
I'm having trouble understanding you.
Sounds like there's a cloth between your mouth and the phone.
"No, of course not."
"Well, you don't have to be nervous."
This is a totally anonymous service...
I just need to know one thing:
What size are you?
An xxxxxl.
Why?
So we can send you a tipster t-shirt.
"Wait a second, xxxxl?"
Is this Ricky?
Hm?
Oh.
Happy- Hold it.
No time.
We got a tip.
Have the rookie blow out the candles.
"Eh, you guys shouldn't have."
All right.
- Doc Swain.
- Hi.
"Evening, Selena."
Be right with you.
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.
Watch your feet.
Are you gonna tell them about me?
"- I'll have to, Selena."
- Nobody in town must ever know.
"- But if I don't, you'll be risking your life."
- I know that.
"- Well, then why?"
- Because of Ted.
"What are you afraid of, what he'll think?"
He loves you.
"It would ruin his life, married to a girl who... ."
Not a respectable person in town would accept him.
"""Respectable. "" What kind of respectability are you talking about?"
The people with enough money to hire him as a lawyer.
"Look, don't you understand?"
We're talking about your whole life.
Prison can be a kind of dying.
Losing Ted would be a worse kind of dying.
"- Besides, you mustn't get involved."
- Never mind about me.
Promise me you won't tell them.
"Promise me, please promise!"
"All right, Selena."
I'll promise you.
You don't seem to realize you face a possible life sentence.
"- l'm on your side, I swear."
I'm gonna tell you as soon as I can.
It's in the best interest of your case if we can cooperate.
I need to know what you're trying to do.
We're trying to do what we always try to do... put bad guys in jail.
including my ex-husband?
"I have no idea, and that's the truth."
And if I don't cooperate?
"Well, I'll get anxious and depressed, start offering you jobs down here or something or vacation property."
Just kidding.
"To tell you the truth, I don't know what I'd do if you don't cooperate."
[knock on door]
- Hey.
"- Hey, sweetie."
I'll be back down in a second.
She... she ate.
Good.
How much?
Enough.
So how's it going?
You're asking me that?
Sorry.
What?
- What what?
- l'm asking you.
"Well, I don't understand."
You're... you're asking me what?
I don't know what I'm asking you.
"Rick, we really can't talk about this."
"Karen, Karen, I know something's happening."
"If you know what it is, I think you have a responsibility to tell me."
Excuse me.
Is that what we're doing?
"Grace, at this point,"
I don't have an answer to that question.
How does it even work?
Would we always pick each other's partners?
"Well, it's our marriage."
It'd be whatever we decide.
"And on that note,"
His name is Jeremy.
He seems like a decent guy.
And his only wish is to satisfy your every sexual desire.
You're really okay with this?
"Me sleeping with someone, and you knowing about it?"
Better than not knowing.
I think.
This is Denise.
"44, software consultant."
"Most important, not looking to fall in love."
She just wants sex.
"You can do that, right?"
All the equipment's in working order.
I feel a bit like we're stepping off a cliff.
Here's hoping there's a trampoline at the bottom.
Donnie?
Simon.
"Look, avoiding my calls isn't going to work."
I need to talk to you about my father.
Don't make me hunt you down.
Oh.
Hi.
Sorry.
I-I was just about to knock.
People enjoying themselves.
Helps me get to sleep.
"They're Colombians, I think."
"So what happens now, Calum?"
About what?
I'm sorry
- I forget you need a bit of extra help.
Remember yesterday?
I was dragged here from prison late at night?
- You were nearly garrotted?
"- Oh, that."
- He wouldn't have gone through with it.
"- Just a kinky game, was it?"
Yeah.
"I'm a bit worried he likes me too much, actually."
"And so when are they gonna turn up again, Calum?"
"Oh, don't worry."
Lenny'll be back soon.
"And that's what he does, by the way - turns up."
"Doesn't always knock, either."
So make sure you're not washing up naked.
"You'll be wanting to see your sister, I expect."
"You've not even met your niece yet, have you?"
- Is that allowed?
- Course it is.
"You're not on the run, licence is in order."
Go ahead.
Go see Jess and the kids.
I'm not a control freak.
"This is where you really want me to live, is it?"
You wouldn't want to live here - too many ghosts.

"Oh, my God."
I'm fatter than the skipper.
Ok.
Enough.
This is brutal.
"I knew I wasn't slim or even normal size, but seein' that bag, you know?"
"Honey, you are really overreacting to this."
"I mean, you are totally attractive."
So you--you still love me?
"Of course, I still love you."
I love you no matter what.
"What does that mean, ""no matter what""?"
Nothing.
Just that I love you.
"No, ""no matter what"" means you love me even though I have some sort of problem, like no job or no money, or biggie can't fit through doorway!"
Ok.
I take it back.
I love you.
That's it.
Period.
"No, come on, Carrie."
I'm being serious here.
Let's go.
You're telling me right now you have no problem with that area in here?
Nothing?
"Well, you know, for health reasons-- no, no, no, no."
"I'm not talkin' about health here, ok?"
Let's assume I'm in perfect health and I don't have that flutter.
I want to know right now:
Casshern.
Devour Casshern!
Kill him...
Kill Casshern!
Devour Casshern!
Why?
What do you stand to gain by devouring me?
The Ruin cannot be stopped now.
"Kill me if you must, Casshern, but this body won't last more than half a year amidst this destruction."
What does that have to do with me?
"Casshern, he who devours you shall attain eternal life."
That's ludicrous.
"I don't know if it's true or not, but to die without even trying is too wretched to fathom!"
Die!
The Ruin cannot be stopped...
He who devours me shall attain eternal life...
Kill Casshern.
Devour Casshern.
Kill Casshern!
Devour Casshern!
Kill Casshern.
So you become fragile when you lose consciousness...
It certainly is a fragile world.
A world of nothing but robots.
Ohji...
"Ringo, you're awake?"
You know you need to sleep.
I know.
Devour Casshern...
What an absurd concept.
You'll gain nothing by devouring him.
It won't stop the Ruin.
"Look officer, you're making a mistake, okay."
You need to cuff that man up right now.
"All right, let me see the cuffs."
Give 'em a tug.
"Dispatch, I got a situation over here."
The jammer.
Angie come back.
"Officer, you can't get a call out, because this man, he has a jammer inside."
"Look, we, we turned it off, but he must have turned it back on."
Be quiet.
What's a jammer?
I don't even have a phone.
Son of a bitch.
All right.
Now he said that the two of you we're trying to rob him.
Is that true?
- No.
- Yes.
"Officer, yes, it's true."
"We broke into his house to rob him, okay, but, he's been keeping us against our will, underground in a torture den."
An underground torture den?
There's a secret door.
If you look inside...
Secret door?
"In the basement, a secret..."
Let me get this straight.
The two of you were trying to rob the house of some kind of serial killer?
This man?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Do I look like Sheriff dumb dumb to you?
- Yes.
Have a good day.
"Uh, you won't be here."
I beg your pardon?
"Here, at 10:00 or 10:30."
Your date tonight.
Yes.
"The liaison in question is hardly a ""date,"" it's an appointment."
"Devon, she's a very beautiful woman."
"Yes, however she's also the widow of Wilton Knight, who, as you may recall, created and continues to fund the foundation for which we both work."
"Oh, I recall."
Yes.
"However, you're quite right."
She is a beautiful woman.
She's also a woman who never does anything without a purpose.
Devon.
"Elizabeth, how nice to see you."
You remembered.
How could I forget?
"Devon, you look absolutely wonderful."
And so do you.
"I believe, you used to say,"
"""living well is the best revenge. """
"Until someone comes up with a better phrase, I still do."
Gin and tonic?
You remember.
I'm so glad you phoned.
How long has it been?
Three years?
Three years and four months.
But who's counting?
I am.
I'm not telling you anything you didn't already know.
You worried about me?
- You were scared.
- Shut up.
"No, you were scared to go into the second tower on your own."
"I think you were afraid to go up the first time, so you were hoping that you could find some bullshit reason so you could stay downstairs."
Makes all kinds of sense right now.
"This is it, right?"
"This is it, pops.This is it, ain't it?"
- That ain't it.
- This is it.
This is the nail right on the goddamn head.
"- I'm warning you, johnny."
- Warning me how?
"This makes perfect, complete sense here."
"Wait, wait, you didn't want to go in, tom?"
Of course I wanted to go in.
You didn't want to go in.
Holy shit.
"Shut your fat cop face, johnny, ok."
- You don't know shit about it.
- Why?
'Cause you're a cop.
You don't know shit about it.
I know a bullshit rap when i hear it.
"I swear on my kids' souls, johnny."
You're a goddamn coward.
All this show.
All the balls.
All the bravado.
Running in like a madman.
"Tommy ""goddamn"" gavin, the firefighter with the biggest cock on the goddamn block."
"You know what, it's all bullshit, bro."
One not inclined to exaggeration.
What can this be?
Is Col. Brandon here?
- My horse!
- What's the matter?
- I must away to London.
- Impossible!
We can't picnic without our host.
Come up to town tomorrow.
- Or wait until we return.
- I can't afford to lose one minute.
- Forgive me.
- I hope it's nothing serious.
"Upon my soul, this is all very unusual."
"- Frailty, thy name is Brandon."
- Some cannot bear pleasure.
You are a wicked pair.
Col. Brandon will be missed.
Why?
"Everyone speaks well of him, but no one remembers to talk to him."
Nonsense.
He is highly respected at Barton Park.
- Which is enough censure in itself.
"- Really, Willoughby."
"Come, come, Mr. Impudence."
I know your wicked ways.
Reveal your beau.
No secrets between friends.
I'll winkle it out of you.
"I'll have you married to the colonel by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet."
- As if you could marry him.
- Why should you dislike him?
- You've lost your mind.
What is that?
Is that why I came?
To meet Anna and see Helene?
You want to buy me?
- I don't want to buy you.
- That's what it says here.
"Fine, then let's say that."
Think of what you could do with the money.
How many you could help.
Wouldn't you sell yourself for that?
- Come on.
I know you would.
- You don't know shit about me.
I know all about you.
You're a good person.
"Naive, but well-intentioned."
Except for some water projects and some schools in Bangalore   not one of your projects has succeeded in the last 15 years.
"You're good at finding people to help, but not at financing it."
- You've been checking me out?
- Your orphanage has to close.
All your sweet little kids will be on the street again.
You fat pig.
"Is it fun playing God, you big, fat pig?"
It's not true.
I'm just saying that you're lying to yourself.
You're an idiot if you don't take this chance.
"You can kiss my ass, Jorgen."
"- Jacob, wait."
- I don't want to talk to you.
"You're right, Jacob."
Don't touch me!
That I am valuable.
That I matter.
And that I deserve to know everything I can about this world that you send me into every day so at least I have a fighting chance.
"You know, in spite of everything..."
"In spite of everything, I like you."
I think you're great.
And I want you to think the same of me.
I screwed up.
"Honey, my key's not working."
Where's him?
Him's not here.
- What room you looking for?
- My room.
Who are you?
You're cute.
And you're faking it.
You never con a con artist.
You had your chance to walk away.
You won't get another.
- Pete with you?
"- No, listen."
I'm a bit busy.
- Can I call you back?
"- Yeah, no, sure."
Everything okay?
It will be as soon as I can get back to work.
I got some bad news.
Leena tells me that your ferret escaped and she's tried to call for it.
She doesn't know its name.
"I don't even know if you finally did name that thing, did you?"
"No, actually, I never did."
Put some food out and it'll come back.
What is this?
I think I might as well go to Provincial Office work.
Just go then.
"You will just waiting for sleepy children, right?"
It might be more tiring.
It's better here!
We will not fall asleep here!
Didn't you say there's no point protecting the president's daughter?
It's very annoying coming here.
I know you enough.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Watch her closely.
I think she will dance until she slips off.
Okay.
"Today, we're also going to a Hotel, right?"
But...
You didn't meet with the old man recently?
"The days you did not meet him, made me very happy too."
We broke up already.
Maybe something has happened.
Even his mobile number has changed.
He should have contacted me.
What?
Broke up already?
Why?
Weren't you allowing me to sort out my relationship?
The case is...
"Now that I think you aren't popular amongst the guys, I've lost interest."
In just one moment my taste changed.
What?
Let's break up too.
"Really, Eun Ah..."
You do look handsome in your sou'wester.
Really?
Gin.
Mr. Hilliard's going to be awfully angry.
"Oh, we'll blame war transport."
- The old ham can make do with me.
So...
Positions!
Positions!
Everybody please be quiet for a take.
Don't stand under any thousand-pounders.
The director wants to speak to you.
Let me guess.
He's canceling my fitting for the dog costume.
"No, he didn't say what it was about."
Tell him you couldn't find me.
But-
- But I have found you.
"No, you haven't."
You are exhausted.
"You're leaning against the rail of the ship, the wounded Johnnie cradled-- cradled in your arms."
"Oh, uh, no, thank you."
"You look up, and you see, coming towards you across the deck, a vision of loveliness."
And you say...
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
He kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
I guess that must be you.
Why do you want him?
We have the two new guys.
Those cream puffs are useless!
Forget about 'em.
"Enough of your ""peep peep."""
"Mr. Biberkopf, my tie's come undone."
You got that patented tie holder?
Come to the Alexanderplatz.
They don't allow business in here.
"Franz, let's go somewhere else."
Take it easy.
Buy the real thing here!
Why do rich men on the west side wear ties but workers don't?
"One for 20, three for 50!"
Step right up!
"Shall I loosen my tie and sing a little song, boys?"
"Peep, peep, peep"
The dickey bird sings
Do you know where the dickey bird sings
In its cage
Where
On the wall Don't ask such stupid questions
Perhaps the honorable Mr. Biberkopf will sing something too.
You bet I will!
What should I sing?
Wait a minute.
What can the band play?
Wait a minute.
"Do you know ""I Once Knew a Comrade""?"
I once knew a comrade
You couldn't find a better man
But now it's all over and I've paid my dues
He is sticking to me like a leech and torturing me.
What sort of background work have you done?
He is in love with me.
You have easily dealt many men before this.
This guy doesn't even stand a chance.
You are being a bit restless.
Fetch me some water.
Deal with him with some patience.
If it doesn't work out... we'll change the plan.
Thomas.
"Get me my handbag from the backseat, please."
There is a pen inside.
This one?
- Open the cap.
Thanks.
Vasundhara!
- I can sense that you both involved in something.
What's it?
Vasundhara...
"- Tell me, what is it?"
It will not take any time for me to poke this into your throat!
(stuttering)
Ravi drafted the plan.
We went to Chennai to meet Varun...
Ravi sold all the jewels... we looted from Varun.
Ravi... has all the money.
Sorry.
I'm very sorry.
If uncle has taken such a step...
I'm the one to be blamed.
"I thought that if you had too much money, you will spend it all on alcohol and other such nonsense."
I have saved a share separately for you.
Where you going with the time capsule ?
Home.
Unveiling it was supposed to be a special event.
The whole weekend's ruined.
"I mean, some things you just can't party plan."
"You know, actually, I'd like to see the contents if you don't mind."
At least someone will get to see the time capsule.
Here's the list.
We buried it underground right before graduation.
All our favorite memories.
"""Rubik's Cube, Atari 2600,"
"Whitesnake CD,"
"President Bush elected."""
"That's the first one, right ?"
"Dubé champagne."""
The same brand as the murder weapon.
The bottle's not in there.
"Did you take it out, Krystal ?"
"What do you mean, take it out ?"
No !
"Oh, my God !"
Our beach in a jar.
It broke !
That might be evidence.
Evidence ?
I'm confused.
Let me guess.
You brought it back from your trip senior year in the Bahamas ?
How'd you know ?
Are you the only one with a key to the time capsule ?
"Well, there's one other person."
Not that she ever cared about the class project.
I third it.
"All those in favor will please say ""aye."""
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Contrary-minded?
Nay.
You'll get your mop.
Aye.
That makes it unanimous.
Any further business?
Do i hear a motion to adjourn?
Let me do it.
I move we adjourn.
I second the motion.
I third it.
Meeting's adjourned.
"Good night, mr."
Fisk.
"Good night, mrs."
Callahan.
"Good night, arthur."
"Good night, sam."
We only needed a $1 million issue to cover our stock shortage.
What do you think you're gonna do with the other 9 million?
"If we can get cornele to buy it, we'll give him the licking' of his life."
"It'll take more money than you ever thought of, commodore, to stop that erie flood."
"You bought over $9 million worth of the stuff now, and they still got lots to sell."
"Cornelius, why don't you stop buying and start selling?"
I don't need any suggestions from you to make me a bigger fool than i am.
"If i sell now, the price will drop like a punctured balloon."
"I won't have any money, any stock, or any control."
"For packaged news,"
"I'm the only one, for timely deliveries."
It's me.
"For the right address, it's still me."
one last breath of fresh air... and it's time to go now.
"Don't get alarmed, Léo,"
The commissioner is here just to make sure all's quiet on the Alpine front.
Better carry a piece.
"Me, never."
"Mary, she's his most precious thing."
He's burning through those creeps who got their kicks from grilling his wife.
"A hero, the commissioner, in the line of suffering."
Stoke the dice.
Load the fire!
The carriage awaits me at the gates.
"Don't see me at the door, I will go alone."
The carriage awaits me at the gates.
"Don't see me at the door, I will go alone."
May I have a drink.
Where are you going now?
To town.
Is Nina Nicolaevna here?
Yes.
"Last Thursday, my uncle was feeling unwell."
We sent him a telegram.
Why did you tell me you kissed the earth I walked on?
"I should be killed, to be put to rest, to be put to rest,"
I am a seagull!
I warned you:
"Lies, dullness."
I don't want you.
- I am an actress!
Come back.
The company needs you and...
And so do I.
"Oh, you mean leave here?"
"Oh, I'm afraid Dr. Croatman would have something to say about that."
"But you're so much better, John."
"You've had a long rest, and you look wonderful."
"Don't you think if the psychiatrist examined you again, he'd see that?"
He does seem rather pleased with my progress.
"Oh, good!"
Then I'll tell Sam about it.
He'll know what's best to be done.
"If you wish, my dear."
But I'm not sure it'll do any good.
Stop pacing like a caged animal.
What if they don't let him out?
Why shouldn't they?
There's nothing wrong with him.
I know.
But you can go off your rocker just being in a place like that.
"If it doesn't work, we're finished."
"If it does, what about you and me?"
We just have to be careful.
"Mrs. Brown, Dr. Helck is here."
I've just come from Dr. Croatman.
"My dear, John is waiting for you to bring him home."
Wonderful.
"Well, it was a great 10 months."
This isn't the end.
We'd better go in.
We won't be able to see each other.
We can't pull this trick again.
"Well, all right."
"You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man."
I feel manipulated.
I thought we were gonna hang out.
"We are hanging out, Badger."
You like Badger or Brandon?
"I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution."
"Badger, listen."
"I'm trying to help you here, man."
"If you just tell me who your supplier is,"
I think this can end very well for you.
What are you doing talking to my client without me present?
You Sneaky Pete!
Which is which?
"What, did the Academy hire you right out of the womb?"
You guys get younger every...
What'd you say to Baby-Face?
Did you say anything stupid?
"By anything stupid, I mean anything at all."
Look at you.
"Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter."
We'll talk about it later.
"Right now, you out."
Ten minutes ago!
Go on!
"There are laws, detective."
Have your kindergarten teacher read 'em to you?
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap.
Go on.
All right.
Who do we have?
May I speak with you?
Something very terrible has happened.
- Oh!
- Ah!
Again.
- George seems more cheerful.
- Mm.
She has a crush on Chopin.
The Polish corpse?
- They couldn't be more different.
- Then they will definitely fall in love.
I suppose as friends we should help them along.
Absolutely not!
"Franz, you and I must put ourselves between them at every opportunity."
- Marie!
Your turn.
- Yes.
"He is so frail, darling."
You know George will finish him off.
- The countess made advances to you?
- She is my friend's mistress.
- She has borne his child.
- He wouldn't mind if she changed hands.
"Really, I don't understand the attitude of you people."
Are we at a livestock sale?
"She's a woman, not a goat."
- Are you in love with her yourself?
- Of course not.
"""I'm not full of virtues and noble qualities."""
"""I love, that is all."""
"""But I love strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."""
"No, it's like something out of a novel..."
- He's all right.
We'll run him through the wringer.
He'll wash.
- How was the ball game?
- We beat the daylights out of them.
"- You did, eh?"
What was the score?
- Sixty-three to 40.
But we only played five innings.
Fat hit a homer and we lost the ball.
And you've torn your pants again.
"Well, I was sliding into third and Muggy spiked me."
"Yeah, what did you do to him?"
I smacked him.
"You know, when I was his age, I could lick any kid in the neighborhood."
- Ouch.
- What's the matter?
- That's where he smacked me back.
That's all there is.
The fellows think I'm gonna get the job.
And I...
"Well, I'm the best man in the shop, ain't I?"
"Gee, Pop, you'll be foreman and that's about the highest job there is, ain't it?"
Heh-heh-heh.
"Well, I wouldn't say that but it's pretty high."
"Well, wait till I tell Muggy about this."
He thinks he's hot because his uncle used to be a foreman.
"Yeah, we'll get Muggy, won't we?"
"- Come on, boys, dinner's ready."
Okay.
"And if I'd have known about this, I'd have fixed us a real spread."
"Oh, don't you worry, kid."
That's why it's not magnetic.
I've never seen markings like this before.
It can mean only one thing.
"It must be a page from the Book of Atlantis, hidden there by Solon himself."
"Kelly, can you take us into the crater?"
Yes.
"If we leave now, we can make it before sunset."
Come on.
"Well, it looks like it was a temple."
Strange place for one.
Great place to hide a treasure though.
"Well, if there was an entrance, it's long since been destroyed."
Here.
Let's clear it.
"In ya go, MacGyver."
MacGyver.
Did you find anything?
"Oh, yeah."
Bigtime.
Incredible.
Look familiar?
A Copernican model of the solar system.
Built thousands of years before Copernicus was born.
The planets must be orbiting closer to the alignment.
The gravitational shift of the alignment's making the volcano unstable.
I hate when that happens.
"Solon said, ""Enter the Gates of Hades."""
"Well, what are we waiting for?"
Ah!
Poor devil.
What triggered it?
Do you think it's Cleeve?
Do we have to?
Why?
No reason.
Is that all you have to say on the matter?
What is this need to have a reason for everything?
"Oh, of course, I forget, you're a pathologist."
You tend to be very literal about things like reasons.
"When you killed them, when you looked into their eyes, what were you hoping to see?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
Killers meet the same end as saints.
"There is no heaven, no hell no final judgment."
You hope'!
Aren't you gonna ask me if I had a troubled childhood?
try and unravel the meaning of it all?
I've got more meaningful things to do with my life.
Tom?
I'm still here.
I've been thinking.
"Not about work, I hope."
About you.
Really?
I've been thinking about you and your father.
You need to forgive him.
If you don't want to end up like me.
What do you mean?
Bitter.
Bitter about what?
Not marrying.
Not having children.
Buying my life in my work.
You have a father.
She knows.
"She knows I'm helping you, she knows I'm following them."
She knows everything.
And she bugged my house.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
They were all over the place.
And they weren't even that careful.
And she made very sure I was aware of it.
She probably wanted to goad you into making contact with us.
Yeah.
They had someone follow me.
I almost killed myself unloading the son of a bitch.
"So, Fi, what do I do?"
"I mean, she's getting closer, and I don't know how much more we can meet like this."
"Well, I'll talk to Michael."
"But in the meantime, if you need to reach us, you leave the house and use this, okay?"
It's a burner phone.
It should be safe to use.
Wait.
One more thing.
"A long time ago, Michael disappeared, and he never said goodbye."
Promise me you won't do that.
I promise.
Nothing here.
Anything on your side?
Jabbar rolls pretty heavy.
"My guess is, when he comes, we're both gonna see him."
"So, where do you think you're gonna go -- after this is all over?"
I don't know.
I have no idea.
How about you?
"Sorry, I am late."
Ghost!
Ghost!
Hey!
What's going on?
It's a mess.
I can't manage to explain.
Help...
Wu Man.
"How is it, hubby?"
"I sent you to UK to study law, why do you come back suddenly?"
I wish to give you a surprise.
It's really a surprise.
Let's eat.
"By the way, why were you flushed out of the room by water?"
And I see traps all over the house.
Do you have time to tell something about it?
"I have time, but it's not convenient to talk right now."
"Madam, don't mistake it."
Master knows that
I have an indecent and brutal desire.
"So he arranged all the traps, to let me have chance to kiss Miss Shiu."
Don't misunderstand him.
"But, master..."
"About the pig's tongue, isn't it convenient to give me an explanation?"
"Sure, but I don't have time."
"That's good, even you have time to talk, we don't have time to listen."
"Foon, you kissed the pig's tongue, didn't you?"
I did.
"Right, I bought that specially for you."
"Master, you promised to let me kiss Miss Shiu."
"In fact, it's me who wanted to kiss her."
I really do.
"Well, thanks."
How about our going into partnership?
Or do we have to ask John's permission?
He's a charter member.
Do you have any influence with him?
I never interfere in his business.
But you just got a share of it now.
You just became a partner.
"Are you as conservative as your husband, Mrs. Brown?"
No wonder my husband thinks your ideas are too advanced.
I just meant we could make a lot of money.
"Oh, now you're angry again!"
Are you sorry John made you take me to lunch?
I wasn't drafted.
I volunteered.
I shouldn't tease you.
Your sketches are wonderful.
And most women would like to make a lot of money.
Sure.
Some of them marry for it.
That's a low blow.
I'm very fond of John.
I'm sure you are.
"Good evening, Mr. Skinner."
"Hello, Ellen."
"I'm a little early, so if Mr. Brown hasn't finished his dinner..."
He's not here.
He left for Philadelphia late this afternoon.
Well...
"Well, that's odd."
I'm supposed to meet him here to go over some statements.
"""Busty's"" pretty bad,too."
"It's clearly not working for you,Bella."
Why don't you just end it already?
I can't.
I can't hurt his pride again.
"I mean,like,I'll have to wait till he breaks up with me."
I wonder how he feels about the Gandhi.
Real men do not fear the Gandhi.
I'm sorry.
What was that?
I said that as loudly as I possibly could.
"Look,you really want him to break up with you?"
-Yes.
- Just be needy.
Be clingy.
Ask him how he's feeling every five seconds.
"Ask him about sex with his ex-girlfriends, and then get really upset over anything he tells you."
"Basically,just do exactly what you did wrong with the last guy you dated that you really liked."
I can totally do that.
Always be on my side.
Just stay.
I have a rehearsal.
Let's just be naked for five more minutes.
I'm sorry.
"I'm already 30 minutes late,all right?"
"I gotta go,okay?"
I'm sorry.
Please.
We could take a bath.
Just soak in the tub till we get raising fingers.
"That sounds really great, but the guys are waiting for me,all right?"
Fine!
"All right, give me that."
"What's the matter, Bal?"
You've been woolgathering ever since we crawled out of the river.
"- You know, my time is up on May 14."
- What of that?
"You can sign on for another nine years, can't you?"
Make a man out of him.
I'm leaving the service.
- Leaving the service?
- That's right.
"I'm getting married, and I'm going in the tea business."
- Married!
- Tea business!
"Why, you're mad if..."
"March to attention, everybody!"
"Let's march in in good style, men."
- Fall in up there.
"- Left, right, left."
Tell the Sergeant to report at the office immediately.
"Yes, sir."
"Party, right wheel!"
Halt!
Left face!
Sergeants to the front!
"The wiring party's returned from Tantrapur, sir."
"Eight killed, three wounded."
Otherwise all correct.
"Very well, Sergeant."
Dismiss your men... and report at the office immediately.
"Very good, sir."
"Party, dismissed!"
"- Identical, Mitchell."
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
(TASER ZAPPING) (SOLDIER GRUNTING)
(BODY FALLS DOWN)
(MACHINE BEEPING)
It's not my usual fantasy.
"Usually, you're wearing latex and a strap-on."
"Well, I see the bullet hasn't improved your sense of humor, then."
And Stonebridge?
You found his corpse yet or you're still looking?
We don't know that he's dead yet.
(GRUNTING) He's been looking for that bullet ever since Kate died.
"And, you knew that."
You fucking used it.
You knew he'd go the whole nine to rescue some damsel in distress.
"Too bad your perfect plan fucked up, huh?"
"I liked him too, Scott."
Yeah.
"But, unfortunately, I can only rescue you at the moment."
(GRUNTING) Lucky me... (WHISPERS) Bitch.
(GRUNTING)
(WATER DRIPPING)
Nothing.
I think we're good.
They're just chasing blind.
For now.
But we're still gonna have to keep moving.
(GRUNTING)
You can still have that morphine shot if you want it.
That's all right.
"It's okay, I won't think you're any less macho."
Someone else might need it more later.
Hmm.
"If I get angry, I'll..."
...this is my weakness.
"If I don't find my patient, I'll not spare anyone of you."
"He's a doctor, why is he behaving like this?"
- He's not a doctor.
- Then?
He's the memory loss patient we were just discussing about.
When he was brought here...
"Tell me, who am I?"
"If you don't, I'll jump down..."
Who am I?
Where am I?
I know...
We were scared he may kill himself.
Now...?
Please...take one injection...
let me give you one shot...
We are now scared he may kill one of us.
- Why?
"That's what confusing us, why did he suddenly change like this?"
Somebody has influenced powerfully and changed him.
He has a patient also in our hospital.
Where did you go?
That is...there...
Bloody!
Do you know how tensed I was without seeing you for 2 days?
With the problem you have...
what's that?
- Memory loss.
Where did you go?
Forgot the hospital address and took time to come here.
"What happened, doctor?"
trust me.
I mean you're afraid of a real relationship Dale.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
I am not scared of relationships
But you're scared of something.
Let's just forget about it.
Ok...
Sorry.
No it's Ok I just wasn't expecting that.
Was it weird seeing Dale?
"Yeah, yeah it was weird."
I felt like I sensed something between you guys.
"Yeah, yeah I think maybe you did."
Dale and I are really tight.
You know and as I told you before Hallie
I'm just not that interested in a relationship right now and I wouldn't want anyone to get the wrong impression about what's going on here.
She's the one that told me to pursue you just so you know.
She told you that?
Yeah you sound surprised.
She said you guys were just friends that you've never hooked up and that she isn't your type.
Not my type.
So are we cool?
"Yeah, yeah we're cool but I just..."
I don't think this is a very good idea right now OK?
This isn't a good idea?
OK I'm just...
Not that into this right now.
You're not into this?
No.
Are you into this?
Hey!
"Hey, Hayden."
Don't you even care?
I'm not happy at the conservatory.
Of course I care!
"But I also care about scholarships, opportunities."
I care about your future.
"If you really cared about my future, you would not have sold my piano in the first place!"
"Mom, I'm sorry."
I didn't-
"Get in the car, now."
I have to go.
I understand.
I hope you're satisfied.
It took all my will power not to trip her.
Thank you for letting me know Amanda was here.
Glad I could help.
Welcome home.
"I'd ask you what you were thinking, but I don't think you were thinking at all."
"Actually, this took a great deal of planning."
Not helping.
The Blooms' situation was private.
We made it very clear you were not to see Amanda.
You were not to get involved.
"I know I broke a rule, but I'm not sorry I did."
"I had to do it, for Amanda."
"Good intentions aside, you're still grounded."
All of you.
Two weeks.
What?
"School, work, home."
Everything else is off-limits.
And I'll take your cell phones.
This was my idea.
"Yeah, one day we'll look back we'll smile and we'll laugh."
But right now we just cry.
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye.
Yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
I'll always remember you.
I'll always remember you.
[Mouthing] Thank you.
So Hannah you said you had some big news for us.
Half of our staff thinks you're running for governor.
The other half thinks you're going back on Flitter.
And Lenny hoping you're back for him.
"No, no, and Lenny, get a life."
"I mean, what is that?"
I don't want to be pushy.
But I've never had the same person on twice in one week.
"Actually, Jay, that's still kind of true."
I'm not the same person.
No.
No of course you're not.
[Whistles]
I think it would be easier this way.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
"Hey Lenny, I'm starting to think you dodged a bullet with this chick."
[All murmuring]
You got money for the bus.
Bus?
I'm taking the car.
Huh?
Cory!
Cory!
Hey!
Hey!
You can't take the car.
You don't know how to drive!
"Eric, what can happen?"
"I lose control of the car and crash into, what, the world's largest Slurpee?"
Lay off my town.
Eric.
You're still here.
Why wouldn't I be?
"We had a great night together, didn't we?"
"Yeah, we did."
"I, um..."
I was thinking maybe you found someone more interesting and I wasn't going to see you again.
"Well, I think you're very interesting."
That makes me happy.
"Uh, do you want to say hi to my friends?"
They're real eager to meet you.
"Oh, and the little hitchhiker boy is more than welcome to join us."
"No, this is where the little hitchhiker boy says goodbye."
"So, Eric, if you're staying, then there's nothing left to say except..."
I'll be the one driving through the corn field.
"Okay, fine, at least let me check to see if you have the right keys."
What a moron.
"Well, you can take the keys, Eric, but you can't take my freedom!"
You don't have to worry about him.
Not that she was drinking or anything.
I think it was a bad trip fajitas.
Yes?
I'll be right there.
Excuse me!
What are you doing?
Pretty naughty!
What do you think about us going on a real date?
"I mean don't get me wrong, secret sex is awesome."
"Really awesome, but I think that you and I actually dating awesom... er."
On that thought.
We have a situation up here.
What sort of situation?
I'm kinda busy in here.
Code red.
I'll be right back.
"Someone drop the dime, called the coppers."
"Someone on the Greek task force phoned Bowman to say, claiming there's booze."
- Come on.
- Chambers.
Execute plan B.
- But there's not time.
- I wouldn't be so sure
There's always time for plan B.
You fellas and spread out.
"Hey, boys!"
Care to join me for a drink?
What the hell are you doing?
"Taking your cruise out on the open road, see if I can hit a few miles an hour."
"You wanna join me, I'd love to have company!"
"Let him go, we always know where to find him."
- Not with my squad car.
- where are you headed?
- to what i promised the last ghost i would do.
- [scoffs] clean up your mama's shop?
"no, you ain't."
- [scoffs] [snaps fingers]
- this ain't right.
this ain't the salon.
- this is like -  scrapbooking place.
- what the heck?
"- it looks god-awful, don't it?"
"[laughs] [coughs, laughs]"
"- hey, i know that laugh."
i know that laugh!
mama.
- [clicks tongue]
- you look terrible.
- well...
- what's up with the creepy black robe?
"- robe's part of the tradition for, uh, ghosts of christmas future."
"anyway, after you married wayne, you sold the place to bob and marge."
you never did get no job.
"- [scoffs] well, i actually think it looks kind of nice."
"- oh, you like the way this looks?"
it looks like a magazine or something.
it's got no soul.
"i mean, honey, look what you let happen to the salon that i built with my own hands."
- it's quaint!
- yeah.
then marge went even hog-wild after she got it all in the divorce.
- wait -- bob and marge got a divorce?
- yeah.
- see?
"Restaurants are big down here, right?"
Huge.
Kind of resisted them at first.
"As you know, I'm not much of a foodie."
"What, now you are?"
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"When in Rome, right?"
"Well, maybe you can help us narrow down which restaurants are prime candidates."
Okay.
What do we got?
(computer blips)
How about this...
Pat O'Brien's?
Pat O's?
No way they're cartel.
They've been in the Quarter for decades.
Make a killer hurricane cocktail that'll...
You should try one.
"I'm not here for the cocktails, T."
Okay.
Let's just get Garcia and get back home.
(computer blips)
I'm not sure I want to go back home.
Sorry?
I'm just saying I'm not sure.
"Ten years ago, you couldn't get far enough away from this place fast enough, and now you like it?"
"I don't understand, Tammy."
This cartel case is your big shot.
"Isler moves up, you move up."
It's... everything you've always said you wanted.
Isn't that why we broke up?
"This isn't about me and you, Hannah."
- How do you know?
- I know because Stacy Culpepper's got one.
And everybody was talking about it.
Let's get ours.
- We can't.
- Why not?
Because we blew the money on rent again.
"Still, we might still have enough for just one dress and then maybe..."
What?
"Again, Vi?"
Call Russ back before he gives the job away.
- We got it.
- What...
"He said it was an easy gig, right?"
- Yea.
"- Up the money too, didn't he?"
Yea.
Then what are we waiting for?
That's shit!
"Hey Russ, it's me Daisy."
I know what we said.
"but, we've changed our mind and we thought... we considered your offer."
"And we think, that actually it'd work out quite well because um..."
"See, the day that you talked about..."
"Deeper baby, deeper..."
"Ow, gross!"
You weren't suppose to like it!
"Like I've end up better do with it, Princess."
Are you guys hear about this guy?
"Ok so basically, there was this guy who stole some shit from Chet."
- What did this guy take from him?
- A truck full of cologne.
I knew you could do it!
Mr. Fuzzles!
"Thank you, Francis."
You can go now.
What?
What is it?
We've got something for you.
Dewey and I finally came up with something good enough for that insane voice in your head.
"-Here, put this on first."
-Roman candles?
"Well, that's how they started off."
We decided to give 'em a little more... oomph.
Do you care if you keep your eyebrows?
"-Hell, no!"
"Okay, the fuse is timed for 20 seconds."
"You're gonna light it, and then get up on the board and jump."
The rockets should kick in around there.
"They won't give you any momentum, but they will ignite that."
"Hopefully, you will land in that kiddie pool."
We think that's got a 50-50 shot of putting you out.
If the roof doesn't collapse.
Or ignite.
And it's all gonna be caught on that video camera.
This is more than anything I could have ever asked for.
Nobody deserves it more than you.
Should I get the hose?
Not yet.
He would've wanted us to wait.
Good boy.
You finished all your peas!
"Hey, slugger."
Guess what.
Erudite sim complete.
JEANINE:
There's only Amity now.
PETER:
She hasn't passed Abnegation yet.
"Yes, she has."
When she spared your life.
This girl is extraordinary.
She's tested positive for four factions in one day.
(CHUCKLES)
No one's gotten that far.
(MACHINE BEEPING)
MAN:
We've got a problem.
She's crashing.
We have to rest her.
Sure you're not letting familial attachment cloud yourjudgment?
See for yourself.
(PANTING)
Very well.
Detach the subject.
"Good work, everyone."
We'll resume tomorrow.
(DOOR OPENS)
"You were never planning on going back to Abnegation, were you?"
I had to do what I felt was right.
Our parents would be ashamed of you.
"Well, maybe not."
"I mean, I am willing to sacrifice you, the only family I have left, the only person I love, in order to preserve what's best for everyone else."
What's more selfless than that?
"What does Jeanine think is in that box, Caleb?"
It's a message from The Founders.
"- Oh, yes, of course."
"- Excuse us, darling."
- Sure.
"Dexter, I haven't said it before."
I will now.
I think your courage was admirable.
And I have you to thank for saving my father's life.
"Now, I realise the great risks you took, and I'll always appreciate it."
"I'm glad I was able to help, Michael."
And that we all got back safely.
"Well, there is one more favour I'd like to ask of you."
That being?
"From now on, stay away from my wife."
Michael.
"Look, whatever you're thinking-"
My suspicions are groundless?
- Yes.
- Good.
Then it will make it that much easier for you.
You know something?
This conversation is for the royal birds.
If you'll excuse me.
"Michael, why did you do that?"
"Oh, my God, Amanda, isn't it obvious?"
"No, it isn't obvious to me."
"Well, how do you think I feel when you throw your arms around?"
"Prince Michael, I have some good news."
Your father has regained consciousness for the first time.
- You may see him for a few moments.
- Thank you.
I'll see him alone.
Michael.
Hi.
You look really nice.
"Oh, thanks."
Where do you wanna go on our first date back?
I got to be in early.
"I got curfew, you know."
"Well, we were invited over to Amy and Ricky's."
What?
"Yeah, won't that be fun?"
I've never actually been over there before.
"Yeah, me neither."
And that's because we're not really friends with Ricky and Amy.
"Yes, we are."
We've known them for years.
That's where you want to go?
I was going to take us out for dinner or something.
"That's okay, I think they're just going to order a pizza or something."
They can't really go out because of John.
Great.
It'll be fun.
I don't think it will.
They're married.
They have a baby.
"Well, don't you want to get married and have a baby someday?"
Someday.
Not today.
Not tonight.
Tonight I just want to spend some time with you.
We don't need to spend so much time alone.
It only makes us want to have sex.
"I'm always going to want to have sex with you, so I'm just going to have to wait until you tell me you want to have sex with me."
"All right, let's go."
Do you have conscience or not?
You don't answer your mobile.
Nobody knows where you are.
I'm nervous!
Have you forgotten that we're going to Paris?
I can't go to Paris now.
Take some rest there without me for a few days.
No.
- I have an important meeting.
- No!
You promised to spend two days with me.
Why are you sitting here?
"Who are you meeting with, if it's not a secret?"
It's not a secret.
I'm meeting with Garik.
- With Garik...
- Yes.
This meeting is more important to me than to him.
"So Garik can't wait, can he?"
Why do you react in such a way?
Lets go.
- What?
"- Let's go, I say!"
I'll give you a lift.
His place is on my way.
"Close the bag, let's go."
I got used to your lies.
I got used to the fact that you have affairs with other women.
But I can't get used to your cynicism and your perverse cruelty.
What women?
What cynicism?
"You've been telling me about meetings with your best friend, your former classmate Garik for a long time."
You leave him to me.
I'll take care of him.
"No, maybe I'd better surprise them."
He can't do a thing like this to a daughter of mine.
"This is my affair, you keep out of it."
I'm your father and I'll settle this as I see fit.
We'll be the laughingstock of this whole town!
So...
Here I am.
"Young man, why didn't you appear for your wedding?"
I thought you'd ask me that.
Don't stand there like a statue.
You said you were gonna do something.
"Well, do it."
What are you gonna do?
Don't you dare touch him.
- Why don't you do something?
- I will.
"I will, but..."
"Pardon me, I think I'm in the way."
- Perhaps you two would like to be alone.
- You stay right where you are.
- I'm not finished with you yet.
- I had a feeling you weren't.
"I wouldn't let you marry her for $10,000."
- How about twenty?
"- Not for $20,000."
- Twenty-five.
- Not for...
"Say, young man, where could you get $25,000?"
By dancing?
And there's another thing... coming back to your own hometown in a dancing act.
It's never felt like this before.
They're coming at last.
The unidentified object has crashed at Narita Airport.
It is still emitting light.
82% of the enemy's makeup cannot be analyzed.
What in the world is this adversary?
This is our true enemy.
Our true enemy...?
I'll explain later.
Can Dangaioh be deployed at once?
Yes.
"In another 30 seconds, it will be loaded onto the Saber Sonic."
It will be ready to go in 140 seconds.
I'll be there in 50 seconds.
Clear Route 7 for my arrival.
What's happening?
I don't know.
I only know that the temperature is rising rapidly.
Vice-Commander...
"We have no data, this time...?"
N-no...
"We know so little of its makeup, power source, armaments that we can't draw any projections."
And so... um...
"I'm sorry, please switch off the monitor."
I had no time to change.
"Listen to me, everyone..."
This battle will be like nothing before.
Anything can happen.
But...
Come on!
That's enough talk!
"I'm itching for a good fight, today!"
That's a good thing.
That means you're not like them.
"""Tell me not in mournful numbers,"
Life is but an empty dream.
"For the soul is dead that slumbers, And things are not what they seem."" Did you write this, dude?"
[EVAN] Huh?
"So, she's meeting you here."
[EVAN] Yeah.
Why?
[BENDER] I don't know.
Most chicks want you to pick them up.
[EVAN] She already knows where I live.
"Right, but still something peculiar about that."
How's this?
"Dude, you look great!"
You think?
Yeah.
Guys should take lessons from you on how to dress like a pimp.
"Yeah, it's like, this part is like..."
Do you want me to help you tie that tie?
"Yeah, that'd be great."
All right.
This is called the double Windsor knot.
"Don't fucking ask me how I know how to do this, like, I don't remember."
"I consider myself a modern-day cad, or dandy."
"A metrosexual, in the parlence of our times."
What was that?
"Dude, I don't know what I was doing, I just ..."
"I've been really lonely lately and, I mean you remember that one time we made out?"
"I mean, come on, just-"
Dad?
"Don't call me ""dad."" What?"
The bastards who did this should be shot.
"No, I tried to get away and I lost control."
You did everything you could.
"Don't worry, the cops will get these guys."
- Have you seen Grace?
- She looks good.
- They think she's gonna be okay.
- Really?
We still have to run a few tests.
"Everything looks good, but as soon as I can, I'll bring her down so you can be with her."
"Okay, thanks."
I'm gonna go back and stay with Grace until they're ready to bring her in here.
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Your husband seems like a great guy.
"It's okay, Judy."
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.
"Okay, well, the Venus flytrap is nontoxic, so it's not lethal if ingested."
"However, the larger ones are extremely dangerous, and have been known to devour pets and small children."
"No, no, no, I made that last part up."
Uh...
I'm sorry.
"Ma'am, I..."
You're absolutely right.
This is not a venue for humor.
I...
I understand.
I-I apologize.
"You, too."
Do you need any help with the snakes?
I swear.
- They won't get over it.
- Who?
The others down there.
"Father Catolle, Mr Mayor."
"Most of all, those wives of theirs."
It'll kill them!
- And then there's Bertha
- Who's she?
Someone I thought of as queen of the village.
"But now, comparing her to you she's a cow."
"I like you a lot, Goubi."
Do you...
"Do you think the schoolkids will call me ""Mr Goubi""?"
"They'd better, or they'll cop it!"
But then there's the others.
The grown-ups.
They all know I'm an imbecile.
Even if I have a wife and a car I'll always be one.
It's true...
"Once the die is cast, that's it."
And then there's something else.
You're all that I think about.
I can't help it.
"One day, thinking about you too much... is going to make my head explode."
Because of you.
I'm used to people making fun of me.
"But they'll talk about YOU, because of ME and I'd hate that."
You'll have your own land and money in the bank...
So you'll never stop people talking behind your back.
The main thing is that they're silent when you turn around!
So you came to ask me permission to marry La Fleur.
So gossip girl most likely goes to or went to constance.
Yeah exactly. why else the focus?
"Well,i would also assume that she is our age."
The blasts all started when we were in the ninth grade.
An upperclassman simply wouldn't care.
"So you're saying gossip girl's a senior,like us?"
"Well,if she's a senior"
Then--then that means she's in the room right now.
So who could it be?
Rebecca sherman?
no her head's always in a book.
- She's not paying enough attention.
- Okay.
Not her either.
Then i submit nelly yuki.
Low profile
Good with computers...
Many grudges mostly against me.
No i have been with her way too many times
When gossip girl has sent out a blast.
There's no way it's her. i'm gonna speed this up.
What are you doing?
sending a tip to gossip girl.
"- Chuck,get the room quiet for me. - i'm way ahead of you."
If i could have everyone's attention please.
We'd like to thank you all for being here today.
Jonathan?
what?
Gossip girl is... a guy?
It's him. look.
What just happened?
What's going on?
- Who are you?
- We?
We're the modest employees of our respected police.
I'm the Major and Seryozha is Captain.
- What are you incriminating me for?
- What words you know!
You'll tell us yourself what we're incriminating you for.
You have no right to...
Call her in.
Sergeant?
Bring the victim in.
Do you recognise this man?
I do.
- Did he rape you perversely?
- Yes he did.
Tell us about it.
What shall I tell you?
What shall I repeat it for?
I was standing on the road waiting for a ride to the city.
A foreign car stopped.The door was opened.
- And?
- A man offered to give me a lift.
"The man was decent-looking, in an expensive suit."
So I got in.
We passed a few kilometres.
Then he turned off the road and raped me.
That's all.
You may go free.
You'll sign the protocol of identification later.
She was your Statute 153 and a straight road to the rooster house.
In a blink of an eye a rusty shank will be stuck in your hemorrhoidal ass...
What do you want of me?
I expect to be able to see the sea.
You can see the sea.
It's over there between the land and the sky.
I need a telescope to see that.
"Well, may I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea?"
Or preferably in it?
Right.
"Now, listen to me."
"I'm not satisfied, but I've decided to stay here."
"However, I shall expect a reduction."
"Why, because Krakatoa's not erupting at the moment?"
"Because the room is cold, the bath is too small, the view is invisible, and the radio doesn't work."
"No, the radio works."
You don't.
What?
"I'll see if I can fix it, you scabby old bat."
- I think we got something then.
- What?
I think we got something then!
What are you doing?
Qué?
"Madam, don't think me rude, but may I ask, do you by any chance have a hearing aid?"
A what?
A hearing aid!
"Yes, I do have a hearing aid."
Would you like me to get it mended?
!
Mended?
It's working perfectly all right.
"No, it isn't!"
I haven't got it turned on at the moment.
- Why not?
What's up?
I don't know.
Sounds kind of phony to me.
"Hello, is that you, Sam?"
Thompson.
"Say, uh, Sam, I just had a long-distance from Gargan."
"Yeah, he sounded kind of funny."
Is there anything wrong?
Is there anything wrong?
"Oh, not very much."
Only Gargan put a bullet into one of his monkeys.
What?
Sure.
"And from the dope I get, he's hiding out."
And they're trying to keep it quiet.
"But if the guy dies, you'll never see that deputy again."
Out of the state on business.
A conference with the governor.
Giving me orders.
"Why, that dirty, little crook."
"When I go to the penitentiary, I'll throw peanuts at him."
- What did he do?
- Nothing.
"He just put a bullet in somebody, that's all."
And he has the gall to--
Let me look at those accounts for the last two months.
We're going to make up for lost time.
You ain't on the level about me going back to that hospital again.
"- Yeah, get back there."
- But I've been there 40 times.
Forty more.
"After two weeks, they don't know if the guy will live or not."
We'll find a way.
Just as soon as he has the company making money again.
Wait a minute.
John!
"Oh, hello, my dear."
And Harold.
Nice to see you again.
"How are you, John?"
All I know is what my psychiatrist tells me.
He says you're entirely well.
And it's going to be wonderful to have you home.
"Isn't it, Harold?"
It's the best news I've heard in months.
"Well, all packed, I see."
"You know, I'm beginning to think that you never liked this place."
"It's not so bad after you get used to it, Doc."
But you say I'm all right now and my wife wants me home.
"Well, you take care of yourself."
"I don't want to see you back here again, except as a visitor."
"I'll see that he never comes back, Doctor."
"Shall we go, dear?"
"John, if you'll sign this we'll spring you."
"Anything you say, Warden."
That's a fine way to talk.
"Here, I'll take those."
"Oh, I forgot this."
"Well, I think that's everything."
"Mrs. Brown, I'm sorry."
"Your husband won't be able to go with you just now, after all."
I don't understand.
He is not able to leave here now.
But he's completely sane.
"A buddy, someone who cares."
Joey?
You ever have... your best friend...
stab you in the back?
Not since the army became my best friend.
You ever... suddenly feel that you're...
lost... that there's no place left for you to go?
I used to.
That was before the army became my home.
- Oh.
Really?
- Sure.
Think about it.
"The army feeds you, clothes you... gives you a place to sleep."
Every guy in khaki is family.
"Oh, that's... beautiful, Joey."
- The army is beautiful.
- To the army.
Max... you've got character.
- I wouldn't make this offer to just anybody.
- What kind of an offer?
What you need is an anchor... something that won't run out on you.
You know what I'm talking about?
The army.
[Chuckling] Hey.
"You're way ahead of me, Max."
Did you ever think about reenlisting?
Where do I sign?
"Okay, I got somethin' to tell ya... and I don't wanna hear so much as a titter, a snicker..."
- or a guffaw from anyone.
"- You hear that, Charles?"
The subject of this meeting is... the army.
Find anything?
I've been over the entire school twice.
No sulphur.
"No sulphur, no demon."
"No demon, no case."
I don't know.
Maybe I was wrong.
"Well, it happens to the best of us."
"I say we hit the road, huh?"
But after lunch.
It's sloppy-jo day.
"Good hustle, Colby!"
Walk it off!
"Hey, I need to copy of your algebra homework again."
Hey!
Why?
"'Cause you're a stupid, brain-dead dick?"
"I'm gonna shove my fist down your throat, you little freak."
- That fist?
- Yeah.
What happened?
How's the nonviolence assembly going?
"Apparently, shoving a kid's arm into a cuisine art is not a healthy display of anger."
"So, the kid had ectoplasm leaking out his ear?"
Which only comes from a seriously pissed-off spirit.
It's got to be ghost possession.
"Yeah, but that's pretty rare."
"Yeah, but it happens."
"I mean, they get angry enough, they can take control of a person's body."
"All right, so, what, we got a ghost in the building?"
"Yeah, but where?"
"I mean, there's no EMF."
- Don't worry.
- I just have to solve this quickly.
- How are you going to do that?
He's ten times sneakier than you.
What is going on between you two?
He's trying to frame me for something that he did.
What?
Did he... do anything to harm a person?
Is that what this blood is from?
Go home.
We never should have taken his money.
"It's all because of me, isn't it?"
I kept nagging about our loans and the lesson fees...
- All I talked about was money...
- Don't say that...
What family doesn't struggle with money?
If I didn't scare you with my words...
You would have cut that Park Seon Woo out of your life earlier.
But I didn't know anything.
I just got excited when I saw money.
This is all because of me...
We're a family.
Why do we have to throw blame around?
Don't worry.
Just go home.
Justice will prevail.
Remember that.
"You can come home by tomorrow morning, right?"
It's Soo Bin's birthday...
We should blow out the candles together.
Then of course I will.
"Hey, let me go!"
I'll have to get you a wedding present.
"Oh, no, no, please."
You don't have to do that.
"So, you're a sophomore?"
Yeah.
Are you a freshman somewhere?
"No, I'm a senior."
In high school.
I'll be going to college next year.
I hope.
Great.
You're gonna love it.
I love it.
Great.
"So, do you, like, have a boyfriend or anything?"
No.
"I went out with this guy recently, but he's a jock."
You know how jocks are.
"It was just, you know, a physical thing, I guess."
"For him, anyway."
"Actually, I don't really know how that is."
"I've only really dated Ricky and a couple of other guys, but no jocks."
"Well, I mean, Ricky is a jock, right?"
He's an amazing baseball player.
Or did he give that up?
"Yeah, I guess he did give it up."
"Oh, man, he was playing for this team one summer and they were going to nationals and he had a no-hit season going."
It was unprecedented.
His name is probably on some plaque or something.
And then he drew a bunch of body parts on the bases.
"Like first base for first base, second base for second..."
"Yeah, I get it."
"Come on, get out."
Quickly.
Be as quiet as possible.
What a surprise!
I studied in Fuente Nueva as well.
I wasn't there for long.
I studied for one semester and...
Padre Julio!
"Come on, señora, I think one of the men is dying."
Hurry up!
I was about to change the bandage when I noticed he was unconscious.
- Probably internal bleedings.
- Yes.
"- Padre Miguel, I want to tell you something."
- We must operate immediately.
Prepare everything.
"Nurse, I think there's enough plasma left."
"Yes, I'll go and get it, Padre."
Come on.
You ungodly lot!
How dare you threaten me with guns in the house of the Lord?
You're protecting rebels in the name of your Lord.
How many?
We're not protecting them.
They turned up out of the blue.
Some were injured.
What else could we do?
They carry guns like you.
You'd better be sensible.
"Being a priest, I'm sure you detest lies."
Where are the rebels' guards positioned?
You must promise not to kill them.
- Oh.
Mm.
Jules... is this hug a display of affection or are you just drinking wine?
[ Mouth full ] 'Splay of 'fection.
Adam is not lame.
He may not be tall and good-looking like Pete...
Mm-hmm.
You got that right.
"But-- but he's deep, interesting, and he's tired of cool guy idiots acting like he's inferior."
"If Adam had a fair shot, Kim would've seen his substance and known he's the better guy."
"Oh, so Pete isn't smart and has no substance because he's cool?"
- Well said.
I agree.
- That is so unfair!
"Cool guys can be deep, too."
"You know, you cut them, they bleed."
"And if you call them dumb, they hurt."
"But then they put on a tank top, and everything's okay, so..."
Uncool guys do not have a monopoly over feelings.
"- Hey, where you guys going?"
- Out to the party.
We settled the Kim thing on our own.
We're good.
"Also, this got weird when it became about the two of you."
Later.
About us?
[ Chuckles ]
- What are they talking about?
- No idea.
They're weird.
Totally.
Totally.
Good thing we have A truck and we drive.
But now captain kris kelly.
Has secured a deal To mine 80-miles inland.
Through alaskan bat country On the kougarok river.
This day's gonna be A good day.
I got a buddy that says He's gonna put us on a claim.
That's for sure good gold.
"But, like, it's a little bit Off the beaten path."
Because there's no Easy gold left out there.
River mining will be A new experience for the Kellys.
"Well, We're almost here."
And the first challenge...
Getting to the river.
That's where We are on this road.
Where's the claim?
The claim is right here.
You see these Little strips here?
- Those are roads.
- I'm pretty sure they're roads.
- Me.
- Man.
My buddy said That we're gonna find.
A trail already marked And it's how he gets there.
"What's the marked the trail, What's it say?"
It doesn't say anything.
It's just a trail in the middle.
Of nowhere on the side Of the road in about this area.
"How's it marked, though?"
It's not marked.
It's just a trail.
You said it was just marked.
A marked trail.
Do you know anything about this?
Yes.
I know all about it.
"You could say I killed him, I suppose."
"If he'd never met me, he might still be alive."
He was the most hated man on earth.
But he could have been one of the great men of the world.
He had a big mind.
When they talk about him they'll be talking about a giant.
A genius.
Some people called him an evil genius.
Go on.
He lifted me out of the gutter.
He made me somebody.
He was the only man I ever loved.
I was only really happy when I was with him.
Could you tell us anything about his activities?
Well...
He started his career only a few years ago in Europe.
It doesn't seem possible.
He could have accomplished so much... in such a short time.
Clementi.
"Well, aren't you going to ask me in?"
What are you staring at?
Is this the way a man greets his own brother?
They told me you had died in that concentration camp.
Who told you that?
Everyone who came back.
So I came back from the dead.
Where's mother?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
- Who wants him dead?
- No questions.
Take it or leave it.
- 1 .5 million.
- Seems high.
This is my last hatchetjob.
"All right, it's a deal."
Money's no object.
These guns are clean.
No serial numbers.
Untraceable.
Explosive head bullets.
Your favorite.
"Easy to pick up, hard to put down."
Want to change your mind?
Why take thisjob?
Ifshe doesn't have a cornea transplant soon... she might lose her sight forever.
There's a cornea bank in Hong Kong... but it's always empty.
"When a donation does come in, someone else gets it first."
So we're going to try abroad.
I have to leave you for a few days.
"When I return, I'll take you overseas for surgery."
"You will come back, right?"
I promise.
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.
Many VIPs and government officials will attend the opening ceremony.
You are assigned to protect them.
Their information is in your files.
Make sure you're extra alert!
"Yes, sir!"
"Tony Weng, we're protecting that scum."
Attention please!
-The power of Christ compels you.
He brought you low by his blood-stained cross!
"Do not despise my command, because you know me to be a sinner."
It is God himself who commands you.
The majestic Christ who commands you.
"God, the Father, commands you."
"God, the Son, commands you."
"God, the Holy Spirit, commands you."
The mystery of the cross commands you.
The blood of the martyrs commands you.
"Give way to Christ, you prince of murderers."
You're guilty before almighty God.
Guilty before his son.
Guilty before the whole human race.
"It is the Lord who expels you he who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world, by fire."
Are you tired?
Let's rest before we start again.
Why this girl?
It doesn't make sense.
I think the point is to make us despair.
To see ourselves as animal and ugly.
To reject the possibility that God could love us.
"Will you excuse me, Damien?"
Why?
Why?
No.
No.
"Dimmy, why you do this to me?"
"Please, Dimmy."
I'm afraid.
You're not my mother.
"Dimmy, please!"
He's stepping out on you already?
I'm gonna kill him.
That's the point.
There's nothing to step out on.
"Oh, good."
"Not yet, anyway."
Not yet?
!
"Look, I know you don't like him, but he's the first guy in a long time that I actually have fun with."
Fun?
"Honey, trust me."
Fun doesn't last.
My third wife-- a barrel of monkeys.
"Dad, it's more than that."
It's like I feel like there's a connection.
"Oh, dear God."
"I'm not saying I know what it is, but I'd like to keep just seeing him and find out."
"What's to find out, honey?"
"He's brash, he's rude..."
He's rude?
You called him an idiot.
And Roberta.
"Sweetheart, sometimes I just get worked up, because I care about you so much."
"I know you do, Dad."
Will you do me a favor?
"When this magazine comes out and you get all these offers, will you just test the waters a little bit before you settle on..."
Roberta?
"Well, my dad's talking to me again."
That's great.
He must be happy you're still going to be on that Ten Most Eligible list.
"Yeah, about that."
I'm not gonna be on that list.
He was so worried about losing more hair with chemo treatments I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men just to put his mind at ease?
- You did that?
- Yeah!
"- Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy."
- Wait!
You can't say anything.
- Why not?
- Because he'll know I told you.
"Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for nothing."
So because you're getting free parking I gotta pretend this guy had cancer?
Yeah.
"Well, I don't like it."
I don't like it one bit.
And I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Maintain the same disposition.
You can't act any differently.
You have to be nice.
- Why didn't he tell me?
- Because you were being so nice.
- I don't think I could be that nice.
- You be nice!
Gary?
What do you think?
Check it out.
- Is that from my gift certificate?
"- Yeah, buddy."
You came through.
You've been so nice.
"Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage."
Yeah.
"Hey, know what I'm thinking of doing?"
I'm getting rid of all my fillings because that mercury's toxic.
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
And you to me.
You are.
Oh.
What?
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
I've -
- I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
I have to go.
"Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"If you do engage in a lot of foreplay so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina and if you are putting your behind on a pillow so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier,"
"the more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
"What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina, because this way, you have some control over how fast you have to go..."
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
I'll tell you what -- if the two of you love each other --
You going somewhere?
"Uh, my mom's."
Oh.
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
And second of all?
"Oh, I didn't have a second of all."
"I was hoping ""second of all"" would make me feel better."
Second of all I can't stop thinking about you either.
[ANNA LAUGHS]
He's totally leaving his wife for me.
That's crazy.
That's crazy.
We hardly know each other.
I don't know.
"I mean, look at Becca."
"You know, my sister's friend."
"One guy waits on her at Bennigan's and by the end of the meal, they both knew they had found the one."
You're right.
You're totally right.
"I mean, it could happen, right?"
Not for me.
What about texter?
Texter has yet to make verbal contact.
"I mean, this guy could've had surgery, leaving him without a voice box breathing through a stoma and I would never know because I've never actually heard his voice."
"Well, I doubt he has a stoma."
MARY:
That's not the point.
I can't text.
"You know, I'm not charming via text."
ANNA:
Maybe you should just stop texting.
"But it's not just texting, it's e-mail."
It's voicemail.
It's snail mail.
That's regular mail.
Whatever.
I started imagining the future.
I felt everything fell apart.
As Clara was talking...
I felt more afraid.
"Without noticing, I repeated several times:"
"""I won't know how to live alone""."
One of them got Clara mad.
And she said:
"""You've always lived alone!"""
That I should be used to it already.
That even in those moments I was incapable of saying that I couldn't live without her.
That I only thought of myself.
You didn't think of me?
We'll talk about you later.
And what did you two say about me?
I remember telling Clara that I wanted to see you more often.
We discussed some issues concerning you.
And why didn't you ask me?
You were too little.
How long ago?
Two years?
More.
Three?
Would had you preferred to live with me?
No.
Then we decided right.
Yes.
"Not long ago, a girl wrote a letter to Max."
But then she broke it.
You tell me why.
If you interrupt me I lose the inspiration.
The letter said:
Remember when you made me do chin-ups in the jib crane?
I bloody well did.
-Let's try it again.
Remember how you used to force me into the garbage can?
"Come back, I feel dizzy."
It'll be great to fall down once my muscles get tired.
It'll be such a relief.
How many can you do these days?
Twenty?
I don't feel like jumping anymore.
I want down.
"I'll do a few more, I feel so great."
You ruined my show.
He's coming.
You've been named firefighter of the year.
Irma did this at the factory.
-It's called The Flame Man.
"It's fireproof and you can take it anywhere, even the sauna."
"Come on, guys..."
Guys?
What's wrong?
-Nothing.
Where's Viljanen?
Dear colleagues...
Representatives of the TV...
Distinguished Governor...
I thank you on behalf of the fire brigade.
Let's hope that this publicity will bring us more funds.
Viljanen!
Here.
The costume is a gift from his colleagues.
"Congratulations, firefighter of the year:"
"It just contains pertinent medical data, family histories, you know, stuff like that."
Everything but a mix tape.
How would you characterize your marriage?
Perfect.
Fantastic.
"Well, let's start with something easy, then."
What's your favorite thing about your partner?
Uh...
She's a good mom.
He really is a great dad.
And where did you meet?
School.
High school.
High school.
Yeah.
She was a cheerleader
- I was on the football team.
Fullback.
"I coach now, but I used to play."
And we had...
We actually had our daughter...
We...
"On prom night, we conceived Lacey and it was a little confusing at the time, but it's been a blessing."
It's been the best thing that's ever happened to us.
It's been the best thing that ever happened to us.
We did the right thing.
How often do you have sex?
"She wants me to be tougher, screw harder."
"Work less, but bring home more."
I can't keep this shit straight.
"All I know is, whatever I do, it's not good enough."
Mmm.
Tell Ruth Hedeby that the case is wide open.
We're not closing anything.
"Call those who've taken time off, back in."
The resources will be there when management sees what I've just seen.
- They didn't find anything in Jutland.
- Then send the men out again.
"Ask the local police to keep searching for Emilie, and coordinate it with Lund."
Give them all the help they need.
Call the Zeuthens in for an urgent briefing.
Asbjorn is asking for reinforcements.
They've traced the perpetrator.
"Asbjorn, what's happening?"
Lund and Borch have tracked him down.
We're on our way there.
It didn't sound good.
They're not in control.
- What's the problem?
- Apparently they're trapped inside.
"I don't know what happened, but we're on our way."
Yes?
What's up?
"Push the book under the door, then I'll spare you."
He wants the book.
Give that to me.
"Listen, we don't have that book."
People are on their way here.
Turn the damn car engine off.
Do you hear me?
Hello?
Hello!
"No, you do it."
"You do it, and then get me out."
But you've got an off switch.
Do you have any idea how terrible that is?
"I know, i didn't say i was proud."
"You wanted to know, so i'm telling you."
Why did i stay?
What did you do to me?
"You just kept wanting to find dylan, look for dylan."
"I couldn't get past it, couldn't make any progress,"
"And then one day, it occurs to me."
"What if... instead of trying to fight your memories,"
"I make you someone else,"
Let the core al work against itself.
"The nightmares... my core al, trying to reconcile conflicting data."
It's a subconscious do-Loop.
We've all got them.
"It's a stroke of genius, really."
It makes you more human.
But you have no right to turn me into something-
Someone i'm not.
I know.
I just... i just wanted rommie back.
I just wanted my old life back.
"Well, argent knows whereandromedais,"
And i want to go there.
He says dylan is there.
"No way, uh-Uh."
"You, dylan, and theandromedatogether?"
Bad idea.
"But you'd like that, yes?"
"To see your old ship, your friends."
Do i sound like i'd like it?
"Tempting, but no thanks."
I...
I can't hear you.
I'm in a train.
"Okay, have a nice bike ride."
Whoa.
Ramon just threw a rock at me.
We're still friends.
What kind of God would put a chocolate fountain on a train and not let kids near it?
!
Yeah!
"Learn how to build a train, God!"
"Well... the chocolate fountain is impressive, but the real supply's all the way up front."
"What do you mean, ""The real supply?"""
There's way more chocolate up in the kitchen.
I've seen them load boxes and boxes of it in there.
"Well, then, are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?"
That I need a bath?
"Oh, yeah."
You do.
No.
We break out of here and steal the chocolate from the front of the train!
I'd do that.
I'm in.
Great!
The Belcher kids ride again!
For the first time!
And Rudy!
Is there.
"Okay, if we're gonna rob this train, we need to take it step by step."
"Luckily, Rudy has been trapped in this caboose for the last nine weekends doing some serious recon."
I see everything out this window.
"Once, a skunk got on the train for a little bit and then it got off and I was the only one to notice."
# Someone who wants to be like family # We welcome anyone with open arms
# Join our circus troupe
# Looking for a new circus performer
"Well, we didn't need to go through a lengthy interview."
"Anyway, we need one more."
Darling!
"I have no parents, no job, no home, no money, no education, no skills."
All I have is a disease.
And everyone ignores me.
My fiancé even dumped me.
I'm so sorry.
But I tried hard to survive.
For her.
"No, for this country and society!"
To be a helpful person.
Like Wonder Woman!
Wonder Woman?
She's my only friend and idol.
"She must be pretty, right?"
All men are only crazy about pretty girls.
I wish all pretty things would die.
Even the fishes in the river would run away from your ugly face.
"You die instead, you wench."
Hello?
I can't tell you right now.
I'll explain when we meet later.
"Well, I caught a big fish this time."
"I know you don't believe me, but this is a really big catch."
"No, I'm not playing games."
Shut up!
Tell me where you are!
Damn it.
So...
So...
How do I get my money back?
What do you mean get your money back?
"- My 40,000 euros."
The judge has to give them back.
You told me so.
Wait.
Why do you think you were freed from jail?
The workings of the Holy Spirit?
Do you think the affidavit from the casino appeared by magic?
Wait... you used my money?
But... what did you want?
You wanted me to use mine?
- What's left?
- Nothing.
Do you know how many signatures are needed to get someone out of jail?
"Between the clerk, the judge, the guards... 40,000 euros goes quickly."
This money wasn't mine!
The guys who entrusted me with it will kill me!
"Tell them that the cops took it, that's it."
"40,000 euros in cash..."
I don't know many who could resist.
"These guys will never believe me, they'll rip my head off..."
"Mr Zeppini, you are free."
That's the most important thing.
"And if you need me, you know where to find me."
"Good luck, Mr Zeppini."
Shit!
That's enough.
I'm losing my concentration.
"See, this is our sesame."
- Yes.
Keep up the good work.
Boy-O.
"- What's up, Felix?"
- Nothing's up.
- You should make a move.
- On Gemma?
"End of term, mate, anything goes."
"That's not true, actually."
"Certain things definitely do not ""go."""
No matter how much you may want them to.
It's just a matter of confidence.
And this is an area where I may be able to help you out.
I'm so horny.
"Come on, let's do it dirty, any way you like."
"- Hi, Gemma."
"- Hiya, Felix."
- Can I have a word?
- Okay.
"I mean, obviously, you're out of my league, but I thought I'd ask just for clarification purposes."
Ask what?
If you'd like to go out with me sometime for something like a coffee or a film?
Sit.
Paul.
I don't think of you in the same way as you suspected.
But I'm sure there's someone out there who does.
You just have to be brave and keep looking.
"Okay, great, thanks."
"Seriously, you're very sweet and polite."
Unlike certain people I know.
So why do you go out with him?
"Truth or Dare, everyone."
"- Come on, don't start again now."
"- Yeah, yeah."
Hidalgo!
Put him on the bed.
"Look, a message."
- He was one of us?
- Nonsense.
He's particularly bad.
- He demands a lot of money for this.
"- So, what does it say?"
They're going to let us escape tomorrow.
And you're probably the reason why.
That's insane!
"They would let us rot and die in here, but as soon as one of the Great Leopard's men turns up, everything's sorted."
- Of course.
They're afraid that I might talk.
- Would you do that?
I haven't talked yet.
But it's not impossible.
I'm a mercenary.
I fight for money... not for my homeland.
"Padre Julio, what have you got for us?"
- Look what he's brought me!
"- Help me unload the truck, children."
I want something too!
You mustn't put yourself at risk by driving around just so we have something to eat.
"Who else is supposed to do it, then?"
- Have you found out anything?
- Carrasco and his men destroyed a bridge.
The supplies for the troops have been held up.
"Oh, and..."
I didn't need this.
"By saving all these children, do you want to be a hero?"
I'm not doing this for the people.
I'm doing it for myself.
The happiness I saw in her smile...
"If there is so much kick in one smile, think about the kick in millions of such smiles."
I want that kick.
I want that kick.
The kick started from a child's smile.
It won't stop.
"Nowadays, people want to be happy even on someone else's sorrows."
He looks for happiness in others' happiness.
He is not giving any suggestions.
He is not fighting against the system.
He never orders anyone to do something.
He does what he wants to do.
He is not saving those children.
He is showing us the kick in saving others.
Which father will get such a great son?
I get lot of kick.
"Till now, I wanted to see what he will become."
He has now become a thief.
He has become a true human.
What if he gets caught?
There is truth in his efforts.
Nothing will happen to him.
He will not get caught until he completes his job.
Where is he now?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
"When did you come, boss?"
How are you?
What?
- How are classes going?
- Tough.
Physics.
"- Oh, physics is tough."
"- It's not the work, it's the students."
"A student, to be exact."
- My back.
Personal growth is so painful.
"- My son, doing manual labor?"
I never thought I'd live to see the day.
"Hey, Mom."
Check out this ironic twist of events.
"- Ryan is now a science nerd, I'm working a blue-collar job."
"- That's nice, honey."
- Mom?
"- Oh, Seth, don't worry."
"Your grandfather's situation is very serious, but your father and I are handling it."
Right.
Grandpa.
"To tell you the truth, I haven't even like... um..."
"- .. slept well the past couple nights, so concerned have I been for his well-being."
- But everything is going to be okay?
Right.
- Right?
- Right.
"And what, if Grandpa, like, he did have to go to some white-collar prison with tennis and TiVo, then...?"
"- Don't worry, Seth, it won't affect you."
- He wouldn't lose the company?
- No.
- What about the house?
- Son.
That's crazy talk.
Won't you send me off with a kiss?
- Here?
!
No.
Here.
Bye.
Deepa.
Say hello to my father-in-law!
Severe head injury.
But now he is alright.
Since he is under heavy medications
It may take a few days for him to gain consciousness.
Let him stay in the hospital till then.
He will recover soon.
"Thanks, doctor."
At what age did your son lose his eyesight?
When he was 15.
All of a sudden he had a high fever.
It continued for 2 weeks.
He started losing his vision slowly.
Doctors diagnosed him with...
"Retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease."
But none of those treatments helped.
We checked his eyes now
His retina is responding to light.
The ophthalmologist will be visiting tomorrow.
Let's see what he has to say.
Varun has light perception.
Surgery may help him get his vision back.
So...
"- There's nothing to think about, doctor."
If Varun can get his sight back...
"""This is fun."
Do it anyways.
"They'll figure out how to save you."""
It just gets quieter and quieter.
Pretty soon I won't be able to hear it at all.
"But before it dies, I want to say good-bye to it the right way."
We'll give it the best send-off any crazy voice could ever ask for.
I'd do it for mine.
"...and then, right around the time I was starting to walk, there was some kind of..."
Ah...
I don't know.
Let's stop.
I want to stop.
"Honey, please, keep going."
You can't stop now.
"No, I don't want to."
We've been sitting here for five hours.
"Why are we doing this, anyway?"
"Francis, please."
I think we're really close.
Just one more time.
Well...
I kind of remember that Frisbee game we used to play...
"Okay, honey."
Maybe we'll eat later.
"Lois, did you see what he did in there?"
He used my tennis racket to smash my camera and all my lenses to bits!
I still had film in it from the Us Festival!
Where is he?
"Hal, it's not his fault!"
I'm pretty sure he's working through a limitation-anxiety phase.
All the literature says this is the age where he's trying...
Hands down.
absolutely not.
hello.
Sing it!
Sing it!
There it is.
The crown jewel.
"AII right then, lads, tourists for the day."
"Get in, NiaII."
Ghetto.
Can we do one of those pictures where you go like that?
How do you do that?
Where you stand like this?
"Like, touching the top."
-How do you do that?
-You have to get down.
Is it working?
Looks like you're holding it up.
We're back now.
Start of the European leg of the tour.
Do you know what I'm thinking?
We need to try one of them local delicacy things from every place.
And here's the frog legs and snail stuff.
Are you down?
I'm not down for snails.
I think we should try it in every place.
Just try a delicacy from somewhere.
I've tried frogs but that's still not that weird.
"Like, snails is probably a bit disgusting."
"We've never toured Europe before so because this is the first time we've done it, it feels like an adventure because a different country every day, it feels like we're on Euro rip."
We're in D0sseIdorf.
Germany!
- Yes.
My goodness.
I hope you have friends here.
"Well, there's Tom who takes care of the lighthouse and the ferry comes every other Monday with our supplies."
- That's all?
- Yes.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
What do you do if there's an emergency?
"There's a radio transmitter at Tom's cottage, but that's really more to do with the lighthouse."
It seems a terribly lonely place to live.
"Well, you see, David and I had a motor accident on the day we were married."
That's how he lost his legs.
He was training to be a fighter pilot.
And then after the accident he...
"Well, we both wanted to run away, so we came here."
It seemed like a good idea.
It might have been a mistake.
You can't blame him for wanting to run away.
"No, I don't."
It's terribly sad.
"No, it was our fault completely."
We'd had a bit to drink and we were driving much too fast...
- Suddenly there was this lorry...
"No, no."
Haven't the leisure.
"Oh, dear me."
And here I thought...
- I'm glad to see you're not really hurt.
"- But I am, doctor."
- Really.
- Maybe I better send you to the hospital?
If you want to keep fit in this weather.
"Don't worry, I will."
Bye-bye.
Ah-choo!
"He's always been a poor one, Mr. herriot."
He never seems to put on no flesh.
- Which field was he in?
In the orchard for a few hours.
That's a thriving cough you've got there.
You're right there.
I'm sure I've got bronchitis.
"I'd watch it, if I were you."
Was there any fruit in the orchard?
"Aye, we had a greatly crop-- orchard is full."
"- That's it, then."
That fruit's brought his digestion to a complete standstill.
"Bogged up, is he?"
- Uh-huh.
A good dose of linseed oil will soon shift him.
"No, we're going to have to open him up, I'm afraid."
It's a very serious condition.
And we're going to have to operate here.
Anyone around who can lend a hand?
"Aye, if you're set on it."
But I still think a good dose of oil will put him to rights.
It'll be a lot easier.
I'm sorry.
The condition's far too advanced.
I've got to shift that fruit immediately.
"Thou knows best, I suppose."
"Hang on then, veterinary."
I'll get old George down at village.
All right.
Welcome!
Would you like to go inside?
All right.
Bring us a bowl of hot soup and a bottle of rice wine.
You got it!
One bowl of hot soup!
All right!
Rice cakes?
It's a grand opening cake.
I hope you'll visit us often.
You're so nice.
And you're pretty too.
"Oh my, I'm blushing!"
I haven't been complimented on my looks since my teen years.
"I know you're just being nice, but you made my day."
"The papers fell down, your blouse dropped, the captain said to hang it."
- What's the matter with your mouth?
- Personal secret.
Never lets go of it.
"Six-two and even, he swallows it, his senior sorority pin."
"I peeked at your papers, and he rescued them."
You went through my papers?
The war's over.
Where are we going and why?
We don't like secrets.
Thank you. I should have known better than try to hold back f rom men who have operated the way you have behind enemy lines.
I wanted Gen. Steele to see your f aces when you heard.
Cold Steele?
It's his doing that your recommendation passed.
- Johnny's congressional?
- Congressional?
Either your informant is bad or someone's taking the mickey.
Now can you tell me who gave you this shitty tip?
You'd better cross your fingers he's forgotten your face.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Hello?
Now?
I'm coming.
I have to go.
What about the debriefing on the whores?
Start without me.
And be ready.
We're doing it again tonight.
Where are you taking me?
Nowhere.
The road ends here.
You didn't realise it was a trap?
I give you information about the squat and you charge straight in.
"I saw you leaving the hotel, you and your guys."
Someone from your team has enquired several times about this case.
Who the fuck are you protecting?
Don't say anything.
"I've got the dealer, the bullet."
It's easy to follow the story.
Get lost.
We both made a mistake.
There's nothing left to say.
Even in 15 years.
Fuck.
Yes.
This is Arnaud Ledoré.
The judge is going to search the mayor's home tomorrow morning.
"The documents he's looking for are in a safe, and the key is in the left drawer of the desk."
"- How are you, old Yannis?"
"Thank God, I'm all right."
You?
So am I.
How's Pavlos?
A good question!
He's been very sad ever since your breakup.
At first he used to come here every night and sit alone and miserable at this very table.
Every night!
Getting drunk...
Don't you see him anymore?
- What's his life like nowadays?
- He lives in poverty.
I pleaded he painted more moons on my walls to no avail...
Let it go!
He has this fixation with painting in the penthouse.
- Day and night!
"- So, he works?"
Yes but what's the point?
Who buys paintings these days?
- Perhaps someone now at the exhibition.
- What exhibition?
He is exhibiting his work at a gallery for a week now.
"It's in the papers, didn't you know?"
"No, I didn't."
"I'll go buy a framed picture for the tavern to aid the poor guy, cause... he's in dire straits!"
I can tell you that he's starving.
"No other way of helping him, proud as he is, you know him, Aliki."
"Yes, I know."
"I looked thoroughly, Aliki."
No bracelet.
I'm sorry.
"You know, I have a friend he's been an honest man all his life but it didn't get him anywhere."
So he decided to join forces with the devil.
He said that the devil would watch over him and protect him.
And what happened to him?
"Oh, he's very rich, very prosperous now."
But is he happy?
Supremely.
The race just isn't even when we're born.
Some people a head start.
All you have to do is run a little faster than the next fellow.
With the devil at your side.
Please have your luggage ready for customs inspection.
"Oh, ""S"" is over there."
I didn't get your name.
Clementi Sabourin.
Have my card.
I'm Wilson of Wilson Oil of Canada.
Thank you.
Look me up.
I'll do that.
Please have your luggage ready for customs inspection.
"Check, please, sir."
"Uh, officer."
"Yes, sir?"
I seem to have lost my wallet.
When did you last have it?
I'm sure I had it when I was standing here in line.
Was there anyone near you?
There was a man standing there?
Which direction did he go?
"I think he went out that way, but..."
I'm not sure that he took it.
I did for a good reason.
But it has gone wrong.
Let Manoj's deal get finished.
I'll give your fair share.
"Only if we are united, we can cheat others."
"If we cheat amongst ourselves, we will not prosper."
Got it?
Don't share this with uncle.
I'll draft a plan for Manoj and let you know.
Let's go to the hospital and then leave.
"In the route from Kanyakumari to Nagercoil, these 3 trees are our mark."
You wait here.
I'll give a missed call while I come close...
You set a scarecrow looking like a human in the middle of the road.
"I'll hit the scarecrow, and act as though I'd hit a man."
Then you have to lie on the road like a dead man.
Definitely he will get scared.
He will try to run away from the spot.
"Then you clear the spot, and leave the place."
The plan is perfect.
"Hey, please..."
"Ashwini, what happened?"
!
What happened?
Tell me!
Ashwini!
What happened?
Where are you?
"Ashwini, where are you?"
Ashwini!
"Ashwini, what happened?"
"He's dead, Manoj."
"The only thing left, is forced execution."
"I heard, from Shi Yoon..."
That what you say or what you do...
Not of it is genuine.
And that it's all part of a mission.
"All I want to do is tell you the truth, Mother."
"If you do this, you will be kicked out without compensation."
Don't listen to anything Shi Yoon says.
He said that he will be the shadow who protects this neighborhood.
"But in reality, nothing will change."
"You, as well as Shi Yoon... will lose this fight."
This is... a fight that you can't win.
Do you think so?
"Wow, this guy is really getting on my nerves."
"Why don't you stop, and turn yourselves in?"
Wow...
Here you are...
I learned from you too.
"You can't say you have nothing to do with Park Seon Woo, can you?"
"- Sir, we'll go first."
"- Sir, congratulations!"
"- Oh, sure."
Go ahead!
- Yes.
"Good work, and thank you."
"We will win, no matter what."
That's right.
Let's go.
[Neighborhood Hero]
"If we just catch Park Seon Woo, we can catch the rest of them easily."
Yong Moon Plan.
"You're operating this company, correct?"
Her dad will give them both a lift in I imagine.
"Now, I've actually got some herbal tea here, if you prefer."
-Lemon and ginger?
"-Actually, yes, I will."
Thanks.
And... that was all very lovely tonight.
"Thank you, very much."
It's no problem.
This morning's teacup.
You must be feeling better.
And a whole basket of laundry still waiting to go in.
-You'll be running out of sheets.
-Do you mind?
Thanks.
Yeah.
And I know that Julie's really appreciated you being around these last couple of weeks.
"-I think there's quite a lot of you in her, actually."
"-Oh, dear."
The poor girl.
"No, it's...."
"What I was trying to say earlier on that... now I feel, I suppose, released in a way."
From Phillipa.
It's....
"This is gonna sound so callous, calculated, it's not meant to be."
I know.
It's very hard sometimes.
"You know, when you just wake up one day... and suddenly find you have feelings for someone you never even knew were there."
"You don't plan it or legislate for it, it's just...."
"-Oh, God."
-Do you know what I mean?
I think I do.
"You do, don't you, Alice?"
"Well, I'm not beat, you understand?"
I'm just a little more respectful.
But I am thirsty.
"Thanks a lot, anyway."
Now wait a minute!
"You know, I saw a man do that one time down in Mexico."
He come on a great big water hole about an hour later.
"All that sweet water, he didn't have nothing to carry it away in."
Like to see a man with a nice even disposition.
Come on.
I've tracked you for six weeks through this country.
You know it just like the back of your own hand.
Where are we gonna find water?
"Maybe the, maybe the Times' place."
They never have run dry there.
Or so I'm told.
But you're gonna give out before we get there.
Tyree.
You don't figure I did this.
Possible.
Hasn't been dead half a day.
"Well, what about Silmser?"
You don't think I stabbed him in the back and did this to him.
Let's bury him.
I asked you a question!
Did you murder a man in Texas?
"I did kill a man, but that was long ago and far away and he had a gun in his hand."
"Now, will you take these chains off?"
"Yeah, there was a girl here, too."
She's gone.
They probably took her.
They?
"If you disagree, I'll file an emergency appeal."
We'll drag this thing out forever.
We can talk about it all day if you want.
"Okay, okay."
Okay.
Okay.
Get Mr. Corey in here.
Your Honor... we respectfully ask for time to consider filing a motion to preclude this testimony.
I respectfully deny your request.
Get Mr. Corey in here.
Now!
So I got to put my ass in the hot seat now?
- He has nothing.
- [click]
Really?
"You sure of that, huh, Donald?"
I am.
What if he does have something?
- [click]
- Huh?
You know what I suggest?
I'd suggest we give these fuckers
$10 million and get this over with now.
"Try not to be stupid, Wendell."
Lord knows you're capable of it.
And don't go weak on me after all I've done for you.
[scoff] Donald--
After all you've done for me.
- [clicking]
- You condescending asshole.
How about the nearly billion dollars in fees we've paid you over the years?
"When you illegally tested and developed items to get a jump on the market,"
we'll have to leave town.
What's gonna happen if Flo leaves town and closes her station?
"- Without gas, we're done for!"
- What?
Don't you think the car responsible should fix our road?
The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al!
"Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago."
"Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon?"
"Oh, he can do it."
He's got the horsepower.
"So, what do you want him to do?"
Fix the road!
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!
Order in the court!
Seems like my mind has been changed for me.
- Yeah!
- No!
Nice ruling.
"Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner."
"That's OK, Stickers."
You can take Bessie.
"Man, you get to work with Bessie!"
I'd give my left two lug nuts for somethin' like that.
Bessie?
Who's Bessie?
"This here is Bessie, finest road-pavin' machine ever built."
I'm hereby sentencing you to community service.
You're gonna fix the road under my supervision.
What?
This place is crazy!
"I know this may be a bad time right now, but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees."
I gotta find my camera.
It can wait.
Those pictures are important!
"I need to do another round of irrigation on your burn before I can dress it, then I'll clean the stitches up."
"No, listen!"
"That building is toxic, OK?"
I didn't risk my life in there so the cops could say I was getting my rocks off.
"- If you knew it was so dangerous, why did you..."
- It's my job.
It's what I do.
And what's that?
Urban explorer and environmental activist.
Nice.
Go to school for that?
"I started climbing buildings, taking pictures, posting them online, whatever."
"Then I started hacking into these abandoned factories, saw all this toxic crap, right?"
So
I started taking pictures and posting them to hold the owners responsible.
- You ever think about the risk?
- It comes with the territory.
"To others, I mean."
The risk to others.
"No, these places are empty."
It's just me and the bats.
Not this time.
Clear.
300.
Clear.
One more time.
Charge to 300.
Clear.
"Time of death, 8:37 PM."
Ma?
Jesus.
This won't be easy for any of us.
But I want you to know that we're here today because we care about you.
"-What was this, your idea?"
-All we ask is that you listen.
"Adriana, you want to begin?"
"""Christopher, I love you very much."
"""My only dream is that we have a happy life together."
"""The last few months, things have got very bad with us..."
"""because of you using drugs all the time."
"-""You're high all the time and I can't take it."""
"-Be specific, hon."
"""When we first started going out, we made love all the time."
"-""Now, because of the drugs..."""
"-Jesus, is this fucking necessary?"
Go ahead.
"""...you can no longer function as a man."
"""Last week when I came home to learn that you had killed our dog..."
"""that was the final straw."""
You killed the dog?
What'd you do that for?
-It was an accident.
-Was it barking?
He sat on her while he was high.
-Jesus Christ.
-I fell asleep.
She got suffocated or something.
"Are you done, Adriana?"
You killed little Cosette?
"I ought to suffocate you, you little prick!"
"Tony, we're going in order."
Welcome to Scabland.
"It was disgusting, but beautifully photographed."
- It was supposed to be disgusting.
- I'm sure it was.
"Mom, all this stuff."
Excuse me.
"All of this equipment, it can't be here."
We won't leave all of this equipment here for everybody to trip over.
We are not cretins.
She's handling it.
"Right, Mom, you are handling it?"
- This lighting sucks.
- Can we do something about the lighting?
"I don't think so, ma'am."
I don't know.
"It's a community college, we'll have to cope."
Think documentary.
"Mom, please."
People will be showing up here soon.
"Lorelai, I'm perfectly capable of handling this."
No one will be inconvenienced.
Okay.
I'm just gonna let everyone deal with all of this... because I need to relax and get a cup of coffee... and maybe hammer a nail into my head.
"You're not needed here, Lorelai."
Go get your coffee.
Relax.
"You're going to redo your makeup later, aren't you?"
Maybe an Irish coffee.
I haven't even heard of half these bands.
I love that about this place.
Lane would want to live here.
Who's Slint?
-Yes.
"And you're Brandon Bourne, aren't you?"
"The seventh, or ninth, or something?"
Only the third.
How do you know?
Your wife comes into the store quite often.
Everyone likes her.
"I like her, too."
"Since you know I'm married,"
I suppose you wouldn't consider sitting down with me for your ginger ale?
Sure.
I'm curious about guys like you.
Yeah?
"-John, this reserved?"
"-Always for you, Mr. Bourne."
"One ginger ale, one Scotch over rocks, please."
"Yes, sir."
"What are you curious about, with guys like me?"
"-Well, doesn't your wife dance?"
-Brilliantly.
Yeah.
"She's prettier than I am, she dresses better, and she's probably a lot smarter."
"Everything I can do, chances are she can do better."
"So, what do you want to be sitting here with me for?"
What is it with guys like you?
What goes on in your fuzzy little heads?
"What do you want, my philosophy of marriage?"
"-Well, I'm a reformed character myself."
-Oh.
"No, really."
"But before I reformed,"
I suppose my thinking went something like this.
I thought we agreed --
"Listen, sister, if I'm gonna be living in a hut in the Dominican Republic,"
I at least need a decent bottle of scotch.
I believe that's the sound of my scotch arriving.
"Hey, beautiful."
Thanks for coming.
I'm sorry it took so long.
There was construction.
It slowed everything down.
Construction?
Where?
At the entrance to the marina.
What?
Is -- is there a problem?
There's a reason fugitives are so paranoid.
"When you're on the run, even the smallest change in your environment can put you on high alert."
"But, then again, sometimes being paranoid pays off."
Damn it!
That's an earpiece!
"See, this is bad."
Those are agency guys.
We're blown.
"Yep, that's a gun."
My I.D. guy -- he was acting all jumpy.
Kept asking if he could deliver the passports himself.
I should have known.
They'll start searching as soon as they block the marina.
We got to go now.
"Well, we aren't getting out of here by sea."
Coast Guard is incoming.
"Fi, get Mike and Jesse."
I'm on it.
We have a problem.
The Ibani hotel?
They just cancelled our party.
And Jimmy Valenti changed his mind.
Nothing's been signed.
There's really no recourse.
A hundred guests have confirmed and we have no place to put them.
"I understand you're a bachelor, Neil, but for God's sake don't let the place go to seed."
So I've been scrambling to find a backup location.
You must have connections.
Somewhere discreet.
I'll see what I can do.
There's another matter we need to discuss.
This is my biggest party of the year.
We're all going to have to multitask.
"Darling, it's just business."
Is that what you call it?
'Cause to me it looks like blackmail.
"Look, Mommy and Daddy are playing house again."
The dining room table?
Bravo.
Is this gonna take long?
We were kind of in the middle of something.
"I just want a few minutes with your husband, Grace."
Like so many women do.
Coffee?
Mmm.
Love some.
She's never gonna stop.
Ever.
Today it's the SEC shutting down Bastion.
Tomorrow it'll be something else.
We'll see you later.
"Come on, Mark."
Go!
"Dad, my pocket money!"
"Money, money, money..."
It's all you think about.
I thought you might like this.
Thanks Dad.
"Thanks I'm good, but thanks."
"Come on, sit down."
Stop it!
Come on!
- Morning!
- What do we got?
Dead woman's bag was found in a hotel room.
"No wallet and no phone, so no ID."
Didn't she check in?
Was checked in under the name of Ben Jackinoff.
So I think it's fair to say that's a pseudonym.
No details yet but I've got something to show you.
- Potential murder weapon?
"- Alright, I'll check that in a bit."
- We got a description of a man?
- Fairly general.
Well how was it paid for?
Didn't the hotel take a credit card swipe?
Cash and there is only CCTV on the outside of the building.
But the manager did offer us something useful.
He recalls the woman going outside to take a mobile phone call.
And it's time coded so we can trace it.
"Yeah but without knowing what network she was on, how long is that gonna take?"
Right now it's all I've got.
"What do we do now, sir?"
First we get some sack time.
Then we start all over again.
- Muldoon.
- Sir?
Check the perimeter.
Make sure the outposts are set for the night.
I guess it couldn't have been much worse.
We're still alive.
What happens now?
We keep doing our jobs.
"You got one to go back to, haven't you?"
I guess so.
What are you going to say in your newspaper?
"If I say what I feel, I may be out of a job."
We'll always give you one.
I could do you more good with a typewriter.
It's Sergeant Sooby's.
He didn't make it.
Funny thing.
Fellow takes one of these into battle and by the grace of God he comes out in one piece he carries a strange sense of guilt all the rest of his life.
JAMISON:
Colonel?
"I'd like permission to take my men into ""A"" camp to check our equipment."
"And also, that sergeant who was pretty badly hit was asking for you."
Provo?
Thank you.
Captain Johanson is taking the Mike Force back this afternoon.
You can go in with him.
- Happy to have had you aboard.
- Thanks for the ride.
Why wasn't he on the chopper?
So that's the problem?
The only difference is that he got caught.
I sit in that courthouse every day and I see how they're doing him wrong.
"Ora, I'm sorry."
"If you need money, I can arrange a loan."
"I want you to tell my daughter, I want Goni to hear."
Why doesn't Daddy's friend come to visit her?
And why he won't let her daddy direct when he knows the truth about all of this?
Please tell her.
I'm sorry.
My darling.
My love.
Did you work on the adaptation?
"What adaptation, Mommy?"
It's a play I did for the theater and I'm adapting it for the school.
For the prison you're going to.
"No, for the school where I'll be working after I get out."
Plays in the theater are more fun.
Schools are nice too.
Then why not at my school?
Maybe there too.
Will you direct me?
That could be very nice.
I told the school they'd get a draft next week.
So they can see it's suitable for kids.
I'll get it ready.
It's annoying that they have to check everything.
Isn't your word good enough?
Why isn't it good enough?
That's the way it is.
Why?
"I want to hear ""There Were Nights""."
Access...
- Confidential?
"No, no, no."
I don't know anything.
"The last time I talked to her it was just, ""The kid this, the kid that."""
"According to our records, you spoke to her on the 15th."
- Three weeks ago?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that makes sense."
I...
She was going to Vegas.
"Oh, is that right?"
Vegas?
She asked me to go along with her.
It was gonna be her treat.
I couldn't go because I had to work.
We were gonna stay at one of those ritzy new places.
"The, um, Bellage..?"
- The Bellagio?
Right.
- Yeah.
- With the contortionist.
- I've never been.
You've been going through my desk.
It never crossed my mind when I was a younger woman... that I'd be this age and not have kids.
"Somehow in my mind, kids."
"Raising them, making them good people."
That's what I wanted.
"Then I met you, and I realized that I'd be... trading my dreams so that we could live yours."
We sacrificed all of that so we could do good.
We have done good.
I was never prouder when you fought to make hate crimes a capital and federal offense.
I'm so glad to see you meeting your son!
Nim-sai!
Nim-sai...
Don't be too excited.
"Men, come and take care of Sir Ho."
"So, you've seen,"
Sir Ho admitted the accused as his son.
"This may be a deliberate conspiracy, a trap for a nullius filius."
But the witness didn't swear in front of the Bible.
"So, his words won't be accepted by the court."
He swore.
"His hands touched the Bible, but he said nothing."
"Alright, again."
"Your Honour, although such a sad thing happened, the words of the witness said before his death... should be forgotten."
Nuts!
"He did say the truth, how can you deny it?"
"Sorry, law is law."
Not any word should be amended.
"Chan Mon-gut, I can't help you."
"Your Honour, you can!"
You'd better learn again.
"Your dad died, and you don't even shed a tear."
I think I'd better learn from you.
It's all because of you!
My dad had heart disease.
"If you didn't ask him to be witness, he wouldn't have died."
"You, murderer!"
"Your Honour, I am sorry."
"My father died, I can't control my emotion."
What's up?
Damn it!
You pretend crying!
"Yes, sir."
"And thank you, sir."
In view of the fact that the deposit was so small this procedure is a little unusual.
"Miss Howell, would you please leave my house?"
I have some very important business to discuss with Mrs. Ryan.
"Come into the garden, my dear."
How do you like it?
It's lovely.
All those wonderful flowers.
"Oh, that's nothing,"
I'm going to have some orchids flown in from Hawaii.
But what a beautiful setting.
"You know, a place like this inspires romance, don't you think?"
How long is it since you lost your husband?
Five years.
And you've been without a companion all that time?
I'm doing alright.
I want you to give a party.
Invite all your friends.
We'll celebrate.
Celebrate what?
My making $20.000?
That's nothing.
"Well, there'll be much more in the future."
Future?
I'm going to Europe soon.
Why go to Europe.
I've brought Europe to you.
"You're a fast worker, aren't you?"
In my country I'm considered a slowpoke.
We weren't even formally introduced yet.
I think we know each other pretty well.
"If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other Federation installations."
I merely suggest that a regard for sentient life...
There's no time for that.
It's a matter of policy.
"Out here, we're the only policeman around, and a crime has been committed."
Do I make myself clear?
"- Very clear, captain."
"- I'm delighted, Mr. Spock."
"Report, Mr. Sulu."
"Alien ship maintaining interval, captain."
Now at warp 7.
Warp factor 8.
"Aye, aye, sir."
Captain to phaser banks.
All components at battle-ready.
All banks primed.
Aft phaser to bridge.
"Work status, all weapons at operational ready."
- Captain?
"- Yes, Mr. Sulu."
"Closing on target, sir."
Good.
Mr. DePaul?
"- Yes, sir?"
- Our position?
"Two-two-seven-nine PL, sir."
Uncharted solar system at 2466 PM.
This is on the alien's course?
"No, sir."
He's headed away from it.
"Captain, sensors report we're being scanned."
By the alien ship?
- How did you learn to do this?
- I was born with the ability.
I wish to see a demonstration of molecular flow.
You are strapped to the table.
Unbuckle yourself and sit up.
Power has come into our hands which is centuries before its time.
We must use it wisely.
"Well, what can you have him do?"
Other than go around making people's belts unbuckle.
The possibilities are unlimited.
"Oh, come on."
"It's just some gimmick, that's all."
Tony...
"Mr. Sickle, whose life you saved, doesn't seem to believe in you."
"Mr. Sickle needs convincing, Tony."
"Hey, come on."
"Hey, get back!"
Get back!
Get back!
Don't.
Get back!
I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention.
"But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?"
I will demonstrate an industrial application.
"Come with me, Tony."
"Now, Tony, those wine casks... stack them... neatly."
"Two glasses of burgundy, please."
To molecular mobilization.
To molecular capitalization.
"Hey, got any more clues?"
No.
Nothing at all.
And I believe I know what key you will sing in.
F-major...
You have no right to parade your ignorant assumptions...
- You told me.
- I told you nothing.
- They'll meet him when he comes.
- You don't speak of such things.
- Everyone else was.
"- Mrs. Jennings is not ""everyone""."
I like her.
She talks about things.
We never talk about things.
"If you can say nothing appropriate, limit your remarks to the weather."
Surely they have enough reeds for a Moses basket.
You know what they're saying?
"Word is, you've developed a taste for certain company."
And why not?
A man like you in his prime...
She'd be a fortunate young lady.
Marianne Dashwood would no more think of me than of you.
- Don't think of yourself so meanly.
- And all the better for her.
Besotted...
An excellent match.
- He's rich and she's handsome.
- How long have you known him?
"As long as I've been here, and I came 15 years back."
His estate is but four miles hence.
He and John are very thick.
He has no wife and children.
He had a tragic history.
He loved a ward to the family.
I happen.
"Specifically, i hack in,"
"And you are locked out, maestro."
That's the last time.
Look at you.
You're going to pieces.
Do you remember when i said
Sooner or later you'd pay?
I'm cashing in.
"Sayonara,cyborgorita."
"Son of a... rhade, cockpit."
Targetandromeda.
They might have gone back to regroup.
No.
"Dylan, look."
It's harper.
He reconfigured the generator to do what he wants.
"Rhade, point defense lasers."
Pick those guys off before they come back in.
Dylan... i'm reading a massive buildup
Of zero-Point energy on sensors.
"Shut it down, now!"
I come in peace.
"Harper... right, now,"
"You're probably asking yourselves,"
"""Self, what's to stop these freaks from using us"
"As the little ball in their cosmic shell game yet again?"""
"The answer is me,"
Plus a relative application
"Of the golden rule,"
Mass times the square of the speed of light cubed
Equals a very bad day for them.
-Did you turn a knob?
-Yes.
All.
It doesn't play.
It's only hissing.
Of course it doesn't play.
There aren't any parts there.
"And now we welcome in the studio professor Janatka, to introduce the popular series ""Mystical outer space""."
"Dear audience, recently there have been many groundless reports about the existence of extra-terrestrial civilizations on our planet."
From a scientifical point of view this is shear nonsense because...
"Hey, doctor!"
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
"-That was a great explosion, Doctor."
-You gave us a real treat.
Congratulations!
At night some people are falling into a strange kind of unconsciousness.
-Shall we try it too?
"-Well, since we are here..."
-Are you already unconscious?
-Not yet.
"Mum, mummy, Not noodles!"
Please not noodles!
Let's repeat after him.
"Mum, mummy, Not noodles!"
Please not noodles!
"Mum, mummy, Please not noodles!"
Not noodles.
Not noodles.
Not noodles.
Not noodles.
Noodles... no.
There's a toilet.
The pillow actually looks pretty comfortable.
OK.
"You don't speak to me, ever."
- Ever.
- OK.
- No!
Shut up!
- OK.
So what are you guys in here for?
For giving the United States a taste of their own medicine.
- You guys are real terrorists?
- Some call us terrorists.
Others call us heroes.
Screw that.
You think you guys are heroes for killing innocent people?
It's 'cause of assholes like you that we're even in this fucking place... you fucking cowards!
"Well, maybe if the people in your country stopped eating donuts... and started realizing what your government is doing to the world... assholes like us wouldn't exist."
- Fuck you!
Donuts are awesome!
- They're delicious.
You like donuts?
"Well, wait till you see what they make you eat in here."
- Yeah?
- What do they make you eat in here?
l--
Ever hear of a cockmeat sandwich?
What's a cockmeat sandwich?
You're about to find out.
Right about now.
Suckers.
"All right, cockmeat sandwich time."
- Yes we can.
She declared war on gossip girl.You brought this on us.
"That's,that's not fair."
Serena was just trying to help everybody.
What do you know about anything
Besides your label was the only one that was true.
"You mean what she said about the ""insider""?"
Are you crazy?
You're friend with Nate Archibald
You played on the soccer team.You got into Yale
You got the lead role in the school play
"You got published in ""the New Yorker """
You had sex with a teacher.
Plus you dated the most popular girl in school
And ignored the rest of us.
No.
I meant them.
You pretend not to be like us but you are... to the bone.
And you should have known better.
Thank you.
Kudos S. Way to go out with a bang.
Now what did you want to tell me before?
Oh.
It doesn't matter now.
- It just happened.
- Leave me alone.
You're not mad at me because of that.
Just like I'm not mad at you about Vanessa.
Stop telling me what I feel.
We're just doing what we always do--finding excuses.
Well...
I won't do it anymore.
"Inspector Li, the suspect Eddie Hung held a hostage... in a crowded trolley car..."
Could you see him clearly?
- Could you?
- Yes.
- Why did you shoot?
- Instinct.
Did you consider the safety of the passengers?
Did you sound any warning before you shot?
Insufficient time.
The hostage had a coronary thrombosis.
She died of a heart attack.
Her family has registered an official complaint.
- You're responsible for her death.
- That's crazy
How could I know she had a heart condition?
I've been on Eddie Hung's case for seven months.
The guy was a maniac.
He'd shoot anybody for any reason.
Should I have waited until he killed her?
You forget I'd just seen him kill a cop.
Who's responsible for that cop's death?
Fine!
Do whateveryou want.
I'm used to all sorts ofcomplaints.
One more makes no difference.
Catch!
- How's the action hand?
- Pretty useless.
Better use it more.
It won't help.
A one-handed killer's out ofthe action.
I've had my day.
- Do not think of it.
- Will you not be seated?
- I'd leave a water mark.
- But permit me to call tomorrow.
- We shall look forward to it.
I'll show you out.
"Margaret, get the gentleman's hat."
- His name!
- To whom are we so much obliged?
John Willoughby of Allenham at your service.
John Willoughby of Allenham...
What an impressive gentleman!
He lifted me as if I weighed no more than a dried leaf.
- Tell me if I hurt you.
"- She feels no pain, Mamma."
"Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress."
Please don't say anything important.
- He expressed himself well.
- With decorum and honour.
- And spirit and wit and feeling.
- And economy.
Ten words at most.
"- Change, or you'll catch a cold."
- What care I for colds?
- You'll care when your nose swells.
- You're right.
Help me.
He's worth catching.
Marianne must not have all the men to herself.
- But what do you know of him?
- There's not a bolder rider.
But what are his tastes.
Idiot!
"Hey Halwa, what are you still doing here?"
You are no ordinary man.
You made that lunatic a doctor.
How long is your game?
I can't with stand it.
This is nothing.
This is just an interval.
Climax is still pending.
Shall I tell you something shocking?
What?
I'm the thief whom your brother-in-law is looking for.
Why did he come to Malaysia?
He used to rob regularly in India.
Why is he quiet now?
Has he quit robbing?
What does December 16 mean?
There is lot of time left for that day.
"If he had quit robbing, why would he fix the target?"
Why is he robbing?
Who will he rob in Malaysia?
He must either rob the nrls.
Or rob those who have link with India.
Where could he be?
"If he had called from this phone booth, he must be living in these surroundings."
But where?
What do you think of yourself?
Is duty everything for you?
"Even after coming to Malaysia, you are still thinking about that thief."
Why did we come here?
For your engagement or to catch that thief?
What if something happens to you?
"- Well, yeah!"
If you can't cope as a human you're never going to cope as a wolf.
The beast is back and I think I know where I can find it.
Don't you ever just want to run free?
Isn't that what being a Wolfblood's about?
"They believed me, Tom."
No-one's ever believed me before.
"It's not nice to be accused of lying, is it?"
"You're a truth hunter, you stick to your guns no matter what."
"One day, you'll to do something that will change the world."
Mam's freaking out about tomorrow.
"After the past two full moons, can you really blame her?"
Oi!
Not my fault you're slow.
Not my fault you're a girl.
- We've got to be there by five.
- That's hours till moonrise.
"Yeah, well, we don't want to take any chances this time."
Smith goes for the shot but is blocked by Morris.
Morris lines up.
He misses!
Complete embarrassment for the boy from Wales.
I mean he's had a terrible season...
Not from Wales.
Hi!
My dad's cooking tonight so I was thinking burgers at Bernie's instead.
- I'm there.
- 5:30-ish?
Yeah.
Great.
"- We'll be there, won't we, Rhydian?"
- Where else would we be?
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
It's gonna be awesome.
"Now, turn off the lights and go."
Not all the way!
Hello.
"Yeah, three..."
"Okay, normally New York is the friendliest, most affordable city in the world."
Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.
Guys?
"Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged."
"Oh, tell her, baby."
Make it hurt.
I'll be at the booth.
My panties may or may not be on when you get there.
They won't be!
"Okay, what is going on with you guys?"
It's the cuff.
It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician with a Vicodin addiction and a beat-up van
I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.
Who knew?
"Whoa, what-what happened to your wrist?"
Oh.
It's an allergic reaction.
So take it off.
"Robin, once you have a child, anything that gets you even remotely close to the possibility of sex is worth a few pus-filled blisters."
Better the sores weep than I.
"Hey, hold on."
That slut just got here.
How'd she get beer already?
Do you see a ring on that finger?
Whoa.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
I shall dispose of you myself !
"You like scaring people, pal ?"
Why don't you let me show you how it feels ?
- It's Storm !
The rings !
"If she damages them further, she'll undo all she healed !"
Polemachus will be devastated !
"Storm, stop !"
Please !
"Storm, listen to me !"
What you're doing is wrong !
"If you want this dirt pile to still be here in the morning, friend,"
I'd get us some of those glowing golf balls right now !
You'll hurt innocent people !
Arkon's making you act against everything you believe in !
"Please, Storm, he's not worth it !"
You are right.
Forgive me.
"Come on, let's get out of here."
Storm !
Please !
"Storm, I can get anything, riches beyond your imagining, our world will worship you !"
We are going home.
"You will be nothing on Earth, cast out and despised, feared and reviled for your gifts !"
"What of the slaves, Arkon ?"
The slaves ?
What are they to our happiness ?
"Everything, Arkon."
I am offering you a world !
Don't be a fool !
The slaves are nothing.
No living being has the right to enslave another.
- What happened?
"- Optical divagation, I think."
- What?
Kind of like a retinal flare after a photo flash.
"My best guess is the blast from the disco ball, kind of frizzed this mirror's primary reflective capacity and then it probably clipped part of Myka's psyche and fused it in there."
I don't...
"You know, it's kind of like shadows on a wall after Hiroshima."
- It's a pretty lively shadow.
"- Yes, but is it?"
- Is it what?
- Alive.
Help me!
- You wanna?
- Sure.
What's that about?
I'm gonna pull her back if she falls in.
"- Oh, hell."
- Get your mind out of the...
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- So?
- Nothing.
- So what is it?
Just a shadow play?
"- Well, the glass is like a barrier."
"If that's alive, I can't tell."
- Let's just ask her.
"- ""It."""
"""It"" might have something to tell us."
"I mean, why can't we just talk to her?"
"Because we do not converse with reflective entities, okay?"
- Because?
They'll send someone more skilful here and we won't go anywhere else anymore.
Don't be crazy.
Why didn't you keep the finished answers?
-Our methods are good for nothing.
-So we must use their methods.
"It seems that if someone gives you one blow,"
-you have to strike back.
-You think?
-What are you doing?
-Strike back.
-At once?
-You mustn't hesitate!
If you think...
-How was it?
-Fine!
"Well, that's it!"
"Hurray, we have it!"
-They haven't worked this out badly.
"Pick it up, the galaxy is waiting for our report."
"One moment, we'll just settle something here."
"So you see, an agreement is always possible."
Hush!
The planet is called Earth.
It's inhabited by living creatures.
"Multi-legged, four-legged... and two-legged."
The two-legged creature is called a human.
He considers himself to be the highest form of life.
He has gained control of energy... and invented a line of useful things.
"The lighter,"
"The telephone,"
The toaster.
"-Soft-boiled eggs, the food dispenser."
- That was you!
"Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable."
I'm sorry.
"To-To hook up with a girl, I have to connect with her at least a little."
Then find a connection.
Just go simple.
"Nothing about weird poets or buildings... or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me... with the subject line ""Food for Thought."""
"Please, Ted."
I need this.
Fine.
You win.
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.
But I'm not gonna enjoy...
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
It's gonna be awesome.
Now turn off the lights and go.
Not all the way!
Hello.
"Yeah, three..."
"Okay, normally New York is the friendliest, most affordable city in the world."
Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.
- Guys?
"- Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged."
"Oh, tell her, baby."
Make it hurt.
I'll be at the booth.
My panties may or may not be on when you get there.
They won't be.
- What is going on with you guys?
- It's the cuff.
It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician with a Vicodin addiction... and a beat-up van I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.
Who knew?
"Just go in the bedroom, that's all."
(angry grunt)
That animal is getting out of here immediately!
"- Wait, wait, wait, don't."
-Don't tell me to wait!
Alice knows she can't have a dog!
And she knows why she can't have a dog!
"Who's gonna take him out, huh?"
Me.
"Me, that's who!"
And when do dogs have to get taken out?
Five minutes before I have to go to bed!
That is around midnight!
"And if you think that I'm gonna walk up and down the street in the snow and the sleet and the rain, walking some mutt back and forth, you're nuts!"
Alice is taking that dog back!
- Right back to the pound!
"-Wait a minute, wait a minute."
She ain't taking it back.
Didn't cost you anything or anything.
She's in love with that puppy.
"If you make her take it back to the pound, it'll-it'll break her heart, and it'll cause a big fight, too."
You're absolutely right.
It will cause a fight.
So therefore I'm not gonna have her take it back.
I'll take it back!
- Back you go.
"-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Just-just wait a minute.
Wait.
- Wait...
-Don't wait...
Get out of my way!
I came to tell you that Allison has been named valedictorian.
Wonderful.
"She'll be terribly pleased, and so am I."
"She's a fine girl, bright and sensitive."
You should be very proud of her.
"Yes, I am."
"Well, that's what I came about."
"Good night, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"You are lonely here, aren't you?"
It's not the worst thing that can happen to you.
- Isn't it?
- You can learn to live by yourself.
You can get used to it.
Maybe.
But that doesn't make it the best way to live.
The best way?
What would that be?
"People meeting, talking."
"Well, in Peyton Place, two people talking is a conspiracy."
"A meeting is an assignation, and getting to know one another is a scandal."
I think you're hard on the town and hard on yourself.
"No, I'm quite all right the way I am."
What were you gonna do tonight?
Wash your hair?
Read a book?
Go to the movies alone?
"- Well, it makes time pass."
- Time shouldn't just pass.
It should be used.
I wouldn't know where to begin.
"Begin at the beginning, begin by getting out."
We need another chaperon for the dance.
- Maybe.
Hello?
"Yeah, Kevin."
Hi.
Is he all right?
"Oh, thank God."
"- All right, yeah, come pick us up."
We're still at his place.
- Where is he?
"All right, bye."
"He's-a, he's in jail."
"Ah, in Oceanside."
He was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.
"Dad left some serious problems with the company, beyond serious."
You think you might have to shut it down?
Maybe.
Probably.
I can't go into details.
I can't even tell Joe.
You know what they say at business school... almost all family businesses fail in successive generations.
I mean...
- if Ojai is already having problems...
"- Then we should kick it to the curb, according to our M.BA."
That's the smart play.
It's not that easy.
Losing Ojai'd devastate my family.
"Come on, you have no idea what families can survive."
"Besides, you are not responsible for everything, Sarah."
You always took on everybody else's problems.
You could come back to North Light today.
You are on the fast track.
"No, that place was eating up my life."
We can't leave anything to chance.
We can't let the girl cancel the broadcasts.
She's the only one who can undo what's been done.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Go fuck yourself.
"Look, your bosses won't let her live."
She knows too much.
Either you or me or the Agency pulls the trigger.
"No matter what, she doesn't make it out alive."
You know a lot about this business.
What's the problem?
What do you care?
Like you haven't done it a hundred times before.
We've almost drilled through your door anyways.
Might as well save your own life.
What's she worth to you?
She's nobody.
DAVID:
"Fuck. lf anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air... (david panting) I couldn't take the shot."
I couldn't do it.
How could I do it?
katherine:
He said he couldn't take the shot.
"-No, he couldn't."
"-What does that mean, Emerson?"
What do you think it means?
It means that there are no other safety measures.
That David was the safety measure.
Yeah.
Means that you're the safety measure.
And all this time I thought you were protecting me.
I knew you looked at me funny.
"Hey, you know that guy we met at the exhibition?"
Joe Sandilands?
The Attorney General.
He didn't like the painting either.
(Both laugh)
"Yeah, well he wants me to run."
State parliament.
Oh.
Dutch Patterson's old seat.
It's safe Labor.
"If I get preselection, I'm a certainty."
And is that something you want?
Yeah.
I never thought I had a chance.
I joined Young Labor when I was 16.
Went to God knows how many meetings.
And here all you needed to do was get shot.
You think that's the only reason they've asked me?
I didn't say that.
"No, but you're implying it."
"Well, they did only notice you after the tabloids called you 'hero'."
"OK, fine."
I'll stay at the bar.
If you're going to be negative about it.
What's it got to do with me?
Why is my opinion so significant?
"Well, I care what you do."
You can do what you want.
"All I'm saying is from my experience, politicians tend to be..."
"Let me guess - arrogant, self-indulgent, trough-sniffing arseholes."
"I was going to say sad, mostly."
And how many politicians do you know?
I'd cry when I saw something that moved me because I couldn't share it with her.
There's nothing worse than leaving someone you still love.
What a sad story.
"Love is the saddest thing when it goes away, as a song by Jobim goes."
We have to talk after the fight.
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You.
Not me.
You're right.
The doctor said it would take two months for my leg to heal.
But you know what?
I'm glad the bull gored me.
"Now I can stay with you until you awake, my love."
No one will take me away from you.
We'd gotten back together a month before.
"Lydia was to tell you at the wedding, but when I saw you in the ICU I knew she hadn't."
It was you she was crying for.
She rang to tell me she'd cried thinking of me.
It was the last time we spoke.
"As I'm injured, I won't be fighting for a while."
I'd like to stay with her these nights.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you.
"Hello, Alicia."
I'm alone again.
"Admit it, you were looking at her breasts."
"It's hard not to, they're getting bigger."
I'm thinking of going away.
- How come?
- I have to work.
What about Lydia?
She doesn't need me anymore.
He was found two weeks ago.
Patrolman saw him wandering on Bahnhofstrasse.
"Dazed, confused."
"Ran his prints and uh, found that he worked for your group, NATO Intelligence."
Thought you could help us.
He was stationed in Zurich.
Shuffling papers.
Hm.
What'd the doctor's say?
No.
He's catatonic.
"Appears to be awake but he's uh, not responsive."
There's been no change in the two weeks.
I think he's hopeless.
So whatever he once knew will die with him.
Nothing?
"No sir, we had a tracer put on Keene's passport."
The woman as well.
But they vanished.
And Jared Clayton.
"They are moving him into a nursing home, outside of Staad."
On NIA pension of course.
Of course.
"All right, we tie up the usual loose ends."
Release statements about terrorist cells to cover up.
"And tomorrow morning, we'll be back to business as usual."
"Good night, agent Henry."
"Sir, there's just one more thing."
It's very late.
It's about the Kozlenko affair.
What about it?
"I did some research, and as you know the NIA keeps excellent records."
I would do it until a morning the with pleasure.
Tell dear Tót.
Where is he?
Excuse me.
It fell down.
Is there a some kind of paint in the house?
- Paint?
- Yes.
This environment is monotone.
Do you not see it?
This grew tired.
You know what I had it made with the sentry boxes in the barracks?
"With a red, yellow, blue paint painted they."
Into the boards I had angles beaten in order for it not to be possible to lean against him.
What is your opinion?
Interesting.
Should we paint the walls?
Everything.
Oh it doesn't matter.
Let us continue.
Let the hand move.
He was cut it off his new sock.
He was crying very much.
"How I remembered him, that strike one 8 monthly children."
"I don't know, I already said that Gyula followed away when I took the road from the front line to the station?"
- Really?
- That's right.
I took a liking to that child very much.
"We took a bath, we were drinking beer next in the canteen."
Oh my sweet god.
"Do you hear this, my sweet good Lajos?"
I hear.
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Damn it!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
"He was... ""And what do I do about going to the bathroom""?"
(MR. WHlTTEMORE continues yelling)
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
"Hmm, Scott or Stiles?"
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
"My, these look comfortable."
You said you were gonna teach us to change whenever we wanted.
There hasn't been time.
"But if you have to lock us up during the full moon, that means you're alone against the Argents."
They haven't found us.
Yet!
So how about we forget the Kanima?
We can't!
But there was something about the way Gerard looked at it.
He wasn't afraid...
At all.
I don't know what he knows or what he's planning.
But I'm sure about one thing.
We have to find it first.
allison:
It's everything Lydia can translate.
"And trust me, she was very confused."
Let's talk later
Why don't you use this car?
"I will, of course I will"
When?
All in good time
"Namaste, sir. (Greeting) How are you Ramprasad?"
To that usual everyday question I usually lie everyday
You lie?
About being fine
You aren't fine
How could I?
I want to become a singer
I took up the liftman's job here in hope that you'd notice me someday
I sing extremely well.
Would you like to hear...?
Not now.
Only in-between floors
"That was folk, but I can change it to rap"
Let's talk later
I told you.
Try to understand.
I'll try to put in a word
"Mr Om, why did you lodge a police complaint?"
He's a poor guy
Because you are a traitor who pirates my music
So what's wrong?
It's only business.
If I make a few cents pirating...
I can spare a bit for you too.
"Fast-forward your life, Mr Om"
Don't you ever step into this office.
"Peace Mr Om, peace"
She pays his salary.
"She may let him strut around like boss man, but make no mistake... without his wife, David Harris is a big, fat zero."
Sorry.
"""I have sinned against you..."

- I got them.
- Thank you.
"Nice to see you, ladies."
"L""ll give you a call."
"Clara, God""s grace is with you."
- Kiss the children for me.
- I will.
"Son, don""t you worry."
The Lord forgives everybody eventually.
Thank you for saying that.
I made dinner reservations for tonight.
Just the two of us.
Same place we got married.
Where?
"David, at the Bayview."
I like this music.
"You""ve really impressed me, David... the way you""ve handled this like a man."
"Pastor Paul says, as long as you""re completely honest... we can survive this."
I am...
"I am a crystal clear well, please dri..."
I am a crystal clear well...
"-That's beauty, isn't it?"
"-Yes, but we would..."
Mother Nature will outlive us all.
-It's beautiful.
-But we are looking for...
"Yes, yes, a rest."
We have wonderful things here.
"Yes, but we are looking for..."
"It's something, isn't it?"
"Wow, it's like at our home."
"According to the dynamic plan of the landscape development, there should be a hundred years of untouched nature here later."
-Let's continue.
"-Yes, but..."
-Who are you actually looking for?
-A colleague.
"He got lost, We're worried about him."
In our forest nobody can get lost.
"Oh, yeah, in the past horrible things happened here."
"Rabbits ate grass, foxes ate rabbits and bears ate whatever crossed their mind."
But now thank God there is order here.
Look.
"I know a crystal clear well, where the forest is the deepest."
"Dark bracken grows there and in the surroundings, red heather."
"Thank you for your visit, sirs."
We are closing.
"Please, wait."
We've lost our friend here.
"But no one can get lost here, sirs."
-It belongs to the ministry of culture.
America's premiere covert intelligence agency.
"But now that the war is over,"
My mission parameters these days are...
"Agent carter, cover the phones."
...Different.
That all changed when an old friend
Asked me to become a double agent.
I have a vault.
Somebody cleaned me out.
"A couple of weeks later, my inventions..."
They start turning up on the black market.
"As of this moment, howard stark is a fugitive from justice."
You're the only one that can clear my name.
Edwin jarvis.
He'll help you in any way he can.
I found the man who stole howard's inventions.
He was part of a bigger conspiracy.
Leviathan is coming.
Who is leviathan?
He didn't have time to tell me.
All he left behind was a symbol.
I must determine what this means
Before the ssr catches up to me Or my friends.
"Clearly, you don't know the rules of the house."
Is this not apartment 3-f?
Who are you?
Jimmy.
"My girlfriend, molly..."
she lives here.
I swear.
"5'5"", blonde, works at bonwit teller?"
Next one over.
I need my brother back.
I promise.
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
- Are you ready?
- One condition.
Just this then we're done.
I'll talk to Calum.
He'll get you everything you need.
You talking to me?
You what?
You what?
Check this out!
Don't point a gun at me ever again.
- Where'd you get it?
- Kosovan Kate.
- Who's Kosovan Kate?
- She works with the Albanians.
"Here, you need to wear these - give the Old Bill a head start."
She's setting up her own people?
"Mate, I don't know how much you know about that part of the world but they treat women in a very degrading way."
Dealing with you must make a nice change.
"She noshed me off for free,"
- that's got to tell you something.
"- Yeah, it certainly does."
Lenny wants it done at the airfield.
Isn't there a lot of CCTV down there?
"Entrances, lobbies, exit to runways, manager's office."
"There's a blind spot in the toilets, though."
It's what everyone does before they get on a plane.
- But the front entrance is covered?
- I can get you in a different way.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked."
I've seen your picture in the paper from time to time.
They don't do you enough justice.
But I'm sure you've heard that more than once.
"Thank you, doctor."
And thank you for coming to the house.
"Oh, it's a pleasure, ma'am."
"I'd like you to meet my niece, Samantha Reece."
How do you do?
Pleasure.
Likewise.
Doctor?
"Oh, forgive me."
I was just studying that oil.
It's magnificent.
I think everything about this house is going to be magnificent.
Bad news?
What kind of bad news?
About my record company.
"Someone is buying up large blocks of stock in my company, and I don't like it."
When did all this begin?
Immediately after your party.
When you announced the pipeline deal.
The brokerage house that is handling the deal is located-
Don't tell me.
It's located in California.
"Los Angeles, to be exact."
Were you able to trace down who it was that was buying up that stock?
No.
No.
I haven't been able to find out anything.
It's Jason Colby.
How's your gin?
- How was he?
He has a quality that can only be described as... chrome.
- And?
- He seems to wanna help me.
How can he help you?
He didn't say.
He's got great stories.
I'd love to hang out with him again.
Do we have plans?
- Do we have plans when?
- Whenever.
"Yes, Philip, I'd say sometime in the indeterminate future, we may have plans."
Good shoot today?
Can you just leave me alone?
I have to do this.
You're fucking with other people's money here.
"Money, money, money."
What about my integrity?
"You know, I can think of a few other important writers who also took a firm no-press position."
I just wanna know that you've thought it through thoroughly.
I haven't.
"It's a very impulsive decision, and I'm very pleased with myself for that."
"Philip, this is Josh Fawn."
"Josh, this is Philip, who's being a baby and an asshole."
Ciao.
"Yes, we've met before."
We've done some panels together.
Er...
I remember one of them.
"Phil, Josh is going on a promotional tour for his new book."
That's what responsible authors do.
What I saw was the night-show;
He's into the matinees now!
Let's apply some ointment...
Why did you go there anyway?
I went for a soft-drink and she didn't let me open the fridge.
The thief?
She must have had it herself.
She's stolen so much already.
Is that the truth?
Of course.
All right.
Papa will set it right!
"Aunt will set it right, you mean!"
Well...
Aunt will!
"Back to the table, Bharti."
"I've got an order for 50000 pairs of shoes from Italy, sir."
The manager has left his file.
Good.
But he said we can't execute the order.
Why not?
Slaying animals is tough... thanks to the animal protection groups.
They're protesting atrocities against animals in the Capital.
"You'll get a shock, Bharti."
Kaushalya... you switch it on.
"""Listen to the secret news from Bharti"""
"""There are many thefts taking place at No. 10, Juhu Scheme"""
"""Our reporter, Aunty, is investigating the robberies"""
"""We present a special report"""
You even steal!
That's not me!
"They're playing such dirty tricks on film stars, too!"
We should move on as quickly as we can.
"Tom, some of those cows in there are mine."
"What are you looking at, Mr. Coble?"
"We're just gonna water our horses, and we'll be moving on."
You like to buy some of them cows?
"I don't want no trouble, and like I say, we'll be moving on."
How about a little dance?
"Give us a little dance, Mr. Coble."
Dance.
I said dance.
"All right, Mr. Coble, why don't you just ride on out?"
Get that shooter and put it in this water trough.
Move!
You son of a bitch!
"I'll get you, you son of a bitch!"
"Tom, that little deal back there at Brown's Hole... ought to give you an idea of what we've been putting up with out here."
I ain't never seen roping like that.
Damn!
He sure don't rope like no Christian.
I wanna tell you.
Any means that you have to take... to eliminate this rustling problem... we're all behind you 100%.
- Whole organization?
- All of us.
"I'll just have to take your word on that, John."
You got it.
"Hey, Tom."
How you feeling?
We're plugging along.
I'm giving a little party at the house.
I'd like you to meet everybody.
- I'm kind of raggedy.
- Nobody'll mind.
What do you mean you 18 year old?
!
You're under age!
No!
Kids are not allowed to do this!
You can't!
Who said you're not a teacher?
"Yeah, I'm a teacher so I can't watch students drink with my eyes open!"
You don't have to walk me home.
I can go by myself.
You don't have to walk me home.
I can go by myself.
You drank earlier.
How can I just let someone who drank walk the streets?
I only drank this much!
"Teacher Gil, are you that naive?"
It's not like that was the first alcohol I've tasted in my life.
"Anyway, I have no choice but to take responsibility."
"Because you're a student, Kang Kyung Joon."
"Also,"
I'm sorry that you have no choice but to pretend to be my fiancé.
I want to thank you too.
"You don't have to apologize, since you found this for me."
"And if you're thankful, fill this up please."
I have to pay more getting on the bus with this face.
And my clothes!
Do something about it!
"If I stretch a little, it seems like it's going to burst!"
My pants are always riding up like this!
"Yeah, I don't think we can leave his body like this."
Let's go.
To buy new clothes?
And how was your breakfast this morning?
It went really well.
I can tell that's 100% not true.
"Okay, are you two, like, legit fighting?"
"No, it's fine."
It's just...
"Audrey has some unflattering opinions about my dad, that's all."
"No, they're memories, not opinions."
"And, sometimes, maybe people are going through big things that have absolutely nothing to do with you, Emma."
Big shocker!
"At the most, it's identity theft."
"And, even then, what's the real harm?"
"I'm sorry, Mag."
I-I didn't mean to sound dismissive.
It's just... you've seen the reports of all the hijinks since your unfortunate run-in with Ms. Shaw.
That's a pretty damning understatement.
"- Look, we all grew up here."
- And you left.
You both left.
My family left because of that whole Brandon James mess.
"Miguel, with our particular history,"
I think you should investigate.
(SIGHS)
You know what?
You're right.
Just to be safe.
I know a guy in the bureau back in Phoenix.
He can try to trace the activity.
Take a while.
"But, for now, do not tell Emma."
Okay?
We don't need the whole student body talking.
See you Saturday.
- Did you find out anything?
"- Not yet, but I will."
Be patient.
"I was patient until the baby was due, but that was a month ago."
You have to keep waiting.
Fuck!
What do you do here all day?
I work in the sick bay.
"The jail is new, so there aren't many people."
It's very quiet.
"From outside, it doesn't look like a jail."
Forget the jail!
My problem is not seeing Alicia.
The medical officer and Alicia's father say I'm a psychopath.
"Yeah, a psychopath."
"They say it's good for the trial, but I don't give a shit about that."
I need to see Alicia and find out how it all ended.
"If this goes on, I'm capable of doing anything."
They say I'm a psychopath?
"Well, I'll behave like one."
"Don't say that, please!"
And get me another lawyer.
The one I've got practically throws up on me when he looks at me.
OK.
I'll tell the concierge to give you my keys.
Rent it out and that'll pay the lawyer.
"I'll rent it, because mine has been rented out too."
Great.
I like that you're my tenant.
"I've been thinking a lot about you, especially at night."
Why at night?
I have a family that needs me!
"When's the last time you did something, anything, without thinking about how your family might react?"
- I think Griff is in trouble.
"- I told you, he's using!"
Tell me you think our brother is not on drugs.
- Natasha!
"- I tried calling, silly, for a month."
"It wasn't that whole night with the coke thing, was it?"
- You and me had a good thing.
- I was used!
Now I need you!
"Allen, I fired him."
He's done.
Let's talk.
"Jesus, she's a cop."
What the hell happened?
Fell through the floor at an abandoned factory chasing some jackass.
- How's her airway?
"- Looks clear, but her sats are low, 93 percent."
I'm taking her up to 10 litres of O2...
let's push ***.
She's tachypneic but breaths are shallow.
Where are those chest tubes?
- Laryngoscope?
"- Kelly clamp, now."
Got no radial femoral pulse by palpation.
- It's already at the carotid.
- That's not a good sign.
- How is she?
- Right tube... is placed.
- You need to find her husband.
"- I'll call dispatch, let them know."
"Growing up in the kellys' House,"
"You know, we had good times And we had bad times."
But what makes a family.
Is if they stick together Through thick and thin.
"You know, my brother's Always been with me."
"We're a great team, Great combination."
- Whoo!
- Batman and robin.
"You know, he's robin, of Course."
"Whoo, yeah!"
"You know, my dad Doesn't expect me to succeed."
"And I just need to prove There's money here,"
And this is all gonna work out.
They just need To trust me a little bit.
Maybe that's not a path.
There's the path.
Get on that.
"Hey, Stop for a second."
- Right here?
- Yeah.
"Okay, this is it."
"All the what up there, A couple of miles."
"And all the way down there, One or two miles."
"J.J., I really love Your adventures, man,"
But you know this one's In the middle of nowhere.
"Even when you're at the bottom, There's only way place to go."
And that's up.
So I can't do any worse Than from right here.
It's only gonna get better.
"I kind of, you know, Expecting to show up here,"
"We drive the bank, And we jump right in the water."
We're gonna make this River mining thing work.
Vanderbilt is a sporting gentleman.
I'll bet right now he'd be willing to settle for half of those millions of his you got tucked away in that safe.
That's a righteous thought!
I ain't greedy.
I'm willing to go over to new york and bargain with cornele if you'll give me a guard.
I'll give you a guard to keep you here.
Huh!
"If you and vanderbilt ever set down to those millions, there'll be mighty slim pickin's for nick and me."
Front wheel!
Back wheel!
1486
Right dress!
"Uh, undress!"
"No, no!"
Dress!
Left by right!
Right by left!
Fix bayonets!
Charge!
Army... help!
"I got 'em stopped, colonel, but they just don't look quite right."
"Well, just tell 'em to fall out."
They'll know what to do.
Fall out.
Fall down!
What good is $10 million if i can't see josie's show open next week?
"Oh, josie will be all right."
"Besides, a trip to europe wouldn't do us any harm."
There'd be plenty of girls over there glad to see us.
Yeah.
And there'll be plenty of fellas in new york glad to see josie.
And i'm not turning my preferred stock over to anybody-you know that.
But evidence does.
"Ah,good."
"Abby,have you lifted the dna from the shovel handle yet?"
"You know,from the sweat we discovered on the handle."
"Oh.Yeah,uh,right."
I-I've got it running.
I'm ready to check it.I just need a sample.
"Well,then... test it against the saliva on this."
You're right.
I tried to cover up her murder.
But I didn'kill him.
That cheating bitch did.
"Boss,Mr. Carvell re admitted to ducky he buried the body."
"Oh,my god."
It was you?
Who else cleans up your messes?
I was watching the two of you from the window.
You watched us make love?
That's not what I'd call it.
Then what happened?
"-They had a fight,she hit him on the head,and she ran."
-Rick... that he's lying.
All I did was bury him.
"Well,I'm afraid you did a bit more than that."
Right.
I unburied him.
Sit down.
A reexamination of the conjunctival and facial tissu revealed petechial hemorrhages suggesting asphyxia.
"So I looked for atelectasis in his lungs, which results from shallow breathing due to aobstruction such as plastic."
And there it was.
Lance corporal finn was buried alive.
He was dead!
- Saul shouldn't have said anything.
- No!
You do not get to blame Saul!
"He had enough faith in me, enough respect for me to be honest, which is more than I can say for you or Tommy or Kevin."
Were you never going to tell me?
You've had so much to cope with.
It just didn't seem to be the right time.
I can just see Tommy spearheading this whole brilliant idea.
- He's so like his father.
"- No, it was my idea."
- It was your idea?
- Yeah.
I was the one who thought that we should keep this information from you.
"Your father made you president of our family business, Sarah."
Not our family.
You taught me to put family first.
I was trying to.
"No, it is not."
You were trying to do what was easy for you.
You think it's been easy keeping this a secret?
No one asked you to!
There is no justification for this.
"- Oh, God."
What?
- Hey.
You ready for dinner?
- May I speak to Dan Silk?
- Talking to him.
"If you're going to make a living tarnishing people's reputations, you may want an unlisted number."
Thanks for the tip.
- Do I know you?
"- No, you do not."
Can't go watching soap operas all day.
That hydro will be here tomorrow.
You won't.
Listen to the doctor.
"Margie, this is Reznik."
The man who cost me my arm.
"How do you do, Mrs. Miller?"
"I've been better, Mr. Reznik."
Is there some place we can talk?
Check it out.
It's a beauty.
8 cylinders.
MagnoSphere.
Speed sensitive steering.
ABS breaking with road texture and tension.
Defence lock-up helps you maintain control in emergencies.
"Of course, it's an automatic."
Hell I wanted a stick... but I figured my shifting abilities wouldn't be so hot.
"You know I am not at National any more, right?"
"Yeah, I heard about it."
"It sounds like you almost lost one yourself, huh?"
"Did you find that a bit ironic, Miller?"
Ironic?
"I'm sorry kid, I never got over sixth grade."
"I'll break it down for you, Miller."
"Moments after you left the shop, someone powered up my machine."
With my arm in it.
I nearly got killed.
Accidents happen.
It wasn't an accident.
Accidents happen out of negligence.
This happened out of spite.
"- See, I don't get that."
Stefan has his humanity.
He's a good guy.
"You kill people, but I see something human in you."
"But with her, there was..."
There was nothing.
You can turn it off.
It's like a button you can press.
"I mean, Stefan's different."
He wants the human experience.
He wants to feel every episode of How I Met Your Mother so he shuts his feelings out.
"The problem is, as a vampire, your instinct is not to feel."
Isobel chose the easier road.
"No guilt, no shame."
No regret.
"I mean, come on."
"If you could turn it off, wouldn't you?"
- You haven't.
"- Of course I have, Ric."
That's why I'm so fun to be around.
Why did you wanna meet me?
It can't be to just catch up.
Because I'm curious about you.
But the real reason is I want what your uncle wants:
Johnathan Gilbert's invention.
[CHUCKLES]
How do you know my uncle?
I used to spend a lot of time here when I was younger.
John had a crush on me for years.
He was the first one that told me about vampires.
"So, what made you wanna be one?"
"It's a very long list of reasons, Elena all of which I'm sure you've thought about."
- That's our daughter.
"Hey, Jeff..."
"today, at Ritchie's school, with everybody there, I got a glimpse of what the future would be like, and it is so messed up."
Is that because you and Matthew have a baby?
"Okay, stop-- stop looking at the board, okay?"
I...
Oh!
I like you a lot.
And I like you.
So why can't we just look past the other stuff?
"Look, you've got to understand this from my point of view."
"I mean, what if I said that, in order to date me, we'd have to hang out with your ex-wife and her husband?"
I'd rather have diarrhea.
Exactly.
"I mean, it's great when it's just us, but it's never going to be just us."
It's always going to be weird.
Isn't this a conversation for way down the line?
No.
"Way down the line, I'm going to be in love with you, and then it's going to be too painful to tell you I don't want to do this."
You don't want to do this?
It's just...
It's too incestuous.
You dated your second cousin.
"Actually, he was my first cousin."
And I asked him out.
I think you're making a mistake.
Yeah.
That's what my aunt said.
No.
No.
About us.
What?
It's your first real conversation since you arrived here?
Conversation that take place on or around campus and was substantial?
Yes.
Wow.
You must be really lonely.
Can't see your eyes in that hat.
That's better.
Where are you going?
Are your office hours over?
For the time being.
Also they're for people in classes I teach.
"That's not you, is it?"
"No, but I was hoping..."
"No, it's urgent."
"So today we'll be learning about the Romantic period, and the impact of the French Revolution, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and..."
William Godwin and...
Did anyone read it?
We'll be also talking about the... (CHUCKLES) Romantic themes.
"Sorry, the cult of sensibility, emphasizing..."
"Sorry, what were we talking about?"
"Well, this is the most amount of visitors I've ever seen during a single session."
"And on a Friday, no less."
What a world.
One second.
(THUDDING)
Come right in.
"When I was in school, I never went to these things, so..."
I tend to forget about them.
That's okay.
I was hoping we could discuss my story.
Right.
Which I read.
Don't turn on the light.
You want something to drink?
"No, no."
I'm not staying.
What are you trying to do here?
"Turn that off, please."
You think having the lights off... is gonna make everything OK?
Just let me pretend for a while.
"Pretend what, that you can't see?"
I can't see.
I can't see things that are right in front of me... and I can see things that couldn't be there.
"For all I know, it was Cuchetto on the stairs."
I saw Valerie after she died.
I saw my mother.
Want to see me cry?
Boo-hoo!
My dog got hit by a Cadillac.
Now get the fuck out of here.
Simmer down.
Is this the cross you saw?
Is it?
How about this one?
That's it.
Why didn't you tell me... about these other hallucinations you had?
Because it wouldn't make me a credible witness.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that what you're here to tell me... that I'm a nut and you're moving on?
Why do you think I assigned someone to protect you?
I can protect myself.
With what...
darkness?
I survived 20 years... without sight or a cop at my door.
"Hey, you guys aren't gonna fight in here, are you?"
And why not?
I pay half the rent.
We lose our cleaning deposit if any half gets messed up.
"Oh, the cleaning deposit."
What was I thinking?
"Of course, you're right."
- Now what?
- How about the roof?
"Good call, Arthur."
There's a place good always fights evil.
"Well, works for me."
"Frankly, that's why I was so glad to find this great apartment."
You'd be surprised how hard it is to get a place in the city.
"Never mind that most folks are hesitant to rent to a slime-based organism, much less one with intentions of taking over the world."
And human brains too!
Don't forget the brains!
"It is good, this roof."
I am pleased.
- [Squelching]
- Come on.
"Let's get this over with, nose jelly."
"Tick, wait."
"- Hey, no whispering."
"- Tick, keep them busy."
I think I know how to get Thrakkorzog back to his own dimension.
"When I give you the ""high"" sign, try to throw the Mucus Tick into Thrakkorzog."
"A ""high"" sign?"
Are you a great sidekick or what?
Let's get to it.
Break!
Coward.
That's a bit of overkill.
"I tell you, we'll discuss it..."
May I take your arm?
My husband's in a temper tonight because I'm wearing his britches.
"George, Chopin does not deserve to be collected."
"He's so fragile, you know he might..."
What's this?
A secret?
Is he the one you came here to meet?
"Mallefille, if you can't behave, go to your room."
I am quite marooned.
Will you... partner me?
Of course.
- Bon appetit.
- ALL:
Bon appetit.
I understand many of you artists are atheists.
Atheists?
"Oh, no."
"No, we feel that God exists."
He's just not considered worth all the trouble of denying him.
"Oh, really!"
The baron is baiting you.
He maintains there is no scientific evidence of God.
"And I reply ""Because civilisation has poured dust on his traces."""
God has been buried by science.
But alive!
God exists.
"But he is no longer loved, so he hides away to conceal his broken heart."
(SYMPATHETIC MURMURS)
Certainly it is difficult to find God in our age.
And artists are the only hope.
Can't you see she's busy?
I'll tell you about her childhood.
Margaret dropped from Connecticut.
She went to church every sunday.
This is when she was sixteen.
What are you doing?
"This is my hair, you could at least consult me about it."
"I think, Jane, the hairdresser..."
Hair stylist.
Hair stylist is right.
We don't need this accessory.
The image should be simple.
Your photographs that Adrian was just showing me indicate a fairly traditional upbringing.
And you slipped to a weird off with some obscure fantasy look.
spirit of paradise everyday in Las Vegas and better.
It's tacky.
You're tacky.
What do you mean by wearing all this weird make up and strange clothes?
Nothing.
You don't admit to dressing strange?
You're strange.
What do you mean by that?
I'm not wearing rags.
You're wearing what they want from you...baby.
America!
What do you mean America?
"I'm American, she's American."
He's American.
Where're you from?
-Detroit.
-Las Vegas.
-I'm coming from Montana.
It's over.
I got mine.
"Of course, tomorrow you'll have to make up the deliveries you missed today and do your regular route."
Oh.
"Right, sure."
"Well, either way, it'll be nice to have a day with the kids and Frank."
"Well, that's a positive outlook."
Who's Frank?
- He's my...
- Don't care.
Do you have to fucking chew so loud?
Excuse me for having a resonant skull.
Good news!
I don't have to work after all!
We've been handed a gift!
A snow day we can spend together as a family.
"Don't you ""agh"" me."
We are all gonna have fun together at the sled hill!
- Yeah!
- Sledding!
You guys have a good time.
I'm gonna curl up in an afghan and slowly cry myself into a nap.
"No, no."
Uh-uh.
You are going to leave this house and enjoy the day with your family.
I can't.
Pogo might call.
"Frank, I'm your biggest cheerleader, but it's been three weeks and Bob Pogo has not called yet."
- And I doubt he'll call today.
"- Your cheerleading needs work, Sue."
"And, if by some miracle he does call, we have an answering machine."
"Come on, you've been a ghost around here since Christmas."
-I probably would have.
-Yeah.
[Door beeps]
ARCHER:
Come in.
"-I didn't mean to wake you, sir."
"-It's all right, I was getting up anyway."
-How are you feeling?
-I've been better.
You sure you had that pistol set to stun?
Captain.
I hope you understand if there'd been any other way....
"You were protecting our mission, Trip."
I would have done the same thing.
"Still, I never thought I'd find myself pointing a weapon at you... no matter what the circumstances."
"Let's put this behind us, okay?"
"Yes, sir."
What's our status?
We just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves.
The hatchlings?
Phlox says there's 19 of them running around down there.
Chances are they'll survive until the next Xindi ship comes along.
It's time we got back on the road.
I want you at your post.
We're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard.
I'll be on the Bridge.
Aren't you supposed to get some rest?
ARCHER:
I've had plenty.
"I'm sorry, sir, but the Doctor was insistent."
Okay.
I guess I don't want another mutiny on my hands.
"Last time I was up here, it was with some soccer player named Eli."
Is something bothering you?
Am I that obvious?
"The one thing you're not is obvious, Chad."
I got the pages for tomorrow's shoot.
I have three lines.
Three.
I was nominated for a Daytime Emmy and now they're treating me like some day player.
"OK, we've parked at inspiration point so you can bitch about your job?"
- I thought we were friends.
"- I don't know what we are, Chad."
You give me shoes.
You admire my body and...
"You know, I'm sorry."
"Taking a drive to a beautiful location is, regardless of categories, a date."
"Come on, man."
"Driving me all the way up here, you're either gonna hack me into pieces or you're gonna kiss me."
"Well, I'm not a serial killer, so..."
Wait.
Wait.
So you are gay.
"No, man."
But it doesn't mean I don't think you're hot.
Wait.
What about your girlfriend?
She doesn't mind.
I've seen her make out with tons of girls.
"Well, who am I to judge?"
"He shows up for his interview and I swear to you, his face did not move."
- No.
"- No, not an inch."
- Botox?
- I'll fight the guy that says you can't.
- I hope they think that way up front.
Forget it.
You're a cinch.
- You sure you're rooting for the right guy?
- Sure.
Think it over.
"I'm warning you there ain't gonna be no hangovers in no shop I'm boss of, get it?"
"- Okay, Mr. Taylor."
- Oh.
"Starting to red apple the boss already, huh?"
"Well, come on, we'll give them a week's work between now and quitting time."
Sure that will do you?
"Oh, yes, thanks."
I'll return it first thing in the morning.
"Even if you don't, it's all right."
I still owe you four eggs and that half bottle of bluing I got from you.
"- Oh, gee, Betty, that looks swell."
- I hope it tastes all right.
The men are getting hard to please.
Not your pa.
He eats anything.
I trained him like that.
"You know, you gotta train a man just like you would a dog."
So it's Ed Jackson who's hard to please.
Are you going to start that again?
"Yes, I am."
And I'm going to keep it up until you and Ed do something about it.
- What are you waiting for?
- That's what I keep telling her.
I guess it's polite to wait until you're asked.
Don't be silly.
"Well, I guess that's better than some stupid doll."
- Hey.
"- Dude, I am so screwed."
I'm so glad it's you and not my mom.
Or my brothers.
Or my sister.
Or indeed my half-sister.
Could my life get any more complicated?
- What's up?
- Did you even hear what I said?
A countdown clock.
Dan Silk is counting out the days until I come out on his frigging website.
"""Chad Berry."
"Come out, come out, wherever you are."" That son of a bitch."
What I can't figure out is why is this guy gunning for me?
"Oh, no."
You called him.
Yes.
"Yes, I did."
I thought I could convince him to leave you alone.
You think you're the first lawyer to try and scare this asswipe?
He makes his living from screwing with people's lives.
You just egged him on!
You promised you wouldn't do anything.
I come from a line of people who are incapable of leaving well enough alone.
"If you had any respect for how important my career is to me, you would have listened and not gone behind my back."
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry.
I am sorry.
So... where do we go from here?
I'll tell you where we won't go.
Time drew it...
This rainbow of desires...
"What happened, uncle?"
Smile once.
"Today, Tony's dream will come true."
He likes to play with me.
Silence heard by the heart.
Doctor told me that I can play now.
He must be very happy.
"Do you have any dreams, uncle?"
It's alright.
What's the fun if each one fulfills his own dream?
The fun lies in fulfilling others' dreams.
Are you the meaning of life?
It's said that God lives in children.
It seems to be true on seeing them.
Each one of them has a disease.
They forget all the sorrows and feel very happy since one of them has defied death.
Some of them will not survive inspite of good medication.
But some will survive.
But there is no money.
Look at him.
He will not survive for more than 4 days.
He too knows that.
But he forgot that  is happy that she has survived  he can play with her.
Who has disease?
We or they?
So many of them?
"If there are so many of them in our orphanage alone, think about the entire city, state  the country."
How many are there?
I need a list of all those children.
We went pillar to post to save one child.
I use it for exercises
Clementine...
I've come to a decision
I'm leaving with you.
It's all decided
If you agree
"I'll write my mother when we're there, explaining my decision"
When we arrive... where?
Wherever you're going
I packed a suitcase.
I'll be ready.
You'll see
I'll manage all the details
I'm sure you will
"Please, don't joke."
I can't stand it
I'll never cause you any problem
I'm the one who would cause you problems
I'm sick... finished
"Yes, I mean it."
I'm flat broke
Poverty doesn't scare me
You know what it is?
An empty stable is poverty to you or a dress you wear for two seasons.
The real thing you don't know
"Here, look"
Quite a group
Is that you there?
It's you
It was.
"Where he went, women used to adore him"
But he died penniless
what's it really about?
I want to become the person my mother can be proud of...
The person I can be proud of.
"Well, for the record, you made a believer out of me."
"You know, this would make one hell of a story."
"No, no."
I am a private detective.
"No, thanks."
Thank you.
"- Hey, you."
- Hey.
Just came to make sure you were okay.
I get it now.
"By rescuing Amanda, you were saving a part of yourself."
"I guess if you want to have a future, you have to make amends with your past, right?"
And you're off to a flying start.
You want to get something to eat?
"Uh, thanks, but I have to take my mother to dinner."
I told her I needed to clear the air.
I predict a complete success.
You don't know my mother.
But I know you...
And I am always in your corner.
"Am I moving your stuff to my place all alone, or are you gonna help me?"
I'm helping.
I'm packing memories.
You know I actually five pounds lighter than I was in high school?
Do you know that none of your glasses actually match?
I don't even know how a person does that.
"Hey, same haircut, you ask?"
"Same barber, I say."
You must really suffer from the terrifying clarity of your vision.
Thank you.
I do suffer.
Thank you.
Take a look at this screenplay.
I kind of dashed it off.
It's about the New York poet Frank O'Hara.
He had a beautiful nose like a boxer.
"Yeah, I know."
I love his nose.
He got run over by a dune buggy on Fire Island.
"Anyway, I'd like you to think about doing a rewrite on this."
- George has my number.
- Thank you for this opportunity.
I love your work and I can't wait to read this.
Thanks.
Did you have this script made for me?
My name's on the cover.
Now when you give someone a script to read it's kind of standard practice to laser print their name on every page.
I see.
"This is not a big deal, but my name is misspelled."
"There's no ""O"" at the end."
"It's ""Jonathan"", not ""Jonathon""."
"Yeah, man, I don't know."
It's not really important.
But call me tomorrow and it's really great to meet you.
Great to meet you.
"Thank you, Jim Jarmusch."
Do you know Jim Jarmusch?
He's my favorite director of all time.
His films are like poems that come to life.
It's really interesting.
"Well, with a diagnosis like mine, the goal is to keep the patient alive long enough for some new miracle drug to appear."
Daddy.
"Yes, my man?"
I want to play with you.
Okay.
"Well, I want to play with you, too."
Let's do it.
Oh.
Dad.
What's happening?
Take me back to the Cube.
The E.R. stopped the bleeding.
He's resting comfortably in his room.
What happened?
"Nose and mouth bleeds are common side effects of chemotherapy, but they can lower his platelet count, so your dad may need a platelet infusion."
That's... all it is?
Mm-hmm.
They'll run some tests to be sure.
"All right, come on."
Show me what you got.
Wait for it.
- There it is.
"- Oh, touchdown!"
- Right on cue.
"- No, no, no, what am I missing?"
"Spike in cerebral blood flow in his precuneus area, also known as ""the God spot."""
It's one of the several areas of the brain linked to spirituality.
"You see, as Jacob listens to music, his right brain is shutting down because he's entering a trance state."
"So, why is this happening to a man who's never been spiritual before?"
"- I don't know, but look at that."
- Mm.
"Oh, wow."
"I have never been one to believe that there's gonna be some knight in shining armor, and he pulls up into my driveway and sweeps me off my feet."
"But, you know, I really..."
I really never thought that it was gonna be this hard either.
"Oh, I..."
I have to go.
"So, thank you for not being a complete jerk about this."
Anytime.
Oh.
"And, uh... wish me luck."
"Then I said, ""You know, I know I'm supposed to be humble, but I'm better than that show."
"I mean, I can do more than play a Mafioso's son."
"At least give me a disease or a multiple personality or something."""
I can see how that'd be frustrating.
"And then finally I just said to him, ""Look, I'm not renewing my contract."""
"So, Kev, you got a boyfriend or something?"
"Uh, no."
"No, I don't."
"And, uh, h... how..."
how did you know I was gay?
I got a lot of gay friends.
"It's so much easier hanging out, you know?"
None of that alpha male weirdness.
- So you're not...?
- Gay?
- Yeah.
- No.
My girlfriend's got a theory we're all a little bit gay.
Right.
"Well, right."
"Well, I'm..."
"I'm pretty much fully gay, so..."
- So you have a girlfriend?
Debriefing at 10:00am.
"Stop it, no one will be up at 10.00am. Not even youl"
Wanna bet?
No.
"You'd lose, there's no point."
"By the way, I owe you 10 euros."
I thought you were a heavy sleeper -
I've been ringing your bell for 10 minutes.
Get lost.
I should be the one who's angry.
"Since you lost the case, you pretended to be into me while running after Ronaldo on the sly."
I didn't suddenly become your type overnight.
Why are you doing this?
What do you gain by sleeping with me?
And you?
Fifteen years ago I totally messed up with you.
This time I don't want to miss my chance.
Would it be a problem that you've become my type?
Get up.
Judge Morel just called.
She found you a home.
You've got 15 minutes to get ready.
Where is it?
- Pantin.
You will go and see her after and start reimbursing what you stole.
Have you got any money on you?
"If you mean the 200 euros, I spent it all."
- And how are you going to manage?
- It's not a problem.
It's not a problem to find 200 euros?
I've got as much cash as I want.
It just pisses me off to earn it the way I do.
"When I think about my vocation,"
"Say it: ""whores""."
one should...
Life doesn't scare me anymore.
Put them down?
"Here's the only Venom still alive, the untouchable, the only one that never touched me."
The one that lights the match!
I don't want the penguins splattered in ketchup.
Especially not in front of the fuzz.
"Enjoy your meal, gentlemen!"
"""Ministers of Integrity""!"
"Thank you, show's over."
It's not over for me.
You gave me a theater as payment for a quickie.
"I resented you, and went crazy about that innocent."
"He burst out of his Hungarian shithole, out of his mind, then began fucking things up for everyone."
The innocent is a dog.
I bought him back from this harlot
- I was wrong.
Do you still want me?
I want everything.
"Whereever you want, whenever you want."
As long as it's now.
"And I want him to see it, OK?"
Search him.
The wax of the seventh seal drips on the butcher's fingers.
The lamb is ready.
"Here, if you please - same as them."
Am I frightening you?
Lower.
Where it's real.
Where it smells.
- Stress responses?
"- He's just scared, but everything else is normal."
He doesn't know a thing.

We don't have a record of purchase of this cardiac regulator.
What difference does that make?
"If there's no record, it means that it was stolen from one of our facilities."
It's company policy for us to permanently deactivate all stolen tech.
Thank you for reporting this to us.
"Wait, you can't do that."
You bought it black market?
"I don't know, but maybe we should start running."
I always thought your idea of having a combat base was crazy.
"Vila, I won't run."
We have to find out what it is they're doing.
Why the old colonies are being conquered so easily.
Then perhaps we can do something about it.
The five of us?
"Oh, and Trooper Orac here."
We need to know how they are doing it.
"It's possible that the Federation have some new weapon, something we don't know about."
- All the more reason to start running now.

There's only one way.

How did it go?
It went over really well.
Ballet is really something out in the country.
Did you dance well?
"Yes, but I wanted you to see it."
Waiter Are you ready for your meal?
"Yes, we are."
Is Father back yet?
Not yet.
I heard something unpleasant about father.
What was it?
During the war he put out an obscure book called
The Literature of the Yoshino Court.
Who told you that?
NMzu-san.
Your NMzu-san?
Yes.
"But even if he put out a book like that, they treat him as if he was a collaborator."
Let's not talk about your father.
"Ah, you came together!"
When did Shinako get here?
She got back today.
"Oh, she must be tired."
Ballet is popular these days.
They must really like it when they see it for the first time.
"But have you made up your mind, Mrs.?"
"It's going to be the studio that you use, so shall we take out those briars and put up a prefab building?"
That would be too much for us.
Leave it all to me.
I'll make a two story concrete building and put in some big windows.
"If we're going to put something up, we'll build it ourselves."
Be serious!
You've dieted until you've disappeared.
Now I'm starting to wonder if you can be too rich.
There has to be a potion in here somewhere.
You need an Other Realm camera.
Everyone knows those cameras add a hundred pounds.
(doorbell rings)
That's Harvey!
"Order me a camera, now!"
"Come on, Sabrina."
We're not going to be able to vote for ourselves if we're late.
Self-opening door?
Cool.
"Not very safe, but cool."
(running footfalls)
Has the camera arrived yet?
Yes!
Finally.
Hurry up and take my picture.
Could we take another one?
I think your eyes were closed.
"Sabrina, I'm down here when you're ready!"
And sorry to anyone I woke up.
SABRINA:
I'll be right there.
"Okay, everything's going to be fine."
Uh-oh.
You think that happened because we didn't use name-brand film?
"Oh, look, it says the camera only brings you back for a few minutes."
"So much for ""Take a picture, it'll last longer."""
And you'll start to flicker whenever you're about to disappear.
Like that.
"Quick, take another picture."
"This isn't about you, Gary."
"Jesus, nothing here is ever about you."
"I didn't hear any of this 'cause I have a really bad case of tinnitus, especially when discussing morally dubious things."
So it's kind of like sinnitus.
But I'm implicated.
I'm the linchpin.

- Shut up!
"No, you shut up."
You shut up.
And I will also shut up first.
Sue!
"Sue, I need to see the president."
"She's in with the joint chiefs, Gary."
Is it that important?
"Listen, Sue, I'm involved with some stuff here."
Scary stuff like take it to your grave kind of stuff.
And that's the... that's the way I like it.
"Okay, well, she'll be out in five."
Can it wait?
"Yeah, no problem."
No problem.
What if he checks our cover story?
"Like, what if he informs Congress?"
"Dan, he's a congressman."
Congressmen never do anything they say they're gonna do.
How are you not freaking out about this?
I'm kind of having fun.
I like having a cover story.
Makes me feel like a Charlie's Angel.
"God, it was a rush!"
"Yeah, but you're a control freak and this whole thing is out of control, so why aren't you freaking?"
Mom finding out now will destroy her.
You're in a relationship with Holly.
How long can that last if this whole thing blows up?
"We all have things at stake, Sarah."
If it's out in the open we have a chance to diffuse it.
"Saul, Rebecca's lived in this city most of her life."
It hasn't affected any of us.
Justin and Kitty don't know she exists.
That's another thing.
Justin's out of rehab.
Are we going to throw this at him?
Right.
If your mother found out we were keeping this from her...
- We've been keeping it from her.
- Before Rebecca moved back home.
Our chances of keeping this a secret from her are...
Nobody will find out if we don't tell them.
Holly's lied to Rebecca her whole life.
I don't think she's going to risk telling her now.
Come on.
Haven't we learned anything this year?
"- Tommy, you're with us, right?"
- Yeah.
Good.
Apparently you've all made up your minds.
It's settled then.
He had this one lone hair.
Like this Fu Manchu thing.
And he had this little fuzz on his upper lip.
He was so proud of it.
You're kidding.
And he called it a mustache?
For a long time now I have blamed myself for your unhappiness and suffering.
And when I think of the music I might have written if not for the guilt which has murdered my vitality all these years!
"But Chopin has seen a happier side of you, it seems."
You can't think that I...
that he and I were lovers?
I'm not sure it was a good idea of yours dedicating the Etudes to her.
Why not?
We are in love.
We can afford to be generous.
They're running away together!
It's a catastrophe!
- It sounds like fun to me.
"- Oh, I see."
Ever the wily peasant you are.
"With Chopin out of Paris, your music no longer suffers the comparison!"

"-No, seriously."

"God, you think I'd make jokes about a thing like this?"
I'm out of my head with worry.
"Look, we're none of us perfect, okay?"
And I won't bore you with all the financial irregularities.
I knew it was wrong what I was doing.
Just thought I'd get away with it.
My mistake.
"They're coming down so hard now, the regulating bodies, on any kind of fraud."
"Fraud, my God!"

"So, what are you saying?"

I've got to cope.
It's Stephen and Julie.
They've both taken it very badly.

Tick-tick-tick.
How about we just cut the cop to psychopath chitchat and you tell me what you want?
I want my bombs back.
The one in the bags or the one in the cemetery?
Your friend is dead.
What do you want?
I want to know what happened to me.
A week ago I went to sleep a stone's throw from where we're standing now.
"The next thing I know, it's what, 2012?"
And I wake up lying on the floor of a tomb.
"Tell me how that's possible, and I'll tell you anything you want to know."
Hey.
"Hey, don't walk away from me."
All right.
Stay here and talk to him.
About what?
About what happened.
I don't know what happened.
"You have, like, 50 theories."

"""Emerson Hauser."""
This was his case.
I think it's a quantum thing.
Imagine a water bug on the surface of a pond.
And he sees this twig sticking out of the water.
"When it rains, the water level rises."
"He thinks the twig is moving, when, in reality, the one dimension he's capable of perceiving is moving."
Not the twig.
"You don't know what happened, do you?"
"What's wrong, you're not getting in?"
Looks like I have to go in his car.
"Don't eat bread Mi Jin, or you may trigger your allergies!"
Please eat your meals when you are at Sunshine Welfare!
Sunshine Welfare?
Why are you telling her to not eat that?
She is allergic to flour.
"If she eats foods containing flour, she'll have reactions."
This time the infection got into her trachea which is making her show signs of asthma.
It is extremely dangerous.
"Because she's on welfare, she doesn't have to worry about the hospital fees."
Welfare?
They're not on it.
"I don't have a lot of time, so let's hurry."
They're not on welfare.
I think the nurse was misinformed.
Do you know those children?
They live in the basement of my apartment building.
"It's them, please stop the car."
What's wrong?
"Hey, you were told to not eat food having flour."
Why are you still eating that?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Chase after them!
Why do I have to chase them?
Hurry!
Didn't you both hear that she can't eat bread?
Are you okay?
Did you get hurt?
Go.
Are you all right?
It was just so unoriginal.
Made me feel sorry for him.
My second husband was a pinch more creative.
Cheated on me with my sister but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious.
"So at least some mind games, some intrigue."
"But my last husband, he was a gem."
He was a veritable master at covering his tracks.
"I mean, I pored over his phone records, I intercepted his credit-card bills I had him followed on numerous occasions and never found a single shred of evidence."
It wasn't until he died that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress.
"But the real master, I have to say, is me."
"Three husbands, countless boyfriends, I haven't been caught yet."
ANNA:
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."

"Dana, I'm working."
I'm still going over some offering statements.

"I have no champagne, so here... this will have to do."
Here you go.
"Drink away, man!"
When is the big day?
All right.
"You know that I like... there's this bowling tournament in Las Vegas, I wanted to go to, so I figure..."
I'll just take care of everything at once.
"Like, I got a thousand dollars saved up already, all I need is like... 4,000 more dollars."
"Please, don't ask me for money, bro'."
"- Not from you, from the store."
"- I can't do it, man."
You told me the other day how much you're taking in a week.
- You don't understand.
- I'll pay you back.
- It's not that.
"- Then, what?"
- There's some shit you don't know.
- What?
What I don't know?
"Right now, for all intents and purposes, your father owns la bodega."
- Get the fuck out of here!
"- Mickey, I ain't fucking around."
Why do you think I took over the store?
- You think I want to run this?
"- No, but your papá..."
"Yo, listen man."
"Your father told me I had no choice,"
Eddie's into him for 25 fucking grand.
"How is he gonna give your father 25 grand, and he's not gonna give me nothing?"
What the fuck!
"Look, chill, man."
"Amaar,"
"I would love to help, but this is the kind of thing that takes a 125% of your energy and faith, and I just can't commit to something"
I don't believe anymore.
OK.
"Wow, I knew you were having a crisis of faith, but I didn't realize it was that bad."
Why is it bad?
Maybe it's good!
Maybe this is the best decision I've ever made!
"OK, Sarah."
"Well, I'm always here if you need to talk."
Uh-huh!
OK.
"Well, that's one Muslim down."
Let's hope the rest of them convert before you build
"That mosque of yours, eh?"
[ laughing ] [ choking ]
What a waste of perfectly good goat curry!
I could still eat that if you want.
Hey!
How do you want to pay for that today?
Uh... with my credit card.
- OK...
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Would it be more suspicious if I use cash to pay for the fertilizer?
- No.
"- Um, I disagree."
I think cash would be much more suspicious.
"And yes, to answer the question your face is asking,"
I am a Muslim.
OK...
Does that mean you get like a discount or something?
I should get a discount!
- No.
"Not a problem if you are, just be harder to join in some of the banter."
"Any part of car mechanics you're interested in, as it goes?"
"To be honest, none of it... as it goes."
"- More interested in bikes, is it?"
"- No, the media."
Or law.
"Look, no offence, but I'm never going to work in a place like this."
- Place like this?
"- You know, a place like this."
"Manual, dirty."
"Not stupid exactly, but not academic by a long chalk!"
"It's not that I'm better than this, it's just that I am much cleverer than you need to be to work here."
Steve here's got a BTEC.
Exactly.
"I suspect the mix-up'll be sorted today, I'll be gone tomorrow."

You don't mind helping out today then?
"No, course not."
"Just the once, eh?"
"Right, Cholmondley-Warner."
We need some stuff picking up from the suppliers.
Fine.
I'll just get a pen and paper.
Great.
"OK, we need two tins of tartan paint."
Tartan paint times two.
- Spirit level bubbles.
- Bubbles for spirit level.
"- D'you need anything, Wolfie?"
"- Yeah, ask him for a reach around."
- A reach around.
Can you imagine Rickie in a high-security prison.
- Who'd supply his make up?
- Do you think it might be possible...
you not make everything into a joke.
"Angela, there is nothing to worry about."
"Harlin, this guy Tino knows, he's been busted with a gun..."

It's no big deal.
You know what I'd really like?
To be put out of my misery.
- Are you kidding?
This is fun.
- Fun?
Everyone running around all upset and rumors flying.
Can't you feel it in your fingers and your toes?
It's like being alive.
It is such a rush.
- You're out of your mind.
- Last year?
That rumor about me and Mark Hammer in the orchestra pit...
during the talent show?
"In that case it was true, but..."
"man, all that conversation."
People writing notes.
"They look at you different, like, trying to figure out who you really are."
Like you're famous.
Admit it.
It's really great.
I don't know what you are talking about.
"Come in, gentlemen."
"So, Mr. Krakow?"
I thought a lot about what you said.
I have even pleaded.
Now I shall use my hands.
Ouch!
"Hey you, now when your boss is getting beaten.."
..you are planning to escape?
"Hey, Iet me go."

"And you still havent got a place to stay, right?"
You also look hungry.
This means that you are a decent man.
"Brother, all this comes Iaterfirst tell me.."
..what are yourfuture plans?
I mean where will you go?
-Wherever my legs leads me to.
Thats good too.
"Then brother, tell your legs to follow me."
My mansion isjust around the corner.
"No, I dont want to be a burden on anyone."
And when my family threw me out of the house..
..I dont share any relationship with you.
Why dont we share a relationship?
We do have a relationship.
"Look you are poor, I am poor."
"And I swear on God, brother the relation.."
..a poor shares with another poor..
..is greaterthan a brother-brother and father-son relationship.
And the truth is I swear on God..
..you have made a place in my heart.
Come.
What is the matter with you?
What the fuck kind of people are they?
We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.
But the first time I realized how different was when Mickey had a hostess party.
"-Karen, where you from?"
-Lawrence.
"Ah, yeah, Lawrence."
Out on the island.
That's nice.
I'm from Miami.
You ever been there?
"It's okay, but it's like you died and woke up in Jew heaven."
Angie stop picking at that thing.
I'd like to smack his face.
The red-haired guy?
He looks like a farmer...
I'm tellin' ya I can't get through the gate without this guys hands all over me.
"So I told him, ""Keep your fucking hands off me, or I'll cut them off."""
She means it.
He's lucky. I just mention this to Vinnie--
How can you mention it?
Vinnie'd kill him.
"Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard, then he'll be there for life."
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?
He was in an argument.
A lousy $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.
The gun goes off.
Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears finds out he's in jail she has a heart attack and drops dead right on the spot.
Now Jeannie has a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
We are so overdue for this.
Ah.

"Dad's flight took off late, when what should appear but a Thanksgiving miracle!"
"Agent DiNozzo, I presume?"
The elusive Jake.
It's nice to know Bishop hasn't been catfishing us all year-- I was starting to wonder.
"Well, you can stop wondering, Tony."
"As you can see, Jake is quite real."
Unless he's a hologram that can shake hands.
NSA's actually working on one of those-
- I've seen the prototype.
"Yeah, that'd be pretty fun."
Really?
No.
Ah.
Aha.

That's too bad-- 'cause I'd like one of those.
I like him.
He's quick.
"Hey, speaking of quick, how'd you get all the way up here?"
Arrival pickups never get past Customs.
"It's all about the badge, Bish-- you got to know how to flash it."
Oh.
"Oh, my."
The classic Smelly Guy.
Yet another vivid hue in the broad spectrum of airport humanity.
Did he come straight from the gym?
Friends?
Ha!
- You are fatally sweet.
- Hm.
I wonder if George will be there.
She has the most alarming way of turning up everywhere I go.
I'm beginning to find it unnerving.
She has a desperate purpose.
What do you mean?
A while ago she was out drinking and gambling... she leads a rough life... and she boasted that...
Let's not talk about it.
I fear I am about to commit a tremendous faux pas.
"Socially she is too bizarre, but somehow I find her very compelling."
I wonder if she is different when alone.
She boasted that you are to be her next lover.
Alfred was there.
He's still the love of her life.
He put money on it you wouldn't be seduced.
"Yes, they made you the object of a bet."
"Well, you know she's eternally in need of money."
Here we are.
You have the most priceless expression on your face.
There's Mallefille.
We can be sure George is here.
He's still following her like a tail.
"Darling, it's so good to see you."
- I didn't know you'd be here.
- I didn't either.

You could if you were drunk and had enough ketchup.
"- Morning, Richie."
- Do my senses deceive me?
Has Eddie Catflap emerged from the arms of Morpheus or perhaps an elephant has blown off?
No.
Right first time.
"It is I, smelly Eddie."
To whiff him is to love him.
"Ready for anything, as long as it's alcoholic."
"- Morning, Richie."
- Where's my shopping list?
Gas mask.
"Now then, shall we have seven courses or eight?"
Don't want do look ostentatious.
But don't want to look like a bloody pauper.
Better make it 12.
We could be like the Romans and throw up between courses.
Why should they get the credit for that idea?
I've been doing it for years.
"Morning, Richie."
"Twelve gas masks, clothes peg for nose, smelling salts and a ticket to Australia to get away from Eddie's whiff."
"- I said, morning, Richie!"
- Ah!
"I got you, then, didn't I?"
I got you.
"Morning, Eddie."
I trust you slept well?
That was.
-.
That was...
There's nothing to move.
I...
I was...
I had a sunburn.
"Good night, sir."
Now we will enjoy looking at the fish!
See and take in with your eyes all the beauty the ocean has to offer!
"As these new things come at you, you may not have seen them before, but be open to them and find the beauty within."
"Hey, buddy."
Yep.
Thanks a lot for bringing me to Problem Island.
What are we gonna do for an encore?
Talk about all the people that we slept with before we were married and really stir shit up?
What the hell are you talking about?
The therapist is trying to create a problem in my marriage that doesn't exist!
"Maybe he's not creating them, maybe he's just noticing them."
"Okay, you know what?"
Don't start with me.
I'm serious.
I don't need it.
"These are the best in the world at what they do, all right?"
"If Jeff Gordon told you that your oil was low, you might want to think about changing it."
"From the bucket, feed them!"
My therapist is kind of pushy.
Really?
Yeah.
"God, I like ours."
"Yeah, he said that Dave and I take each other for granted."
"That, you know, our relationship has become more like a job."
"I've only written in the figure ""1""."
Fill in as many zeros as you fancy
Then you'll see how easy forgetting is
Are you joking?
Or are you illiterate?
"I'm lettered, but not for sale"
Is it the wrong time on a wrong day?
"No, you're welcome anytime."
My decision won't change
Nice knowing a man who can't be bought whatever the price
But if you want to sell...
Are you responding to our ad?
Not quite what you assume
I'll see her out
"Om, how did you find her?"
"Forget it, Ma"
Your exams are around the corner and you're keeping up at nights
What are you upto?
Studies?
Or are you at the computer?
"I make my grade, don't I?"
"In studies, in sports, entertainment"
You ask my principal what I mean to the college
I need a loan to buy a software.
Loan...?
Yes.
Loan.
I'll pay it back
You will...?
"First, prove something to me"
Prove...?
What did Jai prove to you?
"What I mean is if he could stay in the sick bay he'd be out of their hands, you see."
- Who would be out of whose hands?
- Your son.
- What are you trying to tell me?
- I can hear everything.
My quarters are just opposite.
These punishments...
Is my...
Is Mr. Crawford the only one punished?
"No, but when two or three get beaten, he's always one of them."
It's got to stop.
"On the lower deck, men are beginning to think..."
- Think what?
- What I mean is...
"Mr. Scott-Padget's compliments, sir."
"He begs you for an audience, sir."
"At once, if possible."
"He said it is of the most vital importance, sir."
"- Mr. Crawford, go to sick bay."
"- No, sir, I'm not ill."
Honestly.
"Please, may I take him your answer, sir?"
I'll deliver it myself.
- You asked to see me.
- I didn't expect you to come.
I want to thrash you and clap you in irons but that would suit you very well.
"- I fail to understand, sir."
- Do you?
I won't follow your previous captains onto the beach.
Understood?
"- Now, what do you want?"
- Only to be restored to duty.
- Mm...
"Not a big chance, no."
"- Sarah, please."
In the name of all that's holy.
I am the one who bought you your first bra.
I'm not above playing the guilt card.
"Sorry, Mom."
- Who'd you tell?
"- Come on, Mom!"
You spent a night in jail for smoking pot.
This family should have a Bat-Signal for things that good.
Don't worry about it.
"If I were you, I would be trying to live great stories."
You've had too much responsibility for too long.
Yeah.
I know.
Being good for this family has been my sole purpose of existence for as long as I can remember.
I don't know.
"Maybe it's the residual cannabis talking, but what is the meaning of life supposed to be the rest of my life?"
To enjoy it.
However you want.
"Mom, you don't have to worry about being good."
You should just be worried about having fun.
You might want to draw the line at things that get you arrested.
Yeah.
"Well, if it's all right with you,"
I am gonna take a shower for about an hour.
- Here.
- Thank you for picking me up.
"Of course, Mom."
I know you'd do the same for me.
Sorry.
You folks need any help?
We're fine.
Just a little trouble with a tire.
"For your own safety, you shouldn't be on the shoulder any longer than necessary."
"We're leaving now, officer Thank you."
We're clear.
It started.
Briefing's started.
We're not going out today.
We don't have to go to briefing.
"I know, but nervous is nervous, and when he doesn't see me..."
- ... he starts to think I'm in trouble.
- That's just his overactive imagination.
I have a feeling he's gonna see you soon enough.
So the records of gasoline consumption and mileage have not been accurate.
Therefore the logs are gonna have to be adjusted.
The following officers will report to the clerk immediately following briefing.
Patterson.
Wilson.
Sylvia.
"Johnson, T.J."
Poncherello!
Get away from the door.
I said get away.
Excuse me.
"Sorry, sarge, I couldn't hear you."
"We couldn't hear him, right?"
"- No, actually, we're looking at these..."
- Baker.
That's aiding and abetting.
I don't want to see that face.
"Come on, we're not even on duty."
"Whatever we do, we gotta do it fast."
"I gotta get back, gotta find my wife, you know?"
What do you got?
You see her?
That's my wife.
Jennifer?
Shane?
"God, Shane, there you are!"
I've been looking all over for you.
"Jennifer, what are you doing here?"
"Look, I heard at the salon that you were coming to this crazy singles' island, so I just felt a strong sense of urgency that you and I needed to talk before it was too late."
"Jennifer, you left me, remember?"
"I know, I know."
But then I was hoping that you would come after me.
It wasn't like you walked out of a bar!
It was a divorce.
And why are you even at this place?
Do you know this place is insane?
I'm getting called names.
"I've been called a cougar, a black panther, a puma!"
I had to smack this one kid.
That's the last time he'll walk up to a woman talking about cougar!
Yeah.
I've been looking all over the place for you.
And where have you been?
"Well, actually, I'm staying on the other side, the couples' side, with my girlfriend."
What?
Who?
Her name is Trudy and she's aspiring to be a manager.
Put it in my mouth!
"Go, go, go!"
Trudy?
That's what I meant.
it's crazy but I like it.
Bull.
I know you're a little upset about this poem thing. but--
"He said I could make $10,000 a night."
Ten thousand dollars?
Ten thousand American dollars?
"Well, Bull, you're not serious about this?"
"You know, you people always assume you know what's best for me."
"Well, I'll tell you something, you don't."
Maybe it's time to shake up my life.
"Bull, you don't just become a wrestler overnight."
It takes a lot of time and training.
"If you decide to take up wrestling, you're gonna have to quit your job here."
"Now, I want you to take some time and really think about this."
okay-
I quit.
Oh.
He's not serious.
"Well, I mean, he'll cool down and then he'll change his mind."
I hope he's wearing boxer shorts.
[WOMAN SCREAMSI
Briefs.
This is ridiculous.
Bail reports don't just vanish into thin air.
Bull has been gone a week and this place has already turned upside down.
"Yeah, and it doesn't just stop with the paperwork."
It's open season on us in the courtroom.
"Well, word's out on the street Bull's gone."
Somebody's gotta keep order around here.
"Well, that's Dirk's job."
Hi. everybody.
There you--go.
[Spits out drink]
Warm.
You can't do anything right.
- Help me up.
- Where are you gonna go?
"- Shut up, nurse!"
- And don't bump it.
Fat bitch.
Why do you put up with that guy?
I've had it.
"Arthur was famous for two things, bad wigs and carrying a gun."
You've owed me money for 30 years!
Musicians!
Ah!
They're the scum of the earth.
"He raised his palsied hand, and took aim."
"Every one of you, you'll all die!"
Arthur!
"Put the gun down, Arthur!"
I'm the genius.
I made you!
[Screaming]
"By him shooting down at his own bottle, he hit the weakest part of the bottle, which is where the valve is connected, 'cause there's a hole in the bottle."
"That would've forced the valve up, the bottle would've opened up like a--a flower, instantly, blown all the oxygen out of it."
"It would have been a catastrophic, uh, explosion, and he was as close as you can get to it, so it would've taken him out."
Who are you?
Arthur screwed everyone he ever worked with.
I'm the genius!
I made you!
[Screaming]
"But in the end, he gave Jerry and the Atrics an ending to their song."
Did you talk to the Queen?
- I can not talk to the Palace.
And the Prime Minister?
- Still unattainable.
Do you want to be reached?
We are ready.
"- Carlos, what does he do here?"
We will not go anywhere.
- Why?
There is an emergency meeting.
- What the hell is going on?
All flights were canceled due to cosmic interference.
"Excuse me, one that?"
"- A solar storm, exactly."
"The satellites are dead, some are precipitated."
"For security reasons, you have to stay here."
Here in Istanbul?
"- No, here at this hotel."
All foreign dignitaries will be concentrated here.
How long will we have to wait?
"- One day, one week."
You do not know.
"Do you remember the Icelandic volcano, Eyjajafufukukul?"
Eyjafjallajökull.
- Yup.
I have to go back to Belgium right away.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
This situation is a disadvantage for everyone.
I had to receive a promotion this week.
"If we can not fly, we'll be in the car."
"By car, through the Balkans?"
- Yup.
"- Yo, Graff."
Why don't you come driving with us tonight?
That would be exciting.
If I were in a coma.
You'll be excited.
Later.
- l could have handled that.
- Yeah.
You're doing great.
"No, no. I'm asking a particular question. ls it fair?"
- What does fair have to do with it?
- Fair has to do with what?
Anybody?
Fair has to do with the right to come to school...
"and be able to do your work, and not be terrified."
Not have your heart beating fast.
Not jump every time there is a loud noise.
The right to come in and be left alone.
No?
Maybe not everybody is left alone anyway.
Meaning what?
"You don't know what goes on around here, okay?"
Maybe some people have guns to protect yourself.
"Maybe some people who have guns are like victims, too."
And they're like forced to carry.
You think kids with guns are like gangsters or dealers.
Your saying that if someone is threatened it's okay for them to carry...
a gun in school?
You don't think the school authorities can protect them?
"Man, you don't know what goes on around here."
Yes. lf l was--
"Say I was threatened, and I'm not saying that I am..."
"You know when you just wake up, and you're sick, and you're just waiting to suck it down."
"Aw, man you could hawk one of those ten feet, easy."
"No, no, no... it's better to blow them out your nose."
"No, no, it's better to suck."
"Now, those are not the best loogies."
My cousin hawked a loogie from the top of the Empire State Building.
Hit a lady in the head.
Killed her.
He's in prison now.
In prison for snot.
"Boom, boom."
"Okay, you guys, come on."
We place here in the time capsule...
The sacred shoe box.
"Okay, in the sacred shoe box, the things we do not understand, to be opened again when all the mysteries of the universe have been revealed to us."
Who's first?
Kevin.
"I found it in my mom's secret drawer, in this plastic box."
I know what this is.
It goes in the bottom of the bathtub to stop the drain.
"No, it doesn't."
It's a diaphragm.
It prevents the passage of sperm into the uterus... in girls.
How do you know that?
I saw it on Nightline.
"I'm telling you, Frank, it goes in the bottom of the bathtub."
I think it's a travel drinking cup.
She'll never miss it.
"Wait, don't drink out of it until we know what it is."
Yeah.
Brad.
I found it in my sister's room.
Is she dangerous?
She's a Wraith!
"Although, I have to admit, she does seem a little different."
"Now remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground."
Like this?
A little more.
Now why is distillation an important step?
To remove the toxins from the ferrison root?
Precisely.
"We wouldn't want the serum to send you into paralytic shock now, would we?"
No father.
Seriously.
Have you ever seen anything like this before?
No I have not.
She's unlike any Wraith I've ever encountered.
What if it's all an act?
"If she were a killer, why would he protect her?"
Maybe the act is for his benefit too.
"No, they live here together, Rodney."
"If she were like other Wraith, he would be her first victim."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Go ahead.
I just got back with Beckett.
Ronon's gonna take him up to the cave.
I'm gonna check in with the villagers.
What are you gonna tell them?
I'm still working on that.
This equipment's remarkable.
Where did you get it?
"Oh, here and there."
"Let's start by analysing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Yes, of course."
"Yes, Pauline."
It'll all be fine.
Have a seat first...
- I won't go back!
"- Now come, first sit down."
It's so hot...
- Won't you take off your coat!
- Yes.
Do you see that?
"What should I see, Mrs John?"
"Well, take a closer look!"
Where is the child that I'm having?
Mrs John!
"Well, it just happens that one loses a child before it's born."
But for me it's the second time and it'll always be that way...
But you were seven months pregnant!
Was I?
"No, it happened in the fourth month... quite suddenly..."
My husband had just gone on tour.
Thank God he didn't notice anything.
"Yes, and..."
"Then I wanted to adopt a child, but... the girl left..."
And since then I've played a part.
No one has noticed anything.
But why haven't you told the truth?
"Because he is a man, Pauline!"
"A handsome, strong man..."
"Because there are plenty of young things that can have a baby, like yourself!"
Because our greatest happiness would be if we were to have one...
I've always wished for one and so has he... to raise someone...
small for the future...
"Well, why do you think he's so long on the road?"
I don't know how long its been since I've seen that.
You're like a miracle worker.
It's all a part of the process.
"But for now, your chest only, okay?"
It feels so good.
Could you maybe...
Not on the first visit.
It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that.
"I know, but--"
What if this is the only erection I ever get?
I may not have another chance.
You will.
I promise.
Please.
"I wouldn't ask, except... it would mean a lot to me."
"I-I'm not a young man anymore, and..."
Please?
I do not understand it when we've gone over and over this time and time again!
I'm so sorry.
I-I--
You risked compromising his entire treatment!
And for what?
I felt he was so distracted by his need.
- I thought that if I just--
- You crossed a line that cannot be crossed.
And if the surrogate doesn't understand the boundaries--
"But I do know the boundaries, and-- and he did end up feeling--"
Do not tell me that it's okay because it worked.
You cannot play fast and loose with my patients that way.
I am sorry.
You're right.
I-I really apologize.
No.
"I've just come from work, actually!"
I just thought I'd...
I'm trying to make my hair and coat sort of join.
So we don't know where one ends and one begins?
Like a sort of Camden owl.
LAUGHTER
"Now then, where does your style come from?"
Em...
"And this sounds rude, but were you always like this?"
I guess so.
My mum's quite stylish.
Yeah.
My dad used to be.
"In the '70s, he'd wear mental clothes."
"Like yellow flares and tops with stars on them, then he went quite straight in the '80s."
You had young parents.
Your mum was 18?
"Yeah, really young."
So they were really cool and dressed like they were in Black Sabbath.
Then all of a sudden in the '80s my dad got quite square.
"""That's enough of yellow flares."
"I'll just wear a shirt and some leisure trousers."""
"He just stopped, but my mum carried on."
Where was this?
In South London.
What was hilarious was they had this three-wheeler car called a Bomb Bug.
An orange thing and the roof went up like that.
So not only did they wear yellow flares and had a three-wheeled orange triangle car...
I was just a laughing stock!
"It sounds like you grew up in a cartoon, didn't you?"
"It was a bit like Roobarb and Custard, yeah."
- Asshole!
"So I don't care about a neurotical, I mean... he got me to stop eating sushi for about 20 min."
But then I said... seize the damn!
I'm not gonna be sway
"I mean... it's not that I'm dying to tear it out but... honestly, what's the worst thing that can happen?"
"I get a tapeworm and I eat what I like, and still..."
lose 20 pouds?
"I'd rather be like Karen Carpenter... on the top of the world, looking down on creation."
Wouldn't that be dreaming?
"But enough about ""moi""."
What did you say your name was again?
- Jocelyn.
- And you work at...
- Skirt Magazine.
"- Roxanne Rochet, I love her like a sister!"
- What do you do there?
- You know... this and that.
"Details, darling!"
"Are you a writer, a stylist?"
"- I'm a ""head plan""."
- Excuse me?
- The resident xerox core.
- And what is this?
I'm an intern.
She's an intern
She's an intern
"A pathetic, nulling intern"
Slaved little intern
Fax this Xerox that
Slaved little intern
Get me coffee Kiss my ass
Sometimes she may get the blues But everyone would spin and lose
"I'm only thinking of you, josie."
What about nick?
He's disloyal!
He goes down with the rest!
"Must everyone go down except you, jim?"
You don't realize what you're doing.
People are losing everything.
They're suffering.
They're being ruined.
They're killing themselves.
"You're hated, jim."
"But only by the little people, josie."
"Are we any different than little people, jim?"
I was one when i met you.
You made me big with your courage and your ideas and your money.
"But if this is what it means, i don't want it, jim."
It comes too high.
What do we care what the world is saying?
"Tomorrow, i'll buy it and give it to you!"
I don't want it!
"Right now, there are only two people in this world that count-you and me!"
I'm just beginning to feel the power that's in me.
I know now that nothing can stop me.
Whatever stands in my way must go down!
"Jim, i don't know you."
I'm almost afraid of you.
"No, you're not afraid of me."
"You're afraid of life, josie."
But i'm going to make you love it as much as i do as much as i love you.
"What's happened to you, jim?"
You used to be kind and generous.
You were the kindest man i ever knew.
Will he kneel down when he asks her?
They always kneel down.
"What is wrong, dearest?"
Willoughby?
What is the matter?
Forgive me...
I am sent...
Lady Allen exercised the privilege of riches upon a dependent cousin.
- She is sending me to London.
- This morning?
What a disappointment.
"Your business won't detain you for long, I hope?"
You are kind.
But I have no idea of returning immediately to Devonshire.
- I am invited only once a year.
- Can you wait for our invitation?
My engagements are of such a nature...
I dare not flatter my...
It's folly to linger in this manner.
I will not torment myself further.
"Willoughby, come back!"
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea for Marianne.
"- What is wrong, my love?"
- Do not ask me questions.
- They must have quarrelled.
- That is unlikely.
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves of his regard for Marianne.
- An excuse to send him away.
- Then why did he not say so?
- It's not like him to be secretive.
- What do you suspect?
- Why was his manner so guilty?
We mean get arrested by the store detective.
It was just a pun.
We have every intention of paying for this item.
"Ooh, Eddie, it'd be funny if somebody knocked that lot down."
"Not particularly, no."
I'm disappointed myself.
"Come, Eddie, for fruit."
It is the absolute sophis thing to offer fruit after the meal.
So refreshing and it comes in handy for the sex games.
"No, not this."
"Look, ridiculous."
"Oh, this is disgusting."
All this fruit is crushed and bruised.
I shall write to Esther Rantzen.
"- Ah, the meat, Eddie."
- Ha.
Load up the trolley.
They'll have been playing golf
- so they'll be ready for hearty vitals.
- Look at this little lamb chop.
"It was probably once a pig, gambolling in the mountains."
Yeah.
"Doingy, doingy, doing."
I could quite fancy myself as a farmer.
"Well, it's a good job you do fancy yourself cos I can't see that anyone else is going to do it."
"Eddie, do you see this frozen chicken?"
"Er, yes."
"Oh, urh."
Frozen tackle might teach you not to cheek me.
"Richie Rich, do you see this frozen chicken?"
- No.
- I think you do.
"""Why are you still watching this?"" ""You missed a lot of other stuff."
"He hates women."""
I looked at one of those fake asses for about five...
"Shut up, guys."
Not now.
Not this close to the end.
Don't you leave me.
Lock those doors.
They are locked?
So all the doors are locked.
I looked at one of those things for five minutes.
"I was like, ""You know what?"
"If no one was ever gonna know, then, yeah, I'II have sex with it."
"I'm gonna jerk off anyway."" Fellas, am I right?"
The shittiest choreographed ending.
All right.
Just me.
Just me.
"I thought we'd all stand up and get into it, but..."
"Women, I don't know if you know this about men... but when we're in our 20s and our brain is, ""Jerk off right now,"" we're like, ""You got it."
"You got it."""
"When we're in our 30s and our brain is, ""Jerk off right now,"""
"I promise you, all of us are like,"
"""When the fuck does this stop?"
I don't wanna do this shit anymore.
It's been 20 goddamn years.
I haven't liked it for ten.
I just kept doing it 'cause I thought I'd die.
"Stay away from me... and stay away from my family."""
"My question is, if you buy one of those fake asses... where do you even keep that?"
"""I keep mine under the bed."""
"Do you, you lunatic?"
"And by ""champagne"" I mean wine, and by ""bottle"" I mean box."
"Uh, you know what?"
We'll take it here.
Would there happen to be a 7 Eleven Merlot?
"Max, wine in our room sounds so much better."
We can relax and focus on each other for once.
"Mm, great."
What's the room number?
Oh.
I think she means oh-six.
I don't think so.
That room is still an active crime scene.
"Stowaways, huh?"
I'll have the Coast Guard come and pick you up.
They're already coming for that guy.
I didn't wanna strip my clothes off and try to drive the boat.
It was that voodoo curse.
"Damn you, Tim!"
"Look, dude, if you're really a mentalist, you'll know that I need to get to Texas to see my boyfriend."
I can tell that you're telling the truth.
"Please, there has got to be a way we can work something out."
We'll do anything.
"Well, she will."
I'll do over the shirt stuff.
Your shirt.
If you take off that hat.
Is there anywhere in the world where I don't have to be a waitress?
Hooters?
Thanks.
I'm a cocktail waitress on the Mississippi River.
This is a worse vacation than the one with Ed Helms in it.
"Sorry, sir."
"Well as I am going below, continually below, that girl was laughing because of my touch."
- Interesting.
I dreamed things like this.
- Really.
And what?
"Is shivering even now my back, if I remember him when you touched my navel."
How do you fold that box?
What kind of work is this?
"Did you say something, kind Tót?"
"He said nothing, respectable major lord."
"Only...only...his new habit for him, that holds a piece of meat in his mouth and does not swallow it until clocks."
Well why does not spit it out?
"Spit it out if you cannot swallow it, my sweet good Lajos."
Show me
I think you understand that there is a limit to my patience.
I'm done.
"Oh, my God."
Is packing. he leaves.
What will be with our Gyula?
"You have to go in to it promptly now, you have to ask an apology."
- I do not go.
- But you go in.
Right now.
"- That god is not, that let me go in."
- Lajos!
- Daddy!
- Where are you Lajos?
"- What's up with you, daddy?"
- Leave me alone in peace.
- Think of our son.
"Our only son, my sweet good Lajos."
"The colds, the big Russian colds come."
"- You can't carry a gun, Rickie."
- l don't.
Because it would be really bad.
Tragically bad.
"Angela, I don't carry a gun. I wouldn't even know how to shoot one."
But didn't Brian see you?
Isn't that what he's going to tell them?
This is really serious.
People are going to think you are dangerous.
I know.
That's what I want.
"So, what did happen?"
My cousin brought it in to sell it.
And I got real mad at him for bringing a gun into school.
"So, we got into this big argument..."
and the next thing I knew the thing fell out of the box and went off.
And he peed in his pants and ran away.
- He did not.
- He did.
Big stain.
And that's what happened with the gun?
That's the whole story of the gun.
And now Brian is going to say you did it.
"- l'm telling you, I hope he does."
"- No, don't be stupid."
You know it's weird.
I always think of you as Rayanne's friend.
"I mean like, you just think of me as..."
"as someone who's just, you know, around."
It's weird how something has to happen sometimes... to see how you actually feel about something.
"Sit down, Mr. Krakow, we're just waiting for our friends..."
from law enforcement.
Don't you remember what you used to say to me?
You swore you'd wait for me.
"She was convenient for you, wasn't she, because she was here."
You took very good care of Mother and Zina.
Very good care.
What are you going to do?
Nothing.
I'll leave you to each other.
Are you alright?
"Yes, thank you."
"Oh, wait."
Take me to the police station.
Your name?
Clementi Sabourin.
What do you want?
I have some valuable information.
Information?
Concerning whom?
"Concerning a very rich man... who is in this country illegally, forged papers."
I'm sure you'll know what to do with his very considerable assets.
Anything we impound goes to the government.
Naturally.
What's this man's name?
"If I tell you, I want the necessary papers to take me to America."
If you are telling the truth... it will be arranged.
Alright.
He's living here under the name of Gerry Monte.
His real name is Sabourin.
He's originally from Czechoslovakia.
He runs a little antique shop near the Porta San Giuseppe.
Treasures stolen from all over the world.
Thank you.
It makes me want to break everything right now
If I can't hear the words I yearn for again
I'd carelessly offer my life
Desires that cuddle
With a fading light
It's lonely
Will the morning sun come before me?
Answer me
Is there a love that binds us?
Stand and face the despair we invited
The wills of the people
Born and destroyed
Choose the future and open the lock
"All groups, commence preparations."
Securing water takes priority.
"Everyone who's not busy, pitch some tents."
Going to fetch some water!
Don't drag your feet.
"Hey, lend a hand with the tent-pitching!"
What a pain.
No thanks.
"- Hey, Kiefer!"
Say something to Ryner!
"- Oh, my poor stomach..."
"Ah... sorry, I didn't hear you."
"Kiefer, the layabout says he won't help with tent-pitching."
"Ryner only listens to you, Kiefer."
"You did something to Kiefer, huh?"
- Not a thing.
"- She's definitely not herself, though."
You're all so dense.
"I mean, we're in a war!"
How are you?
- Good.
And you?
How are you feeling?
"- Thank god, fine."
You're still here?
- I have no complaints.
"Lights and electricity, nothing has changed."
How's your daughter?
Thank god.
She went to talk to Alex.
"Good, good."
It's good seeing you.
"- Yes, you too."
"Hello, everyone."
I'd like us to read the first act that I translated with the help of my daughter Goni who's sitting right here.
And that's my brother-in-law.
"I chose the cast with Alex, or rather at his recommendation, since I don't know any of you."
But...
The recommendations were very strong.
Yes.
"Hello, everyone."
Don't mind me.
"In any case, Alex suggested we read ""The Enchanted Nose"""
with the junior company.
I thought...
"Excuse me, dear actors,"
"I see you're taking the text out of the envelopes, is this the first time you've seen it?"
"I'm sorry, they only informed us yesterday, we're rehearsing all the time, you expect too much of us."
A serious actor is supposed to prepare at home.
"Yitzhak, don't be so hard on them."
"In the past, I would've got up and left."
-You don't talk much.
-Neither do you.
You've figured it out haven't you?
"The less you say, the more people will reveal about themselves."
"Until little by little, they have divulged every last bit of who they are."
Because what people want most...
Is to be known.
"So, do you use that knowledge for good or for evil?"
I use it for myself.
Kiss me.
Where?
"Well, put your hands here, like that, and then"
I go like this.
"And you pull me in like that, and close your eyes."
-You wanna smoke a J?
"-No, that's not really my thing."
"You said you had a headache, though."
This is perfect for that.
"Honey, I'm already on so many painkillers;"
I don't need anything else.
"See, that's where you're wrong - marijuana is the safe alternative to that."
"Plus, you inhale it, so it works faster."
What the hell?
"Live dangerously, right?"
Ugh... it tastes like shit.
"No, no - it tastes good."
Actually I got it from my friend and he got it from a friend from another friend off the coast of Madagascar.
I guess it came up on a piece of driftwood.
I do feel better.
Is that- is that normal?
"Oh yeah, that's normal."
"Well, in that case."
What about the Egyptian press?
What about the rest of the world?
They are colonialists.
I don't care if they have an agreement.
"These things are for Egypt, not for the amusement of a British aristocrat."
"Yes, monsieur, I understand."
Very well.
As you wish.
They say we must wait.
Go back to the tomb and watch them.
"If they break the terms of the concession in any way whatsoever, call me immediately."
The slightest infringement and we shall take control of the tomb.
You understand?
HOWARD:
We've counted over 600 objects in this room alone.
Everything has to be wrapped and protected.
"So far, we've used over half a mile of cotton wadding and 16 bales of calico, and we're only halfway through."
"- Good morning, gentlemen."
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, Howard."
- This is Harry Burton.
"If you need any photographs, speak to him."
I won't allow any other photographers in here.
"Oh, my God."
It's extraordinary.
"Carter, look at this."
"Oh, my God!"
"Evelyn, come and see this."
"Oh, that's beautiful."
Aren't they lovely?
HOWARD:
This must be his wife.
Give it up for...
The amazing Mr Lifto
"It's not my call but for security reasons, you guys have to leave there."
It's all good...
"Dude, that was my beer."
This song's about.... fucking...
I'm drunk.
And right now I'm so (in love with you).
And I (don't want to think too much about what we...) ...should or shouldn't do.
"Lay my hands on heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars,"
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car.
Nothing quite like the feel... of something new.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel...
Thanks man.
"What did you throw up, man, what did you throw?"
Can I have a towel in exchange?
Thanks man...
I swear.
Right now I found everything I need.
"The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins... are listening to me."
Well I want to drink it up and swim in it until I drown.
My moral standing is lying down.
Nothing quite like the feel... of something new.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
I was just making sure you were alive.
"I'm sorry, sweetie, it was a late night."
My head is throbbing.
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home.
"And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it, too."
"It wasn't a party, it was one guy."
Don't be so judgey.
I talked to Roberta at the Grill and... there's still a bartending position open.
If you wanted to get a job.
"Well, I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I work there."
I think she's desperate.
I'll check it out.
- Don't act so surprised.
"- Well, I mean, I just..."
I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
"- Well, there's back grant due."
"- It's back in everything, mom."
"Like I said, I'll check it out."
- Who's that?
- That's Caroline.
Easy.
"Yeah, come in."
"Okay, we're gonna be late, so, let's just get going."
- How are you?
- Good.
Damon hasn't said a word to me.
"Every time I try to talk to him, he shuts me down."
Do you think he's still trying to find Katherine?
I don't know.
"He waited 145 years, only to find out that Katherine could not care less."
"That's gotta hurt, right?"
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
I'd rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
"Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?"
I have to feel sorry for myself.
I'm the only one who cares.
Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.
Really?
In front of your sister?
We shared a room growing up.
This is not news to me.
Excuse me.
I'm going to go wander the streets alone.
"Invisible, unwanted and unloved;"
a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.
I forgot my windbreaker.
It's chilly.
I don't understand.
Is this a way to break in new shoes?
No.
"Once these puppies touch the ground they're mine, and I'll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off."
"Pretty, pretty, pretty."
Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.
The what?
Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard.
Message received.
"Commence operation ""Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."""
Hey.
Seriously?
Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
I wish.
A clique requires friends.
- I didn't have any.
- None?
"- I'll be there, but I can't ask you."
- Why not?
"Well, my mother."
Your mother.
"Well, she wouldn't actually forbid it."
It's just that she gets jealous of anybody at all that I spend my time with.
You don't know her.
You don't have to live with her.
But she's my mother.
There's nothing I can do about that.
"You don't have to tell me any more, Norman."
"Please, Allison, I've gotta tell somebody."
She won't let me have friends.
She... .
She makes me tell her 10 times a day how much I love her.
She's afraid she'll die alone in a poorhouse.
And marriage... .
"Marriage, she says, is misery."
And a woman can only cause me trouble.
"Oh, Norman, I can't believe it."
Nobody would.
"Now maybe you know why I hate to go home and why I live in the library and why I can't dance, or kiss girls, or look anybody in the eye."
"You see, I'm a sissy and a coward."
"No, you're not, Norman."
No one around town stopped to think and give you a chance.
You shouldn't be afraid of girls.
"I know, but I am, and I don't know what I can do about it."
- I know what you can do.
- What?
You can start with me.
I'll prove everything your mother ever said was wrong.
"Would you kiss me, Norman?"
and you call yourself a hero?
anyone not suited to fight this battle should disappear early on.
Well said.
Archer?
I am compelled by Command Seal not to fight you.
I would die just like Rider.
Saber?
that's enough.
My alliance with Emiya-kun is only until we defeat the Master hiding in the school.
Or what?
Do you want to force me to use another Command Seal on you?
Perhaps.
I got carried away teasing her.
Saber.
as well.
I shall overlook your words.
the first thing we need to do is locate her Master.
Caster's Master comes to this school every day.
we should let them be.
In other words we attack before they can return to Ryuudou Temple?
Exactly.
won't they stop coming to school because it's too risky?
That's unlikely.
I doubt Caster's Master still possesses their free will.
That's her style.
Her very first move was probably to turn her Master into a puppet.
That makes sense.
we'll continue our investigation of the school.
we strike.
but how do we look for them?
That's our homework for next time.
We're all tired.
If someone hadn't helped me...
I wouldn't be here.
Hello?
How are you?
I'm good.
"Listen, I hate to ask, but"
I need your help with something.
"Uh, of course."
China has alopecia.
We need to call the vet.
"Um, are you free for lunch?"
Yeah.
"I have some stuff that I need to do for work, but that sounds great."
"So you guys, I've been thinking about a plan."
"You know, right now this could very well be the first stop on our pancake tour of North America."
"Hey, like in On The Road."
That's my favorite book.
"Mine, too."
So here's the deal.
My mom had this boyfriend.
He hired me to work construction last summer.
But then they broke up...he moved away...to Austin.
In Texas?
"Said if I was ever out there look him up, so..."
"I mean, well, that's really kind of far."
We were thinking like Long Beach or something so we can all still hang out.
I'll need to get a couple of days of work so I can get a little bit of travel money.
"Well, I mean, we can get you money."
"Well, I mean, I guess in a way you're kind of lucky."
"You get to move to a whole new place, start over, be whoever you want to be."
That's really not so bad.
"Hey, putz."
"I mean, we both do."
"Ryan, that's enough."
[Sighs]
"Hello, Peter, it's Geoffrey Barkway."
I wonder if you are available.
I'd like you to speak at my conference on human justice.
"Tell me honestly, does my bum look big in this?"
I prefer the pinstripe.
"Now, ties."
What about classic green or this rather happening yellow number?
What do we think?
If you don't get a move on you'll miss the conference.
All right!
OK.
"You have yourself a very, very well-deserved holiday."
"Thank you, I will."
I hope the speech goes well.
Thanks.
"Lyle, don't forget the good name of Kingdom  Kingdom lies in your hands."
And in Scott's.
You may need to be quite firm.
"Don't worry, cometh the hour, cometh the man, and I ameth the man."
"Ahoy, shipmates!"
"- Bon voyage, Mr Snell."
- Wait for me!
- What are you doing?
"- I wouldn't want to miss the party, would I?"
"It's a conference, Simon, a serious conference."
(Starts car)
I'd like to begin by welcoming you to this keynote presentation on the essentially universal subject of human justice.
Given by a small-town solicitor from Market Shipborough.
-Why do you ask?
-Mm.
Might she remember?
"No, she was heavily sedated."
It's serious?
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
-May I ask...?
-We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts.
A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
"Excuse me, madam."
Anything else?
"No, Karl, we're fine."
Thank you.
"It's all right, Karl."
Why are you asking all this?
It's strange.
"The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl."
"And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil it isn't likely he would fall from a window."
"Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found."
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.
No.
My hunch....
My opinion... point one.
"point two plus the various other things we mentioned would make it very probable probable, not certain that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window."
"But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?"
It could be one way.
If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned.
"Judas Priest, just a second."
-The servants?
They have visitors?
-Not at all.
That's a lot.
I sort of flew off the handle when you said what you did.
I'm sorry.
I don't blame you.
Nick.
Jim's going to ask me to marry him tonight.
What can i say to him?
You know what to say.
"Well, i can't marry him."
L- i don't love him.
You know that.
"I can't help you, josie."
You've known this was coming for a long time.
You've taken everything he's offered you.
Now you've got to pay for it.
But not with love.
"Jim loves you, josie... and i don't."
"If you don't go through with it, everything i ever said about you is true."
"You know, i never asked you... if you'd let me give you a ring for that finger."
Will you put it on?
Nick.
"I had to see you, josie."
"Josie, you did the right thing tonight."
I've been walking the streets for hours telling myself that.
And i want you to know i lied to you.
About you and me?
I knew it.
"Once, i thought that a star on a dressing room door would be worth any sacrifice."
"But the one sacrifice i never figured on... i'm going to make that, nick."
"I'm glad you feel that way about it, josie."
She is so beautiful so lovely all is vanity and vanity will make you blind
do you hear that?
The only thing shot was a bottle of soda.
I don't even know if you should go there alone anymore.
Maybe we should drop you off every morning.
Dad !
The gun was in the school.
We can't be with her all day.
We are not going to change our entire lives over this.
There was one stupid gun shot.
You are not dropping me at school.
God. I'm not an eight years old.
At my school this kid slipped on this wet spot.
And fell.
Like on his face.
Maybe we should take her out of school.
- Honey.
- Put her in private school.
- l wish we could afford that.
- Maybe that's not an excuse.
Maybe we should sacrifice other things.
Like the house in Palm Beach?
This is our daughter we are talking about.
I know.
"Listen, I don't know why the world's gone so crazy..."
and I don't know what to do about it.
I wish we could keep them...
in some kind of bubble to protect them but I know we can't.
I'm not asking for a bubble.
"How about just a place where they can live, and walk to school..."
and become grownups without having to worry about...
guns and Al D S and serial murderers.
That didn't use to be exotic.
That wasn't the province of the rich.
"... havethemon theirknees,beggingme to make the keynote speech."
And then?
A short sojourn to Albany...
... followedbyalongone at the White House.
"If I didn't know better, I'd be bursting with admiration."
I thought I'd come in and find you on your knees.
"Instead, you're turning adversity into triumph."
That's just a reflex.
An old habit of mine.
But it's still good to hear you say it.
The way you say it too.
"""""Adversity into triumph. """""
It's good to know you still believe in me.
Did I say that?
I don't know.
I thought you did.
Don't fathers listen to their sons?
How is your father these days?
I haven't heard you mention him for a while.
Where is he?
"In a nursing home in Crowley, Louisiana."
Plays dominoes with orderlies.
Fulminates over his Cream of Wheat.
Don't be too hard on him.
We can't dictate our finishes.
I don't like the sound of that.
Of course you don't.
Because underneath all that need to believe...
... underalltheconcrete you poured into my pedestal...
... somethingiscryingtogetout.
What?
You know I called Judge Walter Stern.
"I'll keep my eyes closed, I promise."
"He's such a good man, isn't he?"
'I wanted to get Lena's things quickly and get back to the house.
"'I don't know what it was - a feeling, I guess - 'but I was bothered by something."
'Maybe I just didn't trust Higgins with her.
"'Anyway, I'd feel better the sooner I got back to the estate."
"'What I really didn't like was invading the privacy of their home, 'especially since I knew what they'd experienced in the past."
"'I felt strange going through Lena's things, which was silly."
'I'd seen this kind of stuff before.
"'Well, most of it, anyhow."
"'If I couldn't take Saul back to her, 'l could at least take back a pleasant memory.'"
We don't know what we're up against.
This was taken in Suez with my messmates.
"That was in 1946, right after the war."
Karl.
It's dark.
She must be in the main house.
With how many others?
I only have four shots.
Don't worry.
That'll be enough.
"The pictures are wonderful, Higgins."
But I have such a headache.
Do you mind?
"Oh, how inconsiderate of me."
You must be exhausted.
Can I get you anything?
An aspirin?
Some chicken soup?
You're so kind.
Thank you.
Just a little rest.
And no one seems to notice I'm so full of shit.
"Like, this one woman was just eating it up."
"And, on one hand, I felt relieved 'cause, you know, I was getting away with it."
But at the same time...
I felt such... contempt for her.
And then things started really getting bad.
The words I was saying didn't even sound like words anymore.
"And then the walls started making that noise, and I just had to get out of there."
"So I'm sitting in my car, and I'm just......"
Just trying to breathe.
And it's like I'm...
I'm breathing ink.
And then I become the ink.
"I'm like this me-shaped bag of black, viscous ink."
"And even now, as I'm talking to you,"
I still feel...
Kind of gelatinous.
And I'm consumed with an unbearable self-loathing.
And I can hear the furniture whispering.
Maybe we should try adjusting your medication again.
Maybe.
I'm guessing either Carol or Willie Nelson was here.
That bad?
Not if you're in a reggae band.
"So, listen, I, um..."
I'm thinking of staying at my place tonight.
What?
No.
I'll just open some windows.
It's not that.
I just think...
It might be easier if I'm in my place.
- There is hardly any.
"I've heard, ladies used to fancy their dresses, longtime ago."
"But nowadays, why have you ladies become so stingy about it?"
"Now look, what I like to wear is my personal matter."
I see.
"Just like the loafer's personal matter was to whistle, right?"
Any matter which troubles others cannot be personal.
But how does this dress trouble others?
This question suits the loafer who whistled at you.
"An_ay, you seem to be a decent girl from a decent family."
"Ifyou put on some decent dress, then I think it won't trouble anyone."
"An_ay, it's your wish."
"Sawant, take down her complaint."
What's his name?
He just doesn't possess any kind of etiquette.
My case is fixed on the 21th.
And the witness...
Don't talk about the court.
This is a pam.
Have fun.
This is the first time I see you on time.
And...
"Hello, Mr Sahney!"
Have you met my daughter Sheetal?
Hello
"- Sheetal, he is a famous criminal lawyer."
"Mr Sahney, please come with me."
"- Hey, Mr Mehta!"
I've read about your Nihar murder case in the newspapers.
You were just incredible and you won the case.
Really?
Are you interested in such things?
A magic trick?
"- Yeah, I'm talking about a magic trick."
- No.
I used to do it during college exams.
"I can make it appear, I can make it disappear."
We can't risk giving him another agent as a hostage.
We have to do something.
"- All right, Reid, let's go."
Teach it to me.
- What?
No.
"Look, if you can do it, I can do it."
Show it to me.
I've been practicing this my whole life.
We have less than 30 minutes.
"Reid, I am not about to let you get on that train with an armed psychotic."
"We don't have any other choice, do we?"
No.
We don't have any other choice.
Dr. Bryar is definitely one of the top physicists in the world.
He's written hundreds of papers on M-Theory.
Dr. Bryar is definitely one of the top physicists in the world.
He's written hundreds of papers on M-Theory.
I don't understand any of it.
"Oh, he worked for the government for several years in the '80s."
Probably the source of his delusions.
He's been institutionalized for the past nine years.
Until Dr. Deaton took him on a field trip.
Yeah.
What we need is a strategy.
- I'll try to talk to him.
- You think that's wise?
And I'm still waiting on the reply.
Maybe I should pedal.
You look a little tired.
Fine.
Go !
"Frank, hi, it's Julie."
I hope you're okay.
"Caitlin and I are fine, I mean, we're trapped at the ice cream store on the pier, but we're fine."
I guess help is probably on the way.
"Okay, well... take care, bye."
"Look, I understand why you keep on calling Summer and the Cohens, but why Frank ?"
"I mean, weren't you guys supposed to take it down a notch ?"
"Caitlin, just because we're pulling things back a little bit doesn't mean that we've stopped caring about each other."
"I'm sure wherever Frank is, he's worried about us, just like I am about him."
"And I am about myself, because we're stuck here with him."
"The back door is stuck, too."
Looks like there's no way out.
We're trapped.
Figures.
We can't just sit here waiting to be rescued.
Totally.
"No, we should start eating all the melting ice cream."
I want a gold medal ribbon on a...
"Sugar cone, I know."
"Creepy, but convenient."
"Okay, ice-cream guy, start scooping."
"It's Gary, my name."
Okay.
"I'm thinking the roof, or where the roof used to be."
"Ice-cream guy, got a ladder ?"
You can't climb up there.
"I'm not going to, you are."
Come on.
Will you stop it?
Jesse will be here any minute and I need to practice.
Or you could not tell him and before you know it.
We're off to college together sharing a dorm room.
Where I have to listen to you complainin' about how bad you feel.
For not coming clean to Jesse and there's no place for me to hide.
Because I'm trapped with you in a 12-by-12 foot concrete cell.
That's filled with tear-soaked tissues dripping in snot!
"On second thought, yeah, maybe you should tell him."
Well that was a long trip for nothing.
How long have you known me?
Point taken.
[Doorbell ringing]
Now get out of here.
No hang on.
If you're gonna tell him about Hannah.
I should tell him about Lola.
Lilly no one...
Cares!
I get it.
I get it.
"Wow, I really want to tell you you get more beautiful."
Every time I see you.
But that'd be going against my brooding rocker image.
So I'm just gonna say: hey.
That works for me.
"Oh, sweet niblets, can't you at least warn a guy?"
Good thing I got that Smokey and the Bandit marathon running on cable.
You sounded a little nervous on the phone.
Is everything okay?
[Sighs] I'm fine.
And a murder.
And a murder.
Thank you.
And the murder of Amanda Holden.
Rumour on the street is you had beef with Mayor Cowell.
"I have no gripe with anyone, Sleet."
The world and time are linear to me.
I see and hear all things the world chooses to show me.
Look at this one.
Hmm.
"Now, young one, you're obviously not at one with this world yet and that is OK, but listen, let me help you."
"Because deep within all of us is a spirit animal, a spiritual guide."
"Now, most people don't allow this animal to take control, but you must."
Mm-hmm.
"Now my animal is a panther, strong, sleek, unafraid."
His...
Mine is a curious goat.
That was it.
That's nice.
"Well, you know, it's all right, I'm slightly ashamed of it."
You must never be ashamed of your spirit animal.
"Yeah, but it's easy for you to say, you're a panther."
Why did you pick a goat?
"You don't choose your spirit animal, it chooses you."
"Yes, of course."
"We're going to find yours, Dermot."
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Shut your eyes.
Now clear that little mind of yours.
"Now, I want you to think of the second animal that comes into your head, not the first one, but the second one."
Pussycat.
"Learn how to drive, lady!"
I will get to the meeting when I get there.
I looked death in the face today.
Hel... hello.
"Yes, I would like to leave a message."
My husband ordered an eggshell dryer...
"Not talc, not parchment..."
Eggshell.
"Hey, you're home early."
What happened to you?
Doesn't matter.
"So, I called that appliance store, and I demanded that you get the dryer that you wanted."
"Oh, well, it must've worked because they're taking away the wrong one right now."
"Anything for you, princess."
Ooh!
Who's this guy?
"Get over here, sexy."
"If you want to see sexy, I just..."
- Ooh.
- Ah-choo!
Ah-choo!
"Oh, d... what is all over you?"
"- Well, now you are."
- Ah-choo!
What do most of us want from life?
How about someone to love?
Somewhere to live?
Somewhere to work?
And something to hope for.
"Love, home, work, hope - ambitious maybe, but those four expectations define a good life and have done for generations."
"Now there is an election coming, and Panorama has been finding out if politics and politicians can really deliver what Britain wants."
"Coming, coming!"
"For first time in 30 years, I let myself sleep as much as I want--"
- I know-- - ...and you have to come wake me up.
"I know, Axel, but something is wrong."
"Lisa, you forget Mr. Somers is boss now."
Call him in Long Beach--
"No, no."
"No, Axel."
He's the one who's making it wrong.
This morning I got a notice from him at the lumber yard.
He's canceling the regular monthly order for the shop.
Oh.
"Oh, that's too bad."
"Axel, you didn't buy all these years from Carl just because he's my brother."
You bought because he handles the highest grade of S and F hardwood.
"Sure, sure, but if Mr. Somers wants to buy somewhere else, can I stop him?"
You want me to tell you why he cancelled out?
I'll tell you why.
Because he wants to buy cheap commercial grades of lumber.
Nothing but spruce and hemlock.
"Carl, if Somers did like you say, he will cheapen trademark."
He would make it nothing.
Why would he want to kill goose that lays the golden eggs?
That's crazy.
But Carl loses his biggest account.
What can we do?
[phone rings]
I will talk to you later.
And do not worry so much.
- There will be bigger things for all of us.
- [ring] [ring]
Hello.
"They say to him, ""What's the matter?"
"Don't you say anything?"""
"He says, ""What am I going to say, that my wife two-times me?"""
"So she says, ""Shut up!"
"You're always talking! """
"But in Italian, it sounds much nicer."
-Cornuto contento.
-That's it.
It means he's content to be a jerk.
He doesn't care who knows it.
Did Tommy ever tell you about my painting?
Look at this.
It's beautiful.
I like this one...one dog goes one way and the other dog goes the other way.
"One's going east, and the other one's going west."
So what?
"And this guy's saying, ""What do you want from me?"" The guy's got a nice head of white hair."
Beautiful.
The dog looks the same.
Looks like somebody we know.
Without the beard?
"No, it's him."
It's him.
What the fuck is that?
"For most of the guys, killings got to be accepted."
Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line.
"You got out of line, you got whacked."
Everybody knew the rules.
"But sometimes, even if people didn't get out of line, they got whacked."
Hits became a habit.
"Guys would get into arguements over nothing and before you knew it, one of them was dead."
They were shooting each other all the time.
Did you bring me here to stare at the lake?
"No, I brought you out here to understand why you're so angry with me."
"You know, you're at the age I was when my mother was really sick, right before she died."
Before she killed herself?
Yeah.
It happened right there.
I was 16.
I was so angry.
"I remember feeling like everything was always about her, you know, she was so consumed with her own life, her own misery, and Jess, I don't want you to ever have to feel that way."
I want you to know that you can come to me about anything whenever you want.
"Jess, I can tell you're in pain."
What's going on?
It's Naomi.
What do you mean?
We just have a complicated relationship.
I love her.
"Like, I mean, like, I'm in love with her."
"Or I thought I was, I don't know."
I thought she...
"She loved me too, but sh..."
"Oh, honey."
I'm sure she does love you in her own way.
"And if she doesn't, it's her loss."
"I mean, who could not love you?"
You're perfect.
I am?
"Jess, you're perfect in every way."
Why did you lie for her?
What do you mean?
"Naomi took the drugs, you know, the drugs you had in your shed for Casper?"
"She told me, she told me that you lied for her."
Why would you do that?
"Oh, about that we're not supposed to be brothers?"
"No, don't flatter yourself."
I don't break that easy.
"Oh, good, 'cause I was just being honest."
"Oh, yeah."
"No, I got that loud and clear."
"[ Telephones ringing, police radio chatter ]"
"Thanks for your patience, agents."
Coroner's report finally came in.
"All right, thank you."
"All right, let's see."
Did Wayne McNut really weigh 300 pounds just moments before time of death?
316 to be exact.
And the official cause of death?
Cardiac arrest.
"But between you and me, that's just a guess."
The vic suffered massive organ damage.
"Here you go, Jenny."
"Ruptured spleen, pierced liver, collapsed lung."
Looked like everything was just [slurps]
Sucked right out of him.
Like he'd been hoovered?
Yeah.
"Yeah, you know, I got to be honest, fellas -- hm?"
We're stumped.
This type of thing just doesn't happen in Stillwater.
"Now, did Wayne have any enemies?"
Hmm.
More like an unfriendly rivalry.
"A guy named ""Slim Jim"" Morgan."
"Like Wayne, he was pretty well-known in the competitive-eatin' circuit."
Competitive-eating circuit?
Sergeant Major Seo ended up going to his ex-girlfriend's wedding.
Together with Myeong Joo.
"If you're curious about what happened after, follow me."
Together?
Why did Yoon Myung Joo go?
What's wrong?
Congratulations on crashing your ex-girlfriend's wedding.
"Lucky for you, I'm also off duty."
Isn't that a relief?
I asked what was wrong.
Is my question hard to answer?
Is my answer hard?
If you keep on wrecking her wedding the Sergeant Seo way she'll probably be relieved for breaking up with you.
There's no way she'd regret it.
"But if you go with me, we can make her regret all night."
That was what my answer meant.
It's tempting.
But I have a condition.
"First, turn the rear mirror around."
She's an expert at breaking couples.
But what was the condition?
"From here, I appear."
The person that my father sees as husband material is coming in as a lieutenant.
My father said he was my upperclassman in the army.
He already came.
It's been two days since he came.
He came fast.
"Anyways, say that you're dating me."
You don't like Yoo Si Jin?
His appearance isn't my style.
He looks like a girl.
Cooperate?
Never!
No?
Do you think I will put you out of your misery?
Wake up.
Haven't you learned your lesson?
Chosun Navy is the strongest navy there is.
"My comrades will chop off all of your heads, you wicked bastards!"
Long live Chosun!
Long live Chosun!
Hail Admiral Yi Soon-shin!
Hail Admiral Yi Soon-shin!
All of us are sinners.
"In the past seven years, we've buried countless comrades of war at sea."
"If we failed to put an end to this war, if we fail to deliver justice for the pain and suffering of our people, we will forever be bound by our sins!"
"Today, we 16.000 soldiers of Chosun, go to war with faces of sinners."
"But tomorrow, we will return triumphant with faces of champions!"
"Do not let one single enemy ship, one single enemy soldier escape alive!"
Long Live Chosun!
Long Live Chosun!
"Yim Chun-su an Kim Bok-nam, you are under arrest!"
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything wrong!
Let go of me!
I'm not a criminal!
Let go!
Wait!
This is a mistake!
These men are innocent!
Step side!
No!
These men are innocent!
With the wedding chapel on it.
Would you guys find it!
"I love you, Roger."
"I love you, Babs."
Barbara!
You creep!
Babs!
Coach!
Enough!
"Ah, Magnum."
There you are.
"You realize, of course, you have no chance of winning."
"Well, Buddy's not saying a word."
Catching him with a gun is enough.
The guy's a three-time loser.
You know they're gonna put him away for life... probably 300 years.
"And the money, they still haven't found it?"
Roger didn't exactly give them a pinpoint location.
They're liable to be digging up that place till the next Iron Man race.
He seemed sure it was in the Bougainvillea Priscilla.
They'll find it.
And then we'll get married and go back to Bayonne.
"And I'll open an exercise school, and he'll open a little tropical flower shop."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
And everybody will come out of this pile of bat guano smelling like a rose except me.
"Just think, man, I'm the one that put up the money to sponsor you."
"You forget, Robin Masters made a sizable contribution without expecting any publicity for it."
Robin?
What about me?
"I put up the food, the booze, the potato chips."
"Stop it, all of you."
Tom did his best.
Because I don't want to be rude when you show up to my house unannounced.
"Like, like right now."
And you're like a tiger.
"And... you throw yourself at me, and I don't have someone to blame right now... but you're the best I can come up with on the fly."
Why aren't you with Dale?
"You're not the typical Hollywood guy, and she needs someone real like that."
"Look, I really don't know what to say to that."
Dale made it pretty clear that she's not interested in me.
You guys just have something between you two.
I've seen guys come in and out of her life.
But I've never seen her be as comfortable and happy as she is when she's with you.
"Whatever she's going through please don't give up on her, Zach."
Just let her work it out.
I'm sorry if I hurt you.
I never meant to do that.
You didn't.
I hurt myself.
I just gotta open my eyes a little wider next time.
"Can we maybe um, hang out just like be friends and stuff?"
"Yeah, I don't see why not."
That'd be good.
Ok.
Good night.
Can we hang out right now maybe?
I don't think that would be a very good idea.
Maybe I can just come in.
Not good.
Right.
Yeah.
"No, no, no, no."
You don't understand.
She wants yellow roses.
You will see her in time.
"What's up, Connie?"
Everything okay?
Did you just call John?
I've been asleep since 9:00.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
See?
"It's sticking up here around 1,950 cycles per second."
"But it never gets any lower than maybe 1,930 or so."
"But yours is way down here in the normal vocal range... anywhere between 1,000 and 1,200 cycles per second."
"Okay, so this guy's vocal range is much higher than mine."
What makes you think it's a man?
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What is it?
"Near as I can tell, it's... an electrical impulse."
"But whatever it is, it's not coming from human vocal cords."
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
I'll back you up.
I just wanna make sure you still got a job... when you're done doing whatever it is you're doing down there.
"Okay, I'll call you from Chicago."
"For Foon's sake, don't offend him, OK?"
But that's the fact!
Sorry!
...
Summon the witness.
I was washing rice inside the kitchen.
"When I heard the gun shot, I rushed to the backyard at once."
What did you see?
"I saw Ho Chun lying on the ground, with blood all over his body."
Foon pointed a gun at him and laughed.
"He said, ""Ho Chun, you are dead meat now."""
What's next?
I was afraid and screamed!
Ho Foon got mad and chased after us.
Objection!
What did you say?
What you've just said differs from the statement you gave to the police.
I just want to ask why you amended your statement?
"Objection substained, witness should answer the question."
I worry that Ho Foon will avenge me.
So I didn't tell all the truth.
"I have no question, it's your turn."
"I would like to show the jury the evidence, item number one first."
"Witness, this gun can shoot only one bullet."
"You said you heard the gun shot, so how could he shoot you again?"
He didn't want to kill me with gun.
But by what?
Sword.
Are you kidding me?
Really?
"He chased after me and wanted to kill me with ""capital chopper""."
"He chased after me, and I was so afraid..."
"Well, these head wounds aren't consistent with the butt of a gun."
They are not.
"They were inflicted with a pointed metal object, perhaps a hammer claw or garden trowel."
"Well, whatever it was, the killer took it with him when he left."
Who brings a gun and a garden tool to commit a murder?
"Hopefully, this might provide some insight."
I resisted the temptation to examine it before I could establish proper chain of custody.
You think it was the victim's?
There's one way to find out.
(phone beeps)
Retina lock can still be triggered hours after death.
Ain't technology grand?
"O.G.'s real name is Owen Tuchman, and he's involved in at least one dispute via text."

SHINWELL:
Chivonne.
I know you?
I'm your...
I'm Shinwell.
You said you want to talk?
"It's okay, guys."
Catch you later.
Just getting to know the city.
Is this a good spot?
"Well, you have to go where the darts are if you're in a darts league."
Big darts game tonight?
Match.
It's called a darts match.
Big darts match tonight?
"You know, the game of darts goes back to the Battle of Agincourt in the 15th century."
The first dartboard was actually the cross section of a tree.
Wow.
You're a real enthusiast.
I kind of like history in general.
I like the perspective on why things happen.
Never been my favorite subject.
"I do love old movies, like ""Casablanca."""
"That's kind of history, right?"
"Ms. Keyes, you are a breath of fresh air."
Call me Saffron.
We're not at work.
"Gary, more vodka shooters before I take your money."
"Your turn, big guy."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, my turn, my turn."
"And, um, when I come back, will you teach me how to shoot a dart?"
"Okay, but are you sure you don't want the reigning champ to teach you?"
Positive.
I imagine Gary knows what he's doing.
"Vodka, vodka, water."
Drink them under the table.
"Okay, okay, okay."
There's a lot of money on that table...
I'm nervous.
"No, no, I got your covered."
The remaining we shall do it there.
"Brother, you have handled such a big responsibility of mine."
Okay!
It's okay Ameena.
Now we are free.

Uncle!
Uncle!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming here?
"When I heard you went to kill the leader,"
I got the fright of my life.
I'm really too embarassed to face you now.
"Because of my bad foresight,"
I got the whole fleet and you into trouble.
Don't blame it on yourself.
The reason I came here was to make a deal with the bandit leader.
"If it weren't for you,"
I wouldn't have thought of it.
"Commander, So Seo-No came to the hideout herself"
What?
What if the deal doesn't go through?
"You may be a merchant, but putting your life on collateral to make a deal, is really too reckless."
"Speaking of recklessness,"
You and I are no different.
I... have already placed my fate in exchange for your life.
"Even if it fails,"
"Even if I die,"
I will not regret this decision.
-Take her out!
-Yes.
"Miss,"
I will place mine in exchange for yours too.

What happened?
Why you...
You jerks.
What do you mean?
We haven't interfered with your business.
"Shuji, you mean you think I had something to do with the hit?"
"Never, never in a million years would I do anything to disrupt our agreement."
Our relationship means everything to me than gold and you know that.
Our relationship means everything to me than gold and you know that.
"Come on, shuji, what do you think I am a fucking idiot?"
What are you trying to say here shuji?
Huh?
"Not me, not my family."
Not anyone who has a future on this fucking earth.
"Someone hires a low life piece of shit that worked for me for five minutes, makes it look like my guys puts you and me in a war together."
It's the last thing I want.
Do you understand?
The last thing.
Mr. tendo will be relieved to hear that.
"Well tell Mr. tendo that he has my full respect, huh?"
One thousand percent.
Thank you.
Any time.
So?
It was him.
Really?
Yes.
Now what?
We eat.
Come on lets go.
Come on.
Wow this is a beautiful house.
I always thought you guys ate on the floor or something.
So how do you like Japanese food?
It's good.
"I got it from another source, then I passed it on."
I should have made that clear in my original statement.
I'm extremely remorseful.
"Right, and who was the other source?"
An old friend from my days on armed robbery.
Terry Capistrano.
And do you have any further information?
"No, sir."
Only that I'm extremely remorseful.
"Well, thank you, DC Morton."
No further questions.
Interview terminated.
Wanker.
"Right, well, I'll check out this name he gave us."
"Oh, well, I wouldn't bother if I were you."
Terry Capistrano got Alzheimer's.
He was retired sick.
The poor bugger's lost his marbles.
Convenient.
"Oh, come off it, Kate."
Nigel's just trying to help.
Can we be sure?
"Look, I know he's a mate and everything, but he's a few months off retirement and, between me and you, his missus hasn't been too well lately."
"Well, I really don't give a shit."
"Look, his heart's in the right place."
"Let's just leave this cock-up behind us, eh?"
Please.
Yeah.
"Well, I suppose I can overlook it."
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
"Now we know the Caddy's active again, this time we get the bastard."
I've been dieting for a whole half a day and I haven't even lost a pound.
"Sabrina, I found that the key to losing weight is eating the right foods."
Who are you channeling?
The other day I saw you put sugar on bacon.
Lean bacon.
There's got to be something in here that will help me fit in my dress.
"Hey, look at this ad."
"""Thanks to Blubber-Be-Gone,"
"I lost 50 pounds in three days."""
That's ridiculous.
"What'd he do, lop off a leg?"
Here goes.
"""Thin my thighs, lose my roll, make me skinnier than Manute Bol."""
Ooh!
I see you called me in the nick of time.
I did?
Losing weight the Blubber- Be-Gone way is easy.
"Whenever you're hungry, instead of eating food, just mix yourself a shake."
Taste?
Not bad;
although I still prefer ipecac.
SALEM:
"Excuse me, but I think we've met before."
Weren't you selling that turn-your-eye-gunk- into-gold kit a few years ago?
"No, that must have been my brother."
Happy dieting.
This is great.
"I'm going to lose weight,"
"I'm going to look fantastic in my new special dress, and I'll be elected queen of the ball."
Right.
"And one of these days, my pink eye is going to pay off big."
"Oh, no."
"- It's called going off at half-cock, Harper!"
"- Yes, sir."
"Sorry, sir."
"Fall in, Rifleman Harper."
"Yes, sir."
"Thank you very much, sir."
Wait.
Do you not wish your officer to give you some high honours?
"Oh, but he did."
He told me to fall in.
"Lieutenant Sharpe,"
I think it better if you now take command.
Get down!
"That fella's the dead spit of you, Major."
Something you want to tell me?
And what are your orders?
Open that chest and tell me what's going on.
"I'm sorry, not until we reach Torrecastro."
My orders are to meet someone at Casa Antigua.
But if they are not here...
Your fellow countrymen need your protection to Torrecastro.
"Naturally, as officer commanding, I travel by coach."
Just like a proper officer.
Then it transpired that my poor uncle had left a small legacy for the purpose of spreading the message of Methodism to the Papists.
Ireland was well spread so it had to be Spain.
So here we are
Mrs Parker and sowing the seed
I didn't know Methodists smoked.
"Oh, it's for my lungs."
Sorry.
"Sorry, I can't."
Not yet.
Yes.
"It's a lot to ask of you, Alice, I know."
"But that's what families are for, right?"
"Yeah, he's just walked in, Jeff, as a matter of fact."
Yes.
"So, absolutely, I'll pass it on."
"Okay, if you can just watch your shooting ratio, love."
"Yeah, we'll see you then."
Cheers.
-How are things on location?
-Very hot apparently.
He said it's like a furnace in that room.
'Cause they're right under the flight path they've got to keep all the windows closed and there's bugger all ventilation.
But they're all thrilled with the material.
He said the whole thing's got a real buzz to it.
It's gonna be really different to the rest of the series.
And John's put together a bit of cut material for you to have a look at.
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
-What?
"-No, I've just... been getting a lot of static electricity today."
"Just after I'd polished the table, it was a combination, maybe, the friction and the weather."
"Anyway, what happened to you?"
You get whiplash or something?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
What?
What?
Tell me.
I went to an orgy.
"Yeah, right."
-What did I say?
I said you wouldn't believe me.
-An orgy?
"Well, I know you know."
"Now, I may have run across Mrs. Sellers at the grocery today."
And she just may have mentioned that
John was gonna give me his pin tonight?
Possibly.
"I have lots of pins from lots of boys, Mama."
"I know, Zelda dear."
"I've been followin' along lo these many years, but somehow this one's different, isn't it, baby?"
"How do you know when it's different, Mama?"
I don't know.
What kind of answer is that?
What kind of answer did you want?
"Well, he cares about you a great deal."
Anyone can see that and...
"You know, he'll certainly be able to care for you."
Those are not unimportant things.
I know that.
"You and Daddy never think I do, but I do."
It's what worried everyone so about Scott.
"But, Mama... you weren't happy marrying' Daddy."
"Oh, come now, Zelda."
I know there were other possibilities.
Were you in love with any of them?
You can find something to love about every man if you put your mind to it.
I don't want to have to put my mind to it.
"But you will, baby."
Whether you want to or not.
I'm just gonna run this laundry downstairs.
"I can do that, Mama."
"Oh, of course."
"Thank you, dear."
[ticking]
"Dude, don't give into temptation..."
"I love your use of slow-mo, Pete."
"Good job there, Mike."
"That's not slo-mo, that Alexis' performance."
"Oh, God."
You think it's easy to achieve that?
- Damn.
- Slo-mo acting.
Damn lady.
I just wanna say I feel like we set a ridiculous pace for this commentary and now we're all finding it hard to keep up.
We realized this is gonna go on for two hours.
It's a good thing that we have Pete's list of questions.
My coffee is starting to wear off.
"Oh, my God."
- This was shot in the studio...
- Stage.
This was the very last thing we shot.
"Actually, the very last thing we shot on the movie during principal photography was the moment..."
Was your orgasm.
- The overhead shot on the couch.
"- Oh, that."
"But that morning, on day 29 of shooting, we shot this."
I remember sitting there watching this because it was beautiful.
- So this wasn't a reshoot.
- Were you wrestling?
"- No, this is principal photography."
- Right.
- Were you really tickling each other?
"- Yeah, that was real tickling."
"I love this song, by the way."
- This song by The Submarines.
- The Submarines.
"In my statement, I told the police that the victim stepped into traffic and that I didn't have enough time to brake, but that was a lie."
The truth is...
I wasn't even looking at the road when it happened.
(crying):
"I was on my phone, reading a text."
"Because of my own carelessness, an innocent man died."
There hasn't been a day that's gone by that I haven't thought about it.
I'm so sorry.
Got him.
(sobbing):
I wanted to tell his family.
I even wrote the e-mail that I was gonna send.
"But you never did, did you?"
Sorry.
(crying continues)
And now the world will see you for what you really are:
a coward and a liar.
3236.
You're letting me go?
(soft chuckle) No.
"Even if I did, there would be nothing left to go back to, would there?"
But I will show you some mercy.
"(tires screeching, sirens wailing)"
This is Officer Kalakua requesting HPD and SWAT support.
The address is 5625 Hoala Street in Waimalu.
(gunshot in the distance)
"(groans, panting)"
(gun clicks)
(Holm yelling in the distance)
(panting)
(screams)
(groans)
"Oh, thank you."
"I think you guys are talking about postpartum depression, and that totally makes sense."
One out of every seven new moms does suffer from it.
"Yeah, no, no, um..."
"You're saying, no, that's not true?"
"I'm worried that, uh..."
Our kid's just gonna have a shit vibe.
"- Sorry, come again?"
- Okay.
I-
"- I'm, like, ehh..."
You know?
"And he's, like, the worst, so I feel like, when we made a baby, so it'll just be like..."
- Her dad's my boss.
- Gotcha.
"So you're not talking about postpartum depression, you're just concerned that your baby's an asshole?"
"Okay, yeah, like, that's what I'm talking about, too."
"- And, like, off of what she said."
- Right.
"I think, just ultimately, we're mostly afraid that he won't be chill."
"Like, what if he can't hang?"
"Or he hangs too hard and has one too many drinks and does that, like, slow-blinking thing."
Let's open it up.
Any-
- Anybody else with some fears?
Bats.
"Yeah, yeah."
"Okay, I should have been more specific that I meant fears about the baby."
"Okay, I have a fear about my human baby."
"- Okay, great."
- Um...
I'm really scared that my baby's gonna be blind.
All right.
I got you.
Meth.
Right.
"Sorry, that was a little transpositional error."
Nothing a little Wite-Out can't take care of.
"Yeah, and felony quantity."
- Just barely.
"- Yeah, just barely."
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.
But good luck arguing that in court.
Let me get down to brass tacks.
I'm gonna get you a second phone call.
You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader and they're gonna deliver me a cheque for $4650.
I'm gonna write that down on the back of my business card.
Four-six-five-zero.
Okay?
"And I need that in a cashier's cheque or a money order, doesn't matter."
"Actually, I want it in a money order."
"And make it out to ""Ice Station Zebra Associates."""
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.
It's done just for tax purposes.
"And after that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask."
All right?
Any questions?
"You're gonna get me off, right?"
"What do I look like, your high-school girlfriend?"
"Five fingers, no waiting?"
"That's a joke, Brandon."
Lighten up.
Come on.
What do you got?
A lot.
"AUTEC is, like, crazy amazing."
"You've got your Bermuda Triangle, your wormholes, you've got your magnetic field deviations."
Just wish there was a way to contain it all.
You're a mapper.
Oh.
I'm warning you.
You should get out of my head while you still can.
Can you map the bullet back to the shooter?
"Slug that killed Ridgeway, it's 30-caliber, definitely unusual."
The one thing I do know is that it's not military specs.
I'm still trying to track it back to the exact weapon it was fired from.
"Track faster, Abbs."
You know why you're so gruff all the time?
You need more sex.
I'm not answering that.
You just did.
"I am telling you, I saw a bounce in his step."
And Elliott...
"Elliott was sure about Ryan's pupils, as well."
How am I gonna survive Gibbs dating a woman who thinks I'm a game show host?
What does that even mean?
Does she think I'm cheesy?
That I like pencil-thin microphones?
"See, I don't buy it."
Gibbs is a lone wolf.
You have to be observant.
"Next time they come in here, you need to open your eyes and really look."
GIBBS:
"Okay, what are we looking at?"
Do that come hither thing.
They came that fast because it's their behavior pattern.
Joe's been feeding them.
Now look down.
You see a river of pigeon turd?
Uh... no.
There's barely any.
"It's not weird, it's cheap."
Joe's a guy whlooks for the easy way.
Probably been stealing cable from his neighbors.
Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings?
You see a shovel or a dustpan?
"Mmm, found a scraper."
Looks used.
Sitting on a bucket.
Bucket full of pigeon crap.
Perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans.
Yep.
"Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness, and intractable pain."
Let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson.
Don't cut corners when you're growing your pot.
See you back home.
I was there.
I should have found it.
"Yeah, you could have saved us a lot of time."
Get me a flush of ampho b and flucytosine.
I'll start us both.
I was waiting for lab confirmation.
Haven't heard from house yet.
Look at his eeg.
Theta band's been increasing steadily since... since we put him under.
"Guy's unconscious, but still in pain."
Cast off the bow lines.
"We're good to go, first thing."
"Bring her back in one piece, Joe, you're goin' without me."
Did you hear back from the city planner?
Yeah.
She confirmed that viaducts were built over the old rail lines.
What used to be on street level is now a subterranean ghost town.
"Well, Valera and his cohorts must have used that to hide Sara 'cause after we lifted our roadblocks, it would've been easy to move her."
"Yeah, well, we might've identified one of those cohorts."
"This Bluetooth you found, turns out the units are embedded with 48 bit identifiers."
This one's synced to a cell phone.
You got a number?
Better.
I got a name.
Marcy's boyfriend.
Ben Wilson.
- Ben.
- Hey.
I need to know what's going on.
What are you talking about?
Why was there blood on your sweatshirt?
"You took it, didn't you?"
"I need the truth, Ben."
"Believe me, it's better if you don't know."
Don't try to protect me.
I can't stand that.
Okay.
Someone paid me to deliver that money.
Who?
I didn't think it was a big deal.
The delivery went bad.
"A guy got hurt, but it was nothing to do with Sara and it was nothing to do with me."
-What are you afraid of?
What he will think?
He loves you.
It would ruin his life marry to a girl who...
"Doc, you know not a respectable person in town would accept him."
Respectable!
What kind of respectability are you talking about?
The people with enough money to hire him as a lawyer.
Don't you understand?
We're talking about your whole life!
Prison can be a kind of dying!
Losing Ted would be a worse kind of dying.
"-Besides, you mustn't get involved."
"-Now, never mind about me."
Promise me you won't tell them.
"Promise me, please, promise!"
"All right, Selena."
I'll promise you.
"Selena, you don't seem to realized."
You face a possible life sentence!
-I need much more to work with.
-There is no more.
"Lucas was drunk, brutal."
"When he tried to beat me, I killed him."
Killing in seIf-defense is understandable... but you hid the body and acted like a criminal.
-I know.
-But she was fighting for her life!
The State is sending a prosecutor for one purpose: to convict Selena.
I've seen him work.
"He's competent, relentless as the law itself."
"Yes, tell her to come in."
There must be something you haven't told me.
- Madam.
- What is it?
What are you doing here?
Please take me in.
I do not wish to invite trouble by taking in Master Yi's man.
Leave.
But you promised you'd take me in.
The situation has changed.
I must break that promise.
I mean to sever my ties with Master Yi.
You don't have to...
that tie is already severed.
The master is dead.
What do you mean he's dead?
Jang Bogo attacked and took the master's life.
Is Yum Moon also dead?
He wasn't at the base at the time of attack.
Please...
...take me in.
"If you don't take me, I've no place to go."
How can I trust a man who ran away to save his own life when his master is dead?
What?
Who's to say you won't betray your master again?
That will never happen.
I will give my life for you.
I will give you a chance to prove your loyalty.
Say anything.
I will do anything.
We need to recruit more people.
What do you plan to do by hiring more people when we should be letting people go to survive Madam Jami's advances?
I will send merchants all over Shilla.
I will trade cotton and salt at marketplaces where Madam Jami's influence hasn't reached.
I knew Jess Mclntyre would help you.
"- They're helping us, ain't they?"
"- Yes, sir!"
"- Retha, give them boys more chicken."
"- Yes, ma'am."
"You're all very kind, kinder than we deserve."
That's right.
[Innkeeper] You won't have no trouble at all.
"Once folks find out what you're up to, they'll put the big pot in the little one."
"[Innkeeper] Well, look who's here!"
"[Retha] Land sakes, but you're wet!"
"You need some of Retha's cooking, Mr. Andrews."
Sounds mighty good.
Smells even better.
I think I'll get warm first.
Evening.
"[Innkeeper] Retha, fetch Mr. Andrews that peach brandy, you hear?"
"Yes, ma'am."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have great news."
"On the strength of it, I'd ask you all to have a glass with me... if I knew the color of your politics."
You needn't worry about these boys.
"They've been living amongst Yankees, but they're coming out on the right side."
Good.
We won a great victory at Shiloh.
- Did Beauregard lick that buzzard Grant?
- [Andrews] Cut him to ribbons.
What about the Yankee gunboats at Pittsburgh Landing?
"100 of them sunk, and thousands of prisoners taken."
"The whole Yankee force, gone up the spout."
[cheers]
Isn't that wonderful?
Ladies and gentlemen...
- Julie's webcam.
"It would be too bad if this film were to go around court, wouldn't it?"
"What do you mean, go around?"
"To avoid that, you need to help us."
What kind of help?
- Working for us.
Tell us exactly where Roban is in the Villedieu case.
I can't.
I'm sworn to secrecy.
"Speaking of secrets, you know that Julie is underage?"
"That's crazy, she's in the first year of law school!"
Look.
She's in high school.
You see?
"Must admit, she is pretty talented for a 15-year-old."
"If you refuse to help us, within 30 minutes this film will be sent to every magistrate's mailbox."
"When they realise the girl is underage, they won't do you any favours."
And you will be disbarred for life.
"Harsh, isn't it?"
Gilou!
Tintin!
What's going on?
The Crime Squad has found the guy Gilou argued with at the squat.
How do you know?
- I just know.
"If the guy talks, they'll be able to get to Patricia."
"- Knowing her, she'll talk."
- The Crime Squad can't implicate Gilou.
- The bullet doesn't come from his gun.
"- Wait, Bremont isn't stupid."
He'll know we covered up for Gilou if Patricia says she was with him.
He'll realise I tampered with the seal.
I wish it would have been so.
That would be better than the truth.
Ash-393 took it from the womb of your broken wife.
He took it with him.
No one knows where.
"We could not tell you the truth that time, but..."
"But if he had left, a Noid kidnapped a human baby..."
We would have genocidal panic above our heads.
You're telling me?
...
That my son still lives?
"Yes, Bishop."
But the most important:
We're giving you a chance to get them back.
Find Ash.
Then you will find your daughter.
My daughter...
"Our daughter, Mara!"
Five years have passed.
How could he survive on the ice for so long?
She does not have improved DNA.
Extension of DNA at the end of mitosis  sequencing the completed genetic material.
No human survives without Iso-Gel one day less than 60 degrees.
Could she really be alive?
Alert!
F-7100 to the maximum ..
Reprogramming of DNA is complete.
Markers identified for strength and healing.
"I think to resurrect a broken man, I suppose everything is possible."
"They brought me back, Mara."
To the place I never thought to return.
Spartan-7  slave police.
Science is changing the way women age.
This next generation of women will all be GILFs.
[applause]
All right.
All right.
Calm down out there.
"Okay, so, Kiara, what're the kind of things that you might do now that you wouldn't have done in your 30s?"
"Well, for me, I didn't even know what good sex was until I turned 50."
(MURPHY SCREAMING)
ANDERSON:
Where did you learn that?
My father was a doctor.
Bridger!
FITZGERALD:
"Captain, we got a swarm of tree niggers out here waiting to finish the job."
Tell me you got some kind of plan.
Glass?
Missouri's no good.
Not while the Ree's running it.
We got to get off this boat.
"Oh, you want to get off the boat?"
"Then what do we do, huh?"
Take our furs and sit out there amongst the Ree like a bunch of ducks?
Only safe thing to do is track a new course back up on land.
That'll add weeks to the trip.
Better than floating where they can get eyes on us.
"They got eyes on you right now, son."
What I'm saying is we stay on the boat.
Chart a course toward the fort and take our chances on the water.
Glass knows this territory best.
It's his job to get us home safe.
Get us home safe?
Tomorrow night.
He didn't tell me that when I spoke to him.
"Well, he got hung up."
And he didn't know he was going to get hung up when he talked to you on the phone.
(SIGHING)
"Well, we'll wait for him."
"We can't do that, we can't wait, we got to go."
No.
We'll wait till tomorrow.
We'll stay here.
"Pluto, I don't think that's such a good idea."
"We don't have much room, and, uh... (CRACKING KNUCKLES)"
"Yeah, man."
"What the fuck, man."
"You know, you can, uh, you can have my room."
I've slept on the couch before.
"Fuck you, Beaver."
I'm not moving.
Give me the phone.
"I swear to God, sometimes I don't think you got a fucking brain in your head."
"Ray, I'm going to Star City."
"The only reason why I got involved in this shit was because you promised me we'd get some money, that I could go home and see my people."
"Yeah, well, that's before all this shit happened, wasn't it?"
It's about time we got where we're going.
I don't see what the problem is.
All y'all got to do is come through and pick me up.
It's on the way.
RAY:
"You know goddamn well that Pluto's not going to do that, don't you?"
You heard what the man said.
I think it's a good idea.
"If she goes ahead of us, it will be safer to travel."
She must've overheard us talking about it.
I told Zaddik it might be the key to making her human.
"Please, you've got to find her before the villagers do."
"Look, Ronon says we're close."
"If we lose the trail now, we may never catch the wraith."
Rodney and I will find her.
"All right, but be careful."
Understood.
I'll come with you.
"No, I think it's best if you stay here."
"Look, is there anywhere that she likes to go,"
Any favorite hiding spots or favorite places?
"Yes, she often goes off for hours at a time, up into the hills."
"I don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me."
It's a start.
"You know, I thought it was pretty nuts when Ronon was trying to track a wraith through this forest."
"Now that it's just us, do you feel any better?"
"Oh, yeah."
Supremely confident.
Father.
Ellia.
Where did you go?
I was hiding.
I didn't want the others to know... to know what?
"Ellia, why did you take the retrovirus?"
Because I don't want to be this way anymore.
I hate what I am.
If you heard what dr.
"Beckett said, you know the retrovirus isn't ready."
I had no choice.
"When they kill the other wraith,"
I won't be able to pretend anymore.
"So, uh, when can we get started?"
"When Amanda goes back, I'll have time."
Okay.
Well... good-bye.
Bye.
Ready?
"Kyle, I can't go out."
But you said we need to talk.
I'm sorry.
I can't see you.
Amanda?
Inside!
This is all your fault.
What?
My daughter flying clear across the country to surprise me.
You're not happy she's home?
I'd be happy if she hadn't used my birthday as an excuse to tell me she wants to drop out.
Drop out of the conservatory?
Why?
As if you didn't know you're the reason.
She didn't say anything to me about it.
We haven't even had a chance to talk.
You're not gonna get that chance.
"You will not see or speak to Amanda until she's back where she belongs, at that school."
I don't understand why she won't let me speak to Amanda.
"Well, unfortunately, Mrs. Bloom sees you as a distraction."
"I just want to know what happened, make sure she's okay."
"Well, put yourself in Mrs. Bloom's shoes."
"What I mean is, try to see things from her perspective."
"That music conservatory sounds like a pretty big opportunity, one that Amanda shouldn't miss."
I don't want her to miss it.
But Mrs. Bloom shouldn't force her to go back.
Carrasco's back.
- How many people died?
- Have something to drink.
Thank you.
"Welcome, Carrasco."
Enrique!
"They don't know, do they?"
"In Puerto and Timulcha, they called us criminals."
People here should know about that as well.
Padre Julio has kept the truth from them.
"They dropped leaflets from planes, but he said that it was nothing but bad propaganda, that Carrasco was supposed to surrender, that the Leopard was beaten."
Leave them alone for a while.
These men need to rest.
Go back to your work.
I'll go and get him immediately.
"- General, the president is on line 1."
- All right.
Thank you.
- This is General Benítez.
- We need to airlift fuel to the north.
- That's impossible.
- Why?
"During the blockade of Berlin, thousands of planes were employed."
"Of course, Señor Presidente, but we don't have any planes."
Don't argue with me.
Carry out my orders as soon as you can.
- Very well.
I'll do everything possible.
- You better had.
"Excuse me, these are the new defence plans for the refineries."
Thank you.
...plan 3 is to be carried out immediately.
She found another way to get through the night.
A little chemical enhancement.
There are hundreds of Christian camps that minister to thousands of youth every summer.
"Some of these youth have already accepted the truth, but some need direction in their lives."
"By attending camp, we could give 'em that help, by reintroducing them to the blessings of the lord."
Tonight Michelle decided she was gonna share with her brothers and sisters by spiking dinner with several milligrams of ecstasy.
"Dear lord, thank you so much for this food."
- Amen.
- All:
Amen.
Amen.
I feel amazing.
I love you guys.
"We love you, too."
[Laughter]
It didn't take long for these happy campers to go from holy rollers...
[Heavy breathing and sighing]
To horn dogs.
[Laughing] Yeah!
[Laughter]
Michelle sat back to enjoy the show.
Rock star!
Rock star!
Rock star!
[Coughs]
But she suddenly got a little choked up.
[Coughs]
[Laughing] I'm sorry.
"After inhaling the soot from the fire,"
Michelle grabbed a thermos to clear her throat.
[Coughs]
It didn't go down too well.
And he would be a lawyer and I would have his children.
And in the week ends we would barbecue.
And all the other princes and their princesses would come:
"and they would say delicious, delicious,"
"Or, how boring!"
"So I was taught, that I should come to New-York and become an independant model."
And my prince would come and he would be... an agent.
And he would get me a role.
And I would make my living waiting on tables.
I would wait till thirty...
till forty...till fifty.
And I was taught that to be an actress one should be fashionable.
And to befashionable is to be androgenous.
And I'm androgenous not less that David Bowie himself.
They call me beautiful.
And I kill with my cunt.
Isn't it fashionable?
Come on who's next?
I take lessons.
How to get into show business.
"Be nice to your professor,"
be nice to your agent.
Be nice to your audience.
Be nice.
How to be a woman?
Want them when they want you.
How to be free and equal.
Fuck women instead of men and you'll discover a whole kingdom of freedom.
Men won't step on you anymore.
Women will.
"So come on, who's next?"
Who wants to teach me?
"And I'm a monster, too."
"But you're human, Kiefer."
"In here, I can rule as the king of the Kingdom of Afternoon Naps."
"Kiefer, go outside and..."
"Now I know why I fell for you, Ryner."
"Because you were so unmotivated, I never felt like I had to be cautious around you."
I could be at ease.
"That's what I thought, but I was wrong."
It's really because you're kind.
And... because you're strong.
"Ryner, you're no monster."
I guarantee it.
"Thank you, Ryner."
I'll live on.
"And mark my words, I'll..."
I'm going.
Open up.
That surprised me.
I thought I was going to suffocate.
What's wrong?
Are you injured?
A little.
"Are you a fool, volunteering to be imprisoned?"
It was hard getting a visitation here.
You didn't have to bother.
"I'm just being kept in a prison cell instead of a school, now."
When I close my heart
When I close my heart What's this?
When I close my heart I'm leaving a horse in the northern woods tonight.
To the scent of impending darkness I'm leaving a horse in the northern woods tonight.
"To the scent of impending darkness If you do that, you'll be a suspect."
"A refrain of a far-off day of resurrection If you do that, you'll be a suspect."
Then it shall be welcome in our house.
"Oh, well, no, you don't have to keep it here just because of me."
"I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah."
You're the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
They've hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
The excavation is enormous.
They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
It's as if the pharaohs had returned.
When did they find the map room?
Three days ago.
They have not one brain among them.
Except one.
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.
What's his name?
"They call him ""Bellosh."""
Belloq.
Belloq.
The Germans have a great advantage over us.
They are near to discovering the Well of Souls.
"Well, they're not going to find it without this."
Who can tell us about these markings?
Perhaps a man I know can help us.
Indy... there is something that troubles me.
What is it?
The Ark.
"If it is there, at Tanis, then it is something that man was not meant to disturb."
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.
"Do we need the monkey, huh?"
"I'm surprised at you, Jones- talking that way about our baby."
Looking quite dazed.
And what happened to the skinny little boy?
When I looked around... he was gone.
I wonder how a skinny little boy could have carried Suzukichi all the way back here?
Because it was the water imp.
Water imp?
"Later on, the village people and my father talked about that."
But then they all came to the conclusion that it was the water imp.
"Those skinny, cucumber-like arms and legs."
"And his green face, like a leaf."
It couldn't possibly have been anything else but the water imp.
Grandma is pretty good at telling all those make-believe stories.
"Maybe it's our fault, listening to her so seriously."
"It's not make-believe, it's her dotage."
"After all, consider her age."
What happened?
The water imp was peeking in the window!
Stop talking nonsense!
Shinjiro!
"Why, you..."
Wait up!
"""Suzujiro confirmed the names of his brothers."
"""Please come to a definite decision to come to Hawaii."
"Tadao. """
"What'll you do, Grandma?"
I'll go.
But the anniversary of Grandpa's death is coming pretty soon.
I will go after I hold a memorial service for him.
All right?
What?
Grandma decided to go?
Yes.
"""where moth and rust doth corrupt,"" Matthew, 6:19, but it's a handy little case is that."
And a record come with it.
Shall I put it on so we know how we have to do it tomorrow?
Are you allowed to play it?
Yeah.

Does it not matter what I say?
Get inside!
"Mam, we were just..."
You were just showing me up.
You can leave that.
What are you going to do with it?
I might put it in the bin.
"Don't, Mam!"
Maybe they're pack animals and they're marking me for later.
I don't know.
"Dave, I was in a car accident once, okay?"
"And it was really scary, I had nightmares."
But when...
"I've been in a car accident, too."
Have you ever been bit by a shark?
I was never bit by a shark.
I'm just saying that I understand.
My...
Say it again.
I was in a car accident.
"No, say the last part."
I was never bit by a shark.
That's it!
Then you shouldn't talk about it.
And I'm not gonna sit here and try to explain myself to a bunch of black and white suburban trash who don't know a damn thing about the ocean.
"And you understand the ocean, honey?"
"I have some real field experience, honey, yeah."
I had a shark attack.
I'm part of a very elite group.
Like people who have been struck by lightning.
Not everyone can say that they've had that and maybe that's what's going on here today.
You know what?
I don't want to get in an argument with it.
I really don't.
You know what?
I'm really exhausted.
It's been a long day.
I'm gonna go back to the room.
You want to come with me?
"Baby, I thought we were gonna go to the waterfall tonight and have a little alone time."
The only way to get past it is to erase Aaron.
"What do you mean,"
"""We're going to erase Aaron?"""
"When they put me through Everclear, they'll find out about everyone."
"Roger, Elena, you."
I need to map out my brain and lock all those memories away.
Away?
Away where?
Here.
This is an imprint of my current neural map.
"Once I pass Everclear,"
I need you to connect this to the base of my skull to bring me back.
You'll only have a few days to do it or Aaron will be gone for good.
If that thing doesn't lobotomize you completely first.
I'm just temporarily disconnecting some circuits.
Aaron isn't a circuit.
It's who you are.
But he's not who I need to be right now.
This is gonna sting.
[device beeping]
Strap me in.
[soft dramatic music]
So now what?
"Just, uh, flip a switch and say, ""Bye, bye, Aaron."""
Either that or this thing turns me into a vegetable.
Relax.
It knows exactly which memories to sever.
Then my brain will fill the gaps with the cover story I'm using.
The lie becomes the truth.
At least that's the idea.
♪
Bite guard.
Bye.
"Tired, right?"
This is no joke.
Mom wasted two hours.
Why was there no shoot afterwards today?
It's a really busy studio.
There's no reason for me to be dragged around anymore.
You said you didn't want an outdoor shoot.
Dunk your legs in some warm water and rest up.
You should go to a sauna too.
Can't you just take some work off?
There's not much time left.
I'll do what I can.
"Jo Eun Young, please come in."
"Lee Seo Yeon, please come in."
Yes.
"Hello, doctor."
"Yes, take a seat."
I'll put it back when I leave.
"Oh, right."
They're going to use it as a villa and a work space.
"They've been investing money into the land but it hasn't raised in value for years, so his painter wife begged for a villa."
He's a painter?
The wife is.
"It's the wife's wish to live in the country and paint, and the husband also wants to put the main focus on her workshop."
"They're going to be living half the year in Seoul, half in the country."
The wife isn't your typical woman.
She even brought a wish list.
Thank you.
"All right, first, she wants a big workshop and a deck that leads out of it."
The deck needs to be spacious.
"The kitchen also needs to be big, and the living room should extend to the roof."
"You know, Horace, it's time."
It's time for you to claim a fucking life.
"You sat out the first half, now it's time of you to make something of whatever time you fucking have left."
- I didn't sit out my life.
"- No, no, you most certainly did."
"You and fucking Pete, both you guys."
"You guys together, like, you were half a guy each."
"Together, you didn't didn't even add up to a whole."
"Now, he is gone."
You have a chance to be a person.
"To live a fucking life, I don't care, Horace, Iâm saying all of it."
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
- I don't know.
"I don't know, Iâm sorry."
"- Okay, well, there's something you need to know, brother."
Iâm leaving.
- You are?
"- Yes, Iâm going."
Iâm getting the fuck out of here.
"You can do what you want, but Harold and I are leaving town on Monday and that's it."
I'm getting the fuck out of here.
- Where?
- Where-- I don't know where.
"See the country or whatever, just-- Just not here, though."
- You're telling me that now?
"- Yes, now."
"Yes, now, Horace."
This is all you fucking have is right now.
Do you understand?
"I almost died and I got my fucking life back, and Iâm not spending it here, there's no fucking way."
"I hope you don't either, Horace."
"Then keep to it, if that's what's written."
Keep exactly to what is in the score.
Careful!
Here you made a mistake in the fingering.
This bar once more!
"Careful, a mistake in intonation!"
"The first mistake was at the beginning, these notes are long."
"This is a faster tempo, here we shorten the notes."
We'll speed it up a bit.
The other problem is this point.
"I couldn't practise much, we have visitors at home, I couldn't make so much noise."
"And could you let me go now, because the whole family is going to granddad's grave."
His brother's come.
What will you do at the cemetery?
I don't know.
Pay our respects.
This young boy has an id card.
"Everyone has, it can't be helped."
You must have some proof of identity.
She left it at home.
But they know me.
Haven't you got something from school?
You think I'm not fifteen?
Look how grown up she is.
"She is, that's not the point."
"If I've got an id card, she has too."
Must we always have it with us?
What's written on that board?
Young people under fifteen must show their id cards.
"Her age isn't written on her face, she must carry it all the time."
I always have to have it with me?
I can't help it.
- No.
[Grunts]
You'll never find them again.
What the hell?
[Growls]
[Breathing heavily]
He's not himself.
He's been acting weird.
"I'm just, you know, worried about him as to what he saw."
Has he said anything?
"No, but I can tell there's something not right."
Hank's got to be shook up about this in some way.
"You know, I mean whether he's talking about it or not, when I saw him looking up at me, he was freaked."
- Aah!
- [Groans]
"And it's a look I've seen before, let me tell you."
"I'm sure you're hoping it will just go away, and he won't say anything, but look."
"This is not, like, your ordinary nightmare, okay?"
He knows he was awake.
And his brain is trying to process the unprocessable.
"I mean, what did you think when you first saw one woge?"
[Snarls]
- I thought I was going crazy.
"- Right, well..."
"Hank's probably going through the same thing, you know?"
"You know, with you, it was one thing."
He was hit.
He was knocked out.
He was a little dazed.
"But I mean, he saw Brinkerhoff change."
That is so not going to make it any easier.
"Trust me, mental hospitals are chock-full of people who have spent their lives trying to wrap their minds around things they've seen and can't explain."
But what will you do?
Think it over once again Jai
Are you making a mistake?
Grave mistake
Will you go back to India and prove that Om was right and we were wrong?
I'm not going back to India
I came to this city because this is a midway place.
Not fast like Mumbai
"Nor slow, like our Satna."
"As of now, I'm working in Pizza Hut"
"But someday, I'll build myself a fast food chain"
So I got to find myself a job soon.
"Yes, I talked up a computer firm"
They order pizzas from us.
When Can I meet up?
Tonight.
"Actually, they start working from 10 in the night"
G Four
Heard lots about you
Hacking papers from Mumbai University is no mean task
We're entering a bank account.
The one who pulls off the heist... is entitled to 50 percent of the loot
The rest is ours.
G Four's
So... you are professional hackers?
What are you?
Baby hacker?
One thing for Sure
"If we're thieves, you're a thief too"
"Grandma, why have we left our home?"
Why have we come here?
It was too large a house for so few of us
- You're gonna take us all out for American food?
"- Close, but wrong."
We'll bring America here.
We'll have a beach party.
"Big fire, blankets, singing."
"Huge, boiling kettle full of lobsters, crabs, clams, whatever they've got."
"Hawkeye, I don't see a whole lot of lifeguards around here."
"Yeah, well you would if this was Inchon."
"And where's there sea, there's gotta be seafood, Mama."
Hah!
What do you think?
What do you think?
Does that sound fantastic?
- That really sounds stupid.
- But is it possible?
- Of course.
The stupid is always possible.
- Great.
Can you leave right away?
Me?
You want me to drive halfway across Korea... on treacherous roads over hostile terrain?
"I don't want my Purple Heart to read, ""He gave his life for crabs."""
"Klinger, the future of the whole camp depends on this."
- Not to mention our lives.
- Aha!
"Your wanting me in the driver's seat certainly puts me in the driver's seat... for, say, a three-day pass?"
- Thief!
"- ""Thief"" is such an ugly word."
"Shall we say ""entrepreneur""?"
"Sign here, Prince."
I'll fill in the date after I decide on one.
"This is blackmail, and I won't stand for it."
He's gonna abandon that car.
We'll find it.
It'll tell us where he's going.
Watch this.
Keep your eyes on the guard.
Look at his holster.
The safety strap's unfastened.
Wait a minute.
"What the hell is he doing with a gun, anyway?"
"Weapons are for towers, gates and transports only."
- Maybe it was a rookie mistake.
"- No, not a rookie mistake."
He's in on it.
He wanted Dawkins to have that gun.
What's in it for the guard?
"Whatever it is, it was worth putting an armed and dangerous fugitive back on the streets."
Hey.
"Billy Omana, right?"
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, put those on."
- Excuse me?
"- Oh, he said put them on."
Who the hell you guys think you are?
What did Dawkins offer you to help him escape from prison today?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Billy, if you answer incorrectly one more time, we're gonna put those scrubs on you, drop you in the general population."
- How long you think you'll last there?
"- Heh, you can't do that."
This here says I can.
"Dawkins said if I helped him, he'd give me 50 grand."
And you believed him?
"He arranged for $10,000 to be wired into my account."
My name is Brent Sodor.
I used to be on Schmidt's security team.
You work for Schmidt?
!
Do I look like I'm still on the payroll?
!
I was being tortured!
Please.
"Y-you're trying to find him, right?"
Right?
Am I right?
"Well, I can help you."
I'll tell you anything you want.
Just don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.
Untie him.
We're taking him to Jabbar.
He lives for now.
"Most intelligence agencies lack the resources to set up safe houses all over the world, which is why they depend on expat civilians to lend their homes or businesses for missions abroad."
"If you're a former Syrian intelligence officer, the local Syrian restaurant can make a handy base of operations -- and save you a few bucks on lunch."
"Welcome, my friend."
Please -- please sit.
You know who I am?
I have an idea.
You're the guy that's...
trying to kill Schmidt.
Yeah.
My name is Jabbar Hamady.
Mr. Schmidt has taken something that belongs to me.
"So, my men told me a very interesting story about finding you in the warehouse."
Tell me about this.
"Yeah, my name's Brent Sodor, and, like I told your men, I'm on Schmidt's security team."
I don't understand.
"No, no, no."
Please!
"Please, I'll be quiet."
I don't want to go in there!
I promise I'll be quiet.
"No, don't!"
"No, don't!"
"Please, I'll be quiet."
Please!
I want to go home!
Please!
"I wonder what the unsub meant by ""eleven."""
We know he measures the time spent in each house.
It could be some sort of countdown.
"What are you thinking, Aaron?"
The hospital report on Ellie Zumwalt.
Her injuries were minor.
It was the gradual loss of blood that caused her to lose consciousness.
"Well, the unsub must have thought she bled out and left her for dead."
That was his big mistake.
I don't think there was a mistake.
What do you mean?
"What if Ellie Zumwalt was never meant to die, that the mistake that the unsub made was actually at the first crime scene?"
The Brewer murders?
The guy's a family annihilator.
He killed them all.
To me that sounds like mission accomplished.
We didn't understand why he used two different murder weapons on Jim and Lyla Brewer.
That's because there never was a second weapon.
I'm still not following.
"Dave, you said that a large piece of furniture was moved to block the top of the stairs at the Brewer house."
"- No, I didn't."
"- Yes, you did."
"Shit, did I really?"
That's so weird.
I don't understand why people wanna get married.
[SIGHS]
They don't.
- They don't?
- No.
"No, no guy actually wants to get married."
"And if they do, all they're really thinking about?"
All the women they're gonna miss out on.
"I don't wanna be with anybody else, just Beth."
"I don't know, man, I..."
Why'd you get married?
I love Janine.
You're a happily married guy.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'd say so."
"Now, I know I don't need to tell any of you that my cousin Paige is hot."
[ALL LAUGHING]
"In high school, if I told the popular guys that Paige was my cousin it'd keep me from getting my ass kicked because no one wanted to blow their chances with her."
[ALL LAUGHING]
And when she gets up there and says those marriage vows to Devon there will be hearts breaking all over the world.
MAN:
"Hear, hear."
WOMAN:
That's sweet.
"But, you know, keep in mind that her sister Beth is still on the market."
"Yeah, sure, she may be an older model but she got a lot of good miles left in that tank."
But don't stay on the lot too long or next year's models are gonna slip in there and steal all...
"Okay, that's enough of the speeches."
You must've really won her over.
She does not dig up those stories for just anyone.
You can get even tonight.
My parents will be happy to fill you in on all the gory details of my adolescence.
Meeting their daughter's recovering-addict boyfriend.
Senior prom doesn't strike me as the dinner topic of choice.
They're not like that.
They're going to love you.
I hope so.
- Check out this Web site.
"- ""The Skinny Minnie."""
- Do people really read this?
- Yeah.
Everything you've always wanted and not wanted to know about your celebrities.
Scroll down past the photo of Britney without underwear.
It's you.
And me!
"""Soap hunk shops for furniture in WeHo with a friend."""
- Wow.
I'm a friend?
- You're a friend in italics.
"""If that didn't sound the alarm check out the less-than-hetero lamp."""
I told you that lamp was gay.
And ugly.
- It gets worse.
"- ""It could just be wishful thinking, but we're getting a serious gay vibe from the daytime doctor."""
"I've spent the morning fielding calls from my agent, my manager, my mom."
Your mom checks Skinny Minnie?
She Googles my name once a week.
And that's not the point.
We need to lay low.
What?
"The dead are being dug from the rubble and in France, the German armies wait for this country to surrender."
But English troops are fighting back.
"In the skies, the young men of the RAF are struggling against the Nazi forces which only a year ago invaded Poland, swept through France, and left this country standing alone in a conflict which, if lost,"
could destroy the Free World.
"Sergeant Major, move the men in."
"All right, you lot, move."
Mind your backs.
Gangway.
I found the four extra carriages you need.
- Good.
- You'll have your thousand men.
- I'd rather be with them than here.
"- Finland appeals to you, does it?"
- Is it the country or the ladies?
- Just a brief surge of patriotism.
- Are you coming for a drink?
"- Thanks, no."
Perhaps tomorrow.
Hello?
- See you in the morning.
- Yes.
Three that I can see from here.
Cheers.
- Mr Faber?
"- Hello, Billy."
I've got another interview with the army.
You don't look any older than you did last week.
My mate Harry's got some cream that'll take the pimples off just like that.
There's no need to rush.
"There'll be plenty of war left, I can promise you."
But I want to fight now.
Everyone's in uniform except me.
He must die in jealous.
And I must watch it.
What if our parents know it.
"I'll not tell, you too don't tell anyone."
I'll play with his life taking him to home.
"This bracelet was made in India, buyer's details are taken before selling it to them."
First find the jewellary shop.
"If you give this bracelet number, they will give the buyer's details."
"Kinsman, our children have agreed to marry, I'm very happy."
"Yes, I never felt so happy even when I made billions."
That's why I'm throwing this party.
"You said your son-in-law lives in Malaysia, where's he?"
They are also beautiful!
"Didn't I say, I'm Jiguru Jingania?"
"I didn't tell my name, right?"
'Run' Prakash Raj.
"Dear, didn't your short man come with you?"
What's this dad?
"All can't be tall like you, look down, dad."
"Have you come, son-in-law?"
"Why did you come so late, brother-in-law?"
What's this new get up?
That is...
"Kinsman, my son-in-law."
Nobody knows when I'll come.
Do you know why you're here?
Just a joke.
"Jokes apart, why did you change your name?"
That is...
"It seems you're here for a year, and refusing to go to India."
What's the matter?
I made an attempt to murder.
"I guess I always thought it was about human limitation, both mental and physical."
"Okay, that..."
that just blew my face off.
"Well, I hope that helps."
It does.
"Thank you so much, Miss Murray."
This has been terrific.
"Hey, uh, before we go, do you mind if I use your restroom?"
It was a long drive up here.
"No, go right ahead."
We should do something without him sometime.
Do you like tapas?
Someone invited me out for that once.
"I thought they said topless, so I was like,"
(high-pitch): what?
That's a good story.
"Hey, you know, that was really cool how you told us what ""Snowbird"" was about."
"Well, you know, that's just the way"
I always interpreted the song.
But I suppose Gene probably could have explained it better than I.
Who's Gene?
Gene MacLellan.
He wrote the song.
I see.
"But you wrote all your other songs, right?"
"No, all of my songs were written by other people."
"As a singer, I've been blessed to interpret the works of many gifted, sensitive songwriters."
Oh.
"So, you're just a big (bleep) liar?"
Sit back down.
"All right, come on, Stewie, let's go home... (muffled grunts)"
"Stewie, what the hell are you doing?"
I was cooking dinner that night.
I had to start braising the beef and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with meat gravy and I'm planning to roast some peppers over the flames put on some string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets that were cut just right that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.
"So, I was home for about an hour."
My plan was to start the dinner early so Karen and I could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want then get the package for Lois to take to Atlanta for her trip later that night.
"I kept looking out the window, and I saw that the helicopter was gone."
"Michael, keep an eye on the sauce."
Stay here with your uncle Michael.
So I asked my brother to watch the sauce.
and Karen and I started out.
"Oh, God."
I see it.
- I see it.
"Look, it's right there."
- Damn!
- That's it.
- There it is.
We got to get to your mother's.
"See, I told you."
It's funny.
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.
"Go inside, tell your mother not to touch anything outside the house."
Nothing.
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.
Let's go shopping.
"I'm not nuts, it's been following me all morning."
I'm telling you.
Fine.
"- Me, too!"
- Princess!
Your words alone are enough.
Princess...
"All of you, please live on."
And try to give the people of Estabul at least a little bit of happiness.
"For that, I would..."
You've created a problem for me.
All of your cares for your kingdom are quite moving.
"However, in my view, Lady Noa Ehn's life alone isn't enough to atone for all of your crimes."
"Yes, is a tragedy not the most fitting adornment for the tragedy of the kingdom of Estabul perishing?"
Who are you?
"I am Miran Froaude, Colonel of the Imperial Roland Army."
How did you get here?
Did you kill every soldier outside?
Certainly not.
This castle wouldn't fall so easily.
"Of course, even if it did fall, Roland soldiers still couldn't come inside."
After all this place will now play a part in the finale of the tragedy.
Let there be darkness!
- Protect the princess!
- Got it!
But we can't leave everyone...
Get inside!
Everyone's dead.
The kingdom...
The people...
Everything's been lost.
"No, there's still something left."
What do we have left?
Your life.
The cornered Estabul soldiers riot.
There comes a time in every man's life when he wants to be left alone.
"Now, go away."
"All right, who wants the queen of the may?"
"How about you, handsome?"
You look like Cary Grant.
You want to dance with me?
"I'd love to, Queenie but, well, one of the other girls asked me first."
"Bye, darling."
Bye.
"Any cigars left, Cookie?"
"Come on, Cookie, get me a cigar."
What's the matter?
You on their team now?
You think I'm the guy?
I don't know what to think anymore.
I understand how you feel.
It's sort of rough one American squealing on other Americans.
"Then again, Cookie maybe that stoolie's not an American at all."
Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks.
They do that sometimes.
"Just put an agent in with us, a trained specialist."
Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp.
Not just whether somebody's trying to escape.
"What outfit we were with where we were stationed, how our radar operates."
"Could be, couldn't it?"
In this barracks?
Why not?
Just one of the boys.
"Sharing our bunks, eating our chow."
Right in amongst the ones that beat me up.
Except he beat hardest.
Who is it?
I had to give my undivided attention to the repairing of the wires.
Cutter and MacChesney should have watched out for the enemy... but they were off chasing butterflies or something like that.
"I finally got the detachment to the river, and we dived in and escaped."
"Tommy, you're so marvelous."
"That's all there is to it, I suppose."
On the last roof we almost lost MacChesney.
His great elephant hoof crashed through and stuck.
- How did you get him out?
- We had to saw his leg off at the hip.
"If you don't believe me, just look behind that shrub."
Save some for the elephant.
Destroy the evidence.
"- Stand guard, will you?"
- Yeah.
"Never mind that, Sergeant."
Stand easy.
"- Good evening, Colonel."
"- Evening, Stebbins."
"- Good evening, Major."
- How are you?
No formality.
We just dropped in to wish little Emmy the best of luck.
"That's very nice of you, sir."
I'll bring Emmy to you.
"- Looks like a jolly party, Sergeant."
"- Yes, sir."
"Very jolly, sir."
Is that a punch bowl you're shutting out?
Is that punch?
"Some peoples calls it a punch, sir, but I calls it swill."
Nonsense.
Stebbins is famous for his punch.
- That's just me.
- Yeah?
"Well, I'm starting... the bottomless trend."
"Hence, the bottomless party."
So what are you guys doing in South Beach?
How about you answer that question?
I'm gonna go check this out.
- Where are you going?
"- Bang bang, buddy."
Listen.
I'm really sorry to bother you with this.
- You all right?
- Not really.
"They were locked up for less than an hour, and they already escaped?"
Damn it.
Make sure the press doesn't get wind of this.
Don't need the public thinking we're some two-bit operation.
"Got it, sir."
It must have been either al-Qaeda or North Korea who broke 'em up.
Find out if they have any relatives in the country.
You probably should have done that in the first place.
"Do you have a problem with the way I'm running the show, Beecher?"
I'm just saying that...
I've looked through the files on Harold Lee and Kumar Patel.
They were both born and raised in New Jersey.
"Other than a couple of traffic tickets, they're clean."
Right.
That's why they just broke out of prison.
But they--It's not even clear that they should have been there in the first place.
Shut your--
"You see this cute, little white girl, Beecher?"
Yeah.
Like you'd say to somebody:
"""You'll like this guy."
He's all right.
"He's a goodfella, he's one of us."""
You understand?
We were goodfellas.
Wiseguys.
But Jimmy and I could never be made because we had Irish blood.
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.
"To become a member of a crew, you've got to be 100% Italian so they can trace your relatives back to the old country."
It's the highest honor they can give you.
It means you belong to a family and a crew.
It means nobody can fuck around with you.
It also means you could fuck around with anybody just as long as they aren't also a member.
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.
How many years ago since you were made?
- I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago.
- Thirty years?
Brings back a lot of memories.
"Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?"
"As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made it was like we were all being made."
We would now have one of our own as a member.
- Who's this?
- This is Vinnie.
Vinnie.
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?
"No, we had a problem."
We tried to do everything we could.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Wow drama in a wedding that's shocking.
Yeah well Jill wants this chapel filled with eight thousand red roses and some like...
Eighty thousand dollar wedding dinner and seven thousand dollar wedding dress.
And her dad won't cover the entire tab.
Wow I'm very glad that I'm not Drew right now.
Or her dad.
"Yeah but that's just Jill, you know?"
Only love her for it she's extravagant.
You know I've known her since I was eleven.
We went to boarding school together.
You went to boarding school when you were eleven.
Did you miss your parents a lot?
Yeah... it's complicated.
When did you get home to see them?
"Well on the holidays, or you know the occasional odd long weekend."
I liked boarding school.
It was what I needed.
How do you mean?
Well my parents died when I was a kid.
I told you that right?
No I'm very sorry I didn't know that.
How did they die together?
No they actually died separately.
Um my was when I was 5.
My mom when I was 11.
"Oh no, no, no it's not sad."
It was a really long time ago.
I just don't talk about it much because...
Um what about your parents?
They're... still together right?
"Still together yeah, after 30 years."
And totally in love with each other.
Listen to us first.
"We took you away from the Germans, didn't we?"
"I do not ask, I understand..."
We'll untie you today... and tomorrowyou'll order us to be executed...
"No, no, captain..."
They are young and stupid...
We want to help.
We've heard that our...
yourtroops are planning an offensive...
There is a minefield overthere.
We've laid all these mines.
We know all the passages and can showthem.
And what?
Do you think you'll score any points forthat?
"You maywant to receive awards forthat, eh?"
Who is going to believe you afteryou voluntarily defected?
"It is not so simple, captain."
"Grisha received a heavywound and was captured unconscious, and Valera followed him to the camp and was wounded later."
It is a heart-breaking story.
This is exactly what is called a voluntary defection.
and high treason.
"What should we do, then?"
- May be...
Yes!
-What's up?
Are you nuts?
"Come to your senses, folks?"
"Excuse us for doing anything wrong, comrade captain."
and for being harsh with you.
Sit down!
It is them!
- Hands up!
Get up there.
- Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
- Get off!
Get the fuck off me!
I don't know how they got in.
"I mean, how can they have gotten the door code?"
It changes every shift.
Unless someone...
They knew the code and I told Mere...
I told Meredith to lock herself inside the broadcast room to broadcast over the emergency channel.
Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
They've cut into all our other secure lines of communication.
I don't know how.
"I mean, who could know that much?"
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
Wait.
What did he just say?
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
They cut into the operator line?
You did speak to someone on the phone.
You spoke to the operator.
Yes.
"I swear to God, if you were pretending to talk to someone..."
"Katherine, I gave him the code."
He verified the code.
"Yeah, but did you verify him?"
"""Cardiff, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Belfast, Liverpool, Slough."""
Operator.
That wasn't the right code.
What?
What I just called in.
"- No, I canceled."
"- So, what do you want to do for dinner?"
- What?
Why don't you make that pasta with the artichokes?
"Then maybe later, we can figure out what to do with your hair for Claire's wedding."
What is this?
Look at this.
I wish I could escape.
"The mating ritual is both speedy and violent for these passionate insects, with the lesser male often covering the larger female."
"If unsuccessful in mounting, the male is often eaten by the female during copulation."
We're the girls of 1-400-Hot-Talk.
"Brianna, Tina, Marla and me, Felicia."
"Anything you want to talk about, call me."
Call me.
Call me.
I don't really know where to begin.
"Are you lonely tonight, darling?"
Yeah.
- So am I. What are you wearing?
- Nothing special.
"Felicia, can I ask you a question?"
Want to know what I'm wearing?
Just wearing a towel.
I was drying myself off after a hot shower when you called...
- Why do women leave?
- What?
Why do women leave?
Especially beautiful women.
I can't go through this anymore.
Life is very complex.
There are no guarantees.
Why should that be?
There are many such interesting and sensational cases.
"Now that we know each other, I'll tell you about it in leisure."
What are you doing tomorrow evening?
Nothing.
Why do you ask?
- l have some work with your father.
A good reason to meet you too.
No place for reasons.
You can drop in at any time.
"I must leave now, Miss Sheetal."
So early?
- Even I have to work for a living.
"And this fool had to drop in now, you see."
Bye!
"Sheetal, meet Vijay."
And she is my daughter Sheetal.
"My dear, he is a daredevil police officer."
I see?
"So, he is a police officer?"
"I don't understand one thing, daddy."
The crime is on the rise day by day.
What does the police do about it?
"Mr Sahney, our police force and the C.l.D has set an example for the world."
"But, this fact is known only by few educated people like you and me."
Fools and illiterate people just ty to find flaws in it.
But we must not take them seriously.
What do you think?
"Am I not right, Miss Sheetal?"
Perhaps.
"But Daddy, if our police force is so effective then why doesn't crime cease?"
"Mr Sahney, if not cease, crime can be reduced."
But the people must also understand its responsibilities.
No!
You fucking roadkill.
Who... who kept wide eyes... when she jaws?
What?
We're on a deadline and there's a shortage of interns.
Bullshit.
I have appointments and I need someone to carry my Polaroid.
"- But we need her, darling."
- Get Foofy.
- I don't know where Foofy is.
- Filing cards for upcoming shoots.
You know we only use 5 models anyway.
Are you an idiot?
No!
So don't act like one.
So here is the trick for getting free stuff:
"You call Louis Vuitton, call in 4 bags and send back 3."
"The next day, call in 2 and send back 1..."
Then call in 5 and send back 4.
When they ask you to cough up... this luggage you delay and tell them it's on a shoot in Barbados.
"Until you find somebody over there quit, which is weekly."
And say you just sent it back to Sheila and fake surprise... when they say she left the company.
- No way.
- Lf they keep questioning you... tell them you messengered it over to Vogue.
An editor requested it.
- That's hilarious!
- Works every time.
"Hello, Louis V."
This soup is delicious.
It beats throwing an acceptable layout away.
It's such a chaos over there.
This whole Yuri hassle journey... is insane.
He appeared before me first time I presided over the moot court at Yale.
You could say Peter and I are joined at the hip.
"Thanks, Peter."
Please have a seat.
"Thank you for seeing me, Judge Stern."
And how can I help you?
Tino Zapatti.
What about him?
How did he get off with probation?
I can only sentence in accordance with the conviction.
He was convicted of criminal possession of the fourth degree.
They found a kilo in his car.
Is it your intention to try the case again?
Not at all.
But I read the rap sheet.
I am certified to this state as a Supreme Court judge and you're sitting here rearguing a 2-year-old case.
"You're out of line, and I'll so inform the mayor."
I'm here on the mayor's behalf.
You think I've slept the last two nights?
Don't you realize I know what a mistake I made?
That's it.
Satisfied?
No basement or anything?
"You saw it, the rumpus room."
With the pool table?
"That's right, Captain."
I'm only doing my job.
I'm very sorry...
"Oh, sorry, crap!"
You're snooping around like a Nazi.
"Please, you know this is the last thing I wanted to do."
Then get the hell out of Internal Affairs and get yourself an honest job.
"I'm starving, too."
There's probably something in here.
Karen's ziti?
It's the last one she made.
And it was like 300 degrees in that Minnie Mouse head?
"So I took it off, you know?"
I was gonna have a cigarette.
- And some kid took a picture of me.
"- Come on, girls."
These gentlemen have things to discuss.
Let's go.
Okay.
Thanks.
- Nice meeting you guys.
- We'll see you at the bar later.
"Look, Carmine."
You basically know what's going on with your dad and Johnny... and us over in Jersey.
"First let me say, I understand."
I appreciate the respect you're showing me by coming here... and reaching out to me at this time.
Always.
I will also go on record as saying...
I know my old man can be a tough nut to crack.
"I don't want to crack nuts, but I will."
I feel the anger.
"When I try, for the second time... on a separate issue entirely, to reach an accommodation... and he don't even make a counteroffer, where's his respect?"
I don't know what kind of advice he's getting from Johnny.
Johnny's always usually a voice of moderation.
"Me and him, we get along good."
"So, all due respect, let's not jump in and blame Johnny."
True.
John's a pragmatist.
But he's also a greedy motherfucker.
Just start looking.
Will you guys listen to yourselves?
All right.
"Come on out, Mr."
"I know you're fucking in here in the walls or something, laughing your ass off!"
The jig's up!
"Come on out, asshole!"
WOMAN:
I don't think he's going to answer.
Why?
"""November 27."

Positive function.
The machine continues to work perfectly.
"However, I've seen something in the future that is disturbing to my core."
I believe I've seen my death.
I know the cardinal rule of time and causality... is that one should not attempt to change the future.
"But under these circumstances, it seems to be a risk worth taking."
"If I believed in God,"
"I would pray today that no greater harm will come from what I'm about to do."""
Then what?
Nothing.
"That's the last entry, a week ago today."
A week ago.
Seven photos.
That means it was kicking it out after he disappeared.
So it must be on a timer.
8200 PM.
Then why are there so many daytime ones?
Maybe it's only been taking ones at night for the last week.
All right.
Even I have to admit this photo is a little fucking unsettling.
"Any problems, he goes to Paulie."
"Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie."
"Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy he can call Paulie."
But now the guy's gotta come up with Paulie's money every week no matter what.
"""Business is bad?"
"Fuck you, pay me."
"Oh, you had a fire?"
"Fuck you, pay me. """
"""The place got hit by lightning, huh?"
"Fuck you, pay me. """
"Also, Paulie could do anything."
Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?
Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.
"And as soon as the deliveries are made in the front door, you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount."
Take a $200 case of booze and you sell it for $100.
It doesn't matter.
It's all profit.
"And then finally, when there's nothing left when you can't borrow another buck from the bank or buy another case of booze you bust the joint out."
You light a match.
Do you need any help reaching anything?
"You look like you're decorating a Christmas tree, ya fuckin' prick."
She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
Who?
"The Jew broad, Diane."
I was tellin' you about inside.
"I been trying to bang this broad for a fuckin' month, now."
"The only thing, she won't go out with me alone, ya know?"
-No.
"-No, what?"
"No, what Henry?"
"Well, you know, ma'am, that's one of the strange things."
"Uh, actually I was on night duty when it happened."
And I was there when they remove your brother.
"Uh, he was working under the hood,"
"Apparently, when the car jumped out of gear."
Well?
Is there something else?
You're looking at me like you expect me to say something.
"I'm sorry, ma'am."
It's just that I was wondering if you knew where the battery
Is on your brother's car.
"Under the hood, I guess."
Isn't that where there are?
"No, ma'am."
"In your brother's car, the battery's behind the seat."
"You see, they have these two 6-volt batteries wired"
Together to make a 12-volt.
I don't know about electricity and cars.
"Well, anyway, there's one more thing."
The driver thinks there was someone
"Else there, that your brother might have been pushed."
"No, he was alone when he left here."
"Well, it's the way he fell backwards into the car."
The headlines...
Please.
OTIS:
"I'm sorry, ma'am."
It's just that I...
I have to check on everything.

"Hey, that sure is a fine dog you got there."
"Hello there, old girl."
I'm not sure.
Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
I like cows.
That's not the point.
It was its own point.
Go on.

My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.

How did Penny meet an astronaut?
I don't know.
The regular way people meet astronauts.
Most of those guys live in Texas.
"Obviously, this one doesn't."
Okay.
Leonard lives here.
Priya's from India.
"People meet, Howard."
God!
Fine.
"You've met lots of astronauts, and I've never grilled you about that."
I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
I'm not grilling you;
I was just curious.
I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part.
"Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't."
"Maybe that's where she met the astronaut, all right?"
I'm sorry.
What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?
"- No, no."
- There are consequences for disobedience!
- Tonight's the night.
"Together, my Mary we shall put on the performance of a lifetime."
Let the trial begin.
"Mary Bradbury, you stand accused of crimes most heinous."
"Witchcraft, devilry, sins against the Lord."
"Admit what you have done and repent, or you will be sentenced to murder by hanging."
- I didn't do anything.
I didn't hurt anyone.
- Yours is not the only soul on trial this day.
"You must also decide the fate of Susanna Sheldon, the young lady you brought down with your unholy ways."
- Mary... please save me.
- I didn't make her do anything.
- You lie.
"Susanna, tell the judges the truth."
- Mary Bradbury kidnapped me and forced me to commit sins against the Lord.
But...
"- What is it, Susanna?"
- Truthfully I enjoyed it.
- Do you see what your lies have wrought?
They've turned the purity of an innocent girl into the devil's plaything.
- I didn't.
I...
- You lie!
Confess!
"- No, you are a liar, Dr. Cairn."
You lied to me.
You took my faith away from me.
You are a monster.
"- As chief magistrate, I demand you go back to your position."
You're still under trial.
"It's heading straight down, right for Kelso sitting in his convertible."
I'm done.
"I'm out of a job, right?"
Wrong.
"At that second, a hawk flies in, grabs the thing and flies off with it."
I know what you're thinking.
We're in a city.
What's a hawk doing there?
I can't believe you get a locker and I don't.
"Dr. Reid, I need to meet you in Radiology to go over some test results."
"Yeah, it's over, Ricky."
I know you're stealing trays.
Stop it.
Buzz off.
"Carla, the orderly lost my chart for Mr. Tyler in 406."
Would we have his dosages?
"You put him on penicillin, but he was allergic, so you put him on vancomycin."
Thank you.
Wish you put some of that crazy-nurse memory to use on our missing dude.
"Well, he was an older guy and he was on an IV, so he couldn't have gotten very far."
He was jittery and he had this weird circle tan line on his arm.
It was the nicotine patch.
He was trying to quit smoking.
Should I not be out here?
"There he is, Mr. Spot on His Lungs."
"Don't worry, we'll pop that lung out, get it to the dry cleaners and have it back to you after five."
We like to have fun.
I made up that whole hawk story.
Yeah.
I know you're not as weird as you want people to think you are.

You know?
Give me your right hand.
How about folding your sleeve back?
"This stuff gets on your shirt, it'll never come out."
"And slide these on for me, if you don't mind."
"This, uh-This is you, isn't it?"
"Uh, kind of hard to tell from here."
"Put those on for me, if you don't mind."
"In some situations, a tactical retreat is your best option."
"Listen, bud."

Yeah.

Hurry up.
Get to the funny part so I can laugh.
"The funny part is, I've won your high hat."
Off with it please.
Tell me more.
You are now talking to one of your employers.
"The young man with a fall production, remember?"
"Oh, yes, that is funny."
Where would you get money to put into a show?
"Well, young lady, I'll tell you."
The only thing ahead was the old homestead in Connecticut.
So I put a plaster on it.
You trying to tell me you mortgaged something to buy into this show?
Any law against it?
Did my father talk you into this?
The old gentleman with a lovely daughter?
(Patricia) Answer my question.
"Well, being my oldest and dearest friend he was kind enough to introduce me to the producers."
"'Ah, just a minute.'"
- You owe my a high hat.
- Sue me?
"Oh, hello, my dear."
Just sitting here anticipating a few small profits.
Your rehearsal go well?
"Father, you got him to put everything into this show."
"But, my dear, I did him a great favor."
I should have benched Grimes on the bin-Khalid raid.
"Rebecca, he was messed up before the mission, okay?"
He started talking crazy about this conspiracy and that conspiracy - I just...
"I should have reported it, brought it to you, but I covered for him, I just..."
I tried to get his head straight.
We all missed it.
"Now my men are dead, because of Grimes."
"And now he has the list, and, uh... if any more people get killed..."
You can't put this on yourself.
Are you going to help me or not?
"Even if I do, how do you expect to get into the station?"
In the back of a patrol car.
You're gonna let them arrest you?
"Look, I'm a black man standing on the corner at 3rd and Decatur."
"Trust me, it won't be that hard."
"Just be ready to take care of the security cameras, okay?"
I'll call you when I'm inside.
Carter?
Drop the bag.
Where the hell you going?
- Just walking.
- Yeah?
How about you walk over there and put your hands on the wall?
"Whoa, whoa, Paul, Paul, come on, easy."
Pat him down.
"Hey, come on, you're gonna break his arm."
I said pat him down.
"Whoa, oh, oh, oh, easy, all right?"
"His gun, get it and kick it over here."
- Hurry up.
- All right.
All right.
It won't change the way I feel.
"I've tried steroids, fluid restriction."
Nothing's working.
Neuro says he's not a surgical candidate.
I'm gonna take Tammy into surgery now.
Okay.
How's she doing?
She'll be fine.
"Yeah, physically, but she will not forgive herself, and nothing I said was gonna get her... you guys think that when we die,"
"There's like a bookkeeper, and he tallies up everything we did... all the lives we saved, all the people we helped, and if we've done enough good in the world, that it makes up for the times that we just completely fail?"
No.
I don't think anyone's keeping score.
"I think we do what we can, we hope for the best, and that's all anybody can do, right?"
"I think, uh, I think that we..."
"we do what we can do when we know how to do it, and it hurts."
It just... it hurts.
Violet's in the kitchen.
Hello.
Hi.
Come here.
Hi.
Yes.
Yeah.
Hmm.
"So I have this 11-year-old patient, stabbed her father."
"Turns out she has a pheochromocytoma, which made her... aggressive."
"Um, Addison's gonna remove it, but this girl just can't forgive herself."
Maybe she needs more time.
Time?
So should I offer her time?
"Well, what do you want, Cooper, a magic pill?"
Bad things happen.
"Unless Emilie has come back to life, the meeting will begin in a minute, with or without you."
- I'll contact the Ministry of Justice.
- Do that.
I was about to suggest it.
- How the hell did he get away?
- I don't know.
- They're still looking for him.
- You were right.
Emilie wasn't shot.
She wasn't there.
"They're searching his car for clues,"
- What the hell have you found then?
- Louise Hjelby's crime scene.
It seems she was picked up by her killer in a black car on her way home.
"He took her to an old boat builder's yard, where she was held captive and abused."
- Then he faked a suicide in the harbour.
- And the perpetrator found this place?
"He's trying to find whoever did it, with a notebook he's acquired."
- What notebook?
"- A bay was writing down license plates,"
The perpetrator took the book from Borch.
- The Zeuthens have just arrived.
- How did Borch get that book?
You'll have to ask Borch or Special Branch about that.
There was a reason.
I'd like to explain.
I don't want...
We've searched the dunes and the beach with a team of dogs.
- They lost the scent by the stream.
- He's on foot.
He's wounded.
They think he followed the stream inland.
But let me tell you something.
I'd rather blow one in 100 than send 10 men away on mandatories who don't deserve them.

And you sound like you're fucking with me.
"You have anything to add, Abe?"
It's okay.
You're doing fine.

- Larry.
I owe you an apology.
No apologies.
I came in here with a big head of steam.
It was inappropriate.
"Look, it takes more than 3 years to get up to speed in this department."
Only one man would have made a good probation officer:
Kafka.
And he wasn't available.
"Thank you, Larry."
Call me if something opens up in the big building.
"You know, keep me in mind."

I don't think it makes any difference whatsoever.
Have your son stop by.
I'll be happy to take care of it.
"Gussie, come on in."
"Hello, Mr. Anselmo."
"Yes, Miss Sheetal?"
What makes you remember me?
Did someone flirt with you again?
"No, nothing as such."
I read in the papers about your chase with the smugglers.
Did you read it?
They have glorified you.
I thought of congratulating you.
And I called you up.
Oh I see.
Now I get it.
I wondered why'd a pampered rich girl phone a pem police officer.
"But someone said it right, that today's girls are impressed by famous people."
You must've already boasted to eveyone that you know me vey well.
"You must be getting a lot of attention, don't you?"
What?
What do you think of me?
My mistake to call you up!
What do you think ofyourself?
A pem police officer.
What's the matter?
You seem to be short-tempered.
You think you've earned international fame with a piece ofyour exploits in the papers?
You think I called you because I am impressed by your fame?
Ifthis is not the reason...then there is only one reason leR.
And that reason you and I know vey well.
I'll definitely give it a thought.
Have seen yourself in the mirror?
I am afraid... yes.
While shaving today morning.
"Actually, my face is vey expressive."
Especially my eyes.
They'll take care of us really fast
So there's no room for bitching
- Give me a bill
What for do you want a bill?
I'll enter the bank
"Hey, you're learning fast"
"What a way to learn, eh"
Take a good look in there
Look at the cash desk
"The camera, the cashier"
"I want to make a deposit, please"
The window on the right
- Thanks
What do you want?
I want to change this into smaller bills
Here you have
- Thanks
At what time did we agree?
At eight o'clock
It's 8:10 and these guys haven't arrived yet
"Fuck, you just can't trust anyone"
Do I look good?
It's very good
Here they are
Good luck
- See you later
Do you like that one?
That's the one
As much as the 131 is well liked
"Everyone likes that car, eh?"
We'll need another one coming
We can't have that one
Look at this.
Conventional grenades.
"Completely normal, without any hocus-pocus."
Or what?
"It looks like this, but we aren't stopping there!"
Depleted uranium.
What happens then?
Look here.
I had to do something simpler than dropping a bomb on them.
Like for example put it in grease.
A kind of cream.
But with a very different effect and result.
Here.
For example:
Number 47.
"Stopzsky, Shlomo Stopzsky."
Exposed to radioactive radiation for several minutes.
With a remarkable result.
Imagine this...
"A larger dose, nicely wrapped and shipped to Winston Churchill!"
Do you understand?
We are what's left!
We are the nation's backbone.
Or to put it like our beloved Führer does:
"""We have so much to answer for, so we MUST win the war!"""

"Yes, Operation Sunshine."

- I will not believe..
I will make him believe.
Stretch your hands
OK..
"The place you live is Uganda, your wife is Linda and she completely ditched you."
"No, it is a lie."
[SpeakingGibberish]
Half proof has come and now I will show you the full proof.
"To send a few into coma by mixing cocaine in coke, he put cocaine packet in this pocket."
This is peaks PK sir.
Do you say what is in pockets just by catching the hands?
Oh my God!
All this looks like a setup.
I do not believe.
Will you believe if I say your hierarchy?
- Tell me.
Stretch your hands.
Your Name:
Maniratnam.
Too busy for personal hygiene?
"When I am focused, I am focused."
"You know, McGee like them gamey, but I'm not sure he'd go for this one."
"Oh, I clean up nice."
Why don't you put the computer down and step out here?
"Let's go, Animal Kingdom."
Come on.
"So, who are you working with?"
"Ah, um..."
I don't know.
"Well, we know some stuff about the blackmail and about the AUTEC account."
We also know that you're in cahoots with someone inside Wickes Steel.
Um...
Did you just use the word cahoots?
I did.
Nice.
"All right, somebody hired me, through Wickes, but, uh, I don't have a name."
Didn't want one.
Was it Ridgeway?
Did you kill him?
I don't kill people.
I hack.
I haven't really left the van.
No kidding.
"Next time, hacker, why don't you crack a window?"
This is all of Baylor's computer hardware.
No sign of the rifle used to shoot Ridgeway in her van or in the apartment.
"Abby, you do know that AUTEC is just a facility where they run tests, right?"
"No, Tim, it is a potluck of the unexplained, and this scientist is eating it up; you know why?"
Because there's a lot of really important things that can't be explained.
"Like what, Abbs?"
Like Atlantis.
except you who are a badass.
DICAPRIO:
"You hunt and fish here, right?"
AWA:
Yeah.
DICAPRIO:
"What do you, what do you fish and what do you hunt?"
AWA:
"In my territory I hunt fish, seal, narwhal, and polar bear."
DICAPRIO:
Is this polar bear?
AWA:
Yup.
DICAPRIO:
"Oh, well there you go!"
"And the ice here, since you've been around has it been decreasing?"
AWA:
"We used to have a solid ice, blue."
"Not light blue like this, blue."
"Hard, ice."
"Now we usually have a, kind of ice cream type of ice."
"It's ice but it's, when it starts to melt, it melts pretty fast."
Much faster than before.
"DR. SALA: 2040, you will be able to sail over the North Pole."
There's going to be no sea ice left in the Arctic Ocean in the summer.
We are burning so many fossil fuels that the ice is melting.
The Arctic is like the air conditioning for the Northern Hemisphere.
"If it goes away, that's going to change currents, that's going to change weather patterns, that's going to make floods and droughts more catastrophic."
It's the most dramatic transformation of a large environment ever.
Look at this.
DICAPRIO:
They're right here!
Because the stone is too small

Only ladies have come?
What about the male members?
He is a merchant at Rangoon
He will come once in three years only
"Bye, visit frequently"
"Quick, If you delay like this you will be late for school"
-Look there
- How did he come here?
Why are you standing here?
This is my house We are the new tenants
-ls that so?
"-OK, you may go"
"Careful, leg, gently"
Bye
"Mom,you have gone there without giving me breakfast"
That girl insisted that I must attend the house warming
"Poor girl, she is one legged, bye!"
One legged?
What is he saying?
"-She had both the legs, right?"
-Yes
What do you think about yourself?
Will you give us the amount demanded by us or not?
Do you know who we are?
"If you donate funds for us you are saved, otherwise..."
Let us see how you run this factory
You are talking over phone as we are screaming from here?
Creating mischief?
will tear you apart
"Boss, did you call me?"
Force of habit.
Fire marshals will be by to talk with her next.
Any impressions?
"If I had to guess, I'd say she was telling the truth."
Where's Joan?
She's at your computer.
"Said she has a theory as to how Tendu got his $100,000."
What do you got?
"Oh, hey."
"So, this is one of the last pictures that Tendu uploaded to social media."
"Now, the logo belongs to a company called AmpVX."
They make top-of-the-line headphones.
"According to this, the headphones he's wearing haven't even been released yet."
"A friend of mine who dated a Met once, she said the guy never wore brand name unless he was getting paid."
Tendu is a professional athlete now.
Significant percentage of the money athletes make is from sponsorship deals.
How do we get ahold of someone from AmpVX?
There won't be anyone in the New York office until tomorrow.
But?
In Beijing...
it's already tomorrow.
WATSON:
Hao.
Your call went well.
It did.
What is that?
That's roasted huitlacoche.
It's corn smut.
Do you want some?
Ugh.
No thanks.
"So, the VP at AmpVX's Beijing headquarters said they signed Tendu to a five-year, multi-million dollar sponsorship deal."
"Becky, give me a minute, will you?"
"Trevor, you know better than to come here."
"Yeah, I know."
I'm sorry.
We talked about this.
"Yeah, I know, Clark, but, please, I really have to talk to you."
- Not here.
Not now.
- But it's important.
"I'll come by as soon as I can, but get the hell out of here, and don't ever come back."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, ok."
That's much better.
That's much better.
Now you have to turn these both around.
This signature.
And then bring it...
Get everyone in there.
There are approximately two hours between Ramon's abduction here and his escape here.
He crossed the train tracks here.
"Now, given the time and distance parameters, there's no way the unsub could have ventured outside this radius."
"Ok, he said the train was close, and he heard laughter and loud music."
I looked at points of interest next to the train tracks and there really isn't much.
"There's a warehouse, a taco stand that would have been closed, and a bar called the Drunken Dog."
Why stop there?
He need a drink?
He doesn't seem like the drinking type.
He's not impulsive or sloppy enough.
"I live to serve you, sir."
"Garcia, what can you tell us about a bar called the Drunken Dog?"
"Ooh, I like it already."
Let's see.
"Uh, it's been around 30 years."
"Fortunately, the producers are two of my oldest and dearest friends."
"And, uh, ahem, I may be able to persuade the boys to part with a small piece of the show."
"Mind you, I said I might be able to."
"Chop's coming right along, my dear?"
"- Yes, in a moment, father."
"- Uh, may I?"
"- Thanks, I think I can manage."
- Ah..
"Charming girl, your daughter."
Nice of you to go to all this trouble for me.
"Oh, anything to make you happy."
(Tyler) 'It's a special ambition of mine to feature you' 'in my first production.
Or did I tell you.'
"(Patricia) 'Yes, I think you did.'"
"Sorry, I'm already rehearsing in a play."
- What kind of a play?
"- A musical called Hooray For Love, if you must know."
"Ooh, Hooray For Love."
Good show?
"(Patricia) 'Surely not as good as the one you'll produce, but it'll do.'"
"Huh, hot."
"Careful, not too much salt."
- You don't like salt?
- Hate salt.
You forgot this little corner over here.
Thank you.
"Tell me, uh, is the young one mine?"
How did you guess?
"Mr. Ganz, do you recall telling me the other afternoon when my daughter was rehearsing that you could use some additional money?"
"Whether you like it or not, you'll be in my fall production."
- Bet you my high head I won't.
- It's a bet.
Are you sure?
"Thank you, but I wait in the car."
What's the matter with you?
I'm sad for my father.
"All right, but you gotta get over it."
So I unwrap the paper... and there she is... with her head held high and her ears perked up.
And there I am smiling.
What happened then?
"Still, I gotta be the sad clown."
"A front for my friends, my family."
"You know, a brave front."
I've heard you describe yourself this way.
The sad clown.
I've never seen it.
Carmela also painted a very different picture.
What do you mean?
"Volatile, punching the walls."
Compulsive gorging on food.
Kind of a far cry from the seltzer bottle and bicycle horn.
I'm sorry.
"Maybe you'd like Carmela to be here, if I'm so fucking obnoxious."
"What I'm trying to establish is your response to sadness... is usually rage, not humor."
You two don't have to trouble yourselves.
Because I doubled my dosage.
I don't want you taking 80 milligrams of Prozac.
"You kick it up to 80 for a week, 10 days... just to pull back on the stick, get the nose up... then you duck back down to 40 before the limp dick thing sets in."
One:
that's ineffective.
Two:
it's not a treatment for grief.
Let's get back to Pie-O-My.
It's sad that you've lost something that you love.
"At the time, I had no idea that he was going to build a crazy boat."
It's a weird-looking thing.
"Yeah, we saw that coming in yesterday."
"""What the hell is that thing?"""
"Yeah, it looks like sort of a, you know, Jules Verne thing."
Lou built this boat out of steel.
It's a music barge that motors up to small towns all over the world and opens up into a concert stage.
"It was commissioned by a man named Robert Boudreau, who is both the ship's captain and the orchestra conductor."
I didn't tell him that I was Lou's son.
- Hi.
"- Hi, Robert."
Hi.
- Nice to see you.
"- Hi, there."
What are you up to?
Put that damn thing down.
"- Yeah, how are you?"
"- Hi, nice to meet you."
- Quite a boat you have here.
- Thanks.
This is that symphony boat to that cruiser in front of us.
I think it might be a good idea if you just moved out until we went in to dock and then came back in.
"So, Robert, this boat is very futuristic."
"Oh, yeah, people say this thing's from Mars, you know?"
"You know, I love this boat."
"This is my boat, I created it, with Lou."
- So you loved him?
"- Oh, yeah."
"That's a Louie Kahn doorway for sure, isn't it?"
You don't get 'em any better than that.
Isn't that amazing?
"Well, take a look."
That isn't a problem now.
I hope my question didn't annoy you.
"No, no, not at all."
Was her father here?
Yes.
Heasked meifiwasafaggot.
You're kidding!
"Well, he used the American expression, it's more subtle."
What was my orientation?
What did you say?
That I'm into men.
Really?
"No, silly, I lied to him."
How dare he ask me jf I like men or women?
Who cares?
"Well, I'm glad to know."
Did he ask the head nurse if she's a dyke?
Did he ask you if you like bestiality or coprophagy?
"No, you're right."
You don't ask things like that.
"I may have to travel, so I can't come and see you every week."
"But, in Geneva, they've offered me a creation, a choreography, and that thrills me,"
I've got an old idea for a ballet.
"It's called ""Trenches""."
It's about World War I.
Problem.
"You need lots of male dancers because in the war, sorry, there are lots of soldiers."
But in Geneva everyone dances.
It's wonderful.
"There are also ballerinas because in the ballet when a soldier dies from his body emerges his soul, his ghost, and that's a ballerina."
"Long tutu, white like the ""willis"""
"in ""Giselle"", classical, but with blood stain, red."
No..
Who is he?
Tell me
Who is he?
Will you torture her when asked to act like her husband as she got a doubt?
She is my wife and my everything.
Will you put your hands on her?
I will shoot you
Stop it.
"Vasu, that is.."
She is..
- No need!
You have cheated me for all these years.
Do not try any further.
Tomorrow is Rahul's marriage.
"Once that is over, you just not need to resign for all your designations in the company, but also withdraw your Legislative Council nomination."
"Else, I will have to open up."
Mind it!
Thanks bro!
Nothing more and nothing less.
All have smashed it up.
"Subramanyam sir, you were awesome."
Medal is guaranteed for you.
Thank you..
Hello..
He is unconscious as he was tortured for many days.
What is the condition sir?

"Go, play. boy."
Play
"Thy mother plays and I play, too but so disgraced a part."
"How now, boy?"
What has smudged thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine.
"- Come, Captain, we must be neat."
"- I am like you, they say."
"Why, that's some comfort."
"Go, play, Mamillius."
"'A sudden madness had struck down Leontes, the King of Sicilia."
"'In the twinkling of an eye, it had turned him against those he loved best."

"- What, Camille, there?"
"- Ay, my good lord."
"Ha' you not seen, Camille - but that's past doubt - that my wife is slippery?"
You never spoke what did become you less than this.

This is 2007.
And I have a friend who worked for the Irish chart-compiling company.
"He said, 200 copies, if you buy them in the correct stores that are chart-tracking that month."
It will get you to 27?
"That's all you need for 27, yeah."
So I recorded a song in two hours.
"It was called Orange, about ladies who wear too much tan and we burned it."
Rude.
It's rude.
"Oh, really?"
But you know...
I love a tan.
"You know the one that stops there on the jawline, where it's just complete whiteness."
"What, you mean me about twice a month?"
"Hey, really?"
"Yeah, there's no shame in it."
Sometimes you put it on when you're a bit drunk.
You end up with one big orange hand.
Yeah.
My first husband had...
An orange cock.
LAUGHTER
My first husband had no true idea of my actual ethnicity until well after we got married.
He just thought I was kind of a Mediterranean dusky beauty until about six months.
"He just pulled back the duvet one day and went, ""Fuck!"""
"And I was kind of like a pale blue colour, like a pale, white, porridgy colour."
"""Hello, I'm from Cumbria."" That's exactly it."
"Sorry, I get..."
"So we recorded this song, we burnt 200 copies on my laptop and made a cover."
You just need a barcode.
It isn't very hard to get.
And registered me as a label.
"I've got nobody to spend them on, except you."
Now you won't let me have any fun at all.
"Oh, but i'd love to have that necklace."
I've always been hungry for pretty things.
All right.
We'll form a corporation.
Josie mansfield and company.
"Still talking big, mr."
Fisk.
"Oh, show business ain't any different from any other business- you can't stay in it unless you make money out of it."
I'll build you up like i would a big corporation.
"Your assets are looks, talent, and ambition."
You'll be a fine investment.
Even corporations can fail.
Not mine.
Not jim fisk's.
I've got the golden touch.
I got it here.
No.
I think you've got it there.
"Oh, jim, may i see you a moment?"
What's on your mind?
"Well, uh... oh, don't mind josie."
She's one of the firm.
There isn't anything you can't say in front of her.
I'm afraid i'll have to see you alone.
Will you excuse me?
"Old man drew's outside, and he's hopping mad."
"The madder you get a goose, the easier it is to pull his tailfeathers."
But what good's a handful of tailfeathers if you lose a golden egg?
"Keep him here in our henhouse, i'll be with you in a minute."
"You know, josie, i've got a feeling in my bones that you're going to bring us luck."
"It's glorious, isn't it?"
I'm surprised that it arrived so soon.
Yea.
Terrific.
I'll just have a go at the gears.
Then you can take her out for a spin.
"Double-time it, Magnum."
Swimsuit on.
"Mr. Higgins, if you could have it ready by the time Magnum finishes his swim, that would be perfect."
No problem.
"Actually, Magnum, I quite envy you the bike race... because the course cuts through the Austin Memorial Gardens, which are normally off-limits to visitors."
I've been there.
You have?
Yeah.
"Well, Roger wrote about the Austin Gardens a lot, so it was the first place I went when I landed."
He worked there when he first came to the Islands.
Why didn't you tell me this?
I'm your investigator.
I don't know.
"Well, he wasn't there."
They didn't know where he'd gone.
But they said he was wonderful with tropical flowers.
We have got to talk.
"When you've had your swim, then we'll try out the new bike."
"Barbara, I have the feeling you're stringing me along, and it's going to stop now."
What?
You don't think Roger proposed to me?
Oh.!
Or...
Or you think I'm the kind of girl that never gets proposed to.
"- No, that's not what I mean."
"- Well, I'll have you know... that in high school I was voted queen of the Friday night dance... twice."
You understand?
And and...
what elss?
"See this i have changed them, they were very old, i have spend the money."
See more carefully.
"You sold this car with lot of effect, and she was saying no."
"That's why Chandni made her unconscious, yeah Chandni?"
Yeah... yeah... if you were hitting her then why you were behind me?
Dad please think one more time.
"That's what i am thinking, we should leave its getting late."
200000000/-?
"Get some water madam is going unconscious, lets run with the car, this diamond is mine because this car is in my showroom."
Diamond is mine because the car is mine.
This diamond is four of us.
But what if Laxmi Narayan came to pick up the car then?
"Then we will sale him the car, what?"
But before that we will take out the diamond.
"You, never listen to me ever."
"Laxmi Narayan Jee i am Laila speaking, yeah?"
Can you come after one hour?
After one hour?
Actually papers will talk little time.
"All right, you know my nature right?"
I will come after one hour.
Quick.
Here it is...

"Let's have coffee, coffee?"

A girls' orchestra.
"She missed the tram, I caught up with her, officer, uniform.. she fell for it."
I greeted her and said:
I don't mind... wait... I said:
I don't mind escorting you even if it's several kilometres on foot.
Who wouldn't fall for that?
So I escorted her.
"Vinohrady, Streleck¨¢ 12... 23."
He's burbling on!
You missed the tram.
"I did, because it was... lt wasn't yet the Protectorate, but it was already looking gloomy."
I was impressed by the fact that she didn't want it:
Do you mind!
I have always been a protector of frail women.
"I was more frail than I am now, there's no arguing about that."
And she said to me:
"Slovaks have always impressed me, but not ones who go to pubs."
I said:
"D'you mind, I'm bored here."
"Where are those moments, the time I was young."
Then came the day when a dream died.

"I trust her, but I don't want her to experience some disappointment."
"She's going away for two months, to a new environment."
"Oh, sorry."
"I shoot straight, and hope that it'll be tempered by my teddy-bear cuteness."
Uh-huh.
Bullet hole through the window.
Clear.
Clear.
"Well, that's Ridgeway."
Looks like he's been dead a few days.
"What else do you see, Mr. Observant?"
This guy's not gonna be painting anytime soon.
"He's not gonna be answering any questions, either."
"Dr. Ryan, from the moment Jethro first mentioned your name and told me of your passion for the inner workings of the human mind,"
I knew I had found a kindred spirit.
Kindred spirit.
That's exactly what I was gonna to say.
"Plenty of time for spirits later, Duck?"
Ah.
"Thank you, Jethro."
Ever diligent in the war on small talk.
Single gunshot wound to the chest.

"Oh, please."
Mr. Ridgeway.
Do you mind if I call you Larry?
(whispers):
"Ooh, I like this woman."
You're gonna be vice president.
- You'll talk about legitimate issues of concern.
- Right.
Where is the senator's monitor?
There is no monitor for her.
She'll hear Pete in the earpiece.
That is a piece of shit.
"We talked about this, Ray."
"If Peter's gonna be able to see her, she has to be able to see him."
- He's got a sensory advantage over her.
- You wanna pull her?
I'm not talking about pulling her.
I'm just saying it's bullshit.
She was just great in the hearings today.
Cool and collected.
- Steve Poullet.
- Hi.
Should I hear anything?
"Oh, I got it."
"Okay, great."
"Oh, it's that one."
"Yeah, I know."
Can't hear...
"Yeah, right, got it."
"Okay, I've got the intro now."
"Thank you for having me, Peter."
"Sure, that'd be fine."
"Well, it has been a taxing experience... but if we're forced to take the voters out of the equation..."
I think that the vetting system by simple necessity must be arduous.
Mmm.
"I have to plead motherhood on that one, Pete... but I not only served on the Foreign Relations Committee..."
"I sponsored the Hanson-Fineman Bill which readjusted the War Powers Act... to allow the executive to respond to state-sponsored terrorism... like that of Iraq, Libya, North Korea, for instance."

-Don't act crazy.

"-I told you, inconspicuously!"
-What a lot of things.
-All of these can produce people.
It's fantastic.
We must take samples.
We should have started here and not with the inquiry.
"""They spare your time""."
Do you know what fascinates me the most about people?
How they live.
Packaged time.
Magnificence.
Those are exactly the same pictures.
Come to think of it... you sure do look like Suzukichi.
You are like two peas in a pod.
That's really something!
- Let's sleep with this door open tonight.
- Why?
"I don't know why, but I'm scared."
"When I shut my eyes, the picture of those eyes glares at me."
Cut it out!
Now you're going to make me have a nightmare!
Coward!
"Grandma's story, I wonder if it's true?"
"I can't believe that Suzukichi, who was a little weak in the head... came here to swim at night."
That just proves he was weak in the head.
Isn't it rather cold here?
Grandma says there's a water imp living in the basin of the waterfall.
Stop it!
Don't start a story like that.
"Come on, let's eat our lunch."
"By the way, what will you do if you go to Hawaii?"
"First of all, eat a pineapple."
You've sure got a limited imagination.
"Maybe it's only natural, since you're the reincarnation of Suzukichi."
"You are his double, including being weak in the head."
He was only joking.
"Tateo, what do you want to do?"
What else is there?
He'll devote himself to flirting with Clark's daughter.
Will you propose to her?
Don't be stupid!
Emily is one of our relatives.
She's related by blood to Grandma.
It looks like an intramuscular injection.
Absolutely alone.
I repeat my question:
Were you really alone last night?
Are you sure?
You had invited anyone?

"For whatever reason, you could have poisoned your patron."
And then deceived us by injecting it into yourself.

All this is not clear and I am obliged to place you under arrest.
Until you decide to tell us the truth.
But I am innocent.
I said all I knew.
You may enjoy explaining it to the Judge.
"""La Capitale"", latest edition!"

Come in.
The pictures you requested.
"Put them over there, thank you."
"Hello, Fandor!"
"Interesting, that paper of yours on the Norvins St. case."
You have surprised everyone once more.
And say so ...
Couldn't you push a little further?
"They have no adventures, these people?"
Adventures?
"Yes, you could write a scandalous article about the Baroness de Vibray and Dollon."
"After all, this is the only crime for 48 hours."
We must fill up the column.
And maybe you could drag some Fantomas in all this.
Bad news.
There's more red tape around that thing than I have ever seen.
"The good news is, I have a talent for badgering people until they give me what I need."
Hard to believe.
Wickes is lying low for a reason.
I think he eliminated the only remaining connection between his company and AUTEC.
I think he saw us snooping around.
I think he sent us straight to Ridgeway's door.
"I mean, who would suspect him?"
You.
(phone chimes)
Your son?
"You're not the only one who can spot a tell, Doc."
Parker's a funny kid.
He's trying to wrangle fast food out of my sister.
(laughs) No.
You got pictures?
Your surveillance pictures weren't good enough?
"By the way, bad of me."
"Well, that's not the kind of Kodak moment I was thinking."
(laughs)
He was just little when he gave it to me.
He used to love boats almost as much as you do.
"He said it was the two of us, and that we were on this boat, sailing away, happy."
He wanted to take you away.
Who's playing doctor now?
(phone ringing)
"Yeah, McGee."
"Boss, I finally got the IP for the computer used to hack into AUTEC."
Belongs to a government consultant named Amanda Baylor.
So that's our computer genius?
An encryption specialist.
"Secondly, she prefers the term"
"""Adult Film Thespian."""
"And thirdly, I had a very good conversation with her, and hopefully, she's gonna stop doing..."
"Hundreds of men, women and objects?"
She doesn't do objects.
"She has a standard contract, and she doesn't do objects."
"She doesn't do animals, and she doesn't do water sports."
Although I don't really know what that is.
I think that's...
doing it on a jet ski?
"Oh, boy."
Yep.
Why would anyone want to do that on a jet ski?
"Okay, so what?"
- Were you able to talk her out of it?
- I think so.
Although she did most of the talking.
"If it wasn't for you, I never would have gotten to where I am today."
Thank you.
"You made me fall in love with math, Aaron."
"And with those skills, I've learned to invest my money, run my own website, and create a healthy and diversified portfolio."
That's cool.
That is really cool.
"You know, I think that I'm just curious if-if maybe you're interested in expanding."
"Oh, I totally do!"
I'm gonna start my own reality show where I take other porn stars out to dinner.
It's called Stuffing Liza Blue's Face.
Wow.
Great title.
God.
"You know, I love how encouraging you are."
That's why I've always had such a big crush on you.
I'm certainly not turning them over to you
To be stolen the next time you feel sleepy.
"Agent carter,"
How did you come to discover the stolen items?
"Leet brannis, uh, told me where they were."
And how did you come into contact with mr.
Brannis?
I have been conducting my own private investigation
Have you been in contact with him since his disappearance?
"Are you collaborating with stark,"
A known traitor and fugitive from justice?
Publicly revealing these items won't clear mr.
Stark's name.
They'll only place you under suspicion along with him.
Do you see the day I've had?
"I will call them in, and they will respect me."
But they won't.
They'll only use it to tear you down.
If you wish to clear mr.
"Stark's name,"
You must do so from the shadows.
There's a phone box across the street.
"But for god's sake, don't let krzeminski get hold of it."
Sousa's working the office tonight.
I can just about stomach him getting the credit.
"Oh, and, uh, mr."
"Jarvis, they know your voice now."
Sousa.
"Hey, mack, I, uh,"
Got a hot tip for ya.
"Yeah, howard stark's stolen inventions."
They're... they're...
Dalton.
"Hi, it's Megan."
"Oh, hi, how are ya?"
How's it going?
"Oh, it's goin' fine."
"Our lab boys picked up a bloody footprint in the, uh, meat packing plant."
"They, uh, matched it with a size 10 hunting boot, manufactured by a firm in Maine."
He only sells mail order.
"Well, you think he's from Maine?"
"Well, our computer checked their records with all sale of that size with army records, and we finally have us some suspects."
Why do you think he was in the army?
"Well, uh, one of the ghoul's girlfriends picked out the m-16 machine gun as a weapon the ex..."
"Uh, the exterminator used when he broke up their party."
About the only way you can get one is stealing it from the army.
You think you're gonna catch him?
"Oh, we'll-we'll catch him, all right."
But it's gonna take some doing.
"The computer gave us 2,000 suspects."
Now it's gonna take a lot of knocking on a lot of doors.
What are you doing right now?
"Uh, well, I'm a just going over some lab reports and just lookin' for clues."
Do you want to take a break?
Yeah.
"Well, there's a good jazz concert at battery park."
"All right, I, uh..."
I can be there in about thirty minutes.
Good.
"Okay, see you there."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Stan guest."
[Applause]
[Music playing]
Megan?
"You have motive, the insurance money."
Or not giving Gus his cut.
Gus and I have been friends since college.
He did me a favor by showing here.
I would never betray him.
"Okay, um, let's say I believe you."
Who else has the password?
"Besides myself, my assistant and Gus."
Why would Gus have it?
"He's been working around the clock, putting finishing touches on his pieces for the exhibit."
He was taking photos as late as last week.
Are you looking for suspects?
I'll give you suspects.
"What about the guy who wrecked my work three years ago, huh?"
Or what about those jerks that stole my painting from the museum last month?
Why aren't you guys out there looking for them?
"Because you're lying about something, Mr. Walker."
I don't e.
"I don't lie in my life and not in my work, got it?"
Someone besides me wanted my art off these walls.
Go find them!
(Colin) Are you okay?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
He didn't hurt us.
It's just that I don't think it was random.
What do you mean?
"Well, the mugger went for my bag first."
He only seemed to take Sondra's purse as an afterthought.
You know that thing Angela got from the cleaners?
I think the mugger thought I had it in my bag.
"You know, luckily, I didn't."
There's part of it I just--I can't--
"So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch."
"- Excuse me, the DEA?"
- Yeah.
That's the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The feds.
I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers.
I understand that.
What does that have to do with the DEA?
They're after some mystery man some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg.
They want this guy like the axe wants the turkey.
Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest.
"Jesus, cheer up."
This is good news.
"I mean, Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne."
"Wait, wait."
"Look, I just..."
I think...
I just think that we should review our options.
Options?
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.
You got a grand total of two.
Option A:
Brandon takes the deal.
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary and gets his rectum resized about yay big.
"Look, look."
What about reprisals?
"I mean, if Badger..."
If Brandon informs on this Heisenberg...
"I mean, what if, God forbid that they decide to take revenge?"
What have you been telling him?
"The kid keeps spouting off about, ""If I talk, they'll kill me."""
And you won't get thirsty either.
"Oh, good."
That way I can slosh my way through my twilight years.
[Gurgling]
Bob?
I hope I went peacefully
"Sorry, Emily."
I didn't know you were awake.
Bob?
What are you doing?
"Oh, I... couldn't go to sleep, sol thought I'd weigh myself."
"- Well, how much did you lose?"
- I'm afraid I'm like the stock market.
I'm up an eighth.
"Emily, this diet isn't working."
"Well, Bob, you've gotta give it a chance."
You've only been on it five hours.
"Emily, I gai-I gained an eighth of a pound in five hours."
"Well, that's all the water you've been drinking."
I can't understand it.
"I never had a problem with weight... and then all of a sudden, I weigh 10 pounds more than I did on our wedding night."
You weighed yourself on our wedding night?
I had nothing else to do.
You were in the bathroom for 45 minutes.
How could she fly off the bed like that?
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength accelerated motor performance.
For example say a 90-pound woman sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck runs out and lifts the wheels a half a foot up off the ground.
You've heard the story.
Same thing here.
"Same principle, I mean."
So what's wrong with her?
We still think that the temporal lobe--
I already did.
How about i call you big cutie?
"Like, big cutie, have some more treats."
- Thank you.
"- Hey, tom."
Sheila brought us rice crispy treats.
The guys are giving me a little fire fighter tutorial.
Damian wants to drive the rig when he gets on the job.
"Why don't you graduate first before you start picking out a goddamn locker, ok, punk."
"Come on, tommy, he's gonna graduate."
"Yeah, his instructor says that he's already top of the class so far."
"What are you, 3 weeks in?"
Stretching hose and doing physical training.
Got some guy that used to look up to your old man helping you put on your bunker gear every day.
"Wait till they stick your narrow ass in the smokehouse, ok, or you're roasting at 1,500 degrees in the goddamn flashover stimulator."
Then we'll see how big your balls are.
"Hey, asshole."
"I'm sorry, big cutie."
"Listen, why don't you back off my son."
"Because this ain't goddamn summer camp, ok, sweetie."
"And if I'm not mistaken, chief, isn't there a rule against social calls in the firehouse?"
"Don't be a stickler, tommy."
"Here, have a treat."
No thanks.
"Ok, duty calls."
"- Hey, can I ride along?"
- No.
"Oh, come on, chief, let the kid ride."
It'll be good for him.
- Only if his mother says it's ok.
"- Uh, it's ok."
"You stay clear of the action, ok?"
"What are you looking at, say thank you, and give the payment."
"Son, tell me one thing."
Is there any good corner in this hotel?
Why?
Because you payment is very big.
"If i will give it here, everyone will see it."
"Yeah, there is a corner, let me show you, come... why are you beating me Bhai?"
"Hit him... if you don't want to give the payment, forget it, but why you are beating me i am cheep, and i will wear this?"
Tell me where is the diamond?
Here's your diamond.
The diamond which was snitch from me and took my honor.
Honor can be destroy by snitching this too.
Diamond which shines...
Bhai see this how shiny is this.
The diamond which was stolen by Yadave.
Now who is Yadav Bhai?
"Yadav, that's Yadav."
I have come to shoot him Bhai.
Now what is he?
"He stole you diamond, Diamond was stolen by Yadev."
Then you did you send his photo.
"Not his, i have send you his photo in the envelope."
Then why this photo came out.
"You are lying... you are lying, you have send this photo."
"And that diamond photo too, and after this you are beating me too."
You didn't got his photo?
"No, otherwise i would never spear him."
I even beaten him too.
"When, where?"
He was running from the street.
So where he is right now?
"But the one who he was following, is in the same hotel."
"That's enough, dastard!"
Get out.
Get out
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
Get out!
"Take it, son!"
Come on.
"- Whatever I had, was 3 boats sunken - to the bottom of the sea."
"Hereafler they are not allowing wound, brickbat, it's incurable."
"Hanieh, Bashirou,"
You!
So you have loaded all of your things.
"My burden sank to the bottom of the sea, Zaer_"
These things I brought are imposing on you.
"- Then, what are you going to do?"
- The truth is that I came here to how can I tell you?
I came here to be the seaman of your boat.
"No, it's not possible."
What are you talking about?
As I do remember all your family members were chief or captain.
I am beholden to you and your father so much.
"Captain Zaer,"
- how many times I told you these Tangaki people
"- They are innocent, Zaer_"
I am wondering what a compassionate man you are.
"It's outside and inside of the house as you see, captain."
"If Bashirou's mommy can clean it up, it will become a wonderful place, you can even arrange a wedding party here!"
"Let me kiss your hand, Zaer_ Oh, captain, what are you doing?"
What are you saying?
"If anything is lacking ask the estate agent for it,"
I trusted you with mary's life.
"Not just her survival,"
"Though I hear you threatened that, too."
"I gave up every moment of being a mother to my own child,"
Based on your word
That you would raise her to be francis's wife.
"What did you think, when you traded a child"
For the protection of France?
That we would put her welfare above ours?
Lord knows you didn't.
You gave her away to secure your rule.
"I had an infant,"
"A girl, not even a week old when my husband died,"
And she was crowned queen.
I met unexpected horrors and tragedy
And I faced them with courage.
You...
One charlatan scared you by whispering in your ear
About your son's death...
A future no one could know...
And you changed the course of nations.
Nostradamus's accuracy is an inarguable feat.
Here's a feat:
"Women like you and me, surviving in this age."
"I have sold my soul, and my child,"
To protect myself and my nation.
Mary may be scotland's queen
But I am its king.
Has scotland noticed that its king
Has rather overexposed breasts?
It is beginning to.
Ah.
All right.
Will it be fine if I just give it to you?
Then we have a deal.
A contract?
Didn't you say that you will definitely pay me back?
No need to look to know that you still want to be a driver.
Why don't you just be my driver?
I'm not that familiar with South Korea.
You can also help me run errands.
I'll pay you 25 000 Won to be my driver and also to run errands.
Two hundred times should be enough for a total of five million Won.
Two hundred times?
You don't want to?
Then don't repay me.
Why so urgent?
Where do I need to sign?
It won't be easy.
"Even if it's going to be tiring, I will not give up."
Over there.
- President?
- Now?
"This is the graduate from MIT, Dr. Lee Yun Seong."
Information and Communication sector's dark horse.
(Dark horse - is a term used to describe a little-known person.)
I heard that you also got an invitation from United States.
Why did you choose to come to South Korea instead?
Money?
My father has earned a lot.
He will definitely let me inherit it.
So I don't feel the need to serve the United States.
"So, you are a patriot."
"Mr. President, being under your service is a big honor, and it can't be compared to any other thing."
Come on go
Have you started the classes?
Is she learning our language?
We are studying my Paşa.
But she's not that keen
You'll learn our language quickly
How much did you pay for me?
We have got lots of golds.
I'll give you as much as you want
Just let me go
I understand your anger.
But think twice before talking
Because
You are neither talking to a merchant nor a pirate
Were you ever captured?
I'm grieving
I'm miserable
I don't know what to do or what to think
Nobody treats me bad here
But I treat everyone badly
Anything I want is done.
"Dish, drinks"
But that doesn't change the fact that I'm a prisoner
I request you to release me
I realised it is not happening.
But at least let me walk in the yard
"I want to breathe, walk and ride a horse"
Don't tell me you couldn't manage it
Did you find it?
I told you I would bring it
Did anyone see you?
I took it when everyone was in the yard
Let's go back to the hospital.
"Since things went wrong at the hospital, this is a medical mistake."
"If we go to the hospital and talk to them, they'll switch you back."
What are you going to say?
Ah...
"This man is my fiance, but his body got switched with that guy."
So take responsibility and switch them back.
That's what you're going to say?
Fine.
"I'm sure I'll be told that I'm crazy, but they'll find a way to fix it."
That's right.
"We're going to be told we're crazy, and all 3 of us will get locked up."
"You, me and my body that's in the hospital are going to keep staying at the hospital."
"If you're going to go, go by yourself."
I don't like hospitals.
"Just because you don't like it, you think avoiding it is the best?"
-Don't act like a kid!
-I'm still a kid!
-I'm 18 years old!
-That's right.
And a kid needs to listen to the adult.
"-Let's go, Kang Gyung Joon."
-Don't treat me like a kid.
This face isn't a kid's face.
Are you trying to joke with me right now?
And you shouldn't act like a frustrating adult and try to push me!
Why can't you think to calmly listen about what happened from the one affected?
Fine.
Talk.
I...
And Seo Yoon Jae were in an accident.
"The moment that we were to die, our souls escaped the body."
- and I'll never forget...
"- Excuse me, miss?"
Miss?
"- Yes, sir?"
- What's this?
"Three Plantation Dogs, an Uncle Tom Turkey Platter,"
"White Meat Supreme, Two Clucks Clams..."
"Okay, you charged us for eight drinks."
There's only five of us.
- Refills are free.
"- Oh, yes, they used to be, but we changed our policy a few years back."
"Well, I wasn't notified."
You should've put that in writing.
"Oh, we did, sir."
"It's on the wall, on the table, and from what I've been told, it's facing you when you use the urinal."
"Well, I didn't come here to read, I came here to eat!"
"Now, take these off of my check, you bunch of chiselers!"
"Oh, oh, oh."
I understand.
"If you're having a difficult time right now, we have an ""indigent can."""
It's near the register.
- I'm no charity case.
"- Oh, of course not, you're a human being."
"But between you and me, we throw the extra food in the trash every night, so if you get here before midnight, you won't have to fight the other vagrants for it."
"Daddy, do we have to eat garbage?"
"Nobody's eating garbage, princess!"
"Now, let me tell you something, lady..."
How dare you insinuate my husband can't pay!
"- Sue, butt out."
- He can pay for this!
- I can?
- Open your wallet.
How many kills you have made?
You really didn't know that i am Bhai (brother)
How would i know?
Then why you were waiting for me in the restaurant?
That's my restaurant.
I have been inform that you are coming there so i bought my beg there.
So Bhai(brother) call you and send me to kill you.
What?
Your boss is bhai (brother)?
Yeah... you know it was my first murder.
"For this bounty, mother have paid lot of bounty in Mandir."
She went to Sidhivinayak every Tuesday by walking.
"For ""my son get one change to murder."""
"After that much ganpati, i got one chance."
"I though by one murder, i could steel my life."
"Then i will marry to daughter of Chora Khujli, and make my life."
But... because of me every thing gone wrong.
Kill me.
Laxmi kill me.
"What are you saying, you don't have to worry."
"I am here, from today i will stand before you if any bullet comes to you what?"
You will fight with you boss for me?
Now i will show Bhai(brother) what is Bhaigiri(gangster)
Leaving... your just call wife's ring.
"Not nessescery... i will come back soon, i will wait."
Bhai (brother) you are here?
Open grave and hidden new can be seen from far away.
Work has done?
You were right bhai (brother)
My loose motion has stopped Bhai.
"Here is you stuff, your diamonds."
"See, have you seen Chota Khujli."
What do you mean?
You have to pay the remaining six thousand dollars before you can have your license
Six thousand more?
Of course
"Give me back the money, I'm not buying it"
"Well, then all that will cover the administrative costs lf everyone came in like you and messed about, how can we run a business here?"
Country bum
How come you puke just after a short car ride?
Are you alright?
Luckily I haven't bought it
"Otherwise, you can't enjoy it"
Come down
"Hey, you..."
Damn
What happened?
What are you doing?
Stand still
You want your money back?
Here I'm sure to have my money back
And along with some administrative fee
Thank you
Hey
Don't you know me?
I am Choi Ha ls it really you?
Yes I couldn't have recognized you if you hadn't call me
Let me look at you
Well?
You are pretty
Just put on more make-up to make yourself pretty
Money is for spending l heard that you've got married
Are you going to be a mother soon?
Really?
"Yeah, I have your number all right, Crystal."
You call me when you're ready to discuss this.
I'm in town.
"Well, they tried, Will."
"Amy and Ty, they did their best."
You know what?
I think I'm just getting too old... for all this.
I'm sick and tired of fighting.
"Actually, no."
"Actually, what I'm sick and tired of is losing."
"Losing fights, losing them horses..."
There's not much left to lose anymore.
"- Nah, that's not true."
- Oh no?
"Well, what would you know about it?"
"Look, Sam doesn't come up here to see me no more."
Now Joanna's met this guy and she's taking off with him.
Lost my best friend this last winter.
"On top of everything else, my health is totally giving out."
Now it's my lungs and don't be telling Joanna.
"Look, you don't wanna lose anything else, then move!"
Go with her.
It seems pretty simple from where I'm standing.
"Oh, it seems pretty simple to Mr. High-and-mighty, does it?"
You're telling me to do something you'd never do yourself.
Am I right?
"Your wife travels, she moves around, but you're ""independent."" You don't gotta go nowhere."
It's a fancy way of saying that you're gonna stay put.
"People wanna see you, they gotta come where you're at."
You're not gonna move anywhere.
"So don't be giving me advice that you wouldn't take yourself, thank you."
"- Come on, will..."
Tell me...
"- Do you understand british divorce courts, Mr. Collins?"
- Sorry.
"UK law, elementary requirements."
Not at all.
My situation is such that discretion in this case with this single young woman is both financially and publically essential.
"So you, you do know about Zack Starr?"
I'm afraid so.
Yes.
"Only what Krista told me over the pillow, so to speak."
How did you two meet?
Social function.
"I was at a gallery opening, she walked in, and, I noticed."
It happened like that.
Did it?
So can you tell me where she is now?
No.
I haven't seen her in a few days.
"And to be quite honest, she finds me,"
"I don't have a number or an address,"
- just a willingness to see whenever she gets...
- ...bitch.
I tell you what.
"If you meet me at this park,"
"I've got a meeting downtown, I'll... have some of my people dig her up for you."
"I'm sorry, poor choice of words, but I'm sure once I get them onto it."
I'll be able to tell you exactly where she's been found.
"Now if there's nothing else, I think we're done here."
"There is one more thing, Mr. Van Sciver."
Do you know what this symbol is?
Should I?
That wasn't my question.
I'm proud to say that we've grown yet again.
We have three new guests.
"For the new ones, first off a few words..."
"This is a hotel, but at the same time we offer a lot of space... a lot of free space."
Kind of a community...
Sort of an organism.
A place where everyone can come and contribute with their life experience  above all this is a place that doesn't obey the rules of the market nor that of greed.
Our first guest is Emilia.
Well I'm a photographer  and I like to sing.
Then tell us what you like to sing.
German songs  chansons  opera  everything.
I also like to sing Schubert.
What else should I say about myself?
I have a tumor the size of an egg.
Right in here  and sometimes it gives me a headache.
"Yes well, I like to sing."
We know each other from before.
Emilia was in the hospital a long time as well.
Too long.
And... she's a good writer!
Thank you.
"Yes, I'm Josephine Reiter and I want to make something about Franz  and your community."
That's why there's a camera.
- A film!
About you Franz!
- For television.
Let her continue!
I thought it would be helpful if something about you was shown.
Does anyone need help here?
I don't need any help.
I don't either.
I don't need anyone.
David.
What's wrong?
Alan Milliken is dead.
What?
How?
Why don't you tell me?
What do you mean?
"I told you, I didn't go there."
I know what you told me.
"You sat in your car, you made some phone calls, and you came straight here."
"Yes, and that's the truth."
Then you won't mind the police checking your cell phone and the car you used tonight.
"You know... you asked me to take care of a problem, and I did."
"If you want the police to check phone logs, then have them check yours first."
Because remember?
You called me tonight.
"I am here because of you, David."
"What happened, Sherry?"
I went over to the house just to speak to Julia.
Alan interrupted us.
There was an argument and... he had a heart attack.
There's going to be an investigation.
You're going to have to tell the truth about this.
The truth isn't going to save either one of us.
"All they're going to hear is that I was there on your behalf to prevent Alan from meddling with your presidency, and that he died from natural causes."
"Now, how do you think that's going to play out in the New York Times for the next six months?"
What did you do to Alan?
"Honestly, David,"
nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
"Kim,"
I transferred that feed to your system.
"Alright, put in an aircomms request with all the main providers."
I want a name and address as soon as possible.
"If you want my opinion, from the blood on the back of the door the attack looks like it started when she came out of the bathroom."
"Ally, you be the victim."
- Why me?
- Because you're...
"Alright, you be the victim."
"Go on, get in touch with your female side."
She should probably have a leak in the bathroom.
You don't have to do that part.
When she comes out... she gets a blow to the back of her head.
Now it's bad but doesn't kill her.
She goes on the bed.
Now she's probably out cold when the attacker comes at her again.
Are you enjoying this?
"Now, the attacker is covered in blood."
"The traces we found in the bathroom,"
I reckon he took time to wash before making his or her - equally - exit.
Where are you going?
I've just bludgeoned you to death.
Mark!
Happy birthday!
"I was just out for a run, so I, erm, I thought I'd surprise you."
- Right.
"- Life lesson there, isn't here?"
Should never turn up unannounced.
I saw him leave.
So what was Kenton doing here?
Did he stay the night?
"Laura, can you talk to me please?"
Is there any point in lying?
Why would you do that?
He wears a wire.
I think it's really unprofessional of you to come to a counseling session high.
Don't go.
Please.
I can't trust you anymore.
I guess I'd say that.
Is this your mom's?
The best thing to do when your mom's a drug dealer is to just pretend it's not happening.
"The first time I did this, I was 16, with my mother."
"Your mother didn't die of cancer, did she?"
I really thought I knew you.
"Sid Thomas-Haye, gunshot wound to the upper thigh."
Did you have anything to do with that guy's disappearance?
Yes.
I'll take him from here.
"Come on, Grady."
It's too late.
"- Oh, God."
- Ugh!
Poor Sid.
"We are going to get caught, and I cannot get caught."
"Remember yesterday, when I told you to leave me and my family alone?"
I meant it.
I want answers about my son.
"What he needed was someone to say, ""Keep fighting."""
"Instead, he found someone that said, ""You can give up."""
"Well, look who it is, the Angel of Death."
I want a new partner.
Do you think our past dictates our future?
"Everything that's happened in our lives has brought us to this moment here, you asking me to help you kill people."
"That would be the past dictating the present, and no, I think we have more control than that."
How much do people pay?
"Ah, kid was breaking our hearts, telling us about his girlfriend dumping him."
"You know, saying how much he had to win in order to buy her an engagement ring."
"We kept saying that he should just forget about her, but, no, he just kept playing."
Until you stole all his money.
I thought about giving some of it back.
Yeah.
That's right.
"But then, that kid-- he just went nuts."
"Flipped the table over, and he just ran out."
- Where?
- How should I know?
"Hate to break Rule 22, boss, but his lawyer's here."
Then I'm done talking.
Oops.
Got the same story from the blackjack dealer.
"If what he says is even half true,"
Petty Officer Adams could have left that game and picked a fight with the first person that he saw.
Could be anyone.
Thoughts?
"Well, with no security cameras at the pizzeria,"
Ziva and McGee are checking neighboring stores.
"Ye, I know that."
"I asked you your thoughts, DiNozzo."
My thoughts?
"I thought you didn't like my process, my yabba yabba."
Doesn't mean I don't depend on it.
Oh.
"Well, in that case, the pizza guys are slimeballs."
Thin crust beats deep dish every time.
"And every suspect in this case has an answer for everything, but one of them's got to be lying."
- Yeah?
Which one?
"Trust me, give all yours to him, you'll be safe."
"I don't know about others but I feel like seeing the thief once, only then I can be happy."
"You'll definitely see him sir, you've seen me, haven't you sir?"
You've seen him!
"From now onwards, I'll give the kick of life for all of you."
"Previously on ""Being Erica""..."
Is it true that you're taking Friedken's book from Julianne?
"Julianne's ship is taking on water, fast."
She gave me my shot.
"She's a friend, and I'm not just gonna abandon her."
"I'm disappointed in you, Erica."
The feeling's mutual.
That girl is my daughter.
I don't feel like you want me to have a life.
"We had a fight this day, and it was one of many, but this day I said some things that I later regretted."
You're hurting me!
And this was the last time that I saw my daughter.
"I mean, I didn't know if she was dead or alive... and I still don't."
So... you sing really well.
"You're like a barista by day, a rock star by night."
"I do have feelings for you, Kai."
"I wish that I didn't, but I do."
"Relationships-- they're like pillars in our lives, providing support, defining the space in which we live."
Good morning.
"Hey, you."
Is everything ok?
Yeah.
Everything's fine.
Why?
"You know, you're the worst liar on the planet."
Uhh...
The promise of the Chinese ambassador post is pulling you away like you no longer work here.
The DCI has put me on the trilateral commission looking into Jai's death.
People think I murdered my own son?
Hey.
"For a week trip, you pack kind of light."
Please tell me you're not wearing this.
I'm going on a business trip to the Caribbean.
"Unless you're applying for a job at Sandals,"
I would lose this shirt.
What kind of business do you have in the Caribbean?
"Oh, I have my finger in a number of..."
Pies.
Pies.
"Yeah, I know."
"What kind of pies, specifically?"
"Apple, rhubarb... cherry, when I'm in the mood."
This is always the worst part.
The fashion tips?
The end.
"We're always saying good-bye, and we never know when we're gonna see each other again."
Come with me... on my trip-- a week together in paradise.
You have to work.
I don't want to interfere.
"Well, I've never had a problem mixing business and pleasure."
Have you?
I do have some vacation time saved up and... a bikini I've been dying to wear.
Or not wear.
"Where are you going-- Bahamas, Caymans?"
Cuba.
Still interested?
When do we leave?
Hey.
Bring her in.
- You know what?
It's so nice out.
Why don't we just all go for a walk?
"It's pouring rain, Ted."
I think it's pretty obvious she can't fit through the door.
"She is a gorgeous, athletic woman."
"""Athletic."" Sideburns, no cans."
- She is hot.
"- So why can't she come in, Ted?"
She can come in... in six and a half months.
Wait.
Are you saying she's...
- Twenty and a half.
- Almost.
"Hold up, guys."
She had to bounce.
Um...
Flash mob broke out in front of a line... of Korean-Mexican food trucks in Williamsburg.
The only thing that would make her more of a 20-year-old is an ironic form of transportation.
She's roller-skating there.
"Yeah, I don't know which is more pathetic..."
That you're going out with a 20-year-old... or that you bought a leather cuff to get a date with her.
I didn't buy this to get a date.
"I just happened to be out, catching up..."
- on some Saturday afternoon leather cuff shopping...
- Oh.
And she just happened to be a leather cuff saleswoman.
"God, I am so glad I am done chasing bimbos."
"Now that I'm engaged, that whole part of my life just seems sad and empty."
"I don't want this to sound too harsh, Ted, but you disgust me."
"Uh, until a month ago, your headboard had a lube dispenser."
Please come in.
Miss Dashwood.
"Miss Marianne, it is both an honour and the greatest of pleasures to see you."
- I shall leave you for a little while.
- I am sure the Colonel would have you stay.
"Excuse me, I have much to do downstairs."
"Do please sit down, Colonel."
Thank you.
"Dear Colonel Brandon, I must convey my sincere gratitude for all that you..."
"Oh, let us leave that as said."
Excuse me.
I interrupted rudely.
I am embarrassed at being thanked for what was a privilege.
I only caught a glimpse of you the other night.
You're looking so much better.
You must be looking forward to going home to Barton.
"Yes, it seems a lifetime ago that we left for London."
Take things very quietly when you get back.
- Promise me.
"- I am grateful for your concern, Colonel."
Be assured I intend to do little but sit in the garden and read.
"Ah, Gothic novels, with their ghosts and ruined castles."
- Why not?
- I play the schoolmaster.
You read Cowper and Scott.
"You have heard of them, have you?"
I have studied them a little.
I think them truly wonderful.
"Oh, indeed they are great poets."
But have you not read the majestic Milton or the demigod Shakespeare?
"""Fear no more the heat of the sun"
"""Nor the furious winter's rages"
Show him your cardigan.
"Do something."""
"I've got to say something to Jay-Z, so I said this, ladies and gentlemen"
"I said this to the world's biggest rapper. ""Jay-Z!"""
LAUGHTER
I went for a high five with the world's biggest rapper.
"I'm thinking ""You look a right knob now!"
"""You look an absolute penis here!"
"He's not going to give you a high five."""
But he did.
"He gave me the high five Bang, yeah, pretty good!"
APPLAUSE Come here.
Come here.
"Come here, look."
Whoa!
"Feel pretty good now, don't you?"
"It's in a sort of six degrees of separation way, right?"
You have just touched the hand that's touched the hand that has touched Beyonce's knockers.
"Yeah, pretty good, eh?"
Have another go.
"Go on, go on."
"Get lost, she's not a slag."
She's not a slag.
"If you liked it, you should've put a ring on it."
It's your own fault.
"I've been in pantomime, but the one thing I did learn, and I'm going to teach you tonight, is the three secret moves."
There's three secret dance moves.
They're brilliant.
You'll go to any panto this Christmas or any am-dram show and you'll see these three moves.
Here's the first move you require if you want to be in any amateur dramatics dance show - the side sway
LAUGHTER
The second one is a bit more difficult.
"Low doses of methaqualone-- downers, ludes, disco biscuits."
Very retro but making a comeback.
It was just enough to impair
Petty Officer Adams' motor skills.
"I mean, these babies can increase your sex drive, but it also can cause drowsiness and slurred speech, low heart rate, vomiting..."
"Ah, well, so much for the sex part."
So the question is: who slipped it to him and where?
"Well, test everyone who was on liberty that night."
Can I borrow McGee to help?
Absolutely.
"And I swear, your grandma got these crazy eyes and took off after your mom like a cat chasing a mouse."
"Ooh, I can still see them eyes."
"Would Grandma have chased us, Mom?"
"Yeah, she sure would have."
"Nah, she'd be spoiling you guys every chance she got."
"Right, Jack?"
"Yes, Michael, she would have."
"Hey, thanks for letting me stay."
"Well, the kids miss seeing you."
I miss them.
"Just gonna let the old man sleep through the party, huh?"
"Uncle Mike's got great stories, Dad."
"- You finish your paper, son?"
- Yep.
"Nine whole pages, single-spaced."
- Nice.
- Uncle Mike fixed the dishwasher.
"Oh, just a loose valve."
No big deal.
"Well, I appreciate that, Mr. Fix-It, but let's go."
It's my day to drop the kids off at school.
Can Uncle Mike come?
This is where he hid his stash in 1954.
It's been waiting for him.
What are these guys thinking when they come back?
Were they all asleep?
Paint's still wet.
We just missed him.
Mines are the exact same size.
Why is he painting them?
"Sandstone paint, rubber tiles... oh, my God."
Playground turf.
They use it all over the city.
So the next target...
Could be any elementary school or park in San Francisco.
Whoever killed the security guard has got to be the same nut job planting land mines.
City gets a ransom note.
Some crazy Korean poem in it.
"Guys says give him $651,000 and change, and he'll tell us where the rest of the mines are."
- Pretty specific number.
- Yeah.
Wait.
"How is it that you caught up with this guy, but everybody else seems to be clueless?"
I got a secret weapon.
Who are you again?
Surprise me.
We found where Paxton Petty's been hiding his bombs.
And Petty?
He left a dead security man in his wake.
And we found playground turf and spray-paint.
"Now we don't know what the spray-paint means, but the turf..."
What color was the paint?
The turf means he's gonna hit up a school or a park.
We don't have enough information to narrow down the search 'cause there's too many of 'em.
"- Well, who's bringin' it?"
- Who knows?
- Where do you want it?
- Huh?
- Where do you want it?
"- Oh, shit."
This side.
Beat it!
I'm gonna check on this address.
"Ifthey don't know you, it's your ass."
- I thought I told you to stand there!
- Get that hair down before Saturday.
We're goin' now.
Goodbye!
Move ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
"Great, but you belong in Bedford-Stuyvesant, not Ridgewood."
Why don't you detach us?
"Give us a shot, at least till we find out ifthere's anything here."
Everybody wants Weinstock.
Maybe here's the lead we're looking for.
We deserve this.
You couldn't burn a three-time loser with this garbage.
The man has done absolutely nothin'.
You'll wind up in an entrapment rap.
"Brooklyn is loaded with guys that own candy stores, two cars and go to nightclubs."
You put this hustler together with Weinstock and maybe we got a big score.
"Big score, my ass!"
At best he's sellin' nickel-and-dime bags.
I wouldn't be infringing' on your coffee break if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.
"Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle, or have you forgotten about that already?"
"Jesus Christ, Jimmy, what's happened to you guys?"
I'm here to see Alvers.
Marcus.
Michael.
How was your trip?
Interesting.
"I still don't understand why you risked so much down in Mexico, why you didn't come here directly."
240 million dollars made it worth the risk.
What about Nina?
"If she wasn't killed by the bomb,"
I'm sure our buyers took care of her once they found out she didn't deliver the virus.
"Either way, she's out of the picture."
I hope so.
She can point to both of us.
We'll be long gone before anyone starts looking.
Kim.
"Look, I know we haven't talked since I got back."
"No, we haven't."
"I know what you must be thinking, but you need to give me a chance to explain."
I don't know what to think.
"Look, I'm happy that you're okay, but this thing... you have a baby, Chase."
"We've been together for more than three months, and you kept this secret from me."
Who's the mother?
Where does she fit into this?
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I didn't know I had a daughter until a month ago.
How could you not know?
Angela's mother and I went out last year.
"Okay, it's over."
"And when it ended, she never told me she was pregnant."
"Now she calls a month ago and tells me she has a baby, and that I'm the father."
"And she's in trouble, and she can't handle it."
I was afraid to let people find out.
"You didn't like the music, old polkas... lt was embarrassing that no one came for her."
"So I went with the girl... what's wrong with her, what is it about her?"
And what was I meant to do about it?
"I knew those boys, so I spoke to them."
"That was a disgrace, did she have to hear it?"
Tono had to shout out there:
Isn't your daughter dancing?
For ages I've been wondering whether to tell you.
I'm disgusted with life.
And you often don't seem to be a mother.
"- Heavens, how could you think that?"
- How could I think that?
"I can't see any love on your part, any feeling, it's all about money."
"You come home happy - l got that much there, I had a nice little job, I earned that much... I managed to get a bargain."
But you don't make anyone happy.
"Just money, money."
"Just money, money."
Because that's what I see.
How can you see it?
Who do you think I'm doing it for?
How can you say that to me?
I do it all for you.
You have no idea how it was for us.
I don't understand how you could say that to me.
Must it be money all the time?
"No dream, no ideal, how it could be."
You talk to me about ideals?
"Really, you see nothing but money."
D'you think I wasn't young?
Wasn't I eighteen once?
I was nineteen when I left school.
"I learned languages, I learned to play the piano, to have a good life."
"But if I get elected president, I will bring it back."
Bigger and better and stronger than ever before.

I have never been more excited about a presidential campaign.
I have never seen a grassroots uprising.
This is not the Republicans versus the Democrats.
That's right.
This is the elites of the Republican and Democratic Party who have driven this country into the ditch versus Donald J. Trump and the rest of America.
I thank you for your support.
If you have thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins...
And you're short 2 sen on a bill of Y130
How many of each denomination did you have?
What is it?
"Fujio's homework, from yesterday"
He's starting junior high this year
The preliminaries are so complicated
And if I can't do the work he's been set...
It kept me up till 2 a.m
Working on this?
Yes.
"Go on, solve it"
Thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins 2 sen short on a bill of Y130
Forget it.
It's our cross to bear
Wait.
If you call it X...
You can't do it like that!
No using algebra
A total of 32 coins...
And no using real coins!
Right!
I've got it!
"It just takes patience No, that's wrong too"
You don't have to get upset about it
They don't do this in junior

Couldn't the doctor find me a tutor?
Perhaps from among his students
I simply can't do it myself Please ask him
You worry too much
I don't really care who just so long as he's clean
All right?
"What if our guy knew her at church, work, or something... and he's obsessed with her?"
But she dies.
She donates her organs... and he goes after the people that have them.
"Now, postmortem wrist wounds... blood loss speeds the decay of the organs."
"The result is, they can't be passed on again."
I'm betting that this girl Davison... is the donor for all of our victims...
"Getz, Tattersall, and Emma."
Emma is not dead.
I heard back from Ned in Indiana.
The latest victim was a heart transplant.
"If you'll excuse me, gentlemen..."
Emma.
"Please, it's Dr. Pierce."
I've been trying to reach you all day.
"Emma, listen."
The donor I talked to you about... her family is threatening to sue.
Her mother had religious objections... to harvesting her daughter's organs... even though her daughter was a voluntary donor.
"I don't think they have a case, but..."
Are you listening to me?
Her lawyer just called.
She needs to see you.
She needs to see how her daughter's cornea... has changed your life.
"Because it has, Emma."
"Whether you like it or not, it has."
Where does she live?
Is this Leslie's?
"You're Russian, you go to a Russian church?"
Yes.
"Um, Davisovich is our ancestral name."
Where did Leslie work?
Illinois Masonic... on Wellington.
I quit because I couldn't take it anymore.
I couldn't work those hours anymore.
"But I felt he was always an honorable... thoroughly honorable guy, except for the way he treated the women in his life."
"And that was not honorable, but..."
Do you remember thinking about that?
"I mean, how the women took it?"
"I did, because I was married, had a wife, two children."
"And I knew what that was like, and I knew... that's when I... that's when I finally quit."
"For the last time, I came home and... my Estelle was crying, and she said, ""We never see you."""
"And I said, ""Oh, that's it."
I can't...
"Can't do it anymore."""
"But he just could juggle people's lives, and it didn't bother him."
I don't understand it.
I don't know how he could do it.
I don't know how he had the mental strength for it.
It would have...
I would have had a breakdown.
But he didn't.
He was such a tough guy.
"He really was tough as hell, you know, I mean..."
- Mentally.
- In what way?
"Well, how could he juggle three or four lives like that?"
Lou was very secretive.
He liked to keep his business to himself.
"And he'd call and say,"
"""You know where I am, but nobody else is to know where I am."""
"And I'd say, ""Okay,"""
because they would call looking for him.
- Who would call?
"- Esther would call Saturdays and Sundays, or Anne Tyng would call."
One minute.
"Give us a minute, Okay?"
Does it hurt?
They gave me some aspirin.
"Enjoy it, because it's the last fucking drug you'll ever take."
"-I'm sorry, T."
-Shut the fuck up and listen to me.
"You're my nephew, Christopher, and I love you."
That's the only reason you're alive right now.
"If it were anybody else, anybody... they would've had their intervention through the back of their head."
"You and me, we're close."
We've done a lot of things for each other.
That cop shot my father.
"I know what you're telling me, I'll never forget that."
This is how you repay me.
I gotta worry if you'll flip over a nickel bag of white powder.
"-No, Tony, never."
-You lied to me.
"I told you, you were the future of this family."
I gave you that responsibility.
"And you looked me in the eye, and you accepted it... and you were fucking high."
Shut up.
Tomorrow morning I gotta go with Patsy up to this rehab place in Pennsylvania.
You're going in.
You're staying in.
"You'll go to every session, and you'll keep your mouth shut."
"Now, if you need anything, anything at all..."
Patsy's going to be half a mile away from you... in a motel.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
-Do you understand?
"-Tony, I'm sorry!"
How did I fucking get to this?
Any reasonable person would be scared.
Not me.
Nope.
And they punished you for it.
Made you feel like a traitor for doing your job.
I just did what I was trained to do.
"I know, Mr. Petty."
The cold and the fear...
And the wave after wave of enemy soldiers coming across those frozen fields.
You never knew who the enemy might be.
Even women and children.
Children?
Tossing land mines everywhere?
Little soldiers.
And so you did what you had to do.
"You went to the village of Wonju, put the mines where they got their water, where they played in the fields."
Trying 55 volts at 2/10 of a second.
"That's right, Mr. Petty."
It's okay.
It's all going to be okay.
"You were in the 45th division in Korea, it's that right Mr. Madsen?"
"If you know, why are you asking?"
"You got your degree in medical doctoring, right?"
I did my residency in internal medicine.
Then you explain to me why a perfectly healthy man spends most of his time in infirmary and not on work detail.
I assumed you were ill.
"Well, you'd think I was after all the blood they're taking."
"I know all about the new lag, the one who likes to blow things up."
Is that his voice on the tape?
"If you want to know what the song is, then you find out why I am in here all the time."
Deal.
The song?
Medication?
You want to put my daughter on medication because she interrupted your stupid story about a jungle gym on your head?
!
That's it!
I'm taking it off!
Aah!
Ladies!
"Please, stop!"
"Everyone else, there's spinach and artichoke dip in a bread bowl."
There's something about strong women that just gets me going.
"Again, that's my mother and my grandmother."
You're a lucky man.
"Oh, my God."
I cupped your boob.
- Attacked and fondled?
- Didn't fondle.
Aye!
The dip is delicious.
"Hey, Greg."
How are you?
How's your holiday going?
"Normally, I go upstairs and smooth things over, but this time, I can't."
Your mother would assume I was there to bed her.
"Well, I'm not going up there."
She was completely out of line with Anna-Kat.
"I agree the timing was way off, but it really wasn't that terrible."
It's not like Dr. Ellie hasn't suggested medication for Anna-Kat before.
I am not willing to go down that road until we've exhausted all the other roads.
"I totally agree with you, but it's there for us if we feel like she needs it."
"Because the singing in your head, from what we've seen today..."
not effective.
My mom just wants to drug Anna-Kat so she doesn't have to deal with her.
"-Denise, I owe you big."
There's government agents in your room right now.
Somehow they knew we were there.
Any idea how?
-Yes.
"- Alright, We're gonna have to ditch this car and hitch a ride into Albuquerque,"
- What's in Albuquerque?
- A friend.
"Whatever it is you're not telling me, Jaelen, I need to know."
We're running out of time.
-I was compelled by her.
I began experiencing feelings I never had before.
As if I were meant to find her.
I felt myself avoiding better judgment that this was wrong.
A forbidden code of conduct in my task here.
"I allowed it to happen, I wanted it to happen."
Andromedans enforce a very structured mating ritual.
A choice for companion is never our own and never random.
We're conditioned this way from birth.
Therefore there is never the opportunity for...
-Falling in love?
-Yes.
- But did she know the truth about you?
-I didn't have the time.
"But I couldn't stay in one place for to long, so the day approached when I had to tell her."
I haven't been entirely honest with you.
-What do you mean?
-There are people looking for me.
- Who's looking for you?
Do you need any help?
-I'm not from here.
"I'm not from Los Angeles, and I'm not from the United States."

"And then when he told me, I pretended I already knew, and I hate that even more."
I don't know what to say.
I don't even know what I'd want you to say.
What do you say Michelle Ross and Harriett Specter go out for a drink this week?
"Thanks, Rachel."
I'd like that.
"You told him, didn't you?"
What are you talking about?
Told who what?
Don't bullshit me.
You told Alex
- I was working the prison case.
- I didn't tell Alex shit.
What I did was I told you to drop it.
And I did.
"I didn't spend one more second working on it, just like you ordered me to."
Then what the hell is your problem?
My problem is he just showed up to the courtroom and blew up the case.
"He embarrassed us, he embarrassed me, and he did it in front of everyone."
The courtroom?
I thought you said you weren't involved.
I was sitting in the back watching.
"There's no law against that, and that is not the point."
"No, the point is you went from A to Z and assumed that I told him."
How the hell else would he know?
It's none of your damn business how I knew.
"No, no, this is between me and Harvey."
"Wrong, this is between me and you because you broke your agreement with my client."
I don't care what I did.
You didn't have to do that publicly.
I didn't make that decision.
That is absurd.
All I could think was:
"""This isn't happening."
My sister loves me.
"And what the hell is Hello Kitty smiling at?"""
- Is that why you never came to see me?
- No.
- That place freaked me out.
- Of course it freaks you out.
- It freaks everybody out.
It's a loony bin.
"- Well, it scares me to see you like that."
"Allie, I need a sister that's gonna be there."
I need to know you're not just an illusion in my head.
I need to know your voice is really happening.
- I'm afraid.
- You need to stop being afraid of me.
"Lucy, I'm not afraid of you."
I'm afraid of becoming you.
"Bread pudding, everyone."

She said there was something very wrong with you and that they'd taken you from your dorm in restraints.
I'd seen you the week before.
We'd taken you out in Westwood for your birthday.
"You were 19, the same age I am now."
You know how you told Luke that I was always the prettier one and the smarter one and the star of the family?
"Well, you forgot that I have better boobs too."
"Um, you do not have better boobs."
"Uh, mmm..."
"All right, fine, the boobs are a toss-up."
Um...
But you're right about the other stuff.
Why did Curtis McNeal believe that you know who killed his wife and who kidnapped yours?
I -- even met the man.
It was a dying utterance.
The courts give those weight for a reason.
The man killed himself.
"Obviously, he was unstable."
"All right, your son lied, your daughter ran, and now you're stonewalling me-- if I don't get complete cooperation from your family-- now--"
Sara's going to end up as dead as Amanda McNeil.
Or maybe that doesn't bother you.
"If I knew anything that would help find Sara,"
I'd tell you.
"Plausible deniability might work in Washington, but it's not going to help you in a criminal investigation."
Mom.
I told you not to come.
You want me to leave?
No.
Come here.
Why are you staying here under a different name?
You didn't tell anyone.
No.
I want to know what's going on.
Why is the FBI looking for you?
"Max, Max, sit down."
The FBI probably wants to talk to me because I said some nasty things about your father.
"Well, then just talk to them."
Get it over with.
It's a little more complicated than that.
Sara's missing and Dad's a wreck.
"If you know something, tell me."
"You know, the worst thing about the divorce wasn't losing your father."
It was losing Marcy and you.
Mom...
-I don't know.
Prayed.
They grew out of his mattress.
"Come on, Steve."
Hey.
- What do we do for decorations?
-For that you got to pray yourself.
"""And so, Joey we do hope that you will finish that last year of law school when you come back home."""
Law school?
"Hey, you don't want to be no stinking lawyer with a stinking briefcase in a stinking office, do you, Joey?"
No.
"""And do keep writing, son."
Your letters are very dear to us.
"With all our love, Dad."""
"Hey, it's from your dad, Joey."
"Here, take it."
"Next time we write to your folks, you know what you're gonna say?"
You're gonna say that you don't wanna be no lawyer.
"That you wanna be a musician, maybe, huh?"
And play the ﬂute.
"Yeah, Joey?"
"""I saw a wonderful article on German prison camps in one of the magazines."""
Mom reads a lot.

"It's not good for you, Animal."
And so early.
"Oh, Mr Reznik, I only wish all my tenants are considerate as you."
I will give you a receipt in the morning
"Good night, Mr. Reznik."
"Mrs. Shrike, Forgive me, but..."
Have you noticed anyone hanging around my apartment?
Has there been a burglary?
"No, no, no, nothing like that."
I just wondered if...
"You know, if... you noticed anything unusual lately?"
Unusual?
"Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike."
I am sorry to disturb you so late.
Good night.
What we know is this:
One:
Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves.
Two:
Miller's arm was in the cutting zone of mill while it was off.
"Three: the mill suddenly activates, catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this."
What's the fucking point?
"These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik."
Our job is to investigate these events from every possible angle...
So that we might prevent their recurrence.
So we'd appreciate it if you would be a bit more co-operative.
I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake.
"What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik?"
I was distracted.
By what?
What distracted you?
"It was Ivan, I was watching Ivan on the pit."
"The whole thing is my fault, okay."
"The killing could be linked to an attempt by Albanian mafia to control the gunrunning business in London."""
Where are you from again?
Hampshire CID.
I'm part of the external review of Operation Merlin.
"We allowed Jacob Gould to stay in business, then we go after him."
"Now, what's that about?"
"Well, us allowing Gould some leeway for certain strategic reasons is information you might want to lose from your hard drive."
You're joking.
Knowledge is power in this game.
"Well, I must admit, talking to yourself and others, it seems your boss had something of an ego."
Putting Gould away became an obsession for him.
It did seem that way to me at the time.
Must have thought his name was Kevin Costner not Simmonds.
Have you seen that film?
What film?
The Untouchables.
Great film.
It's a great film.
You should watch it.
Sean Connery.
"They put one of ours in a hospital, we put one of theirs in a morgue."

One of the few men I can trust not to grab my arse.
So what's the deal with the Merlin undercover?
Risdale?
"Every single hair gone, one by one, from worrying-- worrying about getting you passes, worrying about protecting your rights."
"And now, for the first time in ten years, when he's got a chance to prove to his old buddies that he's a success, a master sergeant, he can't go to that reunion."
Why?
Because his own platoon is too cheap to raise a few meas...
"Corporal Henshaw, do not beg them."
Let them search their own soul.
"Just remember him with this head of hair, gone from worrying."
'Cause he's the kind of a sergeant that worries about his men day and night.
All we're asking is a measly few bucks.
"-Now, look, come on now."

This is an emergency.

"Well, this is a gay little sorority meeting."
Mother Bilko's little chickens got nothing to do?
"Hey, Sowici, hold it."
You may have some extra guys for KP any minute now.
"Now, listen, you meatheads..."
"Ernie, Ernie, I was just giving 'em tomorrow's work detail."
Work detail?
"Like your mother, there's nothing that you can't do either."
"Now, things are going to be easier now between you and Michael."
"You should have the kind of a marriage that you deserve, a good one."
"My beautiful daughter and her fine, upstanding young man."
"Things will be happy, Daddy."
Doctor?
That's interesting.
Why would Blake Carrington want you to see a doctor?
"For a very obvious reason, Joel."
I've been playing that I have a headache so I won't have to perform my wifely duties.
So he doesn't realise I'm not his darling Krystle.
"He's sick and tired of your headache, sleeping alone and feeling lonely."
Exactly.
"Rita, why don't you go to the doctor?"
All you have to do is pretend to take whatever pills he gives you.
It's like back problems.
You can't prove a headache.
"Well, suppose he wants me to take a blood test and mine doesn't match your aunt's, then what?"
Then nothing.
Her blood will match perfectly.
"I should know, I'm her doctor."
- You?
- Me.
This is perfect.
Don't you see?
Either one of you?
"What are you talking about, Joel?"
I've just cast myself.
I'm going to be playing Krystle Carrington's good doctor.
This is the chance I've been waiting for.
My chance to get into the house.
What better way than to be a specialist she's asked for on the advice of a friend.
"They tell me you've broken the code, Dr. Sengupta."
Yes.
The words in each verse of Paxton Petty's lullaby correspond to the locations of his bombs.
"""Snow"" for the union square snow festival,"
"""Beard"" for beard beach, and ""Grace..."""

There's a fourth verse.
Which means there's a fourth bomb.
"""Twin tree."" What's that?"
"I don't know, but I'm sure the good men of the San Francisco Police Department will."
I've already made a call on your behalf.
Excellent.

Doctor.
I've been meaning to have a word with you about one of your patients.
Tommy Madsen's medical records...
There's no history of illness recorded.
Illnesses come in many shapes and sizes.
You of all people should know that.
"Yes, but why would you have a perfectly healthy man spend so much time in the infirmary?"
And what do you want with his blood?
"A word of advice, my Don't overstep."
"Rebecca, there he is."
Walk me to him.
"Doc, stay here."
Call Tanner.
You got it.
"If New Christine and I get married, and you and Jeff get married, you'll be my mother-in-law."
"No, I won't."
The fourth grade class will now sing a song to those important people in our lives we call grandparents.
"Hey, Christine, what do you have when mother-in-law's up to her neck in concrete?"
Not enough concrete.
Funny.
"It was funny 20 minutes ago, and it's funny now."
"# You're a grand old man, # # you're a generous man #"

"Did you enjoy the singing, Mother Campbell?"
You still got it.
I got another one:
What do you have when your mother-in-law is up to her neck in quicksand?
I hate you?
Close.
Sand that's not quick enough.
"Oh, hey, I got one."
What did the mother-in-law do to thejackass?
What?
Ow!
"Don't pay attention to him, Christine."
What the hell is wrong with you now?
I'm just so happy.
"I love my dad so much, and I've always respected you."
"And now that you're together, it's just so great."
"You know, I never had a very close relationship with my mother."
We hardly ever talked.
"Mrs. Nelson, when was the last time you saw your husband?"
Yesterday at breakfast.
He was taking a business class at NYU on Thursday nights.
He wanted to open his own wrestling school.
So he never came home last night after class?
I fell asleep.
I called the police in the morning when he wasn't home.
But they said I had to wait 48 hours before he'd be officially missing.
Looks like yr husband was quite a successful coach.
"Mrs. Nelson, can you think of anyone who might have wanted to hurt your husband?"
No.
Vince was a great guy.
Everyone admired him.
Did he owe anybody money?
Or have a drug problem or a gambling habit?
"I'm sorry... but if you knew him, you'd know how ridiculous your questions are."
Okay.
Thank you so much.
"Please, give us a call us if you remember anything else."
There was one thing.
"I don't see how it could be related, but yesterday when I came home from work, someone was lurking on our roof."
I saw their shadows through the skylights there.
Looked like two people.
I heard them talking.
Creeping around.
It was kind of scary.
What time was this?
Around 4:00.
I knocked ony neighbor's door.
He said he would go up and check.
And?
"He said he saw something that looked like blood, but no people."
who are you?
Muthu's brother in law Muthu's brother in law?
Nothing will happen But we must be alert
"You said, you won't come to the temple"

Was this girl not named so long?
They name her only now
This is a tradition followed by us
"For newly married,before the family deity"
"She will be named again, same name only"
"After marriage, you will also be named like this"
Why did he come here?
Has he come to defame me?
"Ask him to go out He said, he will not come"
"But he has come, but how can we send him out?"
Will he not keep quiet?
If you put stone mortar in his mouth he will keep quiet
"But he will not keep quiet, when he sees Arul"
The investigation is ongoing.
Ussing's affairs are being checked.
I'm siding with Ussing.
I hope you understand.
"The public prosecutor was reluctant, but Ussing insisted strongly."
Step down of your own accord or we'll have to withdraw our support.
We're looking for someone who may have been close to Louise.
- She only had us.
- Did anyone else see her that day?
One of your colleagues called to ask about the same things an hour ago.
"Why would the perpetrator use your name, if he doesn't know you?"
- Was Special Branch involved in this?
- I wasn't involved in that case.
- Why don't you believe me?
- What are you talking about?
You shut everyone out.
"Me, us, your son."
No one's allowed into your life.
Her bike got broken that morning.
I think that's why she got a lift.
There was a man in a black car.
Those are all his notebooks.
He's crazy about car registrations.
- Where does that road lead?
- To a closed boat builder's yard.
That looks like Louise Hjelby's bike.
This is where she was taken.
Borch took the boy's book with license plate numbers this morning.
It was you and Special Branch who erased everything about the black car.
- I'm not discussing this.
- Why is that book important?
THE KILLING Ill
"Who is this ""someone"" to whom a citizen can ""go"""
that isn't so far up the cop's ass you need a digging crew to find them?
"There's only one person,"
And he's got the best investigators in the state.
The footage disappeared while you were looking at it?
Who has the access to do that?
Only the police.
And the shooting?
"Besides me, only the police knew where DeBray was headed."
"You're leveling quite an accusation, Laura."
That's not the worst part.
The jewelry from DeBray's apartment never made it to lockup.
It's gone.
"Well, DeBray is dead."
What does somebody gain from stealing that evidence?
I don't know.
"But whatever these people are trying to hide, the man who shot Haskell DeBray is out there."
"Tom, if you nail the dirty cop and get him to talk, you can catch the killer before he kills someone else."
"Then I'm gonna have to nail him, aren't I?"
"It goes without saying this stays in this room, right?"
- Yeah.
- Of course.
Good.
Good.
"Okay, Janet?"
"Serena, how about we take you home, little lady, and we have taco night at the ranch?"
- I make the guacamole.
- Deal.
"Captain Nico, you come, too."
"Sorry, Serena."
Captain Nico's got to catch a couple more bad guys before I can have a taco.
"Janet, can you have them bring up my car?"

- Hey.
- I know you.
Do you know where he is?
I don't.
"Do you, like, live here now?"
I still have the keys.
"No, now I live in a depressing faculty apartment."
How is the college?
It's fine.
I assumed he'd be here.
- Seems I was mistaken.
"- Yeah, that makes two of us."
"Hey, you can stay if you want to."
That won't be necessary.

"'In the weeks he had spent living with Ike, when Melanie was not around, 'she was never brought up in conversation."

"'Sitting meekly on the couch,"

"Okay, here's our Taurus coming out of the Biltmore service garage."
We pick him up 50 yards away on a surveillance cam at Commerce Bank.
Valera's headed west.
We catch him on a traffic cam at this intersection.
We catch him on the library's weather cam.
Got the results back on that fabric swatch.
Blood's AB-negative.
Sara's O-positive.
It's not her blood.
So whose blood did Marcy bring us?
Run it through CODIS for DNA.
"Okay, there's Valera's starting point."
Let's roll it.
"Okay, we lose him here for a minute as he passes out of the CBD, but keep watching."
Looks like he's headed toward the 20.
Which puts him west toward Alabama.
Roll it back.
The weather cam time code puts them at the on-ramp at 7:22.
Now roll it back.
But this traffic cam puts him at the tunnel at 7:18.
So why did it take him so long to get to the on-ramp?
Traffic doesn't seem to be an issue.
Go full frame.
Keep your eyes on this SUV.
Freeze it!
The Taurus is right behind the SUV entering the tunnel.
"There's the SUV exiting, but where's the Taurus?"
The Taurus must have pulled over inside the tunnel.
That's our transfer point.
"If there was a handoff, both vehicles would've interrupted traffic flow."
That compare who's going in... with who's coming out.
"Other than Valera's Taurus, no interruption."

"- I know what it is, Rachel."
"- Well, then we need to talk about how you're gonna handle it."
"No, we need to talk about how you're gonna handle it."
"Louis, that's not a good idea."
It's the only good idea.
You need to go over there right now and put an end to this.
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
"Because I had a run-in with Stephanie after you did, and then I had another run-in with her after Donna fired her."
She's not gonna listen to me.
"It is sexual harassment, Rachel."
I cannot have it on my record.
"Someone needs to convince her to let this go, and it needs to be a lawyer I can trust, but it also needs to be someone who's close to her level, or she's gonna feel attacked."
Then I think I have the perfect choice.
She must be really pretty?
Who does she look like?
She doesn't really look like anyone.
Hmm...
What kind of person is she?
- Hmmm.
Like a fairy?
- Fairy?
"Ah, no, well."
"Calling her a fairy is a bit of an exaggeration, but, like she's out of reach?"
"After meeting her, I thought nothing else would do for me."
Many things happened before reaching this point.
Hmm..
"But, you know."
"Confessing one week before Christmas, and instantly ""Ok""."
"That girl broke up with her boyfriend right before that, right?"
"Well, yes."
"Since she became alone just before the event, it feels like she just went along with it for the time being."
Are you fine with that?
"If you put it like that, I have my selfish calculations too."
I told her then because I knew about her situation.
I see.
I know about it all.
But it's okay.
"Anyway, because Saeko-san is my girlfriend now."
You've become really good at tempering.
You don't even need a thermometer.
- I can just tell by how the texture feels.
"Its heaviness changes according to its temperature, right?"
"Alright, right now its 28 degrees."
"Ever since I was a kid, I vaguely thought I would probably continue with the family cake shop, it wasn't something I took seriously."
I found how I wanted to shape my life after meeting Saeko-san.
Now that Samm...
"Now that my brother has gone, I must find something with which to occupy myself."

Dependents.
I've decided that to continue with the agency.
"I understand, Sammy discussed with you Baker's Dunkirk film?"
The role of an inebriated uncle.
No!
"You know, after conversations like this with my brother I would say, ""What have you got to lose by being honest Sammy?"""
"Explain to the man, he's 63."
Not 36.
"And that he's pre-flown to fame is ""Inspector Chamfold""."
Chamforth.
Inspector Chamforth.
Please be calm Mr.Hilliard.
I'm perfectly calm.
What you're seeing is controlled anger tempered with ice headed detachment.

"Now, does anyone wanna guess how old the White House is?"
- Yes.
- Two hundred and twenty-two years old.
That's very accurate.
Construction began in 1792 on what was then called the President's House.
"Now, Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution set forth that a district of no more than 1O miles square should house the new seat of government."
Does anyone know why?
So no one state could claim the President's House.
Right again.
"You're a real keener, aren't you?"
"Now, the founders were crafty..."

"Paula, you sure you're not imagining things?"
"Dad, I swear to you, I am not imagining anything."
And I think Judy's suffering from amnesia.
"Now, what can I do?"
"All right, Paula, I'll tell you what to do."
Take Judy back to the clinic and do a complete diagnostic work-up on her.
"Take her pulse, blood pressure, uh, respiration readings."
"Do an EKG, an EEG, and you can X-ray both arms and legs."
"And if she's still out of sorts you can give her a mild sedative, ok?"
"Marsh, is all that really necessary?"
"Oh, no, of course not."
I just want to keep her occupied.
"Uh, Paula, you sound as if you're having kind of a bad case of nerves."
"Dad, my nerves are perfectly calm."
"Now, there's something wrong with Judy."
She's a different chimp.
"Honey, she probably just wants some attention."
She's not faking.
She is sick.
She's very sick.
"All right, honey."
All right.
"Take Judy back to the clinic, and do as I told you."

"Mr. President, I took one look at your wife, and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste."
Her and me.
"I remember when your coat used to be there, too, Mr. Nash."
I always used to hang mine next to it.
[chuckles] [chuckling] I guess you can tell by now I'm romantic.
You always bought her such pretty things.
Maybe it's not nice of me to talk about the dead.
"You gave me quite a turn coming in like that, Mr. Nash."
"But you had your key, and why not?"
You pay the rent.
"I could smell you'd been drinking... but who could blame you, with all your troubles."
You weren't even sore at me for trying on the coat.

It really hurt me to see the look on your face.
It was nice of you not to want to be present... when she came in with that boyfriend of hers.
You knew you could trust me not to tell her you were in the bedroom.
"Of course, I don't believe that you had anything to do... with what happened later."
"But you see, it's the police I'm worried about, Mr. Nash."
Maybe tomorrow they'll ask me about you.

He was also a friend.
So was he advising you as your accountant or as your friend?
"Listen, Mr. L.A. Law, I'm not on trial here."
All right?
So just stop grilling me and do your job.
Unless you want to try for a matched set.
"I am doing my job, Mr. Campbell."
But if I'm gonna take your stupid case into open court...
I'm gonna need more than a girl fight between friends.
Excuse me?
"'Cause you've got crap for a case, Mr. Campbell."
And the jury's gonna take one look at your fat ass and say--
- What?
What?
Did you hear what he just said?
"- He's not starving, and he's blaming a friend for his own stupid mistakes, so good luck finding a lawyer dumb enough to take you on."

Just for stealing a mouthful of bread

To touch my soul and teach me love?

This world that always hated me!

"No, you will stay here with me."
"Otherwise, I shall have no one to talk to and that will be embarrassing."
As you wish.
Bitch!
I tbelieve you delivered this to the wrong person.
"No, I have delivered it to the Marquise de Maintenon."
My heartfelt congratulations.
I don't understand.
"Iside, you will find the deeds and title to the Maintenon estate that the King himself offers you, in your name."
This is absurd.
I have no taste for titles and such things.
You soon will have.
"Gaston De Foix's newfound wealth, where does it come from?"
"well, certainly not the gambling tables."
"His losses this month have come into thousands, though he has always payed on time."
"By the way, I encountered a friend of yours, yesterday in Paris."
"Mike, come on -- too dangerous."
"Sam, this whole thing with..."
"losing Elsa, I just..."
"Yeah, well, doing something insanely dangerous won't fix what happened with me and Elsa."
I don't see another way.
"All right, then."
Let's go do something insanely dangerous.
This place is like a black market Costco in here.
"Yeah, well, I'm kind of a big deal."
That's why I'm able to smuggle super-spies to other countries.
"So, guys, what's the plan?"
All right.
Here's how it works.
"Every time you make a delivery from a warehouse,"
"Jabbar finds out, right?"
"Yeah -- come looking for me, and then they steal everything."
"Okay, so, now you're gonna call in a pickup from this warehouse."
"Only this time, Jabbar's guys are gonna find a very unhappy ex-employee of yours here."
E-e-ex-employee?
What --
That's what Mike and Fi are setting up in your office.
Mike gets the guys to take him to Jabbar.
We sic the FBI on him -- problem solved.
"Oh, problem solved."
You guys just skipped over the part where I lose everything I own!
Shut up.
"Listen, Mike's doing the hard part here, okay?"
"All you have to do is make the call, wait for Jabbar's guys to show up, and run like hell."
I can't believe I'm even considering this.
I hate this plan.
This is a horrible plan.
Push the button.
- Sorry to barge in on you.
"- No, no, no, no."
I'm just watching your girl.
- First female prime ministers?
- They were great leaders.
Would you put Thatcher in that category?
"No, I don't think so."
- You know what?
I would have to say Thomas Jefferson.
- A man?
"- She's something, isn't she?"
- I don't really know her.
"We served together a few years ago, and, I guess... we just ended up in different company."
- Take a seat.
"- Congressman, the president asked us to come down here."
He'd like to let you know he'd appreciate your support in the senator's confirmation.
- Really?
"- He asked me directly, Shell."
But the president didn't consider it important enough to ask me personally?
You know it's important.
It's the old man's swan song.
Putting a woman in office means something to him.
Laine Hanson's the absolute best choice.
You don't believe that.
Come on.
You're too smart.
"Look, I don't mind she's a woman... but I'm not confirming a woman just because she's a woman."
Laine Hanson has an extra burden.
She's has to come on the world stage with perfect credentials.
Margaret Thatcher didn't have perfect credentials.
The world respected her.
The world accepted Margaret Thatcher because they knew she had to answer to Ronald Reagan.
"Oh, right."
"That's very sensible of you, very male."
"You know, that guy really made me sick."
Hi.
"Leo, I've finished the histology on Dawn Pivcevic and all the organs are normal except for this."
I think the endometrium shows changes of pregnancy and there's a cluster of cells from an embryo.
She was pregnant?
"Yes, just a few days."
You were lucky to sample the right bits for histology.
"They couldn't get pregnant, that's why they'd come off IVF."
It's not unusual for couples to come off IVF and then get pregnant.
That's how Theresa got pregnant with Cassie.
Morning sickness.
She was making the doll throw up.
Who?
The little girl at the scene.
"She wasn't re-enacting Dawn's death, she must have seen her vomiting at some time."
Early stages of pregnancy could bring on nausea and vomiting and faintness.
Especially with the remaining hormones from the IVF.
And if she got a bit tipsy...
She could easily faint.
"How am I going to explain to the husband that his wife, who couldn't get pregnant, got pregnant, which in part killed her?"
If it wasn't so tragic it would be a joke.
Hello.
Hi.
We've met before.
At the garden centre.
"Oh, yes."
Didn't you work for Henry Elliot?
Yes.
"Ah, is Detective Chief Inspector Tom Wimber here?"
"No, I'm afraid not."
Why?
How are you here?
Why did you come here?
Miyu
Stop all this and come home
I don't want to
Why are you here?
Miyu
Excuse me
If you cause any trouble I will have to call the police
Is that Ok?
Did you call her Bebi?
"No, I didn't"
"Um, sorry, there are security cameras on each floor"
"Um, so would it be Ok If I report this to the police?"
Give us a second.
We are friends
Bebi!
Come out and explain
Bebi!
"Wait, wait a sec"
My lust was just...
Shut up
You pathetic loser!
Only with professional fucking experience
The only way you'd lose your virginity is by putting your dick in your own ass
That's so mean
Please stop making so much trouble
Our business suffers from people like you
Sorry
"I won't contact the police this time, as you say these are your friends"
"But next time, I will have to call the police"
We'II wait till she's through soaking in the hot tub then I'm gonna inquire if she's acquainted with the napoleonic Code.
"Oh, stanley, don't be so silly."
It looks to me like you been swindled.
"And when you get swindled under NapoIeonic Code, I get swindled too."
I don't like to get swindled.
"Oh, stanley you've no idea how ridiculous you're being when you suggest that my sister  or I or anyone else of our family could have perpetrated a swindle on anyone."
"Oh, come on, now."
Where's the money if the place was sold?
Not sold.
Lost!
-Lost.
-Come here.
-stanley.
-will you just open your eyes to this stuff?
"-What, she got this out of teacher's pay?"
"-Oh, hush."
will you look at these fine feathers and furs that she comes to preen herself in here?
What is this article?
"That's a soIid-goId dress, I believe."
"-Oh, honest."
-This one here.
"What is that, a fox piece?"
-stanley!
-A genuine fur fox a half a mile long.
Where are your fox pieces?
"This is bushy snow-white ones, no less."
Where are your white fox furs?
Those are inexpensive summer furs that blanche has had a Iong time.
I have an acquaintance who deals in this sort of merchandise.
-He's coming to make an appraisal.
"-Don't be such an idiot, stanley."
"Listen, I'm gonna bet you there's a thousand dollars invested in this stuff."
"Hey Pakodi, Tiger Bhai has come."
Take Chilly Chicken and chilled beer.
['Sher'ishindiwordmeaning'Tiger']
"Yes, Tiger Bhai and Beer Bhai will come."
That Tiger Bhai will not come at all.
"It is Tiger Bhai, who came."
Why did you say Tiger Bhai then?
What do you say 'Tiger' in English?
- Tiger!
Have I served him for a year without knowing that?
What ?
Should I newly tell you the order?
"I should tell you a new matter, you are under arrest."
"Without knowing that you were Tiger Bhai, I fed the militants who crossed the border for a year."
Suzuki Subramanyam alias Peter alias Pakodi.
"Though I have no success, I did 16 undercover operations."
I was side tracked as bad luck is in my back pocket.
I will get into main track now by pushing you in.
"If you are undercover, all these are my cover."
We are the undercover to cover you sir.
Undercover for the undercover?
Excellent!
Do not underestimate diamond as it's light and department guy as he is short.
Thank you guys.
I am very happy about my first success.
This is your last mission.
This is the last job I will be giving you.
"That means, are you dying sir?"
"- Suzuki sir, last mission for you"
"That means, am I going to die sir?"
- You will be retiring next month.
My God!
It takes me a few seconds to realize that they're looking at me.
One of the airport's radiation detectors thought I was carrying a dirty bomb.
Were you?
I was carrying this.
"I found it on the farm when I was a kid, right by the pond."
"I was out there, uh, skipping rocks one day, and then I look down."
"There's a beautiful black stone, so I take it home."
"A few months later, my mother shakes me awake in the middle of the night."
"She says, ""You've got five minutes to grab anything you ever want to see again."""
"At the time, I thought to myself this is the moment where my life changes for the worse."
So one of the things I grabbed on my way out is this little stone.
"Look, Pete, this is a touching story."
Are you going to tell me what this is?
Uraninite.
As in uranium.
"Oh, uranium."
In Connecticut?
We're one of the few states that's got it.
"After I analyzed Pete's stone,"
I had him take me out to the pond.
- Took some core samples.
- How much is down there?
It doesn't matter.
"Just from the surface readings alone, it promises that some big energy company will come in and buy us out."
Okay.
And how much do I get for not telling Audrey?
We can give you 2.
2 what?
2 million.
How much are you getting?
We're getting our share.
Your share is $2 million.
Will it be okay if it comes from me?
It's not like I have to like you with an effort now.
I've always liked you.
But I never felt that you could be the one for me.
"But now that I think of it, it all makes sense."
"I like you, Sadhana."
Really?
A small word said in passing...
"It is chilly, it is true, listen."
You added sweetness to what you spoke.
My feminity is stunned.
Should I blush away?
Or climb up high to touch the clouds?
Should I yearn even more
Or look for more words to speak?
With the wishes as a garland...
Shall I go around you all day long?
A small word said in passing
"It is chilly, it is true, listen"
You added sweetness to what you spoke
My masculinity is stunned.
Should I say slowly
Or increase the speed?
Should I leave after saying or pause right there?
Should I pinch at the love that was said
Or should I lose myself to the love that was grabbed by my hands
I realize today that there may be a thousand changes to the sight.
I see myself through your eyes conveying love.
I am seeing you with a pouring love... that I have collected.
I am gently bringing to your ears the words I collected slowly.
I put my hands out to get a raindrop...
It remained just as a drizzle.
"Well, well, well, wonders will never cease."
Eddie Catflap's been thinking.
Put out some bunting.
Organise a street party.
Let off some fireworks.
Telephone the Queen.
Give everyone a week's holiday.
The man with no brain's been thinking.
Everybody go to the lavatory in amazement.
"You don't know how you wound, Richie, you really don't."
"However, no matter, because you will soon be in pris."
- Pris?
- Pris-on.
You have aided and abetted a robbery in front of Mr Forsyth and 50 mad checkout girls.
I am all right.
I was just the mysteriously handsome bloke in the huge trousers who vanished without a trace.
But you're Richie Rich.
And you'll be going to pris.
"You're not all right, darling, cos I shall squeal."
"Yeah, I shall sing and... and blab..."
Then I might even spill a little bit.
"And I shall buy a lighter sentence with the names of my accomplices - to wit, Edward Catflap."
Then I'll have a face-lift so you can't exact your revenge.
"You'd need a fork-lift truck to lift your face, matey."
"At least I've got a face, not a collage of bogeys and sick."
"Just cos you never get any girlfriends, you think you can take it out on me."
"Me, never get any girlfriends?"
"That's rich, you never get any girlfriends."
I was out with a girl last Wednesday.
"Eddie, that was your mother."
I still got a snog.
- Snog?
would you think it possible that I was once considered to be attractive?
Your looks are okay.
-I was fishing for a compliment.
-I don't go for that stuff.
-What stuff?
-compliments to women about looks.
I never met a dame yet didn't know if she was good-Iooking or not without being told.
And some of them give themselves credit for more than they've got.
"I once went out with a dame who told me, ""I'm the glamorous type."""
"She says, ""I am the glamorous type."" I says, ""So what?"""
-And what did she say then?
-She didn't say nothing.
-That shut her up like a clam.
-Did it end the romance?
"well, it ended the conversation, that was all."
There's some men that are took in by this hollywood glamour stuff...
-...and there's some men that aren't.
-You belong in the second category.
-That's right.
-I cannot imagine any witch of a woman...
-...casting a spell over you.
-That's right.
"You're simple, straightforward and honest."
"A little bit on the primitive side, I should think."
-To interest you a woman would have to--
-To lay her cards on the table.
"well, I never did care for wishy-washy people."
"That was why when you walked in last night, I said to myself:"
"""My sister has married a man."" Of course."
-That was all I couId teII--
-How about cutting the rebop!

"Schools, clinics, grocery stores post offices, hotels, boardinghouses..."
We've managed to civilize all the Wushe savages
It's not an easy task
Hard to imagine that this was once the most uncivilized heartland here
"Carrying logs... and walking from the lumberyard uphill to here takes them a whole day, doesn't it?"
Don't worry.
These savages are strong
And they're more than happy to earn some money for millet wine
Come on.
This way please
"Mr. Satsuka, how long have you been in Wushe?"
Over a decade
So you know this region very well?
What's that pounding?
Your boyfriend is up on the roof replacing the loose shingles.
"Okay, so it wasn't Santa claus."
"But you can understand what got me there, right?"
The poor guy's only been here one night and you're putting him to work?
He volunteered.
Mike Biggs volunteered to climb up on the roof and start relaying shingles?
"He was reluctant at first, but I promised him a pan of brownies and he shimmied up that ladder like his ass was on fire."
"Mom, we shouldn't take advantage of Mike's good nature."
Some might say his jolly nature.
"You know, he's been working hard."
We should make him a nice dinner tonight.
That's a great idea.
Remember our Sunday night dinners with daddy?
"We'll make pot roast, mashed potatoes, and banana cream pie."
Daddy's favorite.
"Oh, it's not Mike's favorite."
Who the hell's talking about Mike?
"I'm telling you, Carl, all I did was put a couple screws in a cabinet door and her mom made me French toast."
"I know, I feel like king midas."
Not the muffler guy.
You got to get a library card.
"Hang on, I got to earn myself some brownies."
"Hey, how you doing up there?"
You working hard?
"Oh, yeah."
Seeing you up there blocking the sun reminds me of when my husband was alive.
He was always working on the roof.
"Well, Chicago winters..."
lots of wear and tear.
I may be up here for a while.
You hungry?
"I want to introduce you to the First Daughter of the United States, my daughter Catherine Selina Meyer."
Catherine.
Always a delight to have...
She is such a beautiful girl.
I'm so proud of her.
"Well, we have another minute or so before we're prepared to call Virginia."
Just checking a couple of precincts.
We've made some premature calls this evening.
So we're anxious to be absolutely certain this time.
Why don't we meet some of the people who lift me up?
I'd like you to meet them.
"Guys, come on out."
How about these great faces?
Incredible scenes.
Never happened before.
Very emotional moment.
"Dan, do you wish you were there?"
I'm sure it's a very exciting place to be at.
There's never been an election like this.
No.
You must want to be there.
"Folks, you don't know her, but this is Karen Collins."
And she has been a friend of mine for a while.
Yep.
And Amy Brookheimer is here.
Amy Brookheimer who so successfully ran my campaign until she became unwell.
I'll tell you somebody else that is not here tonight who was with the campaign...
"Sounds like it could be you, Dan."
"Well, I would be incredibly touched."
"And that is, of course, Leslie Kerr."
"I'm sure Leslie is thanking you, too."
And I'm hearing we can now project a Virginia result.
They waltz into my court.
"They get a slap on the wrist, and then they go off and re-offend."
The only treatment for them is death.
You dismembered him to make it easier to dispose of the body.
I've worked in a courtroom for 16 years.

There's only one problem.
Vince Nelson didn't send those photos.
I don't understand.
I saw them.
They were there with his name on my son's computer.
"Your son, Kyle sent them."
To himself and six other boys on the wrestling team.
He blamed the coach for ruining his chances at the state championship.
Sending the photos from Nelson's e-mail address was his way of getting revenge.
He wanted to get the coach fired.
This whole thing was just a tragic misunderstanding.

You got him!

Okay.
"So, have you had any new sexual partners since the last time I saw you?"
"Oh, nnn..."
What do you consider sex?
Penetration or...?
"Well, no, there's all kinds of different kinds of sex."
"Okay, then, yes, a bunch, but we used a condom."
- Their call.
"- Okay, great."
So I'm gonna have you put your feet in the stirrups and I want you to slide all the way to the end of the table so that I can take a look at your pussy.

"You got a busted ear too, man?"
"I'm on permanent vacation, no parole."
You can shave ten years off my time but I ain't never getting out.
- Just checking.
"- No doors, people."
You have no idea what it is like growing up in this house.
- I'm not saying I do.
- Know why that poster is still on the wall?
Because my life stopped when I was 12 years old and it did not start back up again until a year ago.
"Since the first time Lucy got sick, everything has been about her."
Doors!
You wanna know what's funny?
It was about her before then too.
She was the smart one.
She was the pretty one.
She was the star of the family.
"Apparently, that was not enough for her, because then she got sick."
And she dominated every moment of our lives.
- Everything else was just put on hold.
"- Okay, I can't listen anymore."
- I'm going upstairs.
"- No, Mom."
"No, I wanna hear this."
- I wanna hear the unvarnished truth.
- I like my truth with a little varnish.
Know what it's like to postpone your birthday because your sister sees giant rats running across the floor?
"Or to have your parents so distracted all the time that they can barely get through the day, let alone find the energy to come to your stupid soccer game?"
"If Lucy had a bad day my mom wouldn't get out of bed for the next two days or weeks, depending on how bad it was."
I'm really sorry you had to go through all that.
- I wish you had told me.
- On our first date?
Or second?
How about the first time we did it from behind?
- When she says that...
Just...
"At the end of the conversation, y'all,"
"I kid you not, he says,"
"""And I impregnated America."""
"I said, ""Worth it."""
This whole conversation was worth it to hear Kanye West say he took his penis and fornicated with the United States of America.
My life is fucking awesome.
"I said, ""Thank you, Kanye."""
It's amazing.
"He's--I'm telling you though, he's a cool dude, man."
"There's nothing bad between-- He's a very cool guy, very nice dude, you know?"
There's no beef whatsoever.
"And when I met him, I was star-struck, and that does not happen a lot."
'Cause One Direction came to SNL.
Nobody cared.
It was so funny.
We did a shoot with them.
"It was 200 extra girls, and it was One Direction."
"As soon as the girls saw One Direction, they just lost it, they lost it."
"They were like, ""Aaahh!"""
"I was like, ""Y'all are 11."
"""You shouldn't be touching yourselves like that."
"I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now."""
They got escorted out.
One Direction leaves.
I went to where the 200 girls were standing.
"I kid you not, y'all."
It smelled just like farts.
Do you know what that means?
"That means they were so excited to meet One Direction, they almost shit themselves."
"Now, that's a different type of fame for your ass."
"I know about famous, but not shit famous, right?"
"I ain't never had somebody come up to me and be like,"
She'll bounce back.
It's not like she hasn't had any practice.
That's true.
"And even if you do quit, it's not gonna help her any."
She's still off the play.
"Oh, that's good."
I gotta write that one down.
(Opens drawer)
"You know, if you really think about it, if I'm in the play... (Pen clicks)"
Then Sue's in the play.
"Yeah, don't go with that one."
"...and then I heard the door, and then I came here."
Brick's grandparents and special people day--
Any of that ring a bell?
"Oh, well, I-I don't think that was, uh, that was actually a firm commitment."
(Scoffs) Nothing's ever a firm commitment with you.
This is what you do.
You didn't even bother to show up at my wedding.
"(Chuckles) Well, who has a wedding on a weekend?"
Everyone on Earth.
"You know, Brick was really counting on you, and... (Sighs) You know what?"
Forget it.
"I'm not gonna even bother explaining it to you, 'cause you're never gonna get it."
Hey.
Thought you could use a snack.
Now is grandma dead?
"She's fine, but speaking of grandma, well, you know, that reminds me of a funny story."
"When I was little, your grandma and I decided it would be fun to get matching mother-daughter dresses, so we went shopping all over town looking for the right ones, and finally, we found the perfect dress,"
"but they only had one, and it fit grandma, but it didn't fit me."
Ohh.
"Anyway, grandma got the dress, and I was so happy."
She bought the dress?
We're planning the registry for the most important day of our life and he just leaves.
Maybe he's just feeling a bit of...
"A bit of what, anxiety?"
Can't believe you're defending him.
What?
"No, no, no, no."
I'm not defending him.
You just don't understand.
You can't possibly comprehend what it feels like inside of me right now because you've never been here.
"That's, that's true."
"I used to think about what it'd be like to live your life, Dale."
Just walk in your shoes.
Nobody expects anything from you.
They don't.
No one expects anything from me?
Uh-uh. 'Cause you don't have parents expecting babies... and marriages and perfect husbands.
It's really hard.
"That's true, but it doesn't mean I want to end up alone."
"Tell me something, Dale."
Am I expecting too much?
"Is wanting my fiancée to be excited about our wedding, is that too much?"
"I don't know, Jill."
"Back at St. Mary's, for our first communion... the biggest deal was finding out who you were gonna get paired up with."
I dreamed of walking down the aisle with Billy Dobson hand in hand.
"But, no such luck."
"He was paired with Jill, and I ended up with what's his face who picked his nose all the time."
I wonder if I'll ever get to walk down the aisle with a Billy Dobson of my own.
"Ah, is this your parents?"
Yeah.
That's them.
And is this you with your mother?
Yeah.

"South, when I mas young and handed love as you do"
I was wont to load my she with knacks
I would have ransack'd the pedlar's silken treasury.
"Old sir, I know she prizes not such triﬂes as these are"
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd up in my heart
Which I have given already but not delivered.
"Take hands, a bargain!"
"And friends unknown, you shall bear witness to't"
I give my daughter to him and will make her portion equal his.
"Come, your hand"
"And daughter, yours."
"Soft, swain, awhile"
"Beseech you, have you a father?"
"I have, but what of him?"
- Knows he of this?
- He neither does nor shall.
"By my while beard, you offer him a wrong, something unﬂlial"
- Let him know't.
- He shall not.
- Mark our contract..
"- Mark your divorce, young sir."

"Dad, from school?"
"Actually, and I don't think you know this, Dylan."
I first saw you at the same party where you met Ben.
"I even pointed you out to Ben, because I took one look at you and I was totally smitten."
But Ben Boykewich moved in on you before I even had a chance.
Huh.
Interesting.
Yeah.
We should go.
"No, we shouldn't."
"If you were my daughter, I wouldn't just let you walk out of the house with some guy I don't know."
Ask me anything you want.
And I will try to answer honestly and to the best of my ability.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Honestly?
Yes.
I have a real sweet tooth.
What's your favorite dessert?
Whatever you like to bake.
What does your father do?
He's a male nurse.
He works in assisted care.
He wanted to be a doctor but his dad died when he was young and he had to take care of my grandmother and that's how he got into the field.
He's very patient.
He likes older people.
Our culture is very respectful of the elderly.
What would your family say if someday you wanted to marry someone outside of your culture?
I've already asked.
"We've discussed it at length, and my parents feel that matters of the heart should be decided by the heart."
"Okay, if we're going to get to the 7:30 show, we really should be going."
But he didn't get his cake.
Let me get the cake.
"Go throw Mom one of your ""puppy dog in a thunderstorm"" looks."
Get her to change her mind.
They made it clear.
I have to obey Mrs. Bloom's request.
This isn't right.
I can't just stand back and do nothing.
"Kyle, do I detect defiance?"
Genius joins the dark side.
I've got a list of rules I've been dying for you to break.
I don't want to break any rules.
I won't have to.
I'll do exactly what Mrs. Bloom asked me to do.
"Atta boy, Kyle."
Take a stand.
Why are your feet on my bed?
There were still ways to contact Amanda without seeing or speaking to her.
* I miss
* Feeling you there by my side... *
I could easily circumvent Mrs. Bloom without leaving my own house.
But it seemed she could find ways to thwart me just as easily.
"If electronic messages weren't getting through, there would be no way for me to send a note or a letter without Mrs. Bloom intercepting it."
I couldn't see or speak to Amanda.
The written word was no longer an option.
But there were still a few notes I could send her way.
"I hoped this message would get through, and she would at least know I was thinking about her."
I was just trying- I know what you were doing.
I think you better come in now.
What?
"You want my music now, too?"
You've already confiscated my phone and my computer.
I know this is hard for you to understand-
That you're keeping me prisoner?
Not me.
Where were you on Thursday?
- On a date.
- With who?
I didn't catch her name.
But she wasn't as hot as you.
"Holt's blood is on the victim, he's got priors and his alibi is just as worthless as he is."
"In other words, Mr. Holt just became our prime suspect."
Now all we have to do is shore up motive.
I've been working on that.
"So far, I haven't been able to find a single connection between him and Nelson."
And I doubt u will.
Ribosomal analysis shows that the sample of Johnny Holt's blood that we found on our vic is at least three months old.
While he was still in Sing Sing.
Sid found the dried blood on Nelson's throat.
Said he must've been hit there with a pipe or club.
The blood must've been on the murder weapon.
Transferred onto Nelson when he was killed.
I think we just found our connection.
No.
I've never seen him.
Are you sure?
He might've been an acquaintance of your husband's?
Absolutely not.
What about this boy?
I don't recognize this child at all.
"And to save you a question, I have no idea what these pictures are doing on Vince's computer."
Ever since this e-mail thing came out the phone's been ringing nonstop.
Someone put a pile of dog feces on my doormat this morning.
"Mrs. Nelson, did your husband teach anywhe else where he might've been in contact with younger boys?"
After school program?
The local Y?
But they took her.
-Do you know where she is?
- She's a prisoner underground at the Base of Dulce.
And they have been torturing her.
- So the telepathic link between the two of you is how they tracked you?
-Yes.
-Look... uh...
I have no idea what you must be going through right now.
You never told me her name.
-Her name is Alyssa.
And she carries my child.
- I've been an associate of Chayton's since the early 90's.
He's devoted his life to researching anomalous phenomenon has established a strong following in the UFO arena.
"He was one of the first to get hold of the secret flying disk file of the FBI and sensitive documents from the CIA, air force, army and other government agencies."
"The price he's paid for being the truth to the public are death threats, imprisonment and getting shot at."
"He is a good man, and I trust him as I would a brother."
"- Thanks a lot, Derek."
I appreciate it.
Can you give us a moment?
"You don't know how good it is to see you, my friend Chayton."
-Likewise.
You look good.
-I'm a lot better than I feel.
Uh... this is the gentleman I was telling you about.
Jaelen.
-Welcome.
-I'm gonna show him the footage.
-Why don't we start with your name?
-Jaelen.
-Jaelen?
"So, Jaelen, who are you?"
- Our task was to monitor human conditions.
"Oh, yes."
The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains and laying waste entire regions.
An army which carries the Ark before it is invincible.
You did it didn't you?
They wants you to go for it!
"Wow, Marcus!"
"They wants you to get a hold of the ark before the Nazis do, and they're prepared to pay handsomely for it."
And the museum?
The museum gets the ark when we're finished?
"Oh, yes."
The Ark of the Covenant.
Nothing else has come close.
That thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place.
"You know, five years ago I would have gone after it myself."
I'm really rather envious.
I've got to locate Abner.
I think I know where to start.
Will she still be with him?
Possibly.
"Marion is the least of your worries right now, believe me Indy."
What do you mean?
"Well, I mean, for nearly three thousand years, man has been searching for the lost Ark."
That's not something to be taken lightly.
No one knows its secrets.
It's like nothing you've ever gone after before.
"Oh, Marcus, what are you trying to do, Scare me?"
You sound like my mother.
We've known each other for a long time -
"I don't believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus."
I'm going after a find of incredible historical significance.
You're talking about the boogie-man.
"Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am."
He was just leaving.
"Do you ever make a decision that at the time seems sound, but quickly reveals itself to be empty?"
"Good-bye, Philip."
I don't like you.
He's kind of an asshole.
What a strange feeling.
"So off... it's like my head is a car, but I can't drive fast because there's too much traffic."
"So instead I'm just moving very, very slowly."
"It's so hard, what I do."
"I mean, it's not at all, and that is the joke, right?"
"- (SIGHS) God, this is so boring."
- A big joke.
Ashley's so bored right now.
Just go back where you came from.
"I'm getting angry at myself, do you understand?"
Because it doesn't even upset me to see you like this.
I want you to leave and leave me alone.
"I don't know why you are here, but I'm not interested, so don't tell me."
"God, do you remember there was a time when we just..."
"We wanted to go to sleep together and wake up together, every day, indefinitely."
Now I don't even give a shit if I ever see you again.
"I want you to leave, and just don't come back and stop hurting me."
I got asked to write a short story about photography.
By who?
"Oh, God, you'd be so mad if I told you."
Isn't that what you want?
I don't know what you want me to say.
You used to be so exciting.
Now you're just pitiful.
"(CLICKS TONGUE) I'm afraid you've seen the last of me for a long, long time."
(ASHLEY CHUCKLES)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Enough with the complicated stuff.
Just tell me whether or not you can save him... as a doctor.
You bastard!
What are you doing right now?
Answer me.
I can save him.
Then save him.

His blood pressure is dropping too much too suddenly.
There's too much bleeding.
What are we going to do?
"If something bad happens to this patient, aren't we all going to die?"
"Dismiss Captain Yoo Si Jin of his duties for disobeying command, and... get ready to place him under detention."
"So then, why did you do something that useless?"
Useless?
!
"Because of me, one person's life--I haven't seen Captain Yoo around..."
Did he go somewhere?
"According to military code, he'll go to prison for disobeying command."
"How could you not know this, when you're the one who argued to proceed with the surgery that everyone was against doing?"
FERON:
People from the production crew are really harsh too.
"Even if she is a temporary worker, it shouldn't be like, ""We're about to take a chance to have you fired."""
Look at just what they are doing!
How come those people are so cruel?
"No matter how weak or fragile, you can't just treat a person recklessly."
I will be talking until here.
I'm sorry for blabbering.
Call the director.
"If it's not PD No Eul, I won't shoot a cut be it a documentary or what."
If they don't want the representative actor of the agency then they should put back PD No Eul to her usual place.
"Ahjussi, eat one."
"Okay, I'll stop."
Proposal cancelled.
You should just tell me that you don't want me to be your wife.
Why are you drinking strong soju when you can't even handle alcohol well.
Hey... 'it's not like that No Eul.'
'Why would I reject such a lovely like No Eul?
'
'I just like it so much that I don't know what to do right now.'
You're not saying those.
You still won't say it.
I don't really like it as well!

He won't even come after me.
He is not that great at all.
Why is he stubborn?
"Ah, this is so embarrassing!"
"Rejected from my job, and rejected from my proposal, nothing went well."
That's because I am the third party!
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of fucking bad things.
"I mean, he's treating me like I'm a fuckin' half-a- fag or something."
I'm gonna wind up a lammist. I gotta go on the fuckin' lam to get away from this guy.
This ain't right. I can't go here or there.
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.
"If you tell him, he'll stop."
I'll wind up being declared M.l.A.
"They're gonna find me in the back of a car somewhere, in the weeds?"
You've known this fuckin' Tommy all your life.
Who knows better than you?
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.
"When I leave my house in the morning, before I get to the car, I'm lookin' over both shoulders."
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.
"-Tell me what I gotta do, whatever the fuck I gotta do I'm gonna do, no?"
-What could I do?
"If there was something I could do, don't you think I would do it?"
"You know me, I'd like to help you out."
Sonny...tell him what we talked about.
"Maybe you could come in with me, take a piece of this fuckin' joint. it'd be good."
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?
It's a classy place.
You've been in here a million times.
Tommy taking over this fuckin' joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.
"I don't mean any disrespect, but that's the way it is."
I'm begging you.
What can I say?
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?
I don't know anything about the restaurant business.
And now... we've upset Grandma.
I feel pretty bad.
You've got to do something about it.
Stop worrying.
She'll recover her mood pretty quick.
"Still, what if she starts to say she won't go to Hawaii again?"
You know how stubborn she is.
I've got an idea.
"Why don't you, Tadao, and Yoshie stay here until the anniversary of Grandpa's death?"
Devote yourselves to Grandma's service... and send her to Hawaii in a good mood.
I can't do that.
I've got work to do at the office.
Why not?
You've still got some summer vacation left.
"And besides... if the circumstances require, there's a road open to the canning company, right?"
But I've got to get passports for Grandma and the children.
Don't worry about that.
I will take care of it myself.
Keeping Grandma in a good mood is our first priority.
"If she starts to say that she won't go again, it'll be a serious problem."
"""I received your telegram."
"""Clark will come right away, Suzujiro. """
I knew that telegram would mess things up.
Americans do resent being reminded of the atom bomb.
Japanese-Americans are especially sensitive about it.
I think they feel embarrassed by the Americans.
I wonder why Clark is coming here?
"Well, that's..."
He's probably coming... to wind up this matter once and for all.
I see.
To tell us to forget the whole thing.
"By the way, I guess I must be going, now."
"Apparently, your marine was stabbed, and based on the granulation tissue and the degree of healing,"
I'd say this happened three or four days ago.
He stitch himself up?
Appears so.
Should've gone to the hospital.
"It's a pretty deep wound, but he didn't go."
That means he didn't want the authorities to find out who stabbed him.
"And if this attack is somehow connected to the crash that killed him, then..."
"Like I said, it's not an accident."
Everybody's hiding something about this case.
"Apparently, even Jared."
(chuckles) That seems to be going around.
Loretta...
I'm sorry.
But I wasn't hiding anything from you.
I assumed that Sebastian came to you before he came to me.
"Truth is, I'd offered the position to Gregorio first."
And she turned you down?
"Wasn't the right fit for her, I guess."
"So when Sebastian surprised me, said he wanted to become an agent, I..."
"Dwayne, I'm not mad at you or Sebastian."
I always knew he'd come out of his shell sooner or later.
"The truth is,"
I think you need to worry more about
"Sebastian driving you crazy in the field, if I were you."
(laughs) Good possibility of that.
"Come on, go."
You got your hands full.
"You don't have to worry about me, too."
"I always got time for that, Loretta."
(sighs)
"There must be over $100,000 in here, huh?"
Mother... you have come here to see Grandma.
Why don't you ask about her?
"Tonight's dinner was quite a spread, but it wasn't enjoyable, was it?"
Because the grownups' chatter wasn't enjoyable.
Let's eat their souvenir.
Tateo... don't you find it strange?
Why do they hide everything about Grandpa?
"To put it nicely, they do that out of consideration for Suzujiro and Clark."
"And to put it not nicely, it's sort of a diplomatic tactic and calculation."
"To put it straight, they don't want to ruin the relationship... with that rich family that they've suddenly got."
Hold on.
You mean that Grandma is just being used as an excuse?
That's terrible.
That's the reality of being a grownup.
"Still, I hate it."
Can you take it?
Me?
Count me out.
I'm going to concentrate on this.
"At any rate, the pineapple farm is tremendously vast."
It has eight thousand and some hundred acres.
There are six huge chimneys soaring up from the canning factory.
There is this huge swimming pool in the patio of the house.
Clark's wife got a swimsuit out for me to use.
"But you see, I can't swim."
"And Clark took us on a tour of the factory, too."
Did you know the factory's agency is in Tokyo?
I know that.
They've got agencies in every big city in the world.
"Tell me, what is Clark's wife like?"
A very nice person.
So different from rich Japanese wives.
"He collapsed in the downstairs men's room in Penn Station, New York."
"The police couldn't identify him, because, for some unknown reason, he crossed out the address on his passport."
"They took him to the city morgue, where he lay unclaimed for three days."
What was he thinking at the end?
Had he seen anyone?
Had he talked to anyone?
Had he really decided to leave his wife and come and live with us like my mother said?
[soft dramatic music]
?
?
"For years, I struggled to be satisfied with the little piece of my father's life I'd been allowed to see."
But it wasn't enough.
I needed to know him.
"I needed to find out who he really was, so I set out on a journey to see his buildings and to find whatever was left of him out there."
It would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questions.
[violin music]
?
?
"My father had been dead 25 years, so there wasn't much time left if I wanted to meet any of his colleagues."
I figured I'd start at the top:
the guy with the glasses.
?
?
[dog barking] [chuckles] Mr. Johnson.
Good to meet you.
"Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you."
You're Lou's son?
Yes.
"Generations go by quickl y, don't they?"
I've just decided Lou was the most beloved architect of our time.
Really?
"Yell, think of anybody else."
and there was coverage on the troops in Afghanistan.
She swears to me that she saw me.
"After that point, she became obsessed with politics."
And that's when she first saw you.
The man that was gonna bring Daddy home.
"And when I finally did come home, I realised that.."
I'm not her hero anymore.
So I guess I just figured that I'd try to help protect the man that is.
"Well, if she saw you today, Cale, she'd be proud of you."
You know how when they're young and they come running up to you..
"and they hug you and they're shouting ""Daddy"".."
"and all of a sudden, one day, that just stops?"
Yeah.
I'd give anything for that hug just one more time.
"You know, my daughter, she's 15 years old, her name is Amber."
You know what she wants for her birthday?
A belly button ring.
Belly button ring.
What parent is equipped for that?
Daughters.
What'shappening?
"Attention, attention."
"Everyone below Calico T11, please clear the ﬂoor immediately."
Put the president onscreen.
"Mr. President, Delta Force entered Washington airspace."
I have Lieutenant Colonel Cameron on the line.
"You're online, sir!"
"What do you have for us, colonel?"
We developed this plan independent of the Secret Service.
We'll use the superstructure of the city to mask our approach.
What if they start killing hostages?
They're dead anyway if this fails.
I want one of our own
"If this is not bat, and looks good to you"
I can't understand what for you want another flat
Given how much it costs
"Well man, our own flat is our own flat"
Do whatever you want
But fuck
I can't see any logic if this one is so fine
It looks like you want to live in a palace
- No
Do you want to smoke?
- No
I don't feel like smoking
Are you sleepy?
- Yeah
If you want I'll turn the lights and well get some sleep
After the cigarrette is over
"You were born in La Ciega, weren't you?"
"Yes, that's where I grew up"
Do you like it?
- I like it very much
It's so pretty
You're so pretty
It's very beautiful I like it very much
"Yeah, indeed"
But just to stay a little while and then go
To hell with it
Be patient with grandma
What a surprise is the old lady going to get
I might be out of place here
Out of place?
You're my woman
Stop worrying.
She'II recover her mood pretty quick.
"still, what if she starts to say she won't go to Hawaii again?"
You know how stubborn she is.
I've got an idea.
"Why don't you, Tadao, and Yoshie stay here until the anniversary of Grandpa's death?"
Devote yourselves to Grandma's service... and send her to Hawaii in a good mood.
I can't do that.
I've got work to do at the office.
Why not?
You've still got some summer vacation left.
"And besides... if the circumstances require, there's a road open to the canning company, right?"
But I've got to get passports for Grandma and the children.
Don't worry about that.
I will take care of it myself.
Keeping Grandma in a good mood is our first priority.
"No, but I telephoned him last night."
Most extraordinary.
Are you quite certain that you haven't a gentleman named Edward McDermott stopping here?
- Absolutely.
- Then how could I have spoken to him?
"- It's beyond me, miss."
- I'm certain there's nothing to worry about.
Go up to your room and make yourself comfortable.
"And meanwhile, I'll scout around and see if I can find your Mr. McDermott."
- You must think this very stupid of me.
"- Not at all, not at all."
Your friend must surely be around here somewhere.
"I'll try and find him, and then give you a ring in your room."
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.
- Where's Manville?
I'll bust their fuckin' balls.
"Don't give them the satisfaction, the fucks."
"Come on, fuckos."
Let's go for a ride.
Keep them up all night.
I'll see you later.
Jimmy was cutting every link between himself and the robbery but it had nothing to do with me.
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me some Christmas money.
"From then on, I kept my mouth shut."
I knew Jimmy.
He had the cash.
It was his.
"I knew he kicked some money upstairs to Paulie, but that was it."
It made him sick to hafta turn the money over to the guys who stole it.
He'd rather whack them.
"Anyway, what did I care?"
I wasn't asking for anything.
"And besides, Jimmy was making nice money through my Pittsburgh connections."
"Still, months after the robbery they were finding bodies all over."
"When they found Carbone in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff it took them two days to thaw him out for the autopsy."
"Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy."
He was like a kid.
"We had money coming in through my Pittsburgh people and even after a while, the Lufthansa thing began to calm down."
But the thing that made Jimmy so happy that morning was that this was the day that Tommy was being made.
"Jimmy was so excited, you'd think he was being made."
He must have made four calls to Tommy's house.
They had a signal all set up so he'd know that the minute that the ceremony was over.
"-Ma, where are you?"
-Here I am.
-You're home.
-Home?
I'm leaving.
"- Okay, sit down."
"We are not in this battle alone, I've enlisted the aid... of a very valued ally."
Deep Throat?
He was instrumental in cracking the case of the missing Manolo Blahnik.
"Roxette, do you really think we need the Deep Throat?"
Why can't we just find the Yuri within ourselves?
"Call me silly, but I have a hunch it might be..."
- Pierre Larroux.
- Nonsense!
"Pierre may be an obsequious, ass-licking meretricious... sick offend, but Yuri he's not."
He's off to a secret shoot... for Vogue.
- What?
- Lies!
He'd better not be.
"Ok, now let's move on."
Cornelia?
"Chi Chi, any trend report from the front?"
"I heard from the chef at ""Daveé"", who heard from his boyfriend... who works backstage at Galliano, with Orlando Pitta... whose blow drier system just came from the Gautier show... that his next collection will be revolutionary."
The girls will come out on the catwalk... in wheelchairs.
Wheelchair chic?
- Genius!
- Inspirational.
I think Da Vinci did sketches of wheelchair prototypes.
- We can use those for the layout.
- I have goose bumps.
Nine pages!
"Jocelyn, I see you put your name down for the..."
"""make your own video"" booth."
Do you know?
I think I'm gonna join you on that one.
"Paul, Jocelyn, why don't you guys run over to Gustav's studio now... and I'll be there in a few minutes All right?"
Just sit tight.
Or are you sad that you're separating?
I'm frustrated because the command is unfair.
"You said that you always follow a command.-This command is not by the Commander, but as a father."
This melodrama with the entrance of Yoon Myeong Joo's father means they're still in the screening procedure.
I've been curious since before
How did Myeong Joo and Master Sergeant Seo meet?
Fighting Team!
Fighting!
--Fighting!
"There was a joint march, and Yoon Myeong Joo was the Army Surgeon on service at that time."
"I'll carry the military gear for you, so I'll kill you if you give up."
"Yes, I understand!"
- Go on up.
This is the third time you're here.
What's wrong?
- Take off your boots.
"It's great being the duty officer and first in your squadron, but you can be discharged from this military due to the current state of your feet."
Staff Sergeant Seo Dae Yeong.
"Even if I do get discharged, I am determined to be first."
"I hope your determination to get first place isn't to get permission for a vacation, so that you can crash your ex-girlfriend's wedding."
"Nothinglikethat,right?"
That's right.
Really?
Really.
Get out.
Why here?
We're going to that sea from earlier.
It'll be better to go before we get busy.
You said that it's far.
Because it's far.
I want to be with you for a long time.
It's over here.
He needs to watch the show.
This is the moment he's been waiting for all year.
One where he doesn't feel inadequate or rejected.
So he watches as long as he can.
"Yeah, but fire's unpredictable."
"Every second in here, he's putting his own life at risk."
This guy's obviously confident that he can get out of here before it's too late.
But there was a fire alarm.
My men were here in five minutes.
- And he knew it.
- How?
[Prentiss] This unsub doesn't leave anything to chance.
He knows exactly how long he's got with his victims.
He probably knows response times or at least listens to them.
"[Police Dispatcher] All units, be advised of a robbery in progress at 9760 East Mills."
"[Male Deejay] Yep, this is your man, DJ Cutz, with an instant blast."
"The feds are in town cracking down on this year's Devil's Night, so I'd advise everyone to stay off them streets and keep them radios locked to FM 99 Detroit."
## [Rap]
## [Continues]
"[Reid] The first time I looked at these victims on the map, none of it made sense."
"Seven different victims, various ages, sex, and ethnicity."
- What do you see now?
- The first victim...
- Often tells us the most.
- Tommy Proctor.
"Well, his rap sheet is longer than the Nile."
Looks like he's always walked on the dark side.
The first kill inspired him.
What's different about it?
Two things.
"First of all, his body wasn't found for days."
He was buried deep in the building.
"If p is, qpurely and simply, this man could be a dishonest guy."
The car has broken down.
"Why is he saying,"
"""There's nothing wrong with the car?"""
I'd personally not propose him to anyone.
You've become such a malign person.
Forget about this proposition and go check what it is that the girls want.
You're an impolite student who leads the way and never stays behind.
Sit down!
"Mom, you shouldn't have troubled yourself."
"It was no trouble at all, my dear son."
My point of view in life had changed.
"According to my birth certificate, I was 20 but I had already lost... my joy in life."
Now I can only dream of the days... when I was filled with joy and happiness.
My writing has received a lot from my mother's illness.
Which of the following could be said for the person mentioned in the paragraph?
He has become a different person because of the things he's lived through.
"Dude, he chose the correct answer which was B."
He's actually answering the questions.
"Hey man, how are your studies going?"
Good.
I am studying.
How many correct answers did you get from Math and Science?
Around 67.
67?
I was getting 82 just for Math and Science.
You should also answer the questions on Social Science.
How much did you get?
He can't even answer that question.
He's totally bad in Social Science.
"But, if you ask him about the top 10 he'd answer instantly."
He'll become a pop star.
No badgers.
You know what?
I had this debate and I'm going to get skinned alive for this...
I would almost...
My son's at a certain age now.
..would rather go out and buy a mucky book to pretend to hide than him go on the internet.
That horror.
Just like a copy of Razzle.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
"Just something really normal and go, ""This doesn't represent women."""
"And a nice letters page, where people having sex with each other..."
"As a kid, I'm going..."
"Bathtime, overfill the bath."
"And my dad kept saying to me, ""I'm going to drill the bath"", like they do in the boarding houses so that you keep flooding the bathroom."
I just liked being totally submerged and hiding my shame.
One day I flooded the bathroom and I took the panel off and I'm going to soak it up with towel and I found one of my brother's magazines.
A bath panel - that's what YOU said.
In the bath.
"Well, the magazine..."
It was beautiful.
It was so well-hidden and it was...
Cherished.
It was a cherished item.
There was a woman in there dressed as a policewoman and...
I kind of knew she wasn't a policewoman.
There wasn't the full uniform.
And I was always kind of...
I wasn't always visual.
I needed a back-story and I developed this thing over time.
I had this special relationship with her where she'd arrested me.
For what?
- No.
What is your verdict?
Not guilty.
It is with deep regret that I inform you all of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.
Hari initiated the struggle with that gun and it's only his word for it that it was self-defence.
I owe you an apology for the other night.
"Your, erm, dinner invitation."
- You're a married man.
- This is it.
I think Danny Waldron purposely created a trail of evidence and now we're on the trail of the other abusers.
Dale Roach.
He was leader of the city council during the period Danny Waldron and Joe Nash were residents at Sands View.
The things that he did to us at Sands View...
"I promise you, I will get these bastards."
Bains killed Danny.
I'll lay you evens he killed Kennedy as well.
- Hello?
- 'You're being fitted up for murdering Rod Kennedy.'
"If you want a way out, you'll listen to me."
Did he ever mention any other names?
Politicians?
Coppers?
Single-handedly brings in an AFO.
Well done.
'I'd just like to get on with my life.'
Miss Denton.
"I'm Gill Bigelow, legal counsel to AC-12."
I imagine they keep you VERY busy.
Have a seat.
You know Superintendent Hastings.
I do.
"As part of a new initiative, christened Truth and Reconciliation, following a miscarriage of justice, parties are invited to engage in dialogue to initiate the healing process."
That's Vince.
Vince Nelson.
Why are you looking for him?
Becaushe was killed.
When was the last time you saw him?
Last night.
He comes here every Thursday night for a lesson.
Exactly what do you teach?
Private salsa lessons?
Is that what they call it these days?
"No, these were legit."
Nelson wanted to surprise his wife for their fifth anniversary.
Take her out dancing.
And our Salsa instructor had a client right after Nelson who corroborated her alibi.
"Mac, I found something on Coach Nelson's computer you should see."
This kid can't be more than ten years old.
It gets worse.
All right.
These photos were attached to an e-mail that Nelson sent out to seven of his wrestling students.
******
"This e-mail went out at 4:00 P.M.Three hours later, Vince Nelson was dea"
You think we just found our motive?
Someone may've gotten this e-mail and snapped.
"But if the Coach Nelson was a pedophile, why would he incriminate himself by sending it outo members of his own team?"
Maybe he molested some of these boys before and knew they wouldn't tell.
The whole thing makes me sick.
No.
Pedophiles usually download photos and trade with other short eyes.
"If that's the case, I'm betting there's more where these came from."
Find them.
"We had one victim, but now we have two."
This boy is too young to be a student at Hillridge High.
"Mr. Ohnhouse, you were in the next room at the time... under the orders of Marshal Belle... and you listened very carefully to the conversation... between Marshal Belle and Mr. Horn."
Is that correct?
Yes.
Will you tell the court exactly what you took down at that time?
The last thing Mr. Horn said before leaving Joe Belle's office was:
"""When I shot that kid..."
"""it was the best shot I ever made..."
"""and the dirtiest trick I ever did."""
I want order in this courtroom.
Your witness.
No questions.
You may step down.
The prosecution calls Mr. Tom Horn.
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth... so help you God?"
Did you listen carefully to contents of the transcription... as read by Mr. Ohnhouse to the court?
"Yes, I did."
And you understand that this is a record of your conversation with Marshal Belle?
"Well, it was ""Mr. Horn said this"" and ""Mr. Belle said that."""
I don't follow.
What I'm trying to get you to understand... is that that was a conversation between me and Joe Belle.
I understood that.
Do you?
"Yes, I do."
Do you consider it an accurate transcription of that conversation?
You'll have to ask that fellow that wrote it down.
I don't know how good he was at it.
Can you offer us an opinion?
What did you say your name was?
Walter Stoll.
I'm prosecuting you for murder.
"Well, Mr. Stoll, I was just a little drunk."
Why?
Stay there!
(GROANS)
CONSTABLE:
Monsignor.
We have your silver.
We caught this man red-handed.
He had the nerve to say you gave him this.
(SINGING) That is right
"But, my friend, you left so early"
Surely something slipped your mind
You forgot I gave these also
Would you leave the best behind?
"Messieurs, release him"
This man has spoken true
I commend you for your duty
Now God's blessing go with you
"But remember this, my brother"
See in this some higher plan
You must use this precious silver
To become an honest man
By the witness of the martyrs
By the passion and the blood
God has raised you out of darkness
I have saved your soul for
God
(SINGING) What have I done?
"Sweet Jesus, what have I done?"
Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run
Have I fallen so far And is the hour so late
That nothing remains but the cry of my hate?
The cries in the dark that nobody hears
Here where I stand at the turning of the years
"- Yeah, shoot."
- Do penises age?
"Ugh, if I had a nickel."
The short answer is yes.
"The long answer, much more complicated, you know, based on penis size or shape or whether there's been a traumatic event"
- or even just natural slope.
- A slope?
"Yeah, sometimes a penis can take a slope to the right or to the left."
"If you're lucky, it goes up."
"- Oh, okay."
- Why are we talking about this?
I think tonight Mark and I are gonna do it for the first time.
- What?
"- Yes, I mean, since we got back together."
What about all that hot and heavy stuff on the porch?
I thought you guys would've been all over each other.
- It's been a couple weeks.
"- No, no, no, no."
"He said, and I quote, ""I wanna do this, but I wanna take it slow."""
"- So, since then, there's just..."
- Right.
Been a lot of dry humping and starting meaningfully into each other's eyes.
"Sign me up for a good dry hump, right?"
Although there is a lot of chafing involved.
"But it's been 15 years since I've seen, you know, it, and I just don't know if it's gonna be, like,"
"""Oh, hello, old friend,"" or ""Oh, God, what happened to you?"""
"Well, I would be more worried about him seeing my body, you know, 15 years later."
"'Cause this is 40, right?"
Things are very different.
"God, I hadn't even thought about that."
- Oh.
"- Okay, if you saw... if you saw this coming towards you, what would you think about that?"
"If you can't drink their toasts and sing their songs, love Jeff Davis and hate Abe Lincoln until next Friday, you'll never reach Marietta."
I'm sorry.
Then you were exaggerating about Shiloh?
Yes.
"When I bring them good news, I'm doubly welcome."
The truth is bad enough.
Bad enough to stop General Mitchell's advance?
No.
"Shiloh can't stop him, but the devilish rains may."
"The trouble is, our movements and his have to dovetail."
[Andrews] He has an army and cannon to move.
"It's taking a chance, but we'll have to postpone our plans for one day."
I'll wait here for the rest of the men.
"You go into Chattanooga, and if you see any of the boys who didn't come this way, pass the word along."
[snoring]
What'd you do before the war?
Taught school a while.
How do you like this business?
There's one side of it I can't get used to.
Mr. Mclntyre... and the widow woman who fed us and gave us her bed...
"When I deceive 'em, I feel like the lowest snake that crawls."
I know.
"That soldier, he's supposed to be my enemy."
I'm supposed to hate him the way Campbell does.
But I don't think I can.
It's worse when a Southerner's your best friend.
Like old Jim Lindsay.
"Even picked out the girl I'm going to marry, 'cause she's Yankee-minded like me."
"Now that I've turned spy and have to fool him,"
I can hardly look him in the eye anymore.
How do you stand it?
I believe in a federal union.
"Yes, I just needed to..."
What you need is a way to persuade a court that you didn't kill your bloody wife.
That's what we all need.
And Alec can't do it for you on his own.
"I'll get my head round it tomorrow, it's not been easy, Fiona."
Everything's easy for you.
It's not for us.
What do you think all this is going to do to Simon and Lucy?
"You might not have produced your own children, but you could think about ours."
"James, we're all upset,"
Fiona doesn't mean it.
Yes I do.
"Fiona, we must stick together as a family, that's what matters, try and imagine how James is feeling."
Don't you ever get sick of apologizing for him?
Handbag didn't give us much.
"Plenty of bills, clothes mostly, a hotel."
There is a diary.
Any revelations?
"No, she didn't write down much."
A few initials.
"Sometimes Sheridan, along with the initials of a hotel, sometimes just the hotel's"
"BA, the Bedford Arms, a place near Oxford."
The Hotel bill's from there.
Sheridan says that's where they went.
"Yeah well, far enough away not to be noticed by anyone, I suppose."
Is that it?
The hotel bill's for a meal and a room.
The only odd thing is it's dated ten days before the murder.
Sheridan said he hadn't seen her for three weeks.
Right.
"All right, get round there and get it sorted."
Barr's lawyers are going to use Sheridan to cast doubt on our evidence.
DICAPRIO:
Nearly a quarter of a century of global climate talks have come to this pivotal moment in Paris.
195 countries saying they'll do everything in their power to change.
[French President].
[APPLAUSE]
DICAPRIO:
There's no doubt that this agreement is a massive step forward.
But does it go far enough?
REPORTER:
"The Paris Agreement calls for keeping climate warming to well below two degrees Celsius, while striving for 1.5."
REPORTER:
"There's no mention of a carbon tax, there's no mention of any penalties."
REPORTER:
There are no enforcement provisions.
DICAPRIO:
We just have to take it on faith that all these countries are gonna follow through with what they say.
How likely is that?
FOX NEWS:
This is an unattainable deal that Congress has already voted to reject.
INHOFF:
"The fact that we're going to have a 26‐28 percent reduction in CO2 emissions, that isn't gonna happen."

Julian Clary blames his mother for everything.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
"So, welcome."
"Welcome, one and all."
Julian.
Yes?
Your poor mother.
Why is that?
"Well, she's a great influence on my life, and a lovely woman, don't get me wrong."
ALAN LAUGHS
"And one of the rules of life that she's passed on to me is ""just say yes"", so this is how I've lived my life."
"And it means, as a consequence, you have a more interesting life than you might otherwise have."
"Except...in the early '90s, when I was a lot friskier than I am now,"
I was in a nightclub in New York called Cock...
LAUGHTER ..which...
Picture the scene.
"No, thanks."
"It doesn't mess around, Cock."
It gets straight to the point.
Yes.
Would you mind giving us a little description of what you were wearing?
It wasn't Lycra or anything.
"It wasn't, you know..."
I was just casual.
I was off-duty.
An off-duty comic.
"Yeah, and there was a man trying to pick me up in this club and I was having none of it - it wasn't to my liking."
"And then, I went to the toilet and there was a queue, and I was in the queue, and the man behind me tapped me on the shoulder and he said, ""Would you like some of this?"""
And he had a mirror with some white powder on it.
"Well, it was the early '90s, I was working in television,"
I was no stranger to cocaine refreshment.
Everyone was on it then - even the newsreaders.
What's so weird about that?
"But you see, they just sit face to face."
That's it.
"They don't say a word, for all this time."
And it's been one hour already.
"Grandma, see if this letter is all right to send to Hawaii."
"""hello there."
"Grandma is now inclined to go to Hawaii."""
This is just in diplomatic language.
"After all, we have to consider their feelings, too."
"""But before that, she says she wants to make sure about Suzujiro."
"""Even with the picture you sent, she doesn't remember..."
"""due to his age, and his looks after being ill."
"""If you have a picture taken when Suzujiro was young..."
"""please send it as soon as possible."
"""And ask Suzujiro to try and recall the names of his brothers."
"""If he recalls the names of Tetsutaro, Dozaburo and Jushiro..."
"""those names would match Grandma's memory."
"""And it wouId mean that Suzujiro is definitely the elder brother of Grandma."
"""In haste, respectfully...."""
That's a great idea.
"Tateo, you are something!"
"This is all right, isn't it?"
-Thank you for all your trouble.
-Then I'II send it right away tomorrow.
But it's possible that letter will cross father on the way.
"He's got a job, and it's about time for him to be coming back."
"No, he won't be coming back."
"There's the pineapple farm, even if he gets fired."
"That old lady who came to visit you today, what did she come here for?"
She came to chat with me.
But you didn't talk at all.
"Moroni, arrives behind schedule, interrupts to me, is entertained with the television... it is evident that for you the university you are a game, but it has a little at least of consideration for the others."
I have only put well telly.
"Now that we are all, before describing the operation,"
I want to make some considerations that seem fundamental to me.
"In this apencicectomía, you will be able to notice the perfect technique used by Prof. Ciotti."
Silence.
"There is no sound I know, it."
"Prof. Ciotti has elaborated during times this operating technique, until obtaining the perfection."
"The patient, has not been anaesthetised."
"Only locally, so that Prof. Ciotti it can have a frank and open relation throughout all the operation."
Bravo.
Bravo.
He has been great.
Go Ciotti.
The conditions of the patient were ideal.
"In the previous days, the patient has been fortified with a suitable one..."
Silence!
With adapting it cures vitaminic and anti inflammatory.
Silence!
Italia!
Silence?
You want to let speak to me!
Silence!
Silence!
Prof. Ciotti...
Professor!
"Silence, arrives the sound."
"Yes, bistoury, gauzes, mountain range.!"
Mountain range!
Mountain range!
Mountain range!
Mountain range!
"""'Cause it hurts, bitch!"""
"And they got this stupid app now, and it's called Snapchat."
I don't know if y'all have heard of this.
That is the dumbest app I have ever heard of.
"It's an app that allows you to take a picture and send it to somebody, and it disappears within a matter of seconds."
"It's kinda like this, ladies."
I sent you a picture of my dick.
"No, I didn't."
"I had a chick, right, and she was looking sexy, man."
She had on the thigh-high stockings.
"She had her breasts all out, and she was looking amazing."
"And she sent me this damn picture, but it disappeared."
I was like...
"I texted her back mad as hell like,"
"""What the hell did you send me this for?"
"""I can't jerk off in five seconds!"
"What the hell?"""
"You find somebody that can jerk off in five seconds, they need to be put in the Guinness Book of World Records, and they need to fun for the presidency next term, 'cause they can get shit done fast."
That's all I'm saying.
But not me.
I'm not a punk.
"I'm a survivor, man."
Give y'all some background.
"You know me, I used to work at Golden Corral."
"""Whoo,"" my ass."
That place is terrible.
"As soon as you walk in, it smell like diabetes, don't it?"
"You know it's bad when the only good thing you can say about your establishment is,"
"""Uh, we got a chocolate fountain."""
That's the best thing about it.
I seen a nigga put a steak in there.
"And he was just turning it like a rotisserie chicken, just..."
"- What you think we are, stupid?"
- Off course I think you're stupid.
That's the point.
You're gonna have enough trouble keepin' up with what I'm gonna tell you as it is.
"If you tuck it out too, we'll be wastin' everybody's time."
"You don't want mama's good wisdom goin' to waste, do you?"
"Heck, I'll be surprised if your arms are burnin' already, for keeping us at gun's points for a while."
"I mean, it's not like we're packed or anything, what do you afraid of?"
That better?
"- Alright, where was I?"
- You're gonna ask us something.
"Oh that's right, Thanks!"
Okay.
So... here it goes.
"My partner weighs in at about 95 pounds, right?"
"And together you guys are pushing half a ton, give or take, right?"
"So, did you need much help stuffing' her in that garbage can?"
Now...
"I usually don't talk to people like you in the first place, but... if I did that sort of things,"
I would say that you girls should have your own TV show.
"And that you should call that program ""The Adventure of Donnie's Bitches""."
"But like I said at the top,"
I usually don't talk to people like you.
Because talking' to people like you doesn't make much sense.
"What do you mean, ""People like us""?"
What the hell kind of people are we?
Dead ones.
What?
"Found some bullets, but now I might be out again."
How about you partner?
I think I'm hearin' somethin'.
Something like what?
Show me your first letter.
"For five points, let's see if you're correct."
"Yes, indeed,"
"Mendeleev, who created a periodic table of elements in 1869, Mendel after Gregor Mendel, father of genetics."
Tell me what was so brilliant about Mendeleev.
"Not only did he create a periodic table, but also..."
Is it the fact that he left gaps for unknown elements?
"Exactly, he was such a genius that he left gaps, he knew that there were things he didn't know, that there were properties he didn't know but he did actually suggest what those properties could be,"
he left five gaps and three of them later were discovered.
"Gallium, scandium, germanium."
There we go.
"Lutrophiles, over to you, you are looking for..."

Erotica.
Have you found it?
Yes.
That was so quick.
Your answer?
Eroica.
Eroica.
Show me your first letter.
Let's see if you're right.
"So, Eroica,"
"Beethoven's Third Symphony and Erotica, one of Madonna's more memorable albums, forgettable albums, what do we think?"
It does have that song about Bill Oddie.
Does it?
Yes.
"It's a mondegreen, it's not actually what it is..."
"""Bill Oddie, Bill Oddie, put your hands all over my body..."""
Oh...
THEY LAUGH
"Well done, you got the full five points for that, so, so far, Lutrophiles, you're in the lead with eight."
You should just get yourself checked
Do you understand what I'm going through right now?
What If I get tested positive?
Think before you fucking talk
Think more about others!
But it was wrong to hurt Miyu
Do you know the name Satsuki?
You mean from Totoro?
It's the name she wanted to give her kid
"A boy or a girl, it didn't matter"
"And her professional name is Satsuki, too"
She is using our special name for prostitution
That bitch
It was all a lie
Please tell us the name of her shop
What the fuck are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go meet her
Are you kidding me?
I'm serious
Stop it with your stupid friendship bullshit
She is just gonna get hurt
She'll just be annoyed
It doesn't concern you guys
Please tell us
Are you listening to what I'm saying?
Please tell us
Are you shitting me?
I feel like I'm gonna die
You're fucking pissing me off
Fucking assholes
You guys have no idea what I'm going through
Please tell us
-Of course.
The items you pick out to tell her will be very easy to understand.
"Thank you, Rosa, from me and my wife."
Thank you.
"If I were your wife, I'd cut your heart out."
Good morning.
"Thank you for speaking to me, darling."
-May I tell you what happened?
-If you want to.
"Well, after we finished work, it was early, so I dropped in at the Del Rio for a drink."
"Like an idiot, I stayed too long, and so as punishment I suppose,"
"I got into a rumpus with a drunk, and got knocked cold."
But what was the fight about?
What's a fight ever about?
Nothing.
"Anyway, I was stretched out on the sidewalk with policemen and photographers rushing at me, and suddenly, I was rescued."
"A nice little Italian girl I'd met inside, hustled me into a cab and took me home to her grandmother."
"Well, they kept at me with cold towels and hot coffee until I snapped out of it."
"That's it, Jess."
"I know it sounds improbable, but it's true."
-Do you believe me?
"-Yes, Bran."
But wasn't that an amazingly kind thing for that girl to do?
A girl who'd just met you.
That's the best part of the story.
Rosa's a model at Marianne's.
"She's seen you there, and admired you."
She didn't want me to get into a mess that might upset you.
"Incidentally, she was very disapproving of me for being out alone."
She said she'd cut my heart out if she were you.
You wouldn't be any good to me without a heart.
You wouldn't be able to love me.
Alright...
Bao and his men came to rob the prisoner today
"Although they didn't gain anything, we lost quite a number of men and the kungfu expert like Golden Demon"
I think they will try again
"Brother Man, they'll just die for nothing"
Prince Kang is confined here
How can they save him?
Right.
There's only one way up hill and it is also where the Jin troops camp
Hundreds of thousands of Sung soldiers... still won't be able to come through
So how can these people do it?
"However, the cliff at the back is left unguarded"
There?
Unless it's a bird
If there's someone with great lifting skill
Speaking of people with great lifting skill
I know one
Yian Luyan?
Yes
Do you know where he is?
"Yes, he's at the Xinlung Town"
We need some help here
It would be nice if he's here
Only if he agrees to come
"If he doesn't, he may be used by the enemy"
You know what should be done?
Yes
I'm leaving and will be back soon
The bridge is disintegrating and in bad shape
Unless someone is lighter than this stone otherwise anyone who comes this way... will surely die
These are good
Sir...
he fans were really hard-core and they would just vote loads and loads of times.
One Direction.
One Direction.
One Direction.
One Direction.
What's happening?
've never seen a band cause so much hysteria so early in their career.
"Leading up to the final  thought ""f 'm gonna bet  on any of these three  finalists these are the ones 'm gonna bet on. """
he second act still in the final is:
"I don't think we're gonna win, but I really, really want to win."
Just hoping for it.
Rebecca.
But they lost.
We were gutted.
"Boys, how's this experience been for you?"
What have been the highlights?
It's been absolutely incredible.
hat could have been the end of the road.
I think that was the thing we were most worried about because we just had such a great time on he X Factor and being together as a band.
"Zayn, what's gonna happen to One Direction now?"
We're definitely gonna stay together.
-This isn't the Iast of One Direction.
-Ladies and gentlemen give it up for One Direction.
Unbeknown to me  once they left the show it was all about the fans.
Literally from the second it finished the fans made it their mission that One Direction were gonna become the biggest band in the world.
This is why we have the best fans in the world.
I'm gonna prove it right now.
Proof.
-They're just amazing.
-They're amazing.
They can always make fans laugh.
They make me feel so happy.
Okay....
I'm gonna go with Dr. Cox on this one.
"That's a rookie move, and you hate to see it."
You always side with the wife even if she's got a full-blown case of the crazies.
Turk!
We're gonna have kids soon.
We're supposed to be a team!
That means you occasionally have to listen to me and believe in my opinion!
"Like, what if we have a daughter and she wants to get her ears pierced?"
Irrelevant.
We're not having a daughter.
Okay.
"What if we have a son and he wants to take dance class, even though all his friends are playing football?"
He can dance if he wants to....
He can leave his friends behind....
"""'Cause his friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine!"""
"So then I said, ""What if our son wants to take dance class instead of play football with his friends?"""
"and Turk ran off singing ""Safety Dance."""
"Carla, didn't you learn your lesson that time you told him the commissar was in town?"
Yeah....
Ooh!
Someone's leaving!
We saw it first!
"Jordan, here's the plan:"
I'm gonna go ahead and cram an entire evening's worth of drinking into the next five minutes.
"Now, you just make sure not to engage them."
Be particularly aware of the blonde talky one
I've worked with her before she has no off button.
"If money is so tight, why not have Jake move in with you?"
Who's Jake?
Jordan!
...
"Johnnie has been doing his best to fix the engine, but he is getting weaker by the minute."
"And we all know when the sun comes up, the German planes will be back."
- Oh!
"No one wants to be here, but we have a hole in this picture."
"A stranded boat, a broken propeller, no one to fix it, and no Tom Buckley."
"- Well, maybe we could reshoot."
- Who with?
"Ambrose Hilliard is still in plaster,"
"Wyndham Best's in the North Atlantic, and Carl Lundbeck is back with the RAF."
Could one of the Frenchies do it?
"Come to our rescue, same way we came to theirs?"
It doesn't seem right morale-wise.
"We could, uh, pan across the faces of the soldiers and never actually see who fixes..."
"The work's good, Mrs. Cole."
None of them could have done any better.
You're mustard these days.
Rose could do it.
Rose could free the propeller.
"Cerberus, sit."
Rugelach...
- and kogel mogel.
- Mmm-hmm.
To build you up in time for the premiere.
You'll be interested to learn I received several unexpected propositions this week.
- How delightful for you.
"Of course, I do not speak of erotic advances."
These were professional inquiries regarding your availability.
"You will be kind enough to read, give your opinion."
The doctors tell me you are to be discharged in a few days.
I cannot see you will be in a condition to look after yourself.
I...
I therefore propose that we should ready a room in the apartment for your use.
The rule is...
So we stocked it in the two shops we definitely knew were chart-tracking on that particular month.
"And you can't buy them within 15 minutes of each other, because in the '80s, bands used to buy hundreds of their own singles."
They'd go in and buy 20s.
So now you have to buy individual copies.
"They have to be 15 minutes apart and the walk from one record shop to the other was an eight-minute walk, so myself and my friend Brian spent two days walking backwards and they'd go, ""Oh, you again"""
"and we'd be like,"
"""Can I have another copy of Orange by David O'Doherty?"""
Did you not at least try to disguise yourself with a variety of hats and sun visors?
Dresses and things.
A nun.
"""I'll have one of those!"""
"Did it work, then?"
"Yeah, we bought 196 copies and..."
You idiot!
It didn't get to 27.
It got to 30.
It got to number 30.
"30 is better, though."
"Yeah, 30's perfectly good."
So I have had a hit single that - brackets - that I bought all the copies of myself.
What's the chorus?
"Well, Grace..."
Sing me the chorus.
# She was orange Like a truck made by Tonka
# Orange Like an employee of Willy Wonka
"# Orange, like a sport and leisure question from Trivial Pursuit"
"# Orange, like Garfield... #"
You just think of orange things.
Is it on iTunes?
There's a video for it.
Could we make it a Number 1 hit so you'll never be forgotten?
A lot of things happen in the film.
But what's important is that after years
of remorse and study
Amparo finds the address of Alfredo's mother.
And she turns up there.
"""Hotel Youkali, Room Number 15."""
"- Sleep, my love."
- What if I squash you when I move?
And Alfredo
stays inside her... forever.
A MONTH LATER
"Come on, put your hands right."
That's it.
It's so cool here.
It's wonderful!
"It's lovely out on the terrace, isn't it?"
"And Lydia likes being out on the terrace, don't you, Lydia?"
"You heard her, she loves it."
Look at them.
It's like they were talking about us.
What do you think they'd talk about?
Women tell each other everything.
Lydia would tell her it's two months today since she was gored.
"Benjamin and Angela, do you come here of your own free will to be united in matrimony?"
"Yes, we do."
"That being so, as you wish to be united in holy matrimony, join hands and declare your consent before God and His Church."
"I, Angela, take you, Benjamin, as my husband, and I give myself to you,"
"and I promise to be faithful to you, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, all the days of my life."
"May the Lord, who caused this love to grow in you, confirm this mutual consent you have stated before His Church."
"What God has joined together, let no man pull asunder."
What are you doing here?
We were to meet at the hotel.
Yeah.
"Yeah, put those on."
Excuse me?
"Uh, he said put them on."
Who the hell you guys think you are?
What did Dawkins offer you to help him escape from prison today?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Billy, so help me God, you answer incorrectly one more time,"
I'm gonna put those scrubs on you myself and then drop you in general population.
How long you think you'll last there?
You can't do that.
This here says I can.
"Dawkins said that if I helped him, he'd give me 50 grand."
And you believed him?
"He arranged for $10,000 to be wired into my account."
He told me it was everything he had.
I'd get the rest as soon as he got out.
Where'd he say the rest of the money was coming from?
I don't know.
"All he told me was that there was a lot of it waiting for him on the outside, but in order to get it, he needed to get out today."
I'm Detective Williams;
this is Commander McGarrett.
We hear you and Walton Dawkins were neighbors.
"Yeah, four and a half years."
Warden says you guys used to be pretty tight.
"Well, in the non-Biblical sense, if you dig what I'm saying."
So what happened?
Why the beef?
I didn't appreciate him trying to gut me with a shiv last week.
He said I was asking too many questions.
Questions have anything to do with why he bounced today?
"You know, it's possible I may have some pertinent information, but, uh, you gonna have to play me for it."

I'm playing last you're busy right?
I'll go of course I'll go

Looks like the foot was wrapped in it.
"Now I've heard of re-gifting, but this is pushing it."
Danny and Hawkes just found an arm in a trash bin a couple blocks away.
That looks to be male Caucasian.
Same as the foot that Mac found.
"Wrapping paper's a match, too."

Degree of decomp puts the time of death between 6:00 and 9:00 last night.

Maybe the killer thought little pieces would be easier to dispose of.
There is a certain logic.
Any idea what he used to cut him up?
Haven't seen this particular wound pattern before.
"There's lateral movement at the incision, bordered by these jagged punctures."
Maybe I can give you a hand.
Okay.

Vince was the head wrestling coach at Hillridge High for eight years.
Five championships.
Are you positive it's really him?
I mean...
"I mean, how can you be sure?"
Maybe there's been some kind of mix-up.
We've identified him by his fingerprints.
Every employee in the school system has them on file.
It's been a while?
Yeah.
"No, no, no!"
"I'm 907, and look at me!"
"I don't get older, I just change."
"You get older, I don't, and this can't ever work."
Oh!
"Aw, you are sweet, Doctor, but I really wasn't suggesting anything quite so..."
long-term.
But you're human!
You're Amy!
You're getting married in the morning!
In the morning.
Doctor?
"She is getting married to one of the sweetest, nicest guys in the world the next day and she's coming on to an alien."
That's not cool.
That's not cool at all.
"I was very excited about that scene, just because why not get a jump on the Doctor, see what that's like, before you get married?"
"Although the Doctor is always very sexy, you kind of never really think of him that way, so when Amy actually jumped him,"
"I was like ""this is inappropriate, Amy."
"""What are you doing?"
"It's the Doctor,"" you know?"
"Of course, the other half of my brain was extremely jealous."
"In the modern era, ""Doctor Who"" has been an interesting show for female characters."
I'm your daughter.
These people end up solving things and outsmarting the Doctor and helping the Doctor.
But I always took you where you needed to go.
They have their vulnerabilities.
I love you.
"And, perhaps, it's because of those vulnerabilities that Doctor Who can experience human emotions a bit more."
"Oh, Donna Noble, I am so sorry."
"I think it's a really good thing this show has done throughout time, for female characters on TV."
"So it has to be perfect, you see."
It has to be perfect.
It can't be impatient.
It's timeless.
I wanted to ask you.
Do you think...
did anybody know that Lou had three families all at once?
"No, I didn't."
"As a matter of fact, for years I didn't know Lou was married."
- Really?
- Yeah.
That was part of his mystery.
My mother and I lived on the outskirts of Philadelphia at the end of a secluded road.
"Lou would visit every once in a while, mostly at night."
We never knew quite when it would be.
He'd call at the last minute and say he was on his way.
My mother would frantically whip up a five-course meal and have a Martini in a frozen glass waiting for him.
"I got to stay up late, and Lou would tell me wonderful stories about India and elephants and tigers."
"In the middle of the night, we'd all bundle into the car and drive him back downtown."
I'd lie in the backseat.
We were all silent.
"When I asked my mother why we couldn't all live together, she explained that his wife wouldn't give him a divorce."
Why didn't he just run away?
We'd stop at the end of Clinton Street and let him out.
"He'd walk down the block and disappear into the dark house, his wife's house."
Her name was Esther.
"They had a daughter named Sue, who was 20 years older than me."
"When I was in first grade,"
"I found out I had another half sister, Alex."
Her mother was a lady named Anne.
Then there was my mother and me.
Lou was 61 when I was born.
Felt so bad.
"But, Pete, you were a trouper, though."
"Yeah, you lasted a long time, considering."
I made it look...
I puked with authority.
- I thought it was directorial.
- I thought it was good.
"Was it projectile, like that time when we put that hose up next to my face?"
"If you look carefully at the windshield of the Yugo, I did hit it."
"- No, stop."
"- Pete, tell me what..."
- We should talk about this.
"- That look you tell me to talk about all the time, now you say it."
"This is one of my favorite moments, you're looking at each other with that song before the moment's broken by Mike's voice in that CD."
But you were getting to know each other.
This was day six of shooting.
Is that right?
You have an incredible track of it all.
I can't believe you know what day is what.
- Yeah.
- Sorry to interrupt.
I wanna hear what you were gonna say about the look and stuff.
"So you guys were still getting to know each other and so, what I did was I asked Kat, who was off camera, to..."
"I didn't tell you about this, Mike but I asked Kat to put her hands on your legs but I asked Kat to put her hands on your legs and tell her how adorable she thought you were in Superbad."
- Did you put your hands on my leg?
- I can't remember.
I couldn't tell if you did.
I assumed you did because you did the rest of it.
- I couldn't tell where your hands were.
- I probably poked it.
- I don't wanna know.
- Didn't know where your hands were?

"Charlestown, 1978."
"We should have lost hope when the steel mill closed down, but that was the year our beloved Chiefs won the Federal Cup, led by the infamous Hanson Brothers."
"Their aggressive style of hockey brought passion to the team, hope to the town."
"Metropolis had its Superman, Gotham City had its Batman, and Charlestown had the Hansons."
"And like everyone, though, eventually, they disappeared."
"Bounced, bolted, vanished, deep-sixed."
"But this, my friend, is the story of how they were found again, resurrected and transformed, together with a group of ragtag orphans."
It was their task to defend Charlestown against a heinous villain like none other.
"A real estate developer, a devil in a black pantsuit who hornswoggled me out of my own town."
"Her name, Bernie Frazier."
"Well, 30 years later and your vision has finally come true, Mayor Kenneth."
This wasn't my vision.
"Another done deal, done right."
- Go ahead.

And just because no one ever wants to try with you doesn't give you the right to tell me how to run my associates!
"I got an offer for more money than I'll see my whole life, and you want me to turn it down based on a feeling that whatever happened to Chris happened to other people?"
You're dating your therapist.
"I don't need a lecture from you, Louis."
Does Donna have any idea about the two of you?
"No, she doesn't, and for right now, I'd like to keep it that way."
"Harvey, is there something that you're not telling me?"
'Cause it seems like you've been different lately.
"We win this, you're gonna be Andy Dufresne sitting on a beach in Mexico with a bank account full of cash."
I already make a nice living in here.
I was thinking maybe some of that money might go to your daughter.
I wasn't lying about working a case with Oliver.
I just didn't tell you which one.
- The prison one?
- Yeah.

I've been thinking about what you said to me last night.
"Mike, I didn't mean to be so harsh."
"No, you were right."
My word does mean everything to me... which is why I'm gonna keep helping Oliver.

"When I gave my word to Harvey, I meant it."
"But before that, I gave my word to Oscar Reyes."

"He did, and I'm here to ask why you're bringing it now."
Because the things you're alleging he said...

Wow.
"I guess it's lawyer first, friend second."
That's not fair.
I'm only here because we're friends.
And because you wanted to convince me to forget that Pearson Specter Litt ruined my career.
"Stephanie, I know you got fired, but... this lawsuit could destroy Louis."
Let me get this straight.

And also of course the lyrical roles.
"Rodolfo in ""Bohéme,"" who sits well in my voice, with my radiant high C"
I'd have sung many of the lyrical roles because of my lovely piano.
But with the size of my voice I could've sung the in-between roles.
Perhaps I'd have sung Wagner.

The Hitler portrait behind me was a wedding gift from the guys at work and my buddies.

"'Wife in spirit', eh."
"Well, up to today we were a married couple."
You leave me no choice.
The reason I'm here is because Shinako and Takao are here.
Up today I've been living for them.
You've been possessed by Takehara.
"If you had married him twenty years ago, you'd be genbetsu."
"Shinako, Takao I want you to listen."
"Up to now, you've had things pretty good by selling the things we've had."
Mother did what she wanted and did her ballet.
"Shinako, you danced, too."
"Takao, you've never had to worry about anything."
You say that Mother lived for you.
"Well, yourethechildren of an extravagant mother."
"But all this time I have been living a spiritually impoverished life, a miserable life."
You three have brought up a miserable father.
Don't say that.
I can't respect you if you say that.
No one respects anyone else here.
"We're not a family, just four people."
"You say such mean things, Father."
"You don't have the slightest idea of how much Mother has tried to love you, do you?"
"Mother, you must hate me because you think I was watching you for Father."
"But really, all I wanted was for you and Father to get along."
What father says is true: everyone in this family lives their own life.
The ship is sinking and all of us are just trying to save ourselves.
"Takao, your father is a pitiful person."
I know.
Take care of him.
Mother...
"Shinako, take care of your father."
You can live even if your parents don't love each other.
- Do you think I'll pass for a Helot?
- No problem.
"When Helotrix was first settled, the old Stock Equalization Act was still in force."
Every Earth race had to be represented.
I didn't know Helots were originally from Earth.
Everyone came from Earth originally.
That's a well-known fact.
"It's a well-known opinion, actually."
- Most well-known facts are.
- But not in this case.
Helotrix is one of the oldest colonies and the first to gain independence from the empire.
Until the Federation grabbed it back.
"- Come on, Dayna."
- Right.
That idiot's looking forward to it.
He can't wait to go snooping around Helotrix.
"He's good material, is Tarrant."
One of the best.
He's not the man for the job.
Tarrant has about as much subtlety as a Tarzian Warg Strangler.
"All I'm saying is Tarrant's going to walk straight into trouble, and get himself killed or captured."
"If he's dead, he can't talk."
"But if the Federation find out we're hanging around, we won't stand a chance."
Not in this ship.
At least in the Liberator we could always outrun them.
"Vila, if the Federation do have some new weapon, the Helots will know all about it."
All Tarrant has to do is ask a few questions in the right places.
Even your Tarzian Warg Strangler might manage that.
You think so?
"Well, you better give him a list of questions and then a map to find the right places."
"Doesn't have much time for Tarrant, does he?"
"Oh, well, Tarrant is brave, young, handsome."
- Right here.
Nothing's as dull as a Labor Day speech.
"I didn't bring you here to explain how management and labor must pull together, not in opposite directions."
You've got living proof of it in our prosperity.
And there's more to come.
Meet me halfway and you'll never be unemployed as long as men and women don't go back to wearing fig leaves.
"And if they did, I'll bet we'd be in the fig-leaf business sooner than anybody east of the Alleghenies."
"Now aside from this celebration, this is a proud moment of my life."
Tomorrow my son Rodney leaves for Harvard.
Let's get the fun started and give him a sendoff!
End of speech.
Just beside myself.
"First Paul goes, and then Lucas."
I don't know if Selena and me can keep working and take care of Joey.
- You'll just have to keep trying.
- I've been trying all my life.
"With a husband drunk all the time and a grown girl dressing and undressing in front of him, and him staring at her all the time staring at her and thinking... ."
"- Oh, Nellie."
- We all have our problems.
- Staring at her staring at her.
...and staring at her.
Hello.
Hello.
What are you doing out here by yourself?
I'm not used to being at home with Nellie.
She has too many problems.
"As for the outing, I've seen them all."
"Let's go for a drive, try to find something interesting to do far away from Peyton Place."
Now you're beginning to think like a true suspicious native.
All right.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!
When I had some real problems...
I couldn't go to none of them about it.
"You know, I was having some problems with Catherine's family and my family... and I said, you know, ""Coach Pingatore, their family's been getting on me about... you know, I'm not doing this, and I'm not doing that. """
And the only thing Coach Pingatore could say is...
"""Write 'em off. """
That was all he told me.
"And I was, like, ""What kind of advice is that?"""
"Well, how's it feel to be finishing?"
"Uh, I mean-"
"Now, don't say anything you don't mean, William."
"I mean, I'm serious, Coach."
I enjoyed my four years.
"I mean, we had our run-ins, and, uh -"
- Who had run-ins?
- Me and you.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Like that time you made me run 75 stairs.
- I never f-
- You never forgot that.
Never.
"See,you should have been happy and enthusiastic about doing your punishment."
"But someday you're gonna learn that, uh... everything that was done was for your benefit."
"So that you can come back four years from now and say, ""Coach,you were right."
"""Everything that happened at St. Joe's helped me a lot... and as a result I got a degree. '"""
That's what I'm hoping for.
"I'm going into communication... so when you start asking for a donation, I'll know the right way to turn you down."
I'm sure you'll never turn us down.
Ah.
I never really felt that he bought into the system.
he was never convinced what he was doing was the right thing to do.
But overall he had a good career- not a great career.
I met their spokesman.
They gave me this.
What does the NTSB say about this?
The NTSB isn't getting involved.
Neither is the FAA.
They've all washed their hands of it.
"The airline is registered in the Virgin Islands, the tour operator in the Caymans."
The crew is from Russia.
They still don't know if the plane crashed in Haiti or the Dominican Republic.
Every day it's a different story.
But the plane was due to land here in the US?
Seems like everyone forgot that.
The FAA isn't going to go poking its nose in.
"Too much work, too much hassle, too much everything."
Nathan?
I don't like the smell of it.
"If the FAA won't get involved, that means a lawsuit like this could drag on for years."
That means hundreds of thousands of dollars.
And it means we can forget about the Hague Protocol.
I don't like it.
"Excuse me, since when are we afraid of cases that drag on for years?"
These people are going to get fucked over on the pretext that no convention...
It was the same shit in Unterlinguen.
In Kinshasa too.
A judge will show up with his calculator and say what?
"""All right, let's imagine some two-year-old kid"
"""who has lost his mother."
"""We'll say she'd have devoted how much of her time to him, per day?"""
- Michael?
"- Three hours, tops."
That's a good mother.
"Up until the age of 18, which gives us three hours a day, times 365 days, times $8 an hour, plus the usual interest... that totals a little less than $100,000 at best."
I'll always love you.
To stop her suffering Aifredo left.
"He abandoned Madrid and went back to his mother whom he hadn't seen in 10 years, because she was terrible."
He hadn't even told Amparo where she lived.
Alot of things happen in the film.
But what's important is that after years of remorse and study
Amparo finds the address of Aifredo's mother.
And she turns up there.
"Hotel Youkali, Room No 15."
"Sleep, my love."
What if I squash you when I move?
And Aif redo
stays inside her... forever.
A MONTH LATER
"Come on, put your hands right."
That's it.
It's so cool here.
It's wonderful!
"It's lovely out on the terrace, isn't it?"
"And Lydia likes being out on the terrace, don't you, Lydia?"
"You heard her, she loves it."
Look at them.
It's like they were talking about us.
What do you think they'd talk about?
Women tell each other everything.
Lydia would tell her it's two months today since she was gored.
"Benjamin and Angela, do you come here of your own free will to be united in matrimony?"
"Yes, we do."
"That being so, as you wish to be united in holy matrimony, join hands and declare your consent before God and His Church."
"I, Angela, take you, Benjamin, as my husband, and I give myself to you, and I promise to be faithful to you, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health,"
all the days of my life.
"May the Lord, who caused this love to grow in you, confirm this mutual consent you have stated before His Church."
Was it my aunt Crystal who complained?
"Um, Georgie, I can't answer that."
I bet it was...
because she's mad at Lou and Peter because they didn't let her stay and get to know me.
"You know, I haven't seen her since I was two, and I don't even remember her."
"But my brother does, and he says that she wasn't very nice, and my mom didn't like her and she was a bad influence on us."
I don't really need to know the whole history.
You do!
"You need to know my aunt just as much as you need to know me because she's the one who's accusing my mom and dad of being bad parents, and it's a lie!"
You're supposed to be helping us.
You're supposed to be helping me.
"- Okay, so..."
- So what's the next step here?
"Um, I'm afraid I have to review the case further."
I'll be in touch.
Please stay in town.
- That's my best offer.
- Fair enough.
Not as many takers as we'd hoped.
"Well, rumour has it that Matt's been telling people the sale was cancelled."
- Look at this one.
"- No, I'm not sure about him."
"This is a really nice, young colt, okay?"
He was easily gentled.
"It's gonna some time to gain his confidence, but he's a hundred percent sound."
Good boy.
"Now if I can do this in a day, imagine what you can do with more time."
"Now if anyone is interested, please go see Matt and place your bid."
Why hasn't she called?
"You know, and Clint... picked the worst possible time to be on vacation."
"Of course, I've left more messages, but they're probably all going to Abby."
"Don't go over Abby's head, okay?"
Think of it like the WWE.
"Except it'll really be me kicking yo bitch ass every night, you punk-ass faggot-ass bitch!"
"What you guys do together is like watching the Harlem Globetrotters beat the Washington Generals, except it's an old, black man kicking another old, black man's ass!"
I don't want to do this!
Why do I have to keep fighting this man?
I killed him already!
"Granddad, you got to take all that anger you've been feeling and hold onto it real tight!"
"Focus on it, and so on fight night in two weeks, that's how you're gonna find the strength to beat this nigga in front of the whole world!"
Yeah.
He made you look like a punk in front of everybody!
"Now he living it up, getting money."
He's on TV.
I seen him on TMZ.
"Got some bad bitches, too..."
Bad ones.
We'd like to thank tonight's sponsors...
chicken and sugar water!
"Man, is that that new Stinkmeaner sketch comedy show on TBS?"
That nigga's everywhere!
"Take that rage, put it in your fists, granddad."
"Riley, you notice anything different about granddad?"
Hell yeah!
I'm noticing a lot different about granddad!
"He ain't never gonna get his ass beat again, and it's all because of me!"
"I told him to take all that hate, hold onto it!"
Stupid politicians are stupid.
"Everybody's fucking stupid, God damn it."
What... what... what is this shit here?
What is this... a fucking cooking show?
He keeps bumping into things.
"When he's not working out, this is all he does."
"Fuck, it's all a bunch of bullshit anyway."
Eight for 8:30.
"The food, the fine wine, the... the little chocolatey, minty thingies."
- Who's coming?
- Some close personal friends.
"Oh, dear."
The man from the dirty mag shop and wino Bill.
Again.
"You really are insanely jealous, aren't you, Edward?"
"I keep forgetting you're not in the biz, are you?"
The huge galaxy of showbiz stars are all brothers and sisters to me.
"Tarby, for instance, is bound to accept."
Especially after the brilliant invitations I sent out.
"""The years and the tears."
"""Celebrate Richie Rich's ten fabulous years of success. """
How sad.
From third dummy on Are You Being Served?
To his very own carpet ad.
I am not sitting at the same table as Tarby and that's that.
"No, Eddie, no, no."
We're talking about Jimmy Tarbuck.
The cheeky chap from the 'pool.
Everybody's pal.
The gap-toothed Scouser with a twinkle and a smile for every Englishman.
"Look, if there's one thing I hate in British entertainment more than you, it's that vast army of ex-stand-up comics who did one half-funny gag on Sunday Night At The London Palladium and have made a fortune doing game shows ever since."
"""Oh, good evening, and your name is Cynthia"
"""and you'd like me to patronise and humiliate you"
"""on the off chance of winning a teasmade. """
Cheeky chappies?
"Complete and utter bastards, if you ask me."
"Well, I don't think anyone will be asking you, will they?"
Tarby is just a simple jester.
An honest broker from the bank of smiles.
"Dad, Judy's in serious trouble."
I have the results of the tests.
Her blood pressure is 80 over 120.
Her respiration rate is 7 a minute.
"And the EKG, well, shows a very decreased rate."
"The EEG... well, that's all spread out."
"Dad, you've gotta come back and take care of Judy."
"Paula, your eyes must be playing tricks on you."
"Why, those readings would mean that Judy must've been under tremendous strain for quite a while."
"Dad, I'm worried about Judy."
She fell asleep before I could give her a sedative.
"Oh, well, honey, I don't think there's anything to worry about."
"You know, very often after a traumatic experience such as a leopard attack an animal will fall into a deep sleep."
"No, I think she'll be fine just as soon as she wakes up."
(PAULA):
"Well, I hope so."
How's the search for Sally coming?
"Well, Hedley and I are on the outskirts of Watuba village."
Hold on a second.
Here he comes now.
"The chief said he heard drums from the Cayuba Gorge section saying that a giant silver bird with red, white, and blue feathers"
- came out of the sky.
"- Hey, Paula, did ya hear that?"
"Well, that could be the spaceship with the NASA parachute."
"Yes, we're gonna go check it out."
"Oh, Dad, I haven't been able to get in touch with Jack or Mike."
They seem to be out of my range.
Don't you think you and Hedley should go looking for them?
"Oh, don't worry, honey, they can take care of themselves in any situation."
"Everything's gonna be all right, Sally."
All right.
"Now then, Sally, did this little interruption upset you?"
"Oh, we haven't heard that one, cos we call them Reg Grundies - undies."
"Oh, there you are, you see."
Perfect.
Here's a quite interesting thing about rhyming slang.
"I heard someone in a London market talking and saying, ""I'm not Listerine."" And I said to him, ""What do you mean, Listerine?"""
And Listerine is an example of a sort of...
"a rhyming slang that's moved on one, because an American in rhyming slang is often called a septic, short for septic tank."
Yank.
Which you've probably heard.
"So if you don't like Americans, you are antiseptic."
"And if you're antiseptic, you're Listerine."
"- (Julia) Oh, I like it!"
- (Stephen) See?
Listerine.
There you are.
"So, in the same way, while we're on the subject, you can have a rubber Gregory."
- (Julia) I love it.
- Do you know what it is?
A peck.
Gregory Peck?
Rubber neck.
That would work as a rubber neck.
It's a cheque that bounces.
"A Gregory Peck is a cheque and so if your cheque bounces - in other words, returned by the bank - it's a rubber... (Cockney accent) ""He gave me a rubber Gregory."""
Do you like my earthy street London accent there?
- He sounds like such an idiot.
- Yeah.
"There we are, ladies and gentlemen."
"In the right hands, even a meaningless two-syllable name can be made as frisky as a gay ferret in a pink blender."
I leave you with one last Alan.
"Alan Bennett, who when asked if he was gay, replied wearily:"
"(as Alan Bennett) ""That's a bit like asking a man crawling across the Sahara whether he would prefer Perrier or Malvern water""."
"You had just been admitted to the Bar Association, and I was playing in What Every Woman Knows."
"-Your first season on Broadway, wasn't it?"
"-Yes, it was."
-The town went wild about her.
-Thanks to you.
Horace was my sponsor.
"There was no café society in those days, only Society with a capital ""S"", and its doors weren't open to a young actress."
But Horace pushed them open.
"It wasn't too difficult, my dear."
"Horace, I'll never understand why you let her get away from you."
"She ran too fast, right into Matt Kernan."
"Why did you choose father, darling?"
Because we came from the same neighborhood.
"Because we were comfortable together, right from the very beginning."
It's taken me 20 years to get comfortable with Horace.
"By that time, we were much too good friends to consider being anything else."
"Well, Jess, I'm just as handsome, and blue-blooded, and glamorous as Horace."
-Aren't you comfortable with me?
"-At the moment, no."
"Well, in that case, I shall leave you for Frank Belney."
"Darling, would you like to stay?"
I can pick you up on the way back.
"Why don't you, dear?"
I'm terrified of being left alone with Horace.
He's been wearing that family-lawyer face all evening.
"And I have a speech to go with it, my dear."
"It begins, ""Nora, as your legal adviser, I cannot approve certain extravagances."""
See?
I'm a little tired.
I'm afraid you'll have to face Horace alone.
"Well, I shall ignore him."
It's been the best evening of the week as always.
I'm sure of it.
Why's that?
"Grandma doesn't like America, and it's only natural."
"After all, Grandpa was killed by the atomic bomb."
I think he's right.
"You see, none of us and none of our parents know about war."
As for the atomic bomb....
"Sure, we've all heard about it."
But it meant nothing more than a sort of little scary fairy tale.
We never really understood the feelings of the people... who had the atom bomb dropped over their heads.
We never stopped to think.
Look at my mother.
"Just by being told that there's a rich relative in Hawaii, she got excited."
Isn't it disgusting?
My father's no different.
He didn't even spend time with Grandma.
He took off for Hawaii in a hurry.
Big Sis!
"Here, eat these."
I'm really pleased... that you are so concerned about me.
I'm very grateful.
"But then, it was a Iong time ago when I felt bitter about America."
It's been more than 45 years since Grandpa died.
"Now, I don't particularly like... or dislike America."
It's all because of war.
War is to blame.
During the war many Japanese died... and many Americans also died.
Listen... because of a man called Suzujiro or whatever...
I don't think it's right for you to talk badly about your parents.
"I was the one who sort of drove them to go off to Hawaii... for my own joy of having the four of you here, all to myself, while they're gone."
"Anyway, I want all of you to stay here during summer vacation."
The rich man in Hawaii means nothing to me.
-Not-not in slate.
"I definitely agree with that, yeah."
"So, it could have been a lot deeper."
"Maybe there was a wood hatch, and then it rotted away, and that's what made it slump all of a sudden."
"Jack, we can ""what if"" till the cows come home."
Exactly.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
-That's exactly what I was gonna ask.
-No.
No.
that'sstrange.
"Yes, it is strange."
"Onthewesternside of the island,"
"Rick,Marty and members of the team have invited area archaeologist Laird Niven tohelpin theirinvestigation of a strange, square-shapedhatch."
"Ifthehatchcan be identified as man-made, andofancientorigin, thenthebrothersmay have found another important clue tohelpthemsolve the Oak Island mystery."
It does seem like rocks have been removed.
That's been cut.
"That's not natural, and this..."
this is pretty loose fill.
"It keeps going for a bit, you can see."
"You... so, you think it goes off to the side?"
At least for a little bit.
Thethingwe obviously want it to be is the entrance to a tunnel.
Andtherewere some evidence of that.
"Hethoughtthreeofthesides  were solid, but on... at least on one side, he thought it might go off, somewhat."
It warrants further investigation.
"So, where should we go?"
Who should we notify?
How do we do this?
"Well, if I was to investigate it as an archaeologist,"
"I'd get a permit, probably remove"
-some of these small trees.
You know what?
I'm going to trust my flak jacket.
We got our last known whereabouts on Mr. invincible?

"Welcome to the Portland governor, sir."
Where's Marquesa?
I found a lot more than him.
[Tense music]
I've got something very special for you.
[Cat meows]
Why don't you come out and see your new home?
That's a good girl.
Marquesa was tied to a jewelry store robbery here in Portland 2 1/2 months ago.
"The owner, Sam Bertram, was killed during the robbery."
"Now after that, Marquesa killed a police officer, gained access to the precinct using his uniform in an attempt to get at a police captain."
That's where I became intrigued.
I couldn't figure out why Marquesa went after a police captain after he pulled off a heist.
So I did a little more digging on your behalf.
And that's when I found out...
There were three gold coins discovered in that jeweler's stomach the night he was killed.
Now I got all this from the coroner's report.
How did you get this report?
"'Cause ex New York City cops generally get what they want, which brings me to my next subject."
These are the two detectives that handled the case and killed Marquesa.
"This is captain Renard, the guy Marquesa went after."
This guy?
I don't know how he figures into everything.
He's a local guy.
Repairs clocks.
I believe he's a police informant.
"Good evening, Mexico City!"

"Vauxhaull have sold 1,000 of these VX220s."
You might think that's odd because if you peel away the bodies they're basically the same car.
They're made in the same factory.

Vauxhall have realised it's no good making their car the same as the Lotus.

I'll have the Lotus.
"I mean, it's not like the Vauxhall is any easier to get into."
"If you're taller than six inches or have any extraneous body parts, realistically, you need to take the roof off before you can get behind the wheel."
No problems there.
"It has the same simple roof as the Elise, same basic chassis and with a price of £25,000 it costs about the same, too."
"Oh, it was a couple of hours after you left the house that night."
She said there was something very urgent that we should discuss privately.
"And since it takes only a few minutes to get out to her house, I--"
Did she tell you that she'd also received threatening phone calls?

No.

"She didn't know what Frank Sellers was going to do about it, but it might be serious trouble."
And only she could get Sandy out of it if he'd quit his job and we'd both move out of town.
"In other words, practically admit that we-- or I had been up to something."
What more proof did I need that she was the one?
And you told her so.
And that's when Lita brought out her gun?
"No, she lost her temper."
She tried to threaten me with some silly little thing she kept in her bureau.
That silly little thing was the gun that killed her.
"And Beth, your fingerprints are all over it."
"Oh, Perry, I grew up with too many brothers."
I told Lita she ought to be spanked or worse.
"I simply took the gun away from her, threw it down on the desk and walked out."
"Well, I wish you'd told me all that the next day."
How could I?
I drove home that night.
The lights were on.
So I went for a walk.
I stopped at Dorothea's and we talked a while.
And at 1:00 I went home.
I thought Sandy was asleep.
Then I heard the car come in.
What else could I think the next morning but that he'd taken the car out after I had;
Time to come in.
I'm texting with Gaby.
In a minute.
That's what you said 20 minutes ago.
I want your homework done before dinner.
"Unfortunately, all of the blood at the Brewer crime scene was either from Lyla or Jim Brewer."
Nothing from the unsub.
I just talked to the M.E. Ronnie Brewer died from asphyxiation but had not been sexually assaulted.
Unless strangling the boy was the sexual release.
"Or it could have been the unsub's first abduction and he panicked, disposed of the child immediately once he had him."
"The M.E. also said that the type of glue in the Brewers' eyes is frequently used for surgical closures, so the drying process on the skin in well documented."
Apparently it had been applied at 5:15 am.
"Well, the farm hand said they saw that gray sedan flee the scene at 6:20, so if that was our unsub, what was he doing in the house for that hour?"
All Josie ever does is stare at that phone.
It's not normal.
She's 13.
It's normal.
Girls her age should be out doing things.
What's so funny?
Picturing you a hundred years ago.
"""Motor cars aren't normal."
"What the hell's wrong with the horse and buggy?"""
Good night.
Good night.
"The glue our unsub used is sold practically everywhere, so we can't isolate point of purchase."
"A mineral analysis from the sand, however, indicates that it came from the Seneca River in upstate New York."
You ok?
Yeah.
"Morgan, we're gonna find the people who tried to kill you."
He was in his pajamas.
Ronnie Brewer.
"Out there by the side of the road, he was still in his pajamas."
The Bridge is secure.
Tell Phlox to get the imaging chamber ready.
We've got a patient for him.
"T'POL: [On tape] Acting Captain's Starlog, supplemental."
We've resumed our course for Azati Prime.
Major Hayes and his men have been temporarily relieved of duty.
Dr. Phlox believes he has found an explanation for the Captain's behaviour.
-Where is he?
"-In his quarters, resting."
Do you recall when the Captain was attacked by one of the eggs?
-It sprayed something in his face.
-And I thought it was a defence reflex.
But it was actually something far more sophisticated.
The substance contained a unique neurochemical.
PHLOX:
It infiltrated the Captain's synaptic pathways... causing him to reverse-imprint on the baby Insectoids.
It's the opposite of what happens when a young animal bonds with its mother.
Are you saying he thought he was the mother of those things?
"Well, more likely, a caretaker."
"Of course, the Captain didn't realize this on a conscious level."
"Eventually, he became obsessed with protecting the eggs..."
-to the exclusion of everything else.
-Including our mission.
"I'd like to speak with him, if you don't mind."
He'll be awake in a few hours.
He should be fully recovered by then.
I want you and your men to return to duty.
"Yes, ma'am."
Not the sort of thing they trained us for at West Point.
I imagine not.
"You could have come to me, explained the situation."
We couldn't take the chance that you'd side with the Captain.
"Well, that's the whole point, isn't it?"
"I am, sir."
"Mr. Webster, I'm asking you to lay off... as a personal favor."
"It's one thing to break ranks and vote against my candidate... but to actively attack her from the bench, that's another."
"Mr. President, I just don't believe in Laine Hanson... especially when we have at our disposal Governor Hathaway."
He's a party loyalist and genuine hero.
And I cannot and shall not vote for a candidate simply because she's a woman.
"I am nothing if I do not follow my heart, sir."
I envy you.
I do.
You know why?
"Because someday, years from now, you're gonna come in here with your family... and you're gonna look up at my painting... and you'll be able to say to them, your kids and grandkids..."
"""Way back then I defied my president."
"It cost me my reelection, kept me out of politics forever."
"I was on the track to maybe one day end up here... destined to make the kind of changes in this country... that only great men, given the right time and place, can make... and I have none of that now, but that's okay... because I did what was in my heart."""
"The heart, it can never be wrong, can it, Mr. Webster?"
Mmm.
Delicious.
You got a little...
Hi.
I'm Jack Hathaway.
How are you?
"Hi, sir."
Um...
Ow.
I'm Special Agent Willomina.
Sure is good of you to meet me.
It's a pleasure.
How can I help you?
"I know you're busy, so this will be as routine as it gets."
- Did my girl offer you coffee or something to drink?
"- Oh, yes, she did."
"But even if I did, then I couldn't -- um, I mean, I wouldn't want to -- The stairs."
What about the stairs?
They're right behind you.
Ooh!
"Without the Time Lord knowledge, our Doctor is very insecure and Joan Redfern kind of coaxes it out of him."
"And you can see that, for the first time, the Doctor is falling in love as a human being and he falls in love with her."
"But when the Doctor became the Doctor again,"
"Joan was like ""I don't want any of that"""
because it wasn't the same person.
I can't.
Please come with me.
I can't.
Why not?
"John Smith is dead, and you look like him."
"But he's here, inside, if you look in my eyes."
"Answer me this -- just one question, that's all -- if the Doctor had never visited us, if he'd never chosen this place, on a whim... would anyone here have died?"
Why can't she come with him?
"Well, because she doesn't want to marry an alien being, she wants this nice teacher guy."
All right.
"Yeah, he can't have everything."
"Sorry, Mr. Magic."
She decides not to go with him because she liked the man who he was before.
She says no.
"She's like ""because you're not"
"""the guy I fell in love with."
"""You are someone who selfishly landed here"
"""and got people killed and that is not the man I fell in love with."""
"So, once again, we have a woman refusing the Doctor, which is very rare."
"""The Doctor's Daughter"" is Jenny and she pops up almost literally out of nowhere."
"The Doctor shows up on this planet and they take a tissue sample and, suddenly, there she is, full-grown."
- What's going on?
- Leave him alone!
"Come in, all of ya."
It won't cost you a cent.
Flemingsburg?
I can't rightly say I've ever been to Flemingsburg.
"Unless you wanna be under the thumb of the abolitionists, you better not go now."
I never thought Kentucky would be run by clay-eaters and poor white trash!
There's some mighty fine folks in Kentucky.
"Yes, and more of them are coming south every day."
Isn't that just giving up your state to the Yankees?
They've got it already.
"They're so strong in the legislature, they passed a law that any man fighting for the South forfeits his state's rights"
"- to citizenship, land and holdings."
- Has it come to that?
"Yes, sir."
I know that to be true.
The governor of Kentucky has four sons.
"Two are fighting for the Yankees, and two are in my regiment."
"They told me that unless we won, they could never go home again."
Damn Yankees!
"Jess, you're at table."
Quit your swearing.
"""Damn Yankee"" ain't swearing, Mother, and you know it."
"Jem, maybe the brave Kentuckians would like to join your regiment."
"I'd be mighty proud to have them, if you can wait till this comes off."
"I'd take you to Chattanooga with me, introduce you to General Ledbetter."
"We're honored, but we had our hearts set on enlisting in the 1st Georgia regiment."
"Some of our friends have already joined it, and we're anxious to push on."
1st Georgia!
"Did you hear that, Mother?"
No river's gonna hold you back.
"That ferryman doesn't like flood water, but he'll take you over first thing in the morning or find himself out of a job."
[Innkeeper] I knew it.
Show me Gyuri!
-Ágika!
- Here you go!
My sweet parents and Ágika!
"I announce it gladly, for our loved major lord the person about who I wrote so much beautiful one already deteriorated very much his nervous system because of the partisans' constant harassment ."
And travel home onto 2 weekly sick-leave now because of this.
I discussed with him that he should take advantage of my kind parents' hospitality...
Go on Ágika.
What was not an easy matter because in him mental state he not wants to be in nobody's inconvenience.
"Hear, Lajos?"
"I hear, yes."
"But I wrote our village's climatic benefits, our beautiful glassy porch and the beautiful view, and the our major lord accepted the invitation."
You may think what this means to me.
Christ on the cross.
Our Gyula's commander comes here!
A glass of wine for the postman.
"Come,Gyuri boy!"
Gyuri's 7 pictures hanged on the wall of the big room of Tót.
All guests had to admire these.
"This, when he were 8 monthly."
The rice pudding until all of them scattered spat.
"Was born blond, but his 1 year age his hair was black."
Everybody was surprised at this very much.
He 7 years old on this picture.
My mom said that a lot were trouble with him.
I was not me then on the world yet.
I was born in the next year only.
This picture when it was made a scout.
Went into a camp in one summer.
He got dysentery.
"Well, we got frightened very much then."
This his high school graduation is picture.
The old man is back
No
Old aunt upstairs is out of breath climbing the stairs
Go to America with me
Go to America?
How?
"If I win the semi-finals, I will go to America for the world champion lf l become the America's boxing champion I can apply for you to come over"
Will you win?
Very likely
"You're against Ah Mut Sha, the Thai Boxing Champion"
He fights fiercely
But I might not necessarily lose I won't see you fight
I can't stand your being a boxer
Are you going with me or not?
I don't know English
You can learn it
Those foreigners are weird
They're either blacker than coal or insipid white I would say you don't want to give up that old man
It's not good leaving him like this
Do you really want to bear a son for him?
Have you suffered so much to come here just to bear a son for an old man?
I can't say whether the child you are pregnant with is his or mine
It's mine
Alright...it's yours
What about me?
You want the child but not his father?
Disgusting

It's my husband
Don't you have to work late tonight?
Ah Mut Sha's elbow and knee are powerful

But we're on our way

"In Summer Stock, Judy was seen for the first time wearing what was to become her trademark for years to come."
The top half of a tuxedo.
"Two years before, however, she had worn the same outfit in a scene removed from the released version of Easter Parade."
"Irving Berlin had based a song on just a few notes and called it ""Mr. Monotony. """
This is Judy at the top of her career.
Playing on his slide trombone
In a certain monotone
He was known as Mr. Monotony
Any pleasant interlude
"Come on, hurry up."
"On the double, let's go, boys!"
Got them all.
"Hey, you."
"Snap it up, on the double."
Let's go.
"You know, you can write to her later on government stationery."
"That first winter away from home, I took shape as an individual and toughened."
And with spring came the promise that perhaps I had found my place in life.
"But part of me would keep escaping and I'd find it running, in memory, back through the fields of Peyton Place or wandering down streets now empty of young men."
I got a couple of funny ones.
This is from Ted Carter.
He says:
"""The food they serve here must have been warmed over from World War I. """
Remember Fred Combes?
He's in the Navy.
"He says, ""Dear Hyde:"
I joined the Navy because I liked the way they kept their ships neat and tidy.
But I never knew until now who kept them that way:
"Me. """
The boys are getting around these days.
I had a V-Mail letter just the other day from someplace from Norman Page.
- Remember him?
- Sure.
He said he dug a foxhole so deep that it was just short of desertion.
And then the seasons spun by so fast they seemed to become one.
"The war news was too big to grasp, and too unhappy to understand."
"Selena wrote me often about Peyton Place, and I treasured her letters."
She always tried to mention my mother and tell me what people were saying to each other or were not saying.
"Eventually, I broke the ice of my intentions and subscribed to the Peyton Place Times."
I was hungry for names that meant something to me.
"But among them, unhappily, came the names of those who were gone forever."
-Get into the vehicle
-What for?
"Sitting on the wall, do you eve tease?"
Don't talk unnecessarily
We have received a complaint Who gave?
Should I explain it all on the road?
"Come, get in"
Get down
Why do you bring me here?
"For us police, court, advocate, judge are all our MLA"
You may take me to the police station for inquiry
With whom do you talk about rules?
You debris eating dog
-Look at me and repeat it
-You debris eating dog
Look at my eyes and say that
-You debris eating dog
Brother please don't
Be a police don't be a vandal
Leader is coming for opening the party office
This guy belongs to that area
Let us handle him once the leader's visit is over
I will kill you
Go
"Come,let us go"
Why did you bring here without taking him to station?
"Sir, the MLA..."
Is the MLA giving you salary?
This uniform has a dignity
-Long live
-Leader
-Long live
"""By giving His appearance, he has blessed the three of you."""
"""Sage, you know the past, present future."
"T ellthisboy 'sfuture."""
Not just tell but you have to make his future.
Where do I have the ability to make the future of this son?
"""l just now told you, Lord Shiv himself came as a sage and..."""
...gave you the responsibility of bringing up this boy.
"""As Trishwar, he has also given you the ability to bring you up."""
What should I do now?
-Make the future of this boy who has Lord Shiv's mercy to become glorious
- How?
"""His son, his father left Shiv Pradosh prayer in the middle..."""
...and got into difficulties and this boy is orphaned
"""Since he had Lord Shiv's mercy, he has been brought up."""
But he is still deprived of his kingdom and its comforts.
T ell me the way by which he can get his kingdom back.
Learn the way Shiv Pradosh prayer should be done and...
This boy has to atone for his father's sin.
"""King, you were tired searching for your enemy's son."
"I got him."""
Where is he?
- One brahmin lady Uma is bringing him up along with his son.
Both of them are going to do Shiv Pradosh worship as per the advice of Sage Shandilya.
Dharmagupt will come for the last time to Shiv temple today
He will also die in my hands like his father.
"""Along with enemy's son, his death will come to Shiv's temple"""
Who is my enemy's son amongst them?
How to recognize him.
"""What is this dilemma?"
"T o solve this, I will kill both of them."""
"""Praying Lord Shiv has resulted in your good, sons."""
That enemy had brought two knives to kill both of you.
It's all right!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on.
"Go on, Freddy."
Come on inside.
Come on.
So Gary Figgis copped a plea.
"Gave up the connection between Ray, the PDA and the mob."
There were a shitload of indictments.
"And the sheriff, Freddy Heflin—"
"You know, there's people on both sides of the river wish he never recovered."
They cursed the day he took down Ray Donlan.
"But what they don't know, he figured out:"
No one is above the law.
"Four cops dead, and one dead cop resurrected."
"In a bizarre twist, Murray ""Superboy"" Babitch sits alive and well in a holding cell—"
Sheriff Fred Heflin apprehended Babitch single-handedly.
"...he will be recovering the hearing in his good ear, so that's good news."
Files were seized this morning—
Officer Gary Figgis testified about mob influence and bribery.
"Three months since the shoot-out in Garrison, New Jersey... reputed mob boss Toy Torillo has been indicted on four counts of racketeering."
An unidentified corrections officer was arrested today... for the murder three years ago of Officer Glenn Tunney.
I understand Jim Allen is with the mayor.
Do you want to go back to him?
"[ Man ] back in the '70s, every cop wanted out of the city."
but the only cops allowed to live outside New York were transit cops.
because the Transit Authority was also run byJersey and Connecticut.
"So these guys I knew at the 3-7... they started pulling overtime at subway stations... and got the city to declare them ""auxiliary transit cops. """
They bought some land in Jersey.
Got some cheap loans from people they knew.
I'll escape now from that world

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
BEGGARS' CHORUS: (SINGING) At the end of the day you're another day older
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
It's a struggle!
It's a war!
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
One more day standing about What is it for?
One day less to be living
At the end of the day you're another day colder
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill
And the righteous hurry past They don't hear the little ones crying
And the plague is coming on fast Ready to kill
One day nearer to dying!
At the end of the day there's another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm that'll break any second
There's a hunger in the land There's a reckoning still to be reckoned
And there's gonna be hell to pay At the end of the day!
(FACTORY WOMEN GIGGLING) (SHUSHING)
At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing

Latin is it?
"Yeah, 'pietatis' it's from the old funeral mass."
"'Save me, O source of pity'."
Something like that.
"I didn't think you did that any more, did you?"
"Yes, it must be somebody with a very long memory, or someone who spends a lot of time"
listening to Verdi's Requiem.
"But no, it's not what you'd expect."
From James Barr?
No.
"Tell me something, Father."
What makes you think that James Barr didn't do it?
"You see I can't speak to anyone,"
I can't speak to my officers or any of the witnesses and that includes James Barr.
But I know he talked to you the other night for a long time about all sorts of things.
James knows nothing about the murder.
And he's genuinely appalled that the death of his first wife's being investigated again.
I'd like to know what he said.
Exactly what he said.
"Look, you know I'm trying to help, that doesn't mean I can just go and repeat his confession."
"I can get suspended too, you know."
The other day you were pouring out guilt after someone came in and asked forgiveness because they were going to kill someone.
"Well, maybe, they went out and did just that,"
"I don't know, maybe you should have said something to stop them."
I don't know.
"I'll tell you what I do know,"
James Barr is probably going to go to prison.
"Now if you have a reason why he shouldn't, you'd better decide whether you're going to help me find the truth or not."

"Well, I'd been looking in every bar I could find, and I was still unable to locate Latham-"
- Mr. Reed.
"And inasmuch as Mr. Somers had threatened to put a private detective on his trail, I just had to beg for time."
"Well, did you discuss Axel Norstaad with Somers?"
"Yes, briefly."
"You were well aware, were you not, that Martin Somers had instructed his attorney to file an injunction against the defendant the next morning?"
Yes.
And you were afraid of what Mr. Norstaad would do when he found out about this?
"I wanted Mr. Somers to wait at least until I could find Latham until I found out what had happened to the $50,000 so I could go to Axel and explain everything"
- and tell him how much at fault I was and--
- All right.
And what did Mr. Somers say?
Did he agree to give you more time?
He said it all depended.
Depended on what?
"On whether or not the defendant stayed away from him, let him alone?"
I suppose so.
"Please, don't make any suppositions."
Answer me yes or no.
- Yes!
And that is inevitable for men of his stature.
"On this journey, my father became real to me... a man, not a myth."
"Now that I know him a little better,"
"I miss him more than ever, and I really wish things had been different."
But he chose the life that he wanted.
It's hard to let go.
"But after all these years,"
I think I found the right time and place to say good-bye.

"(Kahn) Louis I. Kahn, whose strong forms of brick and concrete influenced a architects and made him, in the opinion of most architecscholars,"
"America's foremost living architect, died Sunday evening apparently of a heart attack in Pennsylvania Station."
He was 73 years old.
"Besides his wife, Mr. Kahn leaves a daughter, Sue Ann."

"When I first read that obituary,"
I have to admit I was looking for my own name.
"I was his child too, his only son."
I didn't know my father very well.
"He never married my mother, and he never lived with us."
But I can still remember every detail of the few times we spent a whole day together.
"On this afternoon, we had a picnic."
"He painted with watercolors, and my mother snapped these pictures."
He died when I was 11.
[woman speaking indistinctly over intercom]
The circumstances of his death have always fascinated me.
He was bankrupt and alone on his way back home from India.
that he'd been out to Lita's and he'd killed her.
Maybe Sandy had provocation for what he did to Lita.
"The police have check out his story, you know."
He was seen drinking in a Hollywood bar just before--
"Well, it's not specifically against the law to try to kill someone who's already dead."
"Perry, you're making excuses for Sandy."
Why?
To find out why you've made so many.
Not ever again.
"Oh, Perry, I do need my old friends back."
[sobbing]
"[Hamilton Burger] And what did the defendant then say to you when you told her that her husband was busy in the office of the deceased, Lita Krail?"
"Well, she said, ""That little alley cat,"""
and-- and then another word that I really didn't listen to.
"I mean, everybody already knew how much they hated each other ever since Lita was given Beth's job."
- [Mason] Objection.
- Sustained.
"Now Miss Adams, let's skip to later that day, shall we?"
"To that night, as a matter of fact."
Did you have occasion to contact the deceased then?
Yes I did.
"You see, I got this crazy call from Sand-- Mr. Sandover-- about money deposits and money in the office."
"Well, I got home from my date and I figured I'd better call Lita and tell her about Sandy's call."
- So you actually phoned Lita's house?
- At 11:15.
Then she said she was too busy to talk.
"And then I heard another voice-- hers, the defendant's-- saying, ""Hang up that phone."""
"Then Lita says, ""I'm giving the orders around here, dear."""
"And, ""Oh, no you're not,"" says Beth."
And there's a real loud scuffle noise and bam goes the receiver right in my ear.
"[Burger] That will be all, Miss Adams."
- Counselor?
I respond to anything beginning with R.
"When I was at school, we had this teacher called Mr Archer, he was a lovely man, and he just couldn't say my name and my friends just made my name longer for him so that my nickname"
"at school was ""Royconsangonzales"", just to Mr Archer."
"He was like, ""That's not how you say it"", but he wasn't sure."
"And they were like, she's got a fada over the O, that turns it into ""roik""."
"Hang on, there's a what over the O?"
"It's a fada, it's like a hyphen."
It's like a little dash like you get in French like a greve or....
Yeah.
Tell me what the O means?
The O?
Yeah.
In O'Hanlon.
Why do so many Irish names have an O in front of them?
It's just an expression of surprise.
"Roisin, I want to know about when you went on a meditation retreat and you sang an Elton John medley, is that correct?"
Yes.
I'm quite an anxious person and I think I'm always at a sort of low level of panic.
Are you really?
"Yeah, just naturally."
"Cos I would put you down as a happy-go-lucky, smiley, chatty, nice person."
Come off it.
Are you a proper freaker?
"I think I'm quite an anxious, quite..."
SHE JIBBERS
"I think I'm quite an anxious person at heart, like, overall anxiety, and it's fine, it just makes me smoke quite a lot and eat my way through it."
"I went on this retreat, and basically,"
I wanted to go to stop smoking.
"And on the first day I got there, you sort of get introduced to people and this couple said, ""We've been married for ten years"
"""and we're here just to salvage our marriage."
"That's why we're here""."
"And I was like, ""Oh, right, I'm smoking 20 a day"
"And lo, I bring the warlike host of Spain"
In fair review before King Agramant.
"I, Soridan, come with my martial train,"
Who may almost a giant's stature vaunt;
Marsilio with the men of Setta ride;
The Nasamonians troop with Pulian.
"And faithful Sobrino take to thy side,"
Who from far away brings many a man.
"Rodomont, of Sarza, king of Algiers,"
"For thy glory, Agramant, I anew"
Brought up a band of foot and cavaliers.
A new-made king after me comes behind.
"Dardinello is my name, which is signed."
"The fierce Mandricardo, king of the Tartars, is also moving towards Paris."
"But while on the road, he runs into Doralice's procession,"
"Rodomont's fiancée, bound to reach her cavalier in the city under siege."
"Where the deep stream is fordable, I've scanned"
A crowd of cavaliers that armour bear:
"Ye, all!"
I do now question:
"who hath manned,"
"With such a troop, and to what end, the square?"
"In charge, I say, we of the daughter go"
"Of him our king, who fills Granada's throne,"
"Espoused by Rodomont of Sarza, oh!"
And we shall bring her where her father keeps
In the Spanish camp;
meanwhile the lady sleeps.
"This Doralice, by what I hear, is fair."
"Fain would I now be certified, how fair:"
"Then me to her, or her to me convey,"
For I must quickly wend another way.
"Hey, ronin If you want the castle, it's this-a-way"
Excuse me
You heard?
He knows one of the government retainers
And has a relative in the castle study
"Oh, no, the tale keeps getting taller and taller"
"I found him, your enemy"
"Not, again..."
"This time, I swear it's him"
The water's perfect
I know another guy...
"""Height 175cm, fair skin with regular teeth"
WANTED
"WANTED ""His fox-like face bears a red mark from his right eye down his cheek"""
"Ah, the marked cheek is on his face, not his backside..."
Yes
Age?
Thirty
Thirty...
Much older looking since I last saw him...
"Don't lose heart, Soza"
Finding a man in Edo's sprawl is like winning the lottery
"It could take 10 years, no, 20..."
"Hey, sis, another sake"
Patience...
"But he's the right height, right?"
I'll go over it once more so listen well
Our shit fertilizes the rice paddies and fields
"That's why the farmer pays money to buy it from the rich landlord, who owns this tenement"
And that money pays for New Year's rice cakes for all of us
"You mean, rice cakes come from shit?"
"Well, not quite, but you're not far off, either"
"And so I kept doing it, and Bo Diddley was like,"
"""Who is that stepping on my show?"""
"And then they lift me up, and I was gone."
Crowd-surfed with my trombone and I'd ended up on stage with Bo Diddley.
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.
He's become...
"Well, I'll put it like this."
The Neville Brothers had been closing our Jazz Fest since Professor Longhair passed away.
"When the Neville Brothers decided that they weren't gonna do it, the natural progression was Trombone Shorty."
Now he's...
"You know, he's a monster."
It's unbelievable.
One of the things I believe in is the importance of passing on traditions the way they were given to us.
We play all styles of music.
"There's calypso, Cuban."
We have the Mardi Gras Indian sound.
The music there exists because the culture itself is so rich to begin with.
It's not just the Deep South.
New Orleans is the northernmost point in the Caribbean.
New Orleans was the largest port for a century.
It's where coffee entered America.
"It was the entry point for Central America,"
"South America, and Africa."
"I mean, part of our history is, you know, something that we're not very proud of, you know..."
"Is that we are the port where hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Africans were brought into the United States and sold into slavery."
"This was a place where people from a lot of different places met, traded goods and ideas."
And some of those ideas was musical.
You listen to the music and you can pick out all the ingredients from all those different styles.
You can pick out Spanish melodies and you can pick out African rhythms.
"You know, the Bo Diddley riff is just an African riff."
How much rock 'n' roll have we built on that?
The 'pooja' is not yet over why do you taste it before that?
Some guy said he is a relative He has tasted the sambar
What were you doing then?
What can I do?
He said he is Muthu's brother in law
I thought he is your relative We thought he is your cook
What has happened?
A guy with towel was around here
He has tasted the food and polluted it
"He claims, he is Muth's brother in law"
Muthu has no brother in law Call uncle
Might have done some mischief
Must catch him and inquire to know details
"Search every where You all go this side, search"
We are going towards bus stand
Did anyone with a towel come here?
Looks like a cook
He just boarded the bus
-Should have caught him
-Why should I catch him?
Look at his explanation
Don't waste time by talking Quickly intercept the bus
Go fast
"Wait, It is said, should not move when hit by a crow"
Get me a mug of water
Seems the crow is in agony
Must have consumed something
Seems it has consumed rice
Can't hear the drum beats then 'pooja' is over
Would have offered first food to the crow
-Perhaps....
-You are right
They were honking because I forgot to bring the bedroom back in.
"So I'm going down the freeway with the bedroom over the other lane, people are honking."
"The way I discovered this is when the highway patrolman was,"
"""Do you know why I'm writing you this ticket?"""
So I get down to the RV park that day.
All I wanted to do was just get in the shower.
So you go to hook up the sewer for the poo and the pipe burst and poo went everywhere.
No!
"So then they call the fire department, Hazmat gear, they come in, they clean up all the poo, which is spectacular."
"That wouldn't happen in this country, by the way."
"It'd be, ""Get on with it yourself."""
I've come to England three times and you're right - they'd tell me to eff off.
"But in America, they have to put on the Hazmat suits, they clean your poo up for you."
How nice.
What a wonderful country.
"And then afterwards, I do what any good American does -"
I go to Walmart to buy another sewer hose and I hook it back up.
"I go to take another shower and I hear bang, bang, bang on the door."
"I'm just like, ""Leave me alone!"" Bang, bang, bang!"
"I throw a towel on and go out and go,"
"""What's wrong?"
"What's going on?"""
"He goes, ""Your RV, man, it's flooding."""
"And there's, like, water."
"The pipes had burst underneath the RV, flooded all of our clothes, all of our belongings, and I saw red and I just said, ""I will burn this mother-effer to the ground!"""
And it was that day I decided to sell it.
It was poo-inspired.
Surely it should not drive with the bedroom out.
Right!
You would think so.
"If this was a Volkswagen or a Volvo, something would have kicked in with a beep-beep!"
"My car, which is German, beeps at me as soon as I look at it, like I've done something dangerous."
We are on the verge of making America great again.
Thank you.
How are you doing?
Good.
Take a picture with my son?
- Yes.
How are ya?
"And if you decide to run for president in, like, 2039, look me up."

"""Get me Roger Stone."""
"""Get me a Roger Stone type."""
"""Who is Roger Stone?"""
A mock election was planned in my elementary school.
"And I was for John F. Kennedy because my parents were Catholic, and I thought, although they were Republicans, they had a certain sympathy for Kennedy."
But also because Kennedy's hair was so much better than Nixon's hair.
"And, therefore, I went to the cafeteria and as each kid would go through the cafeteria line with their tray,"
"I would tell them, ""You know, Nixon has proposed having school on Saturdays."""
"Well, then the mock election was held, and to the surprise of the local newspaper,"
Democrat John Kennedy swept this mock election.
"For the first time ever, I understood the value of disinformation."
"Of course, I've never practiced it since then."
"We Republicans seek a government that attends to its inherent responsibilities, encouraging a free and a competitive economy, and enforcing law and order."
My first Republican National Convention was 1964.

"And I devoured this book in, you know, a day."
It was at that moment that I knew what I wanted to do.
I no longer wanted to be an actor.
"Less than 12 hours later, the men escaped by creating a disturbance in their cell."
"Well, they started kissing, which I'm fine with... really, I am, kiss whoever you want... except they were both men."
Tito Amendola was also in holding at the time and witnessed the jailbreak.

"That's right, we're coming for you."
"Strong words, and moving on, what if you were going through a drive-thru, and a puppy dog took your order?"
"The cops are looking for us, and a madman wants us dead."
We should be laying low until the Nine-Nine gets here.
"Yeah, but we don't know when that's gonna be, and we need food and supplies."
"Okay, I'll get some water."
"Holt, are you trying to draw attention to us?"
Nobody drinks water here.
Choose something blue or green.
"Okay, I guess I'll go in for, uh, the Blazing Blue Rad-berry Cooler Xtreme:"
Code Rad.
Good choice.
I should probably get some body spray as well.
"What sounds better, Liquid Moan or Turnpike?"
We only have $17 to our name.
We can't spend five of it on this.
"I know, but I'm about to see Amy for the first time in forever, and I want to smell like a..."
"""hot New Jersey breeze,"" ugh."
Good call.
"All right, let's get out of here."
"And in Coral Palms, law enforcement still is searching for a pair of fugitives who broke out of jail earlier this evening."
Greg Stickney and Larry Sherbert are believed to be unarmed but dangerous.
"Liquid Moan, nice."
I wore this to Swampsgiving last year... cleaned up.
"Right on, bro."
"Oh, we have a promotion on the Code Rad."
"He's from the same ruling party as President Choi Eung Chan, but those two are political opponents."
"Without councilor Lee Young Taek, it will not be easy to get the Private School Reform Bill to pass."
"His side is against it for now, so the votes of the lesser councilmen from his faction are essential."
That means President Choi Eung Chan will persuade Lee Young Taek somehow.
Okay.
I will find out more.
"You came, Mr. President."
"We've finished the security inspection within the restaurant, and we found nothing suspicious."
Assembly Member Lee Yong Taek is waiting inside.
The bodyguards can rest outside for a while.

With the previous Guest Hall terrror incident at the Blue House too.
We need to guard you nearby.
Just 30 minutes is enough.
30 minutes is enough.
Mr. President...
I will cut to the chase.
Please help me pass the Private School Reform Bill.
"If I help you Mr. President, what can you do for me?"
"I will arrange it, so that you will not be summoned by the prosecution office."
"After the incident with Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan, the National Assemby is reviled."
"With complaints from the citizens so adamant, the National Assembly will not come forward for you."
But I understand you and Chairman Cheon Jae Man agreed on an alliance.
Public sentiment is public sentiment.
"However,"
I will help you.
Thank you.
For us ruling party members to have friction...
"would only benefit the opposition party, right?"
I will use my power to help you pass your Private School Reform Bill as well.
"Then, I will leave believing in the President."
I am under your care.

Secret chamber?
"However, about a year after the pharaoh would return to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year."
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.
Uh-huh.
"Obviously, we've come to the right men."

"Oh, rubbish."
Ravenwood's no Nazi.
"Well, what do the Nazis want him for, then?"
"Well, obviously, the Nazis are looking for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra and they think Abner's got it."
What exactly is a headpiece to the Staff of Ra?
"Well, the staff is just a stick.."
"I don't know, about this big, nobody really knows for sure how high.."
"and it's... it's, uh..."
"it's capped with an elaborate headpiece... in the shape of the sun, with a crystal in the center."
And what you did was you take the staff to a special room in Tanis..
"a map room with a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor- and if you put the staff in a certain place, at a certain time of day, the sun shone through here and made a beam that came down on the floor here... and gave you the exact location of the Well of the Souls."

The roots of his power as a Catholic king were far from deep.
They had grown upon stony Protestant ground.
William of Orange had begun preparing an invasion fleet two months before the child was born.
The fleet was ready by the first week of October.
"With sailors and others included, William's force totalled some 70,000."
"Clearly, he had no intention of doing this twice."
The army landed in Devon in the first week of November.
"And almost at once, James's support began mysteriously to wither away."
"Because in the end, Stuart or not, son of the headless king or not, he was a Catholic."
"On the night of 9th December, the Queen and the King's young heir fled to France."
James VII and II followed on the 23rd.
He hadn't abdicated.
But everybody decided to behave as though he had.
"They decided, too, that this wasn't an invasion."
This would be the Glorious Revolution.
They had invited William of Orange.
Do come and take a kingdom!

"In May of 1689, William of Orange and his wife Mary accepted a joint monarchy of England, Scotland and Ireland."
A monarchy with strings attached.
"The Crown could no longer suspend laws, levy taxes, or maintain a standing army in peacetime without Parliament's permission."
"Here, at last, was the new world, 50 years after the Covenanters had first asked for it."
50 years after Charles I had said no.
"In England, the Stuarts were kings no longer, with hardly a shot fired."
The Glorious Revolution would acquire another adjective.

"A priest, a blessing, a piece of paper"
Definitely not
Do you want to smoke one?
OK
Look at them they're driving like crazy
And then something goes wrong you cant leave them all alone
They're driving like crazy
Because they're desperate to get home
So the wife opens the door
Gives them little kiss
And asks 'How was your day at work?
"and they say 'Fine, I'm just a little tired'"
Then she turns the TV on
Start arguing with the son
If a son dares to punch me I swear I'd kill him
I'm going to the sea
Who comes to the sea with me?
"I'm also going, eh"
I can't go now
I have to fix a few things
"You blew it, kid"
Wait for me there
While you still in blossom
Ain't it the truth?
Cleopatra and Delilah
Had it way over Ruth
Them gals did mighty swell
They sure did ring that bell
Ain't it the gospel truth?
It's the truth
The truth
It's the solid
Mellow truth
"In 1946, I played the role of Julie in an excerpt from Show Boat in Till the Clouds Roll By."
I was being considered for the part for the 1951 version of Show Boat but the Production Code Office had banned interracial romance on the screen.
So the studio gave the part to my good friend Ava Gardner.
And she was wonderful in it.
The studio had Ava rehearse singing the role to the recordings that I had made hoping to get the part which annoyed us both.
"Anyway, she did a great job on her own but just before releasing the film, the studio dubbed her with Annette Warren's voice."
"Fish got to swim, birds got to fly"
I got to love one man till I die
Can't help lovin' that man of mine
This is what audiences would have heard if they had allowed Ava's voice to be used.
"Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow"
Tell me I'm crazy
Maybe I know
Can't help
Lovin' that man of mine
Though Ava was one of my few good friends I was deeply disappointed that I didn't get the part.
That's a rainy day
But when he comes back
That day is fine

He can come home

"In kind of a real-life ""Doctor Who"" episode,"
"Georgia Moffett, who plays Jenny, is the daughter of Peter Davison, who's the fifth Doctor;"
"and she's the wife of David Tennant, who is the tenth Doctor."
"So it's this kind of amazing meeting of real life and the fiction of ""Doctor Who."""
"There's so much weird sort of ""Doctor Who"" looping going on with that that it's -- he married his own daughter..."
He married his own daughter.
But I'm fine with it.
It is all wrapped up in timey-wimey in real life.
"Yeah, I -- it's a conundrum."
Amy Pond was supersexy and feisty.
She states what she wants and goes for it.
I really wasn't suggesting anything quite so...
long-term.
I think what the show does a really great job of is not having the women just sort of be these passive accessories to the male lead of the show.
"They're always very strong women, in their own way."
Amy Pond was the first companion since Rose to just be like supersexy and hot and feisty and crazy.
"I love the fact that she's got this edge to her that's really, like, kickarse, like, she's really -- like, you just get the sense that you shouldn't mess with her."
Amy's interesting because she's the first companion we meet as a child.
"He showed up when she was a kid, said, ""Oh, come with me,"""
"she said okay, and then he ditched her for 12 years"
And then ditched her again for 2 years.
"All that stuff that happened -- the hospital, the spaceships,"
"Prisoner Zero -- Oh, don't worry, that's just the beginning, there's loads more."
"Yeah, but those things, those amazing things, all that stuff."
That was two years ago!
Ohh...

A deep and utter... I've been looking for you
Why have you come to Hong Kong?
I want to do something I'd like to do
Couldn't you do it in Canton?
No but I was doing more of what others wanted than what I wanted I didn't realise before I had achieved anything here I had to sell my body
You mean those bastards in the wooden hut area?
It's not them
They have escaped to come here too
They work hard for money and have to send it home to their family
The alternative was war on the never-never.
Charles began to look for someone to borrow from.
"The Scots raised an army of fervent Covenanters, led by expert soldiers who had returned home from foreign wars."
Charles raised the military equivalent of a tickling stick.
He lost.
Twice.
"By September of 1640, he was shamed and mired in debt."
He had to call the English Parliament.
And the English Parliament was full of Protestants who wanted the same things as the Scots - limits to his power.
"They didn't understand that he was God's anointed, trying to save their souls."
Charles declared war on Parliament in August 7642.
The English Civil War had begun.
Warriston had prayed for a chance to extend the power of King Jesus beyond Scotland 's borders.
"The English Civil War was a regrettable bloodbath, of course, but it was also an opportunity."
"For the first year, the Scots took no part."
Charles and his Royalist army secured victory after victory.
"And in the autumn of 1643,"
"England's Parliament sent agents north to Scotland, to ask for help."
The National Covenant had been for Scotland alone.
The Solemn League and Covenant of 7643 would go much further.
I wasn't expecting to see this in the form of a little hardback book.
WOMAN:
"Unlike the National Covenant,"
Solemn Leagues actually tend to be printed.
"They are normally a plain, printed book that is signed up to."
- We have these lovely engravings here.
- What do they tell us?
One of my favourite illustrations is this one here.
It shows how the Covenant is more radical than that of 1638.
There's no wishy-washy stuff from bishops here.
"It's the extirpation of Popery, prelacy, that is bishops."
"And here we have these bishops, prelates, deans, deacons, all being cast out of the Church, being insulted as they go."
"I love Dean Smith, you know?"
"I respect him as much as anybody that I've been around in coaching, and I understand him."
A lot of the things that we've gone through --
The sustained excellence and the expectations --
"Are very, very similar."
It's like brothers in arms.
One thing coach k and coach Smith.
One thing coach k and coach Smith certainly had in common was winning.
"By the time he reached his 36th year at Carolina,"
Dean Smith had amassed enough victories to make history and pass adolph rupp --
"At the time, the winningest coach in the long history of college basketball."
But the glare of the spotlight wasn't for him.
"He thought it took away from the players, it took away from the program, it put him in a spotlight that he didn't want to be in."
It was never his goal to break rupp's record.
He probably didn't know what rupp's record was.
He probably didn't know what rupp's record was.
"He was not comfortable with it at all and he told me at one time he may quit the day before, and I said, ""you cannot do that."
We're going to hogtie you.
"You cannot do that."""
"There was almost a conspiracy of his former players, who got together and who said, ""look, whatever it takes, we're not going to let him retire before he breaks the record."""
"Dean Smith is the winningest coach in the history of college basketball, in the history of college basketball,"
877 career victories.
"They start chanting his name, ""Dean!"
Dean!
"Dean!"""
And he sprints like a track star to get off that court.
He genuinely did not think he had done anything.
And I'm telling you -- He meant it.
"Coach, we want to give you a present from past, present, and us --"
"A present from past, present, and us --"
A Jersey with 877 wins.
"Well, aren't you nice."
Still we've gone from A to Z
Doin' what comes naturally
You don't have to know How to read or write
When you're out with a feller In the pale moonlight
You don't have to look In a book to find
What he thinks of the moon And what is on his mind
That comes naturally
My uncle out in Texas Can't even write his name
"He signs his checks with ""x's"""
But they cash them just the same
Grandpa Dick was always sick
But never saw a doctor
He just died at 93

The quick toboggan When you reach the heights
I miss the kisses And I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again
Words and Music was the last time that Judy and Mickey Rooney worked together at MGM ending the most popular song and dance team the studio would ever have.
No more pain
No more strain
Now I'm sane But I would rather be gaga
The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mismating of a him and her
We've learned our lesson And we wish we were in love
Again
Judy Garland and I grew up together at MGM and completed high school between long days of shooting.
Here on the lot we made 10 pictures together and even when we worked separately we turned to each other for friendship and encouragement.
"We were the very best of friends, more like brother and sister."
I still miss her very much.
Judy was 11 years old when I first heard her sing and I told her right off what I felt then and what I feel today.
"I said to her, ""Darling, you're the best in the world. """

"Freedom from the English crown at last, for ever."
The next English invasion was in 1 332.

NARRATOR:
"They call it Britain's last great wilderness, a place as beautiful as it is barren."
The islands and mountains of Scotland seem to exist on the edge of the imagination.
But it wasn't always like this.
"For centuries, Gaelic Scotland was at the heart of the Scottish kingdom."
Then it changed.
"It became something different, something separate."
Something other.
(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYS)
(ALL SPEAK GAELIC)
"In many ways, Scotland is a nation of two cultures, one Highland and one Lowland, and one part just doesn't seem to understand the other."
Most of us don't speak Gaelic.
"We speak English and, whether we admit it or not, we have to view our own country through the prism of the English language."
"And when we go to the Highlands and Islands, we find ourselves in amongst a language and an entire culture that we don't understand, that we just don't get."
"It's an uneasy, uncomfortable double vision."
It's Scotland's guilty secret.
And it all began with a feud between two families.
"In 15th-century Scotland, family was everything."
This is the story of two of those families and how their fates were locked together.
The rise of one meant the fall of the other.
Their struggle was epic their names legendary.
They were the Stewarts and the MacDonalds.
There's a story of a medieval Spanish traveller who came to Edinburgh to see the sights.
"When he got home, someone asked him what was the most wonderful thing he'd seen."
"The traveller thought for a moment and then answered,"
"""A grand man called MacDonald with a great train of men after him,"
"""called neither Duke nor Marquis."""
"His name was Alexander, Lord of the Isles,"
we reveal who Donald Trump is running against for President.
"- Plus, we'll show you the winning lottery numbers."
Could 67 be one of them?
- Now our top story:
two prisoners have escaped from the Coral Palms sheriff's station in a daring daylight jailbreak.
"Themen,identified asGregoryStickney andLarrySherbert werearrestedafter aroutinetrafficstop revealed a cache of automatic weapons."
"- Less than 12 hours later, the men escaped by creating a disturbance in their cell."
"- Well, they started kissing, which I'm fine with-- really, I am, kiss whoever you want-- except they were both men."
- Tito Amendola was also in holding at the time and witnessed the jailbreak.
- I do a lot of meth.
- The sheriff's office is coordinating their search with local and state police.
"- If you're watching, Greg and Larry, and I know you are, my men and I will not rest until we find you."
"That's right, we're coming for you."
"- Strong words, and moving on, what if you were going through a drive-thru, and a puppy dog took your order?"
"- The cops are looking for us, and a madman wants us dead."
We should be laying low until the Nine-Nine gets here.
"- Yeah, but we don't know when that's gonna be, and we need food and supplies."
"- Okay, I'll get some water."
"- Holt, are you trying to draw attention to us?"
Nobody drinks water here.
Choose something blue or green.
"- Okay, I guess I'll go in for, uh, the Blazing Blue Rad-berry Cooler Xtreme:"
Code Rad.
- Good choice.
I should probably get some body spray as well.
"What sounds better, Liquid Moan or Turnpike?"
- We only have $17 to our name.
We can't spend five of it on this.
"- I know, but I'm about to see Amy for the first time in forever, and I want to smell like a..."
"""hot New Jersey breeze,"" ugh."
Good call.
"All right, let's get out of here."

Have you any idea how many men the Confederates could bring out of Atlanta against me?
"15,000 at least."
That many?
"Suppose we have a look, Andrews, and see how matters stand."
"Here's Lee, who has his hands full in Virginia."
"And here's Beauregard, who's bringing up everything he's got to fight Grant at Shiloh."
"And here's their east-west railroad, all the way from Alexandria to Memphis, with Chattanooga right in the strategic center."
Here we are.
"So, if I moved down here to Huntsville, captured the locomotives and flat cars, and rode into Chattanooga, all I'd have to fear would be these forces out of Atlanta."
"That's true, sir, but we're right back where we started from."
They can move their soldiers up the railroad from Atlanta and drive you out of Chattanooga in two days.
There are 11 railroad bridges over the Chicamagua.
A man like you could lead a raiding party and burn those bridges for me.
Why not?
"I had a deal with General Buell that when I brought this information,"
I wouldn't go South anymore.
"Soon as I complete this report, I aim to enlist in the 21st Ohio."
You'd leave the Secret Service to become a foot soldier?
"Yes, sir."
"Maybe I won't be any great shakes in the infantry, but at least it wouldn't be hiding under a cloak."
"After just so long, a man has to come out in the open."
"Mr. Andrews, I wouldn't detail any man on a duty of this kind against his will."
But consider what it might mean to the Union.
Cut the Confederacy in two.
"We could shorten the war by half, maybe end it."
[Pittenger] I'd heard from Mr. Andrews sooner than I expected.
"That night a score of adventurous men, most from the 21st and 33rd Ohio Infantry, followed me to a meeting place on a hillside."
[coyote howls]
"- Good evening, gentlemen."
- [all] Good evening.
"All here, Mr. Andrews."
Which are Brown and Knight?
"However, an Egyptian pharaoh Shishak invaded the city of Jerusalem around about 980 BC and he may have taken the Ark back to the city of Tanis, and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls..."
Secret chamber....
"However, about a year after the pharaoh had returned to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year, wiped clean by the wrath of God."
"Obviously we've come to the right men, you seem to know all about this Tanis."
"No, no, not really."
Ravenwood is the real expert.
"Abner did the first serious work on Tanis, collected some of its relics."
It was his obsession really.
But he never found the city.
"Frankly, we're somewhat suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood."
An American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.
Oh rubbish!
Ravenwood's no Nazi.
What do the Nazis want him for then?
"Obviously, the Nazis are looking for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra and they think Abner's got it..."
What exactly is a head piece to the staff of Ra?
The Staff is just a stick...about this big.
"Nobody really knows for sure how high it is... it's capped by an elaborate headpiece, in the shape of a sun with a crystal in the center."
"And what you did was you take this Staff to a special room in Tanis, a map room, a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor."
"And if you put the Staff in a certain place at a certain time of day, the sun shone through here and made a beam that came down on the floor here,"
and gave you the exact location of the Well of the Souls.
"Where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, right?"
That's exactly what the Nazis are looking for!
What does this Ark look like?
There is a picture of it right here.
That's it.
Good God!
"Yes, that's just what the Hebrew's thought."
Now what's that supposed to be coming out of there?

Millions of people around the world believe we have been visited in the past by extraterrestrial beings.

"..and I'm like, ""Sorry?"", and he was like, ""No, I didn't say anything"", and you're getting really angry and it just makes you look mad cos they can't see it."
"I was in the Comedy Store when I started out and I wasn't getting any laughs, I can't remember why, and right in the front row, this girl turned to her mate and said, ""He's lost it""."
That's horrible.
And I let that hold me below the waterline.
"Can you tell me, Rob, about going to Slovakia by mistake?"
"Yeah, I was in Poland and I'd climbed a mountain, as you do, and I was up there at the top, just kind of rummaging around and I actually drank my first Red Bull, this was in, like 1999,"
"and I was just up there and some Polish guy handed me a Red Bull and I drank it and I said, ""This is disgusting"", and I wanted to throw it off the mountain but I don't litter."
"So I put it in my bag and I kept walking and I found this rock in the ground, in the snow with a big S on it and I was just looking at it and some other people came from the other side and I said,"
"""What's this S about?"""
"And they said, ""Oh you're in Slovakia now""."
"And I said, ""Well, how about that?"""
And then I walked down the mountain.
"I'm sure it's a fantastic country, I didn't go further than that."
Does it border Poland?
"It doesn't, which is the weird part."
"No, it does."
That is odd.
It is right there.
It gives you wings.
It's a shock when you wind up there and you didn't plan to.
My mum nearly ended up in Gdansk once.
Ryanair.
"She was on the flight and they were taxiing down the runway in Ireland and then she started speaking to people and they were like, ""What?"""
Where did she think she was going?
London.
"It's a holiday in Ireland and then she started speaking to people and she goes, ""There's a lot of Polish people in here!"""
"She spoke to someone and they said, ""we're going to Gdansk,"""
"and she was like, ""But we're going to London first."""
"Luckily they hadn't taken off, but they'd literally taxied..."

He was serious all along.
In 1993 Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven won four Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.
It's just....
It's just been very nice because I've been directing films for 23 years out of the 39 I've been in tHe business and this comes out of the small films I've made¸:
"Tbe Honkytonk Mans, and the Bronco Billys, and Beguiled in 1969 and a Iot of films where I thougbt I took chances."
"Eastwood discovered His artistry as His audiences did gradually, over time."
"He invented a new kind of movie Hero and then, as He matured sharply criticized His creation."
"He Has never limited Himself to one genre or one kind of filmmaking moving freely between mass-market entertainments and small, personal projects."
Eastwood is an elusive artist an intensely private man who reveals Himself only through His work.
"Today, He remains a complex, contradictory and essential figure in American culture."
I did fall in love with Him the minute He was born.
And I don't think I ever fell out.

"Yes, sir."
Well done.
"Sir, there is something I'd like to do before the launching."
It's a terrible loss...

At least no one will die because of a wound that's left untreated.

Getting the Turtle Ship built...
every moment was mother battle.
It is the blood and sweat of the Left Cholla Navy that built the ultimate assault vessel.
"Those lives that have been sacrificed in the process of its birth, their deaths will not be allowed to end in vain."
We will remember that they were the bravest soldiers of Left Cholla Navy.
Launch!
Heave!
Heave!
Turn the ship around!
Left oars forward!
Right oars rearward!
Fire the cannons!
Fire the cannons!
"April 12, 1592, Chosun's most powerful assault vessel the Turtle Ship made its first appearance on the pages of history after completing its test run."
This was only one day before the outbreak of Yimjin War.
The historical significance of the Turtle Ship goes deeper than being an attack ship.
"It was a brilliant achievement of science and technology built on 5.000 years of arts and culture, and it was the most innovative invention in Korean history."
Twenty-three battles and twenty-three victories...
The Turtle Ship is at the heart of this incredible legend about Yi Soon-shin and his men.
"The architect and engineer of the Turtle Ship Na Dae-yong is a notable scientist that Chosun produced in the 16th century, and Yi Soon-shin who trusted his creative vision and supported him is perhaps the true epitome of a modern leader."
The courage and patriotism of Yi Soon-shin and his men who fought bravely for the next seven years remain as honorable traditions in the Korean navy to this day.
"A main force destroyer in the modem Korean Navy is named after Yi Soon-shin, and three of it submarines are named after Me Dae-yong,"
Chung Oon and Commander of Bang-dap Yi Soon-shin.

"The swarm chased her to her car, all the way from the colony."
That swarm followed her from you.
"You tried to kill Betty, except that wasn't Betty."
This is the queen bee cage you spat when you were covered in bees.
"We found it outside Betty's office, under a swarm."
"And if we tested it for spittle, I'm sure we'd find plenty of yours."
"Well, I have no idea what you're talking about."
The facts were these:
Woolsey Nicholls was madly in love with Kentucky Fitz.
"The operative word was ""madly."""
Betty Bee was a withered hag by the mere fact that she wasn 't Kentucky.
Shortly after Kentucky gratefully accepted Woolsey's offer  to become the new face of Betty's Bees  he discovered her gratitude was insincere  and her intention was sabotage.
Infected bees were found in Kentucky's possession.
She was smuggling mite-infested bees into his new colony.
"Betrayed and brokenhearted, but not sloppy  Woolsey dealt with Kentucky using a means  that would also imply accidental death."
Woolsey Nicholls confessed to the murder of Kentucky Fitz  and attempted murder of Betty Bee.
He never knew the colony collapse was a hoax  or that Betty had stolen back her bees.
Since Kentucky Fitz was like a sister to Betty Bee  Betty Bee was like a sister to Dusty Fitz  and made him her new partner.
Realizing that his colony had not collapsed  but had merely expanded into his-and-her suites  the Pie-Maker labored to make Chuck's suite feel like home.
- Are those my books?
- Yeah.
"And my furniture, and..."
My special pillow.
How...?
Welcome home.
And so the Pie-Maker had come to understand  home did not mean four walls and a door you never walk out of.
Home was a feeling of where you belong.
"For Emerson Cod, home was Lil' Gum Shoe."
The tale of a girl whose father couldn 't find her  so she had to find him.
"Mr. Cod insists it's a work of fiction  but if published, it could serve as a how-to manual for an audience of one."
"For Olive Snook, home was the place she hoped to find herself  and perhaps find new friends with not so many secrets."
So somebody with connections to the Lordship of the Isles went all the way to Rome and brought back this as a souvenir with its image of St Peter carrying the keys of heaven.
"Alexander, Lord of the Isles, held the keys to more earthly kingdoms."
His Atlantic realm faced in two different directions at once.
To the south was Ireland where family and cultural ties were deep.
To the east was Scotland.
"But the Lordship wasn't on the fringes of the Scottish kingdom, it was at its very centre."
The Gaelic world of the Lordship was at the heart of how Scotland imagined itself.
"It was the Gaels who had first unified the kingdom, giving it its Gaelic name, Alba."
Now Gaelic Scotland was enjoying a second golden age.
"If Finlaggan was the heart of the Lordship, then Iona was its soul."
St Columba's island was one of the most important spiritual sites in Scotland.
It was here that the bodies of the Lords of the Isles were brought for burial.
Alexander showered the Abbey and its community with money and gifts.
"Of course, he had good reason."
"Like the best of medieval godfathers, he had a string of mistresses and a pile of cautionary letters from the Pope to prove it."
All this church-building was a kind of spiritual insurance policy.
"But if Alexander MacDonald feared for his soul, that was pretty much all he feared."
"He was Ri Innse Gall, a king in his own land, in a land where there was no king."
Scotland was a kingdom with an empty throne.
Its Royal line had faltered.
Its young king was in the hands of its ancient enemy.
"James Stewart, King of Scots, had been captured by the English when he was only 12 years old."
His family had fought alongside Robert the Bruce during the Wars of Independence.
"When Bruce's bloodline died out, it was the Stewarts who succeeded to the Scottish throne."
"But the sole heir to the new Stewart dynasty was now a hostage - a bargaining chip, leverage."
"It was the same old game, for the same old stakes."
"If the Scottish magnates wanted their king back, they would have to submit to English overlordship."
"""Forget the Bruce."
"""Give up your independence."""
But the Scots weren't going to play by the English rules.
"""No, thanks,"" they said."
"""We're managing fine without a king."""
"rigid boxes, you know."
He--he was his own artist.
He was free compared to me.

(Kahn) The first time I'''d gotte n a real sense of Lou's legacy was when I was a student up the road at Yale University.
"My father was only 5'6"""
but he cast a long shadow in New Haven.
He built his first and last major buildings here:
the Yale Art Gallery in 1953;
"and right across the street, the British Art Center, finished after his death."
I used to wander around in those buildings on weekends.
"They were silent and mysterious, and I half expected Lou to just appear from around the next corner."
There were rows of books about his work in the library.
"He hadn't built very many buildings, but apparently they had changed the course of architecture:"
"the Salk Institute, the Kimbell Art Museum, the Exeter Library, the Capital of Bangladesh."
"My art history professor, Vincent Scully, had been a friend of Lou's , but he always talked about him like some long-dead ancient hero."
It was unsettling.
"(Scully) From the very beginning, he was after symmetry, order, geometric clarity, primitive power, enormous weight-- as much as he could get, like this great monster that stands in the middle of this space."
"You know, as I said too,"
"I think, before:"
enduring monuments.
"He wants his materials to kind of last, permanent work in the world."
That's what he's after.
"You know, it was such a wonderful thing to be close to somebody who really was changing everything."
(Kahn) You said at one point that he wanted to make everything right.
(Scully) He wanted to make it perfect.
Perfect.
"You know, in Jewish mysticism, which I know almost nothing about-- but God can only be known through His works, right?"
"And since the messiah hasn't come yet, hmm, the works of any Jewish architect might be the works of God."
"And you take those pictures of Louie when he's looking into the light when he's enjoying silence like this,"
"because it really is like that, as if he's in some way communicating with this fundamental thing, that God is in the work."
"But it was time for one last effort, or this great opportunity would be lost."
"And so, miraculously, in August the King was well enough to lay siege to Norham Castle, while Moray and Douglas made assaults on the castles at Alnwick and Warkworth."
All of these sieges in Northumbria sent a message loud and clear.
"The Scots, quite possibly, were about to take the north of England."
The threat was real.
The English folded.
"On 1 8th October, whilst at Berwick, Robert issued his conditions."
The King of England must recognise his throne and the independence of the Scottish crown in perpetuity.
"To seal the deal, his son David was to marry the King of England's sister, Joan."
"The English hummed and hawed, but there was little doubt that they would accept all of the important points."
The Bruce had won.
Queen Elizabeth of Scotland died nine days later.
She was sure of her husband's success but she was not alive to see it.
The Bruce's blessings were usually mixed.
"The peace was finally concluded at the monastery of Holyrood, where the Bruce lay ill, on 1 7th March 1 328."
One of the English promises was to return the Stone of Destiny.
"His earls were in attendance, his bishops too, including William Lamberton, who had chosen him, with whom he'd signed a very different document 24 years before and without whom, very likely, none of them would have been there at all."
Lamberton died two months later.
"On 1 2th July, in accordance with the second of Robert's treaty conditions,"
"David, who was only four, and the Princess Joan, who was six, were married in Berwick Church."
Neither king was in attendance.
"One was too angry, the other was too ill."
"Peace at last, after 32 years of struggle and bloodshed."
"The Pope let it be known that he recognised the Scottish throne, and he lifted the ban of excommunication from King Robert."
The Pope was onside.
The gates of hell were firmly shut.
"King Robert, you might think, could be sure of salvation."
But he wasn't.
Guilt weighed heavily on him.
His nameless illness assured him that he still lacked God's grace.
"The crown was his, he wouldn't be parted from it."
"But it was steeped in blood, the blood of his family and the blood of others."
What specific message do you think is the most important?
KI‐MOON:
"Climate change is coming much, much faster."
"We have seen such, uh, extraordinary extreme weather patterns."
"If you consider this vastness of this universe, this Planet Earth is just a small boat."
"If this boat is sinking, then I think we will have to all sink together."
I know that he has been a very committed and effective environmentalist and that is why I really count on your leadership and vision.
ANNOUNCER:
Please welcome newly appointed United Nations
"Messenger of Peace, Mr. Leonardo DiCaprio."
[APPLAUSE]
DICAPRIO:
"Thank you Mr. Secretary General,"
Your Excellencies...
I feel incredibly honored that they chose me to be the United Nations Messenger of Peace on climate change.
"I stand before you, not as an expert,"
I want to do everything I can to learn more about this issue.
See for myself exactly what's going on and what can be done.
But it all kinda seems beyond our control.
"As an actor, I pretend for a living."
I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems.
I believe that mankind has looked at climate change in that same way.
"We keep getting inundated with catastrophic news about the environment every single day, and the problem seems to be getting worse and worse and worse."
"Try to have a conversation with anyone about climate change, people just tune out."
♪ [MUSIC] ♪
"If the U. N. really knew how I feel, how pessimistic I am about our future, I mean, to be honest, they may have picked the wrong guy."
NEWSCASTER:
Hundreds of thousands took to the streets of New York today demonstrating for action on climate change.
NEWSCASTER:
"Secretary General, Ban Ki‐Moon called Leo a credible voice in the environmental movement, which is like calling Jeffrey Dahmer a credible voice for stew."
NEWSCASTER:
Leonardo DiCaprio has just naively bought into the entire global warming hoax.
Arise
"Hero Man, some people stormed the execution area?"
Yes
You have failed to guard it
"Your Majesty, of the nine prisoners they only freed one... and left the others"
They've been at a disadvantage
Hero Man... the Jin have Prince Kang as hostage and are in an advantageous position
It is a great responsibility to guard him ...and it falls on you
"Don't worry, with him under my guard there'll be no problem"
Award hero Man 500 taels of gold... and 50 horses
Yes
"Thank you, your Majesty"
"Among the Princes of Sung,"
Prince Kang is the most smart
The others are slow-witted and can cause no harm
As long as we retain him
We will sure win
Why don't we just kill him?
"It is easy to conquer, but difficult to rule"
"After we devour Sung, we have much use for him"
You wouldn't know about this
Yes
You can lie down and speak
"There are so many of you, how come you were wiped out?"
All have been killed
"Nine of us were captured and escorted to the execution site, I..."
We will go again
Tell us about the situation in Jin
We went in two groups
I was in the first group
Hero Ting Siu led us... and came to the river side
Where are the boats?
- thanks
- ENJOY!
no
why?
I think it's good right?
see
Fujii yes do this by tomorrow tomorrow?
good luck ENJOY!
can't
Imaoka-san
actually
I've waited a million years actually sorry
subs:dancestar24
thank you for waiting no problem
a little tilt please look this way
when a guy is out there are 7 enemies apparently then what about women?
love triangle?
who and who promotion Tamayama Miho-chan serious apparently Tamayama and Miho disappeared during... rumors in the company
I used to listen to it as entertainment but if this continues I will be in the rumors please give me some time
I knew there was a girl around him it was you
Fujii-san and at the end of the love triangle first it will become a rumor in the company then I'll start to suspect him and I'll be right then fighting lastly I won't be able to stay in the company
a life I didn't even imagine before no no
what's wrong?
nothing
smells!
what's this?
sorry one moment
Fujii-san i electronics might be difficult no answer?
but it's already a week by the lastest we were supposed to by this morning but they said to wait when the answer is postponed at about 62% rate the answer is no going from past experience
what about that?
"Wakabe Yuzo, the anime creator"
"The world around me is like a trap, I don't know what I'm saying"
Give me the engagement ring
No
"Give me the ring, I know you have it"
"Give it to me, don't make like Abdelhalim Hafeth"
What can I do with your craziness?
I have to be patient but it's almost over
- Did you look in the mirror?
- A little bit...
You look great
- Pray that I get lucky today
"- God willing, you'll be lucky"
"You look like an officer already, better even then an officer"
"I should go, I want to catch the busses while they're still empty or else the crowds might mess up the suit"
"No, take a taxi so that you can stay calm and say this prayer in front of the exam committee"
Say...
"God, help me overcome all their hurdles and don't forget the two verses seeking refuge in the Lord"
- Bye
- Good bye
"Come in, Hajj"
"Look, Hajj A'azam, ministers and other higher ranking officials... attend openings of new institutes, come in, Hajj"
Thanks to God and you and people like you
I've become a huge institute but I thought Hajj A'azam must bless it himself
"You're very dear to me, Za'atar, and I'm happy for you and the children too, may God add to your wealth"
- What would you like to drink?
- We can only drink coffee
What coffee?
We can drink coffee anytime
Suad...
"- Yes, Mr Selim"
- Get Hajj A'azam some juice
"- Yes, sir"
- A patriot.
Patriot?

"Darling, I am not a fool."
I have read the history of all the lovers in the world.
I then researched it.
After that I loved you.
"And darling, remember!"
lf I get the chance then I will even lay down my life like them!
"Yes, darling."
I will lay down my life!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! shame! shame! shame!
So the third -- the algebra way to look at the
problem is the matrix form and using a matrix that I'll call A.
"Okay, so can I do an example?"
The whole semester will be examples
and then see what's going on with the example.
"So,"
take an example.
"Two equations, two unknowns."
"So let me take 2x -y =0, let's say."
And -x +2y=3.
"Okay. let me -- I can even say right away -- what's the matrix,"
"that is, what's the coefficient matrix?"
The matrix that involves
these numbers -- a matrix is just a rectangular array
of numbers.
"Here it's two rows and two columns, so 2 and --"
"minus 1 in the first row minus 1 and 2 in the second row,"
that's the matrix.
"And the right-hand -- the,"
"unknown -- well, we've got two unknowns."
"So we've got a vector, with two components, x and x,"
and we've got two right-hand sides that go into a vector 0 3.
"I couldn't resist writing the matrix form, right -- even"
before the pictures.
So I always will think of this as
"the matrix A, the matrix of coefficients, then there's a vector"
of unknowns.
Here we've only got two unknowns.
Later we'll have any
number of unknowns.
"And that vector of unknowns,"
well I'll often -- I'll make that x -- extra bold.
They are impervious to heat and magnetism.
These smart arms are controlled by my brain through a neural link.
Nanowires feed directly into my cerebellum... ...allowing me to use these arms to control fusion reaction... ...in an environment no human hand could enter.
"Doctor, if the artificial intelligence in the arms... ...is as advanced as you suggest... ...couldn't that make you vulnerable to them?"
How right you are.
Which is why I developed this inhibitor chip... ...to protect my higher brain function.
"It means I maintain control of these arms, instead of them controlling me."
And now on to the main event.
"Give me the blue light, Rosie."
Precious tritium is the fuel that makes this project go.
There's only 25 pounds of it on the whole planet.
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and Oscorp lndustries for providing it.
"Happy to pay the bills, Otto."
Ladies and gentlemen... ...fasten your seat belts.
"Doctor, we have a successful fusion reaction."
This is a breakthrough beyond your father's dreams.
Thank you.
We're producing a thousand-megawatt surplus.
The power of the sun... ...in the palm of my hand.
Keep calm!
Is only a spike!
Iil soon stabilize!
"Ladies and gentlemen, please clear the room."
We have a containment breach!
"Otto, please get back!"
"Shut it off, Otto!"
Shut it off!
It will stabilize!
Is under control!
I'm in charge here!
Is my money!
I'm in con...
"a minus one and in the second equation a two,"
"and on the right-hand side, zero and three."
"You see, the"
"columns of the matrix, the columns of A are here and the"
right-hand side b is there.
And now what is the equation asking
for?
It's asking us to find -- somehow to combine that vector and
this one in the right amounts to get that one.
It's asking us to find
the right linear combination -- this is called a linear combination.
And it's the most fundamental operation in the whole course.
It's a linear combination of the columns.
That's what we're seeing
on the left side.
"Again, I don't want to write down a"
big definition.
You can see what it is.
"There's column one, there's column two."
I multiply by some numbers and I add.
That's a combination --
a linear combination and I want to make those numbers the right numbers
to produce zero three.
Okay.
Now I want to draw a picture
"that, represents what this -- this is algebra."
"What's the geometry, what's the picture that goes with it?"
Okay.
"So again, these vectors have two components,"
so I better draw a picture like that.
So can I put down these columns?
"I'll draw these columns as they are, and then I'll do a combination of"
40.
"So, please re, remember there's always one more point in time than the number of periods."
"If you remember that or if you recognize that, you'll be okay."
"So, how maNy points in time, 41."
"Zero, one through 40."
How many periods of time?
"Well, it takes two points of time to make a period, so there one less."
"One, two."
"So, what we'll do to make our life simple is we'll assume that the first $10,000 is at the end of the year."
Why did I do that?
I could always start saving at this point.
"But I'm doing it simply so that I can use the formula and, just directly, you know."
"Use the calculator, and do it, and setup."
"We can change that, so don't worry."
"You can start a payment today, and change it."
It's just a minor difference.
How much?
"Another thing that seems a little bit odd or manufactured in this formula is that you are saving at year 40 too, right, you may not be, right or actually messed up saving in between."
"So, but for convenience, we are trying to understand the problem which is got 40 of these guys, alright."
"So, the good news is even though this formula is very complicated, right, you divide this by how much?"
"I mean, you carry it forward by how much?"
One period but there's no money.
How much do you carry this forward by?
39 periods.
How much do you carry this forward by?
38.
Which is the simplest piece of this?
This guy.
Why?
"Because I'm askin g you, what is the future value at this point in time, alright."
"So, the future value of this point in time of this guy is just itself."
"That's the, that's what I mean, if you learn how to travel in time."
But not the animal sliding into number 2: the lungfish.
It can breathe air.
"So when the going gets tough, the lungfish digs deep."
"Three feet underground, it swallows mud to excavate a chamber."
It secretes slime that hardens into an impermeable body bag...
sealing the lungfish away from the drought.
Mud makes a time capsule.
And great bricks.
"Inside its cocoon, the lungfish shuts down."
The comatose lungfish is number 2 because it can remain in suspended animation for up to four years!
"But even in Southern Africa, the rains will come."
[thunder]
[rainfall]
Water dissolves the slime sack.
The lungfish awakes.
Withered and shrunken.
It has survived for four years by cannibalizing its own muscles.
But it has still enough strength to slither to water.
It's an extraordinary feat of endurance.
Only one animal survives longer in far worse conditions.
NARRATOR:
The ultimate survivor hides out in the forests of Canada.
"For the world's largest deer, it makes life a living hell."
Moose are bled dry.
Attacked by a plague of tiny vampires.
It's late summer.
Bloodsuckers the size of a grain of sand swarm at the optimum height to meet a moose.
Ticks.
CO2 from moose breath stimulates the swarm.
"One moose can be home to 100,000 ticks."
Over two months the ticks drink 10 gallons-- that's a moose's total volume of blood.
Infested animals are called ghosts.
I never take any cold showers for example.
And I cannot do all these nice exercises.
But I want to ask you something:  do you like organic food?
Can you raise your hand who likes organic food?
"Yeah, you are the problem."
"Because, every morning I fall into deep depression for ten seconds."
"Because, I sit on the toilet- (Straining sounds) and then, basically, I'll show you what it means."
I make excrement.
Like a baby.
And that's what you do as well.
But isn't it amazing?
"That's not one organic label which allows, my excrements are included, not one, whatever you do when- (Strains) never allows me to be involved."
And that's a problem.
"So, we are in deep shit, because we don't respect shit."
(Laughter)
"We can do a lot of innovations, we can look at things, and make them differently."
We can reduce our ecologic footprint.
"For example, people say,"
"""Please protect the environment; don't make so much waste."""
"Please protect the environment, don't use so much water;"
"""Please protect the environment; don't use your car so often."""
"So this is what we're calling ""environmental protection""."
When we destroy a little less.
"That's the same as if you say, ""Please, protect your child; beat your child only three times, instead of five times."""
We think we protect when we destroy less.
"But it's not protecting, it's only minimizing the destruction."
And this is where we are.
"We make waste all over the planet, and it looks crazy."
Why can't we make a different thing?
Why can't we make a footprint which is beneficial?
But this is what we do.
We try to be less bad.
"""Nice and quiet around here."""
"If there was more land, then he bought some more pigs, a few chickens and some cows."
"""Well that's a fine kettle of fish."""
You know what!
All that grubbing around outside takes far too long.
We're going to fatten you up and fast.
It's not a fairytale storybook.
You're there to be eaten.
"""Errrrr ... not sure that's such a compliment, really."""
"We'll squeeze you altogether nice and efficiently, and you'll all get sick right away."
"""You're telling me ..."""
"Listen Piggy, I'm not interested in your personal vision right now."
"In the Netherlands alone, you lot produce 70 billion kilos of dung, do you know how bad that is for the environment and the climate?"
"""Uh ..."
"I'm sorry for living."""
"Did you know that cows of all farm animals are the largest producers of greenhouse gasses, mostly through all that belching and farting?"
Do you know what the problem is?
You're eating us out of house and home!
"""Who was here so pleased about fattening us up?"""
"But all that food has to come from somewhere, doesn't it?"
So ... we destroy the rainforests and plant soya crops instead.
But the rainforests are really important for the absorption of carbon dioxide.
Then we spray the stuff with pesticides and we ship the soya off the Europe where it ends up in your feeding-troughs.
So well-organised.
What are you people up to?
"""Oh-oh, well that's not our fault."
"Who actually wants to eat meat anyway?"""
"The consumer, OK, is there something wrong with that?"
Well.
"That's a good question, who actually eats so much meat?"
Eating meat is a luxury that we've got all rather too used to.
Don't dare touch our steaks!
"6 divided by 287 and that gives me 0.021, carrying one extra significant figure."
"And if I now take that probability and I plug this into here, I've already done a calculation."
I got a table here.
I find that that diameter to the correct number of significant figures is 0.7.
And the actual diameter of these balls is 0.8.
So you guys did a very great job.
[APPLAUSE]
All right.
This works.
That's how they calculated the diameter of the nucleus.
That's it.
Nothing else involved in this.
That is the principle behind how it was done.
Very simple.
That is the principle behind how the quark was discovered and the size of the quark was revealed.
That is terrific.
"Now, we've got the problem that the scientific community had in 1911, 1912, right after the discovery of the nucleus."
"And the problem is, now we know the atom has got a nucleus, we know it has got an electron, what is the structure of the atom?"
How does the electron and the nucleus hang together?
"In particular, what we have to do is we have to ask what is the force of attraction that keeps the nucleus and the electron together?"
"We are going to talk, here, about this classical description of the atom."
And we've got to talk about the force of the interaction first.
"Well, there are four known fundamental forces."
What is the force that is the weakest force?
Gravity.
Absolutely.
What is the force that is the next stronger force?
Electromagnetic.
Absolutely.
What is the next stronger force?
Weak force.
And the next force?
"Roller skates, reservoirs, anything."
And they will go break that in your home.
"If people have access to the necessities of life, they don't kill, they don't steal, if they are educated properly also."
"Now, for the people that are afraid that there is a bunch of scientists, you would work on the area D, all that is bull."
All that is what you get from the television shows.
There is no need to control people.
"None or whatsoever, in an abundant society."
"We don't want people to have houses, and then go out and buy the furniture."
"We think that, like your automobile."
"You don't have to buy seats, it comes with everything."
So we want to mold all that in the house.
"Jacque and Roxanne build models for films they make, to spread the message of The Venus Project."
"So people say, all my buildings are alike."
They are not.
"If you carefully look at them, there is a widest range of variables."
"Some people say, i don't know that i want to live in a dome."
Your brain is in a dome.
You have been living in a dome all your life.
This is how we make our apartments.
"We change the dive, they changes the shape."
And then pressure.
"Moves a composite material forward, then we cut it."
And then this machine lifts it.
"And this machine, in certain improvement onto that."
Do you understand?
"No humans do any work, any kind of work at all."
Except what you would like to do.
"Art, music, play right, travel, scuba diving."
It wont take 7000 or less people to run everything on Earth.
You need everybody anymore.
"With the advent of automation and nanotechnology, we will make machines enabled to do most of the work."
"There is no such thing as Utopia, as the best as you can design up to now."
So then we're in trouble.
If the three columns of my matrix -- if those three vectors happen to lie
"in the same plane -- for example, if column three is just the sum of"
"column one and column two, I would be in trouble."
That would
"be a matrix A where the answer would be no, because the combinations --"
"if column three is in the same plane as column one and two,"
I don't get anything new from that.
All the combinations are in the
plane and only right-hand sides b that I could get would be the ones
in that plane.
So I could solve it for some
"right-hand sides, when b is in the plane,"
but most right-hand sides would be out of the plane and unreachable.
So that would be a singular case.
The matrix would be not invertible.
There would not be a solution for every b.
The answer would become no
for that.
Okay.
I don't know -- shall we take just
a little shot at thinking about nine dimensions?
Imagine that we have
vectors with nine components.
"Well, it's going to be hard to"
visualize those.
I don't pretend to do it.
"But somehow, pretend you do."
Pretend we have -- if this was nine
"equations and nine unknowns, then we would have nine columns,"
and each one would be a vector in nine-dimensional space and we would
be looking at their linear combinations.
"I'm Moopheus, and I know a lot about you."
Have you heard of the Meatrix?
The Meatrix?
Do you want to know what it is?
OK.
"The Meatrix is all around you, Leo."
It is the story we tell ourselves about where meat and animal products come from.
This family farm is a fantasy.
"Take the blue pill and stay here in the fantasy, take the red pill and I will show you the truth."
Welcome to the real world.
Whoah!
What is this horrible place?
"This is a factory farm, Leo."
"Places like this are where most eggs, milk and meat come from."
How did this happen?
I'll show you.
"In the mid 20th century, greedy agriculture corporations began modifying sustainable family farming to maximize their profits at great cost to both humans and animals."
Factory farming was born.
Animals are packed as closely together as possible.
"Most never see sunlight, touch ground or get fresh air."
Many can't even turn around.
These cruel conditions cause fights and disease amongst the animals.
"To fix this, the corporate machine began systematic mutilation, practices such as de-beaking chickens."
"And they started adding a constant dosage of antibiotics to their feed, just to keep these poor wretches alive."
This overuse of antibiotics breed super strains of resistant disease-causing germs.
Every day we get closer to an epidemic that cannot be stopped.
Eeeuw!
What's that smell?
12 million pounds of excrement!
This pollutes the air and ground water.
That's why communities near factory farms often suffer from high levels of related sicknesses.
"Well, it smells like shhhhh ..."
"You can't do better than 100%, right?"
"So now in stage five, we kind of take this a little too far, right?"
So let me actually just make a little bit of space here.
We take this a little bit too far in the sense that our actin is going to slip out all the way over here.
And it's going to be out all the way over here.
"So we've got a huge, huge gap now."
"And, of course, our titin is completely stretched out."
It's about as stretched out as our titin is going to get.
This green titin protein.
"And now the question is, of course, would you get any force?"
And the answer's probably no.
Because the myosins aren't even touching the actins anymore.
"So really, again, you have zero out of 20 myosins at work."
"And of course, that means that then the amount of force would be zero."
So we go back down to zero.
So this is part five.
"So you can see now, as we've gotten longer and longer, things were good for a while, but then they drifted all the way back down."
"And this curve that I'm showing you, this tension-length curve, is now based on exactly what you see on the right."
"It's based completely on the idea that as you stretch things out, the amount of force changes depending on the length of the sarcomere."
[ape sounds]
Meet the relatives
"These are our closest cousins, the great apes."
We like to think we're different.
"But a few million years ago, we were just the same."
"Now, we dominate the planet."
"Somehow we humans have left apes far behind, or have we?"
Through a series of experiments we'll prove that apes are much closer to us than anyone thought.
Startling images reveal that their instant memory is far superior to ours.
Woman:
"""Lettuce."""
Apes can understand hundreds of words.
[mimicking the sound of apes]
Insults are always a sign of inability
"Happens a lot, For example when a guy tries to get the girl"
"Nothing happens, so he tries to insult her"
Hi baby.
Let's Dance
"Sorry, no ..."
Sl*t
"Insults are really just empty air, We should not pay attention to them...."
Completely!
"Who understands it, it's mpossible to hurt him"
But there are those who take the harsh words in their direction
"For them, it is better to understand thay insults are lies and complex of the offender or the meanness of offending"
"Indeed, how low you need to go if you insult someone weak"
So you're rose above him.
Laughed and forgot
But he remembered and stepped out the window
"Maybe I'm exaggerating,But the essence is clear"
"By the way, is often not only an insult."
And by praise you can understand human values
Someone praises a rich businessman.
And translation:
Yeah cool I also aspire to be like this
"Someone praises a monk, sitting in a monastery And a similar translation:"
I aspire to be like that
But when one praises the monk but reproaches the one that praises the businessman
It's only a clash of values.Full stop
Therefore such criticisms should pass by you
Because this is for you.
That it for him.
Different issues
"Better still, to heal each other with words."
Simply and bluntly
We saw it as an opportunity to develop a crop locally.
It's really volunteers in of our field.
"If you drive around, it's really easy to see right now."
It's going to be turning yellow.
"You can do down the interstate, 65 miles an hour, and you can pick it out."
Once you see it a couple of times.
So it is easy to see.
It's pretty much everywhere.
It's all across the Midwest.
"It stretches into Canada, down into"
Texas.
It's very widespread.
"It originated, probably, in this country with wheat, as a contaminant of wheat."
And that's probably why you see it so widely dispersed.
So we're not the discoverer of it.
We just saw an opportunity to take that plant and do something with it.
So it has very high oil.
"It is 36 percent oil, in the variety that we're working on."
"It's a very small seed, as you've seen this morning."
And it does dry down.
"It has a lot of good things going on in a crop, that you want right out, as a wild crop."
And usually you have to work to get those things.
It doesn't really seed scatter.
It will after a while.
That is how it gets dispersed.
It is usually several weeks after it's ripe that you'll start to see the seed shatter.
"So it holds on to the seed, so you can get it into the combine and do all the things."
"And so, these things sound all easy when you talk about them but when you work on a new crop, these things aren't easy to get to that point."
So this thing started way ahead of every other new crop that we have ever worked on at the lab.
And you have bear that in mind.
It may take tens of years to get to the point where pennycress started.
"So, Win has an opportunity to really take that and move that forward quite a bit and make some real advancements."
"So this is the width, this is the length."
So L plus W is equal to 8.
What is the perimeter of the shaded region?
Fascinating.
Let's do it step by step.
First we can just figure out what this part of the perimeter is.
"And that's the easiest part, right?"
Because what's the perimeter of the whole circle?
"Well, it's the circumference of the whole circle."
Circumference is equal to 2 pi r.
This is the whole circle we're talking about.
"So that's equal to 2 pi times 6, so that's equal to 12 pi."
"This is the circumference of the whole circle, so the circumference of this arc, of this piece, is going to be 1/4 of that, because it's 1/4 of the whole circle."
"So it's 1/4 of 12 pi, so that's 3 pi."
"Now, what we need to be able to figure out is L and W because if we can figure out L and W, we can figure out everything else about this circle."
"And actually,"
"I'm going to continue this problem in the next video, because I think it might get a little involved, and I don't want you to get too confused."
I'll see you in the next video.
"What's a fuck, lord, music store?"
Hi!
Where's your compact disc departament?
"We don't care CDs, only vinyl."
Only vinyl?
Uau!
What blast to the past
The people's still listen to vinyl records?
I don't know.
"Well, me nice still have..."
I am to interview a patient and I'd like to give you some thumbnail sketch of what
Gestalt therapy stands for.
"The Gestalt therapy works on an equation awareness, equal present time, equal reality."
"In contrast to depth psychology, we try to get hold of the obvious, the whole surface of the situation in which we find ourselves, and to develop the emerging Gestalt, strictly on the I and thou, here and now, phrases."
You can see that's a modern battery in there.
We've converted this.
And this battery is connected to a bulb.
And it lights up.
"It's the most simple thing you can make-- a battery and a bulb, the bulb lights up."
And that's all it is.
The clever bit is the wires of the circuit are inside the rotors.
"So when the wires turn, the battery will connect to a different bulb."
Let's try and see that happen.
"So I'm going to turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
"Do it again, I'm going to turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
It changes.
"Do it again, turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
"And that's why it changes each time, because it has moving parts inside."
"But otherwise, it's just a simple circuit."
I think we need to know how to decode.
"This would be no good if we can't decode our message, so"
let's do that.
"First of all, we're going to take our code here, we need to know what the setting was."
"Now, if you notice, in the little windows, we have three numbers."
"It's like a combination lock, like a bike lock."
"Now, I took a note of what those three numbers were."
"Those three numbers, when we started writing Numberphile, were a 13, 9, and 21."
"So the idea is, you would type in your message, and you would get a code."
"The machine itself doesn't transmit, so you would have to write that code on a piece of paper."
So that piece of paper would be given to the radio operator who would then transmit the message by radio by Morse code.
That would travel miles away.
"So now imagine a second German officer, maybe on a ship somewhere in the ocean, now he's tuning into that radio signal."
He can hear the code.
"It's coming in, and he writes it down."
"Now, this second officer will have an"
Enigma machine as well.

GLOBAL STRlKE!
2011
There IS a way we can collectively fight back against environmentally destructive multinational corporations.
"A coordinated global general strike and boycott, combined with personal preparedness, in sufficient numbers, can cause a great deal of economic disruption."
The best tactic?
Non-participation.
- Yes.
- Especially because Java catches jar index offsets.
- If you replace a jar in a running app....
"- Things get very, very interesting. - ..you get horrible, horrible problems."
"- If you try to load a component that hasn't been loaded yet, the jar offset is wrong so it will just give you a bizarre ""no class.found"" error."
It's a bad error.
It's bad.
That is all.
"- Because I noticed it the other day and because I think it's great, when you look at 5.4, they now ship examples in a format where you build ANT and you get legacy, JAR, and WAR versions fully embedded of all the examples from Web Objects"
"If you don't know how these work or you don't know how to build them, they ship with 5.4 examples now."
"Thanks, Pierre and whoever else made that happen."
- It was actually Daryl.
- OK.
Thanks Daryl.
- Thanks Daryl.
- Is that a hand in the air?
- He may have been the shadow we run to the door.
- I just have a quick question for Pierre.
"When you compile those jars into the extension directory, [indecipherable] and you still have to put them back in the [indecipherable], correct?"
- No.
- If you just shovel them in there then you're lost when the application starts?
- Any jars in your slash content extension are going to be loaded before anything else in your class paths.
There is nothing you have to do.
It's even loaded before the library extension.
"If you want to override a JAR, you just put it there."
It's going to be loaded before anything else.
- OK.
"I just want to go through one quick final topic here, and we're running low on time."
Don't repeat yourself really.
I've only got so many jokes.
I have to use the lame ones.
"One of the things that bothered me when I first started using WOlips is I had all these build files for each project, and they were all substantially the same."
"For six months, heavy rains cause rivers to rise."
Forests to flood.
The Amazon and its tributaries overflow an area about the size of California.
Which poses real problems for ants.
Their homes can be covered with over 30 feet of water for months at a time.
"To survive the flood, ants need to build an ark."
It's a raft.
A miracle of biological engineering.
"None of the ants are submerged, or even get wet."
"Their water-repellent bodies push against the surface, shaping it into a bowl-- without breaking the surface tension."
Nature's Noahs are number 8 in the countdown because the ant's ark can ride out the flood for months.
It holds millions of passengers with zero casualties.
Unless it runs into pirates.
Heat is another killer.
"Out of the shade of the forest, the larvae are suffering."
Workers carry them to the edge of the raft and dip them in the cool water.
The fight for survival doesn't end when the colony runs aground.
Scouts race ahead to find a new nest site.
Others unload the women and children.
Soon the ants will be safe in a new nest.
Until the next flood.
Drought is deadly.
"Without water, some animals are forced to leave."
Others do something unbelievable.
Tiger salamanders become cannibals.
"In the shallow ponds of Arizona, juvenile tiger salamanders come in two types-- both with feathery gills."
Mom has no gills and lays eggs.
But not all eggs are created equal.
Scientists discovered the tiger salamander has a unique way to survive drought.
Some eggs carry the genetic blueprints to become harmless plankton feeders.
Others become cannibals.
"A month after hatching, they transform into killers, with big teeth and big heads."
Now what if I tell you that we observe that X 1 was equal to this little value X 1.
"Well if that's the case, then you can come up here and you'll see that X 2 is more"
likely than not to be in this region as.
I'll circle them right here.
So in fact you would expect the conventional mean x one equals little x one to be maybe somewhere around here .
And this would be near 2.1 okay?
Likewise you can see just from this.
"Again, that the variance of x2 would have shrunk."
"Because knowing something about x1 would give us information about x2, and that would decrease our uncertainty about the"
location of x2.
And in fact this expression here tells us how to actually do that.
This mathematically.
"So, so they're conditional distributions."
"A conditional distribution of a multivariate normal is again, multivariate normal."
"We also mention that the linear combination, ax plus a, of multivariate normal random variable x, is normally distributed with mean, a times the expected value of x plus little a, and covariance mix, matrix a times covariance of x times A transpose."
Welcome back.
Well we left off on problem number 13.
But let me start it over just so that we don't get confused kind of doing the problem over the course of two videos.
So number 13.
It starts off with this pattern.
"3, 5, minus 5."
And what it says in the problem is that each even number term is 2 more than the previous term.
And then each odd number term is negative 1 times the previous term.
So we started with 3.
"So let me say term-- let me write it here, term-- term and then value."
And then what we did.
Maybe we could call that f of x or the function.
How did we go from one value to the next?
"So if we make a table, term one is value 3."
And that's just the starting one.
Term two is 5.
"That's because we added 2, we added 2 to 3."
"large molecule, it's going to move very slowly."
"If it's a very small molecule, it will move through fairly quickly."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"When it gets to the very end of that tube, there is a flame there, and it's going to burn off this molecule."
"And depending on the intensity of the fire, that is created because the molecule comes out at that time, creates a signal."
"And that allows us to determine not only how much oil was in the plant, but also the specific components that actually make up that oil."
Let's take a look at the computer here.
"And so this is the controller, and this controls where all the viles are."
And it keeps track of all the numbers.
I know where all my samples are.
"I know how much material is in those samples, and when it is going to be run."
"And after the sample is run, I get what is called a chromatogram."
"And, simply, it's a graph."
This is the signal strength over time.
"And so, I inject my sample here, and as it goes through, every time"
"I get a peak, that tells me that a compound that is coming to the end of that glass tube."
And so this tells me all the different compounds that were actually in my seed oil.
"Now, as a plant breeder, how do we make sense of this?"
All right.
"What I know is, I know what compound this is at the two-minute time period, four-minute, or six-minute time period."
"Well, let's say I'm trying to create a bio-diesel product that doesn't create as much smoke."
Or maybe doesn't gel up under very cold conditions.
Beth Seaton:
Right.
Win Phippen:
So what I would look for is plants that have very high of this compound and perhaps something low in this compound.
Beth Seaton:
I see.
Win Phippen:
And so I can alter the relationship of these different constituents within the oil.
"We'll check that return equals, equals null, just like it did."
"In fact, it looks a lot like the stack, actually."
And here I'm going to show you something kind of funny.
If I go take my stack CCPs pop.
"So if you remember what pop did over here, is it took the front most cell off the"
list.
And in the case of the queue that was the popping operation.
And it turns out the D queue operation is exactly the same.
"If we're empty, right, then we want to raise there."
"Otherwise, we take the head's value."
"We move around the head, we delete the old memory."
So it's not actually the top element.
"I should, actually, be a little bit more careful about my copying and pasting here."
I could really call that front.
It's the front-most element on the top.
But it's like the exact same mechanics work to take a cell off the front in that way.
"Well, that's sort of nice."
"And it's like, yeah, well, since I have some code around I want to go try it."
"My stack, also, kind of does some things useful in push that I might be able to use."
"It's not exactly the same because it's adding it to the front, but it is setting up a new cell."
So I'm going to make a new cell and I set its value.
"Then, it's attaching"
looks a little different.
Let's take a look.
"We omitted a cell, copied the value in, now the goal is giving our pointer to the tail, we want to attach onto the tail."
"So we know that it's always going to have a next of null, the new cell."
"So no matter what, it will be the new last cell and it defiantly needs that value that tells us we're at the end of the list."
And then we have to attach it to our tail.
I'm going to write this code first and it's going to be wrong.
So just go along with me in this case.
If the tail's next is the new cell.
"So if I'm wiring in the pointer from the tail onto the cell we have there, and then we want to update the tail to point to the cell."

Circulation of money used to give money your power
Since the value of money means your work
And without it money do not cost anything.
That can be nice but then you only have what's on that island.
By opening up the borders for others you become more innovative and you get more unexpected creative solutions.
"As a result, you become better at what you do."
We made the Muse app firstly because we enjoyed it and also because there wasn't an app like it.
"Besides being a fun app, it also gives a better perspective on art history."
"Old paintings from for instance the 17th century consist of many details, which can overwhelm spectators."
We're not used too looking at images in that way anymore.
"By focussing on the small parts and making your own image, you create a better view of the overall picture."
After we won the competition we contacted Open Culture Data... ...to see if we can use the basis we made for other museums as well.
These other musea have their own needs and different data.
"Also, we made MuseApp from our own perspective... ...but by using the data and wishes of other organisations we can perhaps use it in other ways."
We've learned a lot by organizing our own app competition.
Getting a result of 27 entries like we did takes a lot of work and energy.
"You need to let developers know what you're doing, but you also need to know what they want."
Sustainability is also an important issue for app competitions.
"We've given out these four prizes, but what happens to an app when the competition is over?"
I heard everything.
"If you don't mind, can I accompany you to the airport?"

"Now we've sampled, we've interleaved this, we've decided how to sample."
"Now the big thing we got to do is simply construct our matrix a, and then solve a large under-determined system, and by the way"
last time in class.
"We solved the large under number of systems in four ways, okay?"
"And we found out by the way that zero inverse looked like, a lot like the"
"l2 optimization, so really we're going to solve it in three ways today."
"Alright, so"
let's come back to our code.
And we first do this.
"Alright, the first thing I'm going to do, is going to take the discrete cosine transform, of the indentity matrix."
"I'm going to map out for every point that's On in the signal, suppose I have a point."
"I figure out, if I have, if I have this signal of 5000 points and I have one point on, I find okay, what would that correspond to?What, how would I discreet cosign transform that point?"
What if the next point were on?
How would I discreet cosign transform that?
"So in some sense, I build up my basis, my way of transforming, so, so essentially right?"
"What's going to happen here, is i'm building up this."
"So I this big matrix that gets me from the signal space to the Fourier space, okay?"
"Okay, and so if I have, if I think about sampling, if I sample with one, zero, zero, zero, zeroes, zero one, zero, I can start thinking about how, what's the connection between these two?"
Okay.
"Yeah, exactly, 5,000 delta functions, as it were."
And seeing what the response is.
"And then what I would do with this, is say, okay great, I've done that."
"And now what I'm going to do, is I'm going to take the 500 that matter."
"In ot her words, I have said, let's sample at 500 different points."
"Well, how would those 500 different points, essentially generate cosined [UNKNOWN]"
DCT components.
There it is.
And that's my matrix a.
This is equivalent to my times psi [UNKNOWN].
This one will take a little meditation time.
Meditate upon it.
Maybe burn some incense.
That appeal attracts people all over the world.
Economic growth in Asia is due to millions of families wanting to give their children a better life.
"The TV series ""Home to the Village"" shows the cruelty of urbanization."
It's not fun to move from a rural community to a tenement house.
In China rice growers get silicosis working in stone processing plants.
"Becoming an industrial worker is not a beautiful thing, you'll agree."
We build dams that flood valleys.
But what is the alternative?
"It's living in the countryside and having six kids, of whom two die."
"The population doubles in a generation, there's war and misery."
But the path of development that's available is not pretty.
And of course we have the impending climate threat.
The US ambassador made a statement in a Swedish national paper that:
"""The climate issue cannot be solved without regulating India and China."""
Scandalous!
He's crazy.
"China emits 3 tons of CO2 per capita, the US 21 tons."
He shouldn't talk until the US cuts emissions to 10 tons per capita.
The United States needs to halve its energy consumption.
Where does your great dedication come from?
It's really fun to work with what I do.
My interest in the world developed into curiosity as to why this shouldn't work.
Why is Malaysia free from malaria?
"Why does Singapore, a tropical marsh on the equator have the world's best health?"
They did welfare investments.
"They had children's health centers, got rid of drugs..."
They created good social development.
People tend to say I paint the world in excessively rosy colors.
But I don't.
Ten million children die each year in the world.
But you have to see the improvements even if huge problems remain.
You have to see the risk of climate change and still say that not many people are dying of it yet.
The algae are more efficient. &amp;gt;
Prof:
Well you're getting at it.
"They are more efficient, but they're more efficient in a particular sense that makes a big difference to rates."
Okay?
This is the difference--this is a still photo and this is a movie.
Okay?
So there's--that's the difference.
It's a difference in rate.
Yes?
Student:
Algae reproduce a lot faster.
Prof:
"That's basically it, yes."
"A single celled alga can probably have two generations per day and-- at least one per day--and maybe even in a warm estuary three per day, whereas a grass is probably going to be lucky to get through two or three generations per season."
Okay?
So there's a difference of perhaps a hundredfold in the rate.
"And the things that are eating them have a much, much longer lifespan."
"So down here what's going on is that the algae, there are not so many of them, but they're cranking over like crazy, and they're getting harvested"
like crazy by all of the planktivores in the ocean.
"So the krill, the copepods, everything that eats algae, is grazing them, and that's keeping the algae at a fairly low level."
They're a long away from their own carrying capacity.
They're in exponential growth rate almost all the time.
"So they're booming along, and it doesn't take so much standing crop to maintain a lot more biomass because they are turning over and reproducing and multiplying so quickly."
So that is why you see this dramatic shift.
"Okay, so that's a bit of the overall description of the world's ecosystems."
Now let's take a look at cycles of matter.
Okay?
"The main compartments are oceans, fresh water,"
"land and atmosphere, and they are exchanging materials all the time."
You're already familiar with the upwelling patterns;
I've mentioned that when I was discussing the Coriolis force.
This is very important.
"Every time I put up a problem and you're reading it, please recognize that this is an opportunity for you to learn the stuff by doing the problem first and then starting the video and doing it together with me."
"This is my main advice to you, take every opportunity to do the problems in the videos."
"So you have lot of testing, self-testing opportunities."
"Having said that, video is the main resource."
What do
I mean by that?
I am not going to give you Powerpoint versions of the video.
"To me,"
"Powerpoint is great, but it also makes you go to sleep."
"Online learning, has huge advantages."
"You can make your own class notes, and I encourage you to, from the video."
"But be an active listener, not lay sitting back having a coffee."
And you can do that too [laugh].
"You know, I am too."
Of course I can possibly watch.
"But I would encourage you to make, be an active participant in the video and hopefully if"
I am interesting enough right?
"But I will provide you very few notes, and these are"
largely geared towards stuff that you need to know at one place.
So two or three of these.
"Review of Statistics, some notes on how to use Excel or a Financial calculator, and some formulas put together to."
"But I must emphasis, don't go by the how to do things."
"First understand what the heck is going on, and why."
Another resource I'll give you is there are many textbooks written on Finance.
Finance took off in the late 50s.
"And for the next 30 years, there were a lot of really great breakthroughs."
And those breakthroughs from the fundamentals and great textbooks are available.
"And I'll give you some, I'll give you references."
"But there is one textbook which you may want to look at, which is free on the web, written by a colleague who allows you to read the stuff free not download."
And so on.
"So please when you use this textbook, don't try to download the stuff."
Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.
"Now, which would you rather be?"
"A grid, or manifest destiny?"
Manifest destiny.
(Laughter)
It's a big deal.
"It sounds big, it sounds important, it sounds solid."
It sounds American.
"Ballsy, serious, male."
And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.
"I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day."
"We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?"
"Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one the moment they saw one."
"And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key, rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway, and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle."
(Laughter)
Why?
Why?
Why do you want to do that?
Why do we all want to do that?
I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.
(Laughter)
"It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are."
So we're going to go straight into this.
Can I have the lights off for a moment?
"I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly that represent the current split, architecturally, between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution."
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.
"One very young, one a little more mature."
"This is the work of a firm called SHoP, and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park."
Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?
"Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it."
"This is just the outline of it, and you can see, does it look like a regular building?"
No.
"Because, if they were down at the South Atlantic, it'd take a while for somebody to get to them."
And so we'd throw that out 150 ft above the deck and you try to wrap it around
"like, here's the capsule, and the wind is -"
"They'd put two small ones, the capsule, and then the other two."
"And they're tied together, so they'd wrap right around."
"And then then you'd drop your paramedics, and those guys were good."
They were experts in nine fields.
"They're paramedics, mechanics, parachute guys, anything."
Great bunch.
So we did this for a while and really got it down.
They'd mark spots like you do in the side window and they guided you in.
"I'd be on hot mike in the back, and they'd be looking out seeing the thing."
"The capsule, and the logger?"
Yep.
They'd see the capsule and the logger because they'd nod their head one way and you'd go one degree
"left, two degrees right."
"And then they'd jump, just like that."
And it didn't make any difference what the wind was doing.
"One night, them seas had to have been ten feet high and blowing the top right off them."
Middle of the night.
"And we went up to 20,000 feet so a couple million candle [?] out the back end."
Flares.
And then we'd go back down.
But then the astronauts show up and so we flew to Houston twice for a weekend two different times out in Houston.
And we went out there because they had different equipment.
And they also wanted to see who was going to pick them up.
If they got in trouble...
"So they get on the plane, and it's funny because all I had was a stack of wood pallets with a piece of plywood on it and the flight [?] around a couple power cords so they could have - they call it [?] - search and"
"locator ... anyway, they were just improving on this to find the capsule."
"That was back in the early 60s, you know, sort of primitive."
"So, they're on the plane, and I never gave it a thought."
"You meet them, and you're working with them and they go out and fly with us and they'd see what I was doing in the cabin and they were offering advice on what it was like and the scuba guys and the whole bunch, we all worked together."
"In Gregorio Marañón or in Castelar, I don't know."
"That moment, when the people were crying and hugging."
"People coming from the northwest and people from the northeast, it was also a moment of..."
"Just over a month had gone by and these people were still getting emotional over little things like that, to meet in a square again coming from different parts of the city."
"They were very emotional moments, and nobody, whether they're for or against what was happening, can deny that there have been moments of emotion. sharing things that don't usually happen in politics."
"They don't usually happen, but that's politics too."
Empathy is pure politics.
Those were three emotional moments that I experienced.
"And the worst, probably what happened in Barcelona."
"I mean what happened at the gates of the Parlament, violence as an answer to whatever, but in the end violent outbreaks of tension."
That somehow fractured part of the message that we were sending out.
That was a very sensitive moment.
But it also consolidated the movement.
"Because people went out to the street to prove that that was just an isolated episode and not what we're about, that is not what defines us."
But it was a complicated episode.
Another bad moment...
ST:
I'd like you to find something that you experienced.
"That you witnessed or that affected you, that made you feel bad."
In my case it's obvious.
There were maybe two.
"The violence on the 5th in the Ministery of Interior, or the 4th of august which was the first contact and not very violent, but for me very surprising."
And afterwards undoubtedly on the 17th I took that video and got home trembling.
I experienced that and it was terrible.
I don't know if you...
JL:
I wasn't there that day.
ST:
"It doesn't have to be in that sense, I don't know."
Frustrating.
"Or if you don't remember, I'm happy for you."
JL:
We won't stand for tyranny!
O king: and it's too late to apologize.
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late!
"We've paid your foolish tax, read the acts, and they just won't do."
"We want to make it clear, we believe this much is true: all men were created with certain unalienable rights!"
"Among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!"
It's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
It's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize!

In this session we値l be talking about Renaissance and the landscape that incorporated the time roughly from the 14th to the 17th century.
We値l be talking about Italy and the Italian philosophies and different design styles and how they set a pattern for the rest of northern Europe which became known as the Northern Renaissance.
The Renaissance was a cultural movement.
It began in Italy in the late Middle Ages and then spread to the rest of Europe.
The ideas from the Renaissance have disseminated from around the 15th century across Europe.
"It was really this resurgence in classicism and it was a time of development of linear perspective, artists and rendering techniques, realistic type paintings and gradual educational reform."
The tortoise and the hare are racing to see who can run 100 feet in the shortest amount of time.
Net short term effect on the state's budget?
Zero or worse.
It is not about the budget.
It is really not.
"It is not about the budget in Wisconsin, it is not about the budget in Florida, it's not about the budget in Ohio, it is not about the budget in Michigan."
"But what Michiganders know, and what Michiganders have been trying to get the rest of the country to pay attention to, is that what these Republicans are doing in the states, is not just 'not about the budget'."
It's about something way worse than that.
Stay with me for a moment here.
There is more to this.
This is our house.
Kill the bill.
This is our house.
Kill the bill.
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Why are these people in Michigan so loud?
Why are these people in Michigan so mad?
"Not just because they haven't won yet, like the protesters in Wisconsin have, it's because Michigan Republicans are telling them, that they are about to lose their right to elect local government."
The governor's just going to take care of that from now on.
"See, the governor knows best."
"This whole democracy thing, turns out, it's very inefficient."
And haven't you heard?
There's a crisis.
"Big government conservatism gets really, really, really astonishingly big."
That's next.
"The Michigan House has already passed, and the Michigan Senate is about to pass a bill that sounds like it is out of a dystopian leftist novel from the future."
"If you think that Republican governors around the country are using fiscal crisis as a pretext, to do stuff they wouldn't otherwise want to do, this is something I don't think I every would have believed Republicans even wanted to do."
But this is what they're proposing.
"This hasn't really gotten much national attention, but please just check this out."
"Governor Rick Snyder's budget in Michigan is expected to cut aid to cities and towns, so much, that a lot of cities and towns in Michigan are expected to be in dire financial straights."
But the growth arc is not going to be in power level.
It's going to be in something else.
So that's just one way to look at characters.
It's not the only way.
But it is one way to view your characters.
"Almost every good character... they may move along this but almost every good character is going to start of with a little smidge of this, and a little smidge that."
"And so, I will add under the ""aspire to be,"" which is kind of the same concept, but: they are an expert at something."
In other words they have a superpower.
And their superpower might not be something we normally think of.
A great example of this is going to be Sam from Lord of the Rings.
"He is superhumanly loyal, would you not say?"
He has one attribute.
Everything else about him is basically goofy and befuddled.
The midget in the world of giants.
And yet he has this one super quality that all of us would love to have.
And because of that he consistently polls as people's favorite character from Lord of the Rings.
"In fact there is a lot of discussion that he probably is the hero of the whole story, is Sam."
And that is because Sam has this blend down really well.
"Yes, he's kind of a fool in a lot of ways, but he has this one thing that is defining about him."
"And it's something that, when you look, you say ""yeah, I wish I could be Sam, for that moment."""
"So, an expert at something."
The other one I'll add up here is that they are proactive.
Have we talked about proactivity?
Did I do anything about this?
"I think I talked about it in the first week, or maybe the second."
Keep in mind that you don't need to do all of these.
And there are a few more I'll throw up here.
These are all tools in your toolbox that you can use to increase the level of sympathetic... the sympathetic nature of a given character.
If you can combine them all - great.
"In fact, pretty much everything up here are things that you should try to put in almost every character."
"But it doesn't mean you can't have one that leaves out one of them or two of them, or something like this."
These are the ways that we make people sympathetic.
"Pale skin shows through, where the intensely itchy animal's rubbed off 80% of its hair."
"These ghosts are sick, starving, and fatally anemic."
But the ticks live on.
Females remain dormant in the ground for weeks.
"In Africa, some species survive without food for much, much longer."
"In harsh environments, big mammals are few and far between."
So a tick finds a shady tree and heads underground to wait... and wait.
Ticks are ultimate survivors because they can sit waiting for a blood meal for ten years!
"We've seen ten of nature's toughest animals-- battling adversity for days, months, and years."
"But only the tick can survive without food for a decade, which is why it's number 1!"
even as I put it in my last incarnation:
"""Everybody's got something to lose except for me and my monkey"""
Hi!
How can we survive without overusing nature's resources?
It's of vital importance here to maintain a balance.
"This is what we examine in this unit, focusing on fishing-- trying to find the best strategy that serves both humans and nature."

THE CONCUBlNE  Concubine to the King Korean movie - 2012
"Once again, I am so sorry."
That one doesn't know front from back.
"It would have been nice to have your son join us, as well."
"No, not at all."
He isn't my son at all.
"So, let's take the extreme case scenario, you are doing a regular job and you know 40 years from now, you are going to retire."
"My point there is, you have more control on that, but sometimes people don't."
People have jobs where they are dependent on their employer on how many years they work?
"But forgiven, I mean you won't go to a financial advisor and say, how many years do I retire?"
"The person will give you an answer but [laugh] , you know, will charge you a lot money for giving the answer, right?"
"So the 40 is also information that you should know, 10,000 is the information you should know and now the eight%."
I'm going to violate the assumption that I said make at the back of your mind.
"But to be fair, I never said assume is not there."
"I said, I know it's there, keep it in the back of your mind, but for convenience's sake, ignore it."
And that is risk.
"So, let me ask you this, who determines the eight%?"
"And if you can answer that, you have arrived."
And the answer is simply nobody.
"If, if anybody knew what the interest rate was in the future for the next 40 years or something, you know, they would, they would be omnipresent."
They would know the future.
We are wanting to be like that.
But I think the beauty of
life is nobody knows.
"And in fact, one of the most profound developments in Finance in recent years, I, I should recent say last 40, 50 years that gets challenged because it's a good idea."
"Bad ideas don't get challenged, right?"
Good ideas get challenged.
"So, the notion there is that nobody in a good market should be able to tell the future because everything we know is already in the marketplace, right?"
That's why I said competitive markets at the beginning are extremely important to what we do.
"So, quick question."
Who determines the eight%?.
And the answer is you.
And this is where I have to bring in risk a little bit.
Why?
"Because eight percent let me tell you, if you get over the next 40 years, may the force be with you."
[laugh].
Because it is not going to be easy.
"You have to take risks to get high rates of return, and with risk comes volatility."
"Andfor real man, this is it."
You know.
"I've talked about how I faked rage when it came out to these stupid memes that I wanted to be popular and that sort of thing, man."
Don't get it wrong.
"The rage as it pertained to the political and the social components and the capitalist components, they were genuine."
They were 100% genuine.
"As a matter of fact,"
"I was a pretty livid guy back in the conservative days, man and believe it or not, I had health problems during that time."
"I had a lot of health problems that that .... that were inspired or transpired because of me thinking about all these subject, you know."
"And believe it or not,"
"I found that utilizing this show as a way to exert all that angst that I had was comfortable and if somebody listened, that's fine."
"If they didn't, you know, it's good."
"I mean, it didn't really-- I didn't really do it for the money."
"I mean, if I did it for the money,"
I would be -- I would've put out books and shit.
"I would've done that shit, but... anyway..."
"It is necessary, are you kidding me?"
It is necessary.
"No, the show's not gonna be back this fall."
"No, no, no."
"Fuck no, I am not going to fucking continue to fucking have a venue for these idiots to, you know, I don't know, to do whatever it is that gets them off or whatever whatever it is that sustains the continuity of these sons of bitches as it relates to their goddamn trollin'."
"Well, I'm just not gonna do it anymore."
"I'm done here, man."
"I see we got a whole bunch of people here so I'll stay in here for a few more minutes, but it's over man."
"I mean, like I said, I'll come into this room and not to mention, the people that I have talked to about making actual businesses with, I am not joking, you know what I mean?"
I'm not joking about that whatsoever.
"I am sincere when I say that you know, I want to make businesses."
"I want us to make money, you know."
And ...
I'm sincere when I say that man.
But I got a lot on my plate on top of all this stupid online ridiculous bullshit.
"You know, a lot of people depend on me for a lot of shit and I know it seems that"

"If, in everything that surrounds me."
Do you think that technology is important to survive or could you live without it?
"Not survive without it, it has become a necessity."
What kind of technology do you use?

Do you dependent on some technology?
"If, to communicate with other people"
Do you know use social networks?
"Yes, are very simple to use"
How do you think the world has changed thanks to technology ?
"Technology has completely changed the way of life of the people, how they work, how they speak, and its needs changed."

"Ellen Langer, as we move increasingly towards an information society away from muscle power increasingly to brain power, how to think how to learn."
"Yet, you've introduced the concept of ""mindfulness"" that really challenges what is the most effective way of learning."
"Walk us through what the basic principles of what ""mindfulness"" are."
"I think the best way to understand it is to realize that all that we've learned and the way that we've learned how to learn teach us to search for ""certainty."""
Because then you think you know it.
"Uh huh -- but ""certainty"" leads to ""mindlessness."""

The only one I want to look up from
Assignment one is question eight because this one has a little bit of mathematics in it.
It relates to that proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
And you'll recall from a lecture that a key part of that was taking this number N that you get by multiplying the first
little n primes together and adding one.
"And at the time, I actually mentioned that this number is not always prime, well, how do you prove that?"
"Well, you prove it by exhibiting a sequence of prime numbers for which it's not prime."
"So, you start by looking at the primes and you sort of say, well, two x three + one, in that case, you get seven."
Then seven is a prime.
"So, let's go one more, two x three x five + one, you get 31."
That's also a prime.
"Well, let's do another one, two x three x5 x seven + one, that's 211."
That's also a prime.
"Well, at this point, you might beginning to lose heart, but if you keep going just a couple more until you get two x three x five x seven x eleven x thirteen + one, then in that case you get 30,031, which is equal to 59 x 509, which is not prime."
"And so now, we've exhibited a number of this form."
Let me put parenthesis in here.
Just to separate things out.
Oops.
"You don't actually need them, because of the conventions that multiplication dominates over addition."
But let's put them in anyway.
"And in this case you check one, two, three, four, five, the first six primes, add one, you get a composite number."
"That shows that this number is not always prime, okay?"
And that takes care of assignment one.
First we'll deal with the controversial bit.
This car belongs to Ferrari.

"It not only has audio, video and images, but for the first time, it's a broadcasting medium that can except a whole lot of text."
"So, there's a whole lot of stuff typically going on at once."
Its also a great interruption system.
"It's feeding us messages, alerts, our access notices, tweets, Facebook updates all the time and again that's one of its powers as a medium, but it's also very distracting."
"And finally, and due to many of those, its encouraging a constant multitasking, constant juggling of visual stimuli as well as actual jobs."
So I think it's all those things combined.
PETER NORVlG:
"Now one of things that stuck me, you cite Maryanne Wolfe, whose an expert in this area, and she says 'the web returns us to the time of scritura continua', which is like the Latin script where there are no spaces in between words and supposedly its an additional cognitive task to be able to separate that out into spaces and so deciding not to click on a link is this additional cognitive blow."
"Now ironically, that paragraph had a footnote at the end of it."
And looking up that footnote took me about twenty to thirty times longer than it would've taken if I would've had that book online and really got me out of the flow and I got really distracted.
(Laughter)
"And I also wanted to say that from what I know of the task of word segmentation, it's really not that difficult."
That Chinese and Japanese don't have spaces between words; they have no problem doing that.
I have a little example from my text book where I have a ten line program that does word segmentation with ninety percent accuracy.
So that not really so bad and maybe hyperlinks are so bad either.
"And maybe, its that we have to train ourselves that"

"OK, next one I'll go through pretty quickly."
"Awake from insertion, it's the EO constructor."
If any of you have ever tried to use the actual Java constructer in your enterprise objects you probably quickly discovered that wasn't really a good thing to do.
"If you want to do your initialization in awakeFromlnsertion, it's the place to set defaults for your enterprise objects."
The little known fact that I want to point out today is that it can get called more than once.
"Two cases have been pointed out recently, Java client and nested editing context can result in this getting called more than once."
In order to protect yourself the best practice is to check to make sure a value is null before you set the default.
"If not, then probably something else has been done with that object and you don't want to go back to the default."
- There is also the init method you can override if you're using Wonder which checks whether it's a temporary global ID or not.
If you deleted an object from an editing context and do an undo on the editing context it gets reinserted.
"- Oh, that's another good point, yeah."
- You want to set up the default values there.
Use in it or check whether the global id is a temporary global ID or a non temporary.
"- OK, now a few quick Java ones, exception handling."
Don't do this.
How many times have I seen code...
I thought somebody would like that.
Don't write code like that.
Just don't do it.
"I've seen so many people do that and it's just,"

"Don't worry about it."""
"Sooner or later, yeah, it does happen."

That does occasionally happen.
"For me when that happens I always put a comment in that catch, and explain why I'm doing that."

"- Well, something really funny always happens to us because to every event we go, we devirtualize with the people."
"And it is really funny, because you are talking for 20-30 min. with a person, and suddenly you say, Hi I am Fiori Alvarez and the person gets surprised - ""really? so nice!"
"I follow you""."
"So, the relationship becomes so personal that you end up being a friend of a lot of people but, real friends, real solid friendships, as in 2.0 as in ????"

"And, these four options that I'm going to talk about are, are, are out of that standard."
And the first one is called the baseline approach.
"And, what the baseline approach does is have you apply a set of controls to achieve some baseline level of protection for all systems."
"And, oftentimes, it's called a gap analysis."
"So, and I'll show, actually, I think it's the very next slide."
"I'll, I'll show you."
I was going to draw a picture.
"But I'll,"
I'll just show you the picture on the next slide.
It should look a lot better than the one I would draw.
"And the list of controls, as you would guess, given that"
ISO promulgated the guidelines for management by security is in the ISO 27001.
The same count rate.
"It doesn't sound like a very interesting experiment, but at that time he was working with a person named Geiger, a post-doc named Geiger."
The same Geiger as the Geiger counter.
And Geiger wasn't too happy about the results of these experiments.
"And in addition,"
Geiger had this undergraduate student hanging around the lab.
This undergraduate named Marsden.
And Marsden was really excited about doing science.
He just hung around there.
He really wanted to do something.
"And Geiger was, jeez, what am I going to do with this guy?"
"Geiger goes to Rutherford and says I've got Marsden here, he really wants to do something, what should I do with him?"
"And Rutherford said well, okay, let's have him build a detector that can swing around that gold sample."
"Let's have him build a detector that will rotate around such that the detector can be positioned this way, so that we can look for any alpha particles that might be backscattered, backscattered meaning scattered back in the direction from which they came."
"And Geiger said ah-ha, this will keep this guy busy and not in my hair."
No problem.
"So he goes down to Marsden,"
Marsden is all excited to build this detector.
"He builds the detector and gets Geiger, okay, we're ready to go."
Let's try this.
And so they put the radium bromide there in this arrangement.
"They're sitting there at the detector and they hear tick, tick, tick, etc."
"Hey, particles at the detector."
"And they go, oh, well, that must just be a general background."
"So what they do then is they take this gold foil away, so that presumably all the particles are going in that direction and they listen and they hear nothing."
And they put the gold foil back.
"And they listen and they hear tick, tick, tick, etc., 20 alpha particles per minute."
"And they then pick another foil, platinum foil, basically the same result."
"They go up to Rutherford, they get him down in the laboratory."
"Rutherford's looking over their shoulder, tick, tick, tick, etc."
"Hey, there are some alpha particles coming off."
Not many.
The suitors are doing all the wrong things when it comes to xenia.
"When they cross this threshold and act so ugly, in such an ugly way to Odysseus."
"Yeah, they're, they're treating a beggar poorly, and they should have treated a beggar better."
But they're also running afoul of this critical code that is built into what it is to be Greek.
You ought to treat strangers well.
"So, it's not just that you're doing something that's a little bit rude to this one person, you're violating a core social custom of what it is to be a Greek."
So these suitors are violating something quite strong here and being quite so rude to Odysseus.
"Also, they are violating a code that is a strong, strongly knitted into the Greek cultural fabric."
But it also comes from Zeus himself.
So they are committing a kind of offense against Zeus by not treating a stranger well.
And this comes out.
Gods arrive and disguised in every way.
We hear again at page 370.
Gods arrive disguised in every way.
That person who you don't who it is could be god.
You should treat them well.
"And if you don't, you are violating even the great authority of Zeus."
"Looking forward to book twenty, one of the suitors comes up and says, you want a guest gift, you beggar?"
"Fine, I'll give you guest gift."
"And takes an ox hoof and he hurls it, hurls it at Odysseus."
Further perversion of the custom of the xenia.
"What you are supposed to do is not take the hoof which can be used as a weapon, but take the meat which is nourishing."
"Give it to somebody who comes to your house, take care of them but they're not doing that."
"As this book, you know, carries forward book seventeen."
We see further Eumaeus develop in his role as messenger.
He brings a message from the stranger to Penelope at 371.
"Then comes back and, and talks to Odysseus and Odysseus asks then Eumaeus to bring a message back to Penelope."
"That message of Penelope, hey, stranger who has just washed into my house."
I'm so far away from my husband.
Maybe you'd like to have a private audience with me?
And invites him to go ahead and come on in and talk to her.
"Already a little bit forward, that maneuver."
That's what I think the drawing implies.
"They say the inside of a rectangular carton is 48 centimeters long, 32 centimeters wide and 15 centimeters high"
OK.
So that's the inside.
Kind of from the other wall.
This is the floor of the inside of the container and then there would be another up here.
But I think you get the idea.
The carton is filled to capacity with k identical cylindrical cans of fruit that stand upright in rows and columns as indicated in the figure above.
OK.
So this is like a top view of it.
"So we could say that this side up here, this is 48 and then this is 32."
"So we don't care so much about the height, I think."
"So, let's see, the carton is filled to capacity with k identical cylindrical cans of fruit that stand upright in rows and columns as indicated in figure above."
If the cans are 15 centimeters high--
"OK, so each of the cans are exactly 15 centimeters high."
So they literally are exactly as high as the carton.
"If the cans are 15 centimeters high, what is the value of k?"
So we have to figure out how many of these cans will fit in this area essentially?
And then they tell us point number one: each of the cans have a radius of 4 centimeters.
Radius is 4 centimeters.
"Well, if we know that each of them have a radius of 4 centimeters then we know exactly how much square area each of these circles will take up, assuming that they're packed exactly like this, right?"
"Because if you think about it, what is this area right here?"
"Well, there's a bunch of were different ways you could think about it."
"The easiest is that if the radius is 4 centimeters, that the diameter right here is 8 centimeters."
"So if this is 8 and you have a 48 length, you can only do 6 of these, right?"
6 times 8 is 48.
So you can only do 6 that way.
"And then if the diameter is 8 this way and this length is 32, you can only do 4 this way."
"So statement number one, alone, is enough to figure out how many you can put."
It would actually be 4 times 6.
"You could put 24, k would be 24 cans that you could fit in."
"So statement one, alone, is enough."
(robotic voice) How do you feel?
(robotic voice) How do you feel?
I do not understand the question
What is it Spock?
I do not understand the question Mother
You are half human.
The computer knows that.
The question is irrelevant.
Spock...
"The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings."
"But as my son, you have them."
They will surface.
"As you wish, since you deem them of value."
But I cannot wait here to find them.
Where must you go?
To Earth.
To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
"I do this because I was there,"
Spock.
Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one?
I would accept that as an axiom.
"Then you stand here alive because of a mistake made by your flawed, feeling, human friends."
They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the one
-you- was more important to them.
Humans make illogical decisions...
"They do, indeed."
"Hey guys, my name is Tim Schmoyer and it's Wednesday, time for some YouTube tips and advice and this week I want to talk about the new YouTube trailer option that we had to add to our new one channel design that had rolled out like a couple of weeks ago."
"I've actually already talked about this on the ReelSEO channel which you can click right here and go watch that, but I want to take it a little bit further this time, because what I said there is some things that I have observed about what makes channel trailers work well and what kind of doesn't, just based on the limited, you know, interaction I seen with them across several channels that have already implemented it."
And now YouTube's coming out with some best practices that they are seeing as well and actually almost everything I said in that original video is also what YouTube is saying so I feel a little bit proud of myself about that.
But let's look at what they say and then I have another tip to add to the end that I think is very vital and crucial that they don't include.
"But first of all, the first thing they say is to have a very clear call to action to subscribe."
"If you did capture them, which we did occasionally, you could use it until it runs out."
"But without a code sheet, you would have to break the code."
And you would have to do that with mathematics.
-What was the key?
What was wrong with Enigma?
What was its weakness?
DR. JAMES GRlME:
Let's have a look at what the flaw is in the Enigma machine.
"So the Germans thought it was unbreakable, but there is a flaw."
If I press a letter K--
"For this quiz, your goal is to define a procedure."
We'll call it abbaize.
"This is very useful if you need to come up with names, and what it does is take 2 strings as its inputs and outputs a string that is the first input, followed by 2 repetitions of the second input, followed by the first input."
"As an example, if we called abbaize, passing in the string 'a' and the string 'b'-- single character strings-- what we should get as a result is the string 'abba'."
"If we called abbaize, passing in the string 'dog' and the string 'cat', what we should get is the string 'dogcatcatdog', and there aren't any spaces between the strings."
They're just all pasted together.
"Ermira, you have led the session many times, what would you say about it?"
This is the last chance you have as a trainer to do teaching practice actually.
"And it's your last chance to make sure that all the participants have understood correctly the importance that children should have to make this working groups alone or in pairs or working as a group of five or more, depending on the number of children they have."
"But in the same time, it's the last chance for them as well, for the participants, to make sure that they can prove to themselves that they can do it and can demonstrate they can use this techniques."
Then let's plan together.
Do you agree to plan together to see what kind of supplies we can make for work?
The following incident is a reenactment.
Professional actors will depict different characters in each episode.
"(BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP)"
"ME, ME, ME"
It's my day off.
I can't reach it.
Ugh.
(And there was another drive-by shooting today...)
"Blah, blah, blah!"
Get to the weather already.
"So we went back to these specimens and we started digging around, and particularly, we looked into the teeth of skulls, hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers, and we found much better quality DNA."
We found nuclear mitochondrial genes.
It's there.
So we got it.
OK.
What could we do with this stuff?
"Well, George Church, in his book, ""Regenesis,"" has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented DNA."
"We would hope that we'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form, and then, much like we've done with the Lazarus Project, get that stuff into an egg of a host species."
It has to be a different species.
What could it be?
Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil?
"They're related, distantly, to thylacines."
And then the Tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end.
"Critics of this project say, hang on."
"Thylacine, Tasmanian devil?"
That's going to hurt.
"No, it's not."
These are marsupials.
They give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean.
That Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth.
"It is, shortly, going to think it's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world, so maybe it'll need some help to keep it going."
Andrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time.
"And it's sort of in the future, we haven't got there yet, but it's the kind of thing we want to think about."
"They took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA and they spliced it into a mouse genome, but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine DNA produced would appear blue-green in the mouse baby."
"In other words, if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA, it would be able to be recognized."
"When the baby popped up, it was filled with blue-green tissues."
"And that tells us if we can get that genome back together, get it into a live cell, it's going to produce thylacine stuff."
Is this a risk?
You've taken the bits of one animal and you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal.
Are we going to get a Frankenstein?
Some kind of weird hybrid chimera?
And the answer is no.
"God was throwing thunderbolts down like Zeus in the cartoons, but churches, they built churches on hills as shining beacons."
"And, as such, they attracted lightning bolts."
"And when these churches were hit by lightning, it often destroyed them, and a lot of bellringers got killed from that lighning."
"And the clergy, who were doing their best to suck up to god were at a loss to explain how this was going on."
What was happening here?
Why did god dislike them so much?
"So, based on his understanding of electricity, Ben Franklin, who was a deist, solved the problem with his lightning rod, and his lightning redirection system in 1749."
"And, today, all churches, lo and behold, have lightning rods."
"Yet, they claim god is still protecting them."
I find that amusing.
What about rainbows?
"Well, in Genesis 9:11, we have god talking to Noah."
This is right after the flood.
"And god says, 'And I will my covenant with you."
Neither shall flesh be cut anymore by the waters of the flood.
"Neither shall there be flood to destroy the earth.' And god said,"
"'This is a token of my covenant, which I make between me and you and every"
living creature that is with you for perpetual generations.
"I do set my bow on the cloud, and it shall be forever a token of the covenant between me and the earth.'"
"So, according to the bible, rainbows are a remembrance of god's promise not to kill everything on the planet again."
-Promise not to kill again with a flood.
He can kill it again in other ways.
- Okay.
"And you can contrast this rather silly kindof creepy story with the Feynman lectures on physics, where Richard Feynman explained how and why rainbows appear the way they do."
"And he worked out the angles and the diffraction of the light and all this good stuff, and there's no psychopathic connotations and there's a lot of beauty."
And that's what science has done instead.
"So, materials science."
"So, say you're god and you wanted to communicate a message to humanity."
"And if you wanted to write something on a slate or a tablet, and you wanted it to last for centuries, you might use sapphire-coated titanium."
That might be a good choice for a writing surface to send a message.
-I'm down with that.
"The thing is I'm pretty sure if I'm a god, and"
This discotheque owner is also DJ in order to save money.
The only cost for music is the two percent to composer and lyricist.
A cost of no more than SEK 200 a night.
A popular orchestra would cost tenfold.
-Most of them refuse to play disco music.
The play socially critical music you can't dance to.
They are welcome to play that but then they can expect to be unemployed.
-We've tried the last two or three years to play seventy percent disco music but it is apparently not enough.
-The new technology is here to stay.
"It has many advantages in terms of stimulating the music scene, interest in music and so on -"
- but it can't serve as an alternative to a job outcompeting the live music.
"Beer to thirsty disco dancers, but now the Musician's union want to retract liquor licenses to dance halls who don't play live music."
-I refuse to play music my guests at large does not want to deal with and then some bastard blackmail me and take away my rights.
It is the part of Swedish society today that I must strongly protest against.
Also amusement parks begins to stop using dance bands.
This weekend saw the premiere of the dance to video discotheques and the Musicians' union advice all artists to not participate in these kinds of video recordings.
No aunty I can't do it
What is it that you're worried about and can't do? you will go on stage and sing the songs that you know say couple sentences and you will be done she's right we will do what we usually do in weddings
No..
I can't do it
The stage is ready sister
"Ok they will come, you go"
- get up - No
Get up the stage is waiting for you get up with your right foot
Let's go my sister! who told you where we are?
My mother told me what you're doing?
All what is happening to us is because of Cobra
If you want I will go on stage.. you can't do it
No don't intervene in this matter.. we've everything under control just sit here
We'll spin and shake our waist twice then we'll be done how can this happen Aunt kadriyeh it can.. it can
Everyone is waiting for you sisters they didn't die yet! you don't leave an artist speaks two sentences here..
Oh God!! come on go..
Spent the whole day running around the museum.
It was awesome.
I had a wonderful time.
- I went to the Secular Student Alliance Leadership Conference in Columbus where I helped poison the minds of the current and future leaders of the secular movement.
- Good for you.
- All in a day's work.
- Okay.
The devil must be very happy.
- Yes!
"- Today I have yet another installment of my Failures of Chritianity series, and I've"
"- Which we could do forever, by the way."
- That's right.
So we're just scratching the surface.
I'm up to number 8 today.
"The idea here is there's so many failures, how could there possibly be a god behind all this?"
Or maybe there is.
I don't know.
"Previously, I've talked about the failure of christian based abortion policy, the christian genocide of the Jews, the failure of the catholic pedophilia scandal, the failure of prayer, the failure of the 2nd coming, the failure of social engineering, failure of biblical morality, and today I'm going to talk about the failure of"
'christian science'.
Got to put that in quotes.
So what is chrisitan science versus real science?
"Well, christians supposedly worship the creator of the universe, the creator of the earth that created all human beings, all animals, and supposedly the bible is divinely inspired and sort of written by the hand of god indirectly."
"And, supposedly, he talks to christians through prayer, and supposedly he knows everything."
He's omniscient.
"So you would think that there'd be all sorts of interesting facts about the way the world works in the bible and believers would know all these things, and there'd be all sorts of special insights there."
But that's just not the case.
"What qualifies as science in the bible would fit on about 4 pages, comments about he nature of reality."
And what is there is almost complely wrong.
It's pretty abysmal.
"So, christians like to use this word 'science' and grab on the coattails of science and use the word 'creation science' and try to make it science-y and make it all better."
And it's really just marketing.
"So, often there's sort of an attempt to steal the work of other people or steal the credit."
like it was quickly ported over.
"It doesn't convey that level of effort, and people are going to see that and make judgments off of how much effort you put into it."
It's kind of a negative note to end it on.
"All right, well thank you for coming."
Hey there.
I'm Paul Irish.
I'm a Developer Advocate on the Google Chrome team and today
I'm going to show some advanced uses of the core Chrome Dev Tools features.
"First, let's enter into the dev tools."
It's common to use the app's menu.
"And you can also use a keyboard shortcut, like Ctrl-shift-I on Windows or Cmd-option-I on Mac."
But I prefer to open them by right-clicking on an element and choosing Inspect.
"Now that we have this open, I can navigate the DOM by clicking on the arrows, but it's much quicker to use the keyboard arrow keys to traverse up and down the DOM tree."
"You'll notice as I'm selecting these elements, I get an onscreen blue highlight, but I also get a css selector that represents that element, along with its current width and height."
"Sometimes, I like to zoom out of the page with ctrl - to get the full view while I do this."
"Now, over in the Console tab, I'd like to share a few things."
"Let's say that you have a big string coming from your app, and you want to copy it into your clipboard."
"While you certainly could highlight the entire string with your mouse, it's much more effective to use the console's built in copy method."
I can now paste this wherever I am going.
Sometimes you get too much text in the console.
You can use the clear() function to clear it out.
"Or, of course, the clear icon below will do just the same."
"Now sometimes, you have a reference to a DOM element, and you want to inspect it."
"Right now, I have a reference to the big headline on the page."
A simple way to do that is the console's inspect function.
"Now, let's say you have the reverse:"
You're
"looking at an element in the Elements tab, but you want to access it via scripts."
What
I used to do is add an ID onto the element and use getElementByld.
You'll notice I brought up the console right here.
"In fact, I can toggle on a console on every tab of the dev tools with the escape key."
"So if I had the buffer contents A, B, C, D, E, right, and if I could slam those into a vector, and then I would need one other little bit of information here, which is where is the cursor in any given point because the cursor is actually where the uncertain lead operations take place relative to the cursor."
"The buffer's also going to manage that, knowing where the insertion point is and then deleting it and inserting relative to that."
"So I say, okay."
I need some index.
The cursor actually is between two character positions.
"This is like slot zero, one, and two."
"And the cursor is between, actually, one and two."
"And there's just a minor detail to kind of have worked out before we start trying to write this code, which is do we want the cursor to hold the index on the character that's to the left of it or to the right of it."
"It's totally symmetric, right."
"If I have these five characters, it could be that my cursor then goes from zero to four, it could be that it goes from zero to five, or it could be it goes from negative one to four, depending on which way I'm doing it."
I'm going to happen to use the one that does zero to five where it's actually recorded as the character that's after it.
Okay.
So that's just kind of the staring point.
I'm going to write some code and make it happen.
So I'm going to remove this.
"Reference it, that's okay."
And then I'm going to add the things I want to replace it with.
So I put in the editor code and to put in the buffer code.
Was buffer already in here?
I think buffer's already here.
Okay.
Let's take a look.
I get my buffer.
"So right now, let's take a look what's in buffered."
I think I have the starting set information.
"So it has move cursor over, you know move the cursor around, it has the delete, and it has - let me make it have some variables that I want."
I've got my cursor.
I've got my vector of characters.
"Right now, it has a lot of copying, I think, just in anticipation of going places where copying is going to be required."
"Right now, because it's using vector and vector has deep copying behavior, I'm actually okay if I let windows copy and go through."
But I'm actually going to not do that right away.
All right.
Uh huh.
"And it doesn't look bad on the phone, we still, we still probably, we're still gonna add a um, MPS piece, and try to get involved, to be more responsive probably the next day."
"But uh, yeah the night that some of these people that were on our team that, that are really."
"You know the staff from the responsive design and the nine sixty, you know that Mh-hm And all those kinds of things, you know, we don't have a lot of information, I would think and a lot of information that is going to come and that kind of that and that would be really helpful What's the next, what's the direction of the website?"
"It'd be kind of nice if you guys had something about it, a little discussion could start, th e future of the web and things like that."
"Yeah, we are definitely focusing much more on that in the coming year."
"We want to do a lot more, we have a user experience fundamentals course coming out, content strategy."
"We're looking at doing usability testing, a lot more."
Fundamental information that will help as you approach your project.
"Whether it's a redesign or a new, a new site."
"And um, we've really focused on tools in the past."
How do I use Flash to do what I'm trying to do?
But I think that um.
"An area that we really want to look at is, now that you are in conjunction with tools, it's, it's just as important to understand why you are doing what you're doing."
"And to, to make the best decisions for your site and, and your membership, or your viewership."
"Right, mm-hm. , That is very interesting."
"And especially because the way, technology is being consumed, has so fundamentally changed, with mobile devices."
People are actually having these conversations now.
"You know, people are talking about responsive design, or they're talking about, uh, user experience."
"And it, it wasn't, much of a conversation a year ago."
"And, um, I think that people really, are."
"Are looking for this type of information, and it sounds like this would be beneficial for, for your project as well."
"Yea, particularly right now cuz I think that everybody I think is going to be redesigning their web right now."
Trying to get moving towards.
See the social media kind of stuff.
Right.
Yeah.
How do we integrate social media effectively.
How do we.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And then we, and then we."
"So, watch out for that kind of thing, especially the multiple people have looked at the draft and edited the draft, references tend to get lost in the shuffle."
So here's an example of the first kind of thing I was talking about.
"So you, some authors give a reference to back up a statement."
You go to the original reference and it just doesn't back up the statement.
So here's an example.
"I'm going to pick on a particular example from something I was reading lately but again, These authors are by no means the only ones who do this."
"This is very, very common."
"So, I read the sentence."
These data are particularly disturbing as the UVC emission is even larger than ambient sunlight on a mountain.
"Now, I was writing about this for the lay public and so I thought, well great, here"
I've got a comparison that anybody can understand.
"The amount of UVC, if you're exposed to sunlight on a mountain."
"Well, that's a great way to put this in my piece."
So I wanted to get more information about this.
"I thought that was an interesting and cute fact, a good fact to use for a piece for the lay public."
"And I also had a question, because when they say it's larger than ambient sunlight on the mountain, they didn't give any time frame."
"So, is it larger than the amount that you'd get in one minute?"
Is it larger than the amount that you'd get in an hour?
So there was no reference right there.
So I needed to go back to the original references to get more information.
"And again, I, I'm doing this often for various reasons like, like we've been writing something for the lay public and I see an interesting statistic or fact that"
I wanna trace back.
Alright.
"So, to go to reference thirteen, Well, it's, it's you know, a URL."
"It's, it's a website link and it was broken."
"So, the, the link doesn't work."
"I get, you know, an error message."
It does bring me to a site.
So I search on that site and there's no relevant information about UVC emissions on a mountain on that site that I can find.
Maybe I didn't do a great search.
"So maybe, you know, the URL, link got broken, you know, between the time the authors wrotethe paper and, the time it was sent, it was published."
"Could have happened, But anyway, it's a problem because again,"
Listen to this:
It is known now that chocolate is the number one longevity food in the world.
That is known.
"It is the number one food for your heart  according to the research, for your heart."
It's also a great way to party and have a good time  without a hangover.
Chocolate grows across  the temp required that the -- what we call the tropical belt  of the world; from about 20 degrees north latitude  to 20 degrees south latitude.
In that belt.
And it's originally from the Americas:
"Central America,"
"Venezuela, Ecuador."
Most people now believe that chocolate  is originally from the Orinoco river basin of Venezuela.
"That's where the Spanish first rolled into and saw tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands  of wild cacao trees, but no people, 500 years ago."
I searched all over the planet.
I visited shamans asking them  what they thought about chocolate.
"This shaman in the Amazon told me  that you can take the cacao tree bark, peel it off, soak it in ice-cold water."
"It releases the gel in 24 hours, and when you rub that in your scalp, it cures male pattern baldness."
I'm an infopreneur.
"My eyes went into dollar signs,  when I heard that."
"You mean, there is a product that would sell more than chocolate itself, that comes from the chocolate tree?"
And we're researching this right now.
First and foremost I am a researcher.
"That's what I love to do, I love to study, research and look into the data."
"Chocolate is the number one food in magnesium of any food in the world, that is the number one mineral deficiency in the Western world."
"Also, chocolate is the highest  natural source of iron, the highest natural source of manganese and the highest natural source of chromium of any major food in the world."
These are very important minerals  for blood building.
"They're very important for stable blood sugar and, of course, magnesium de-stresses us."
Could we use that?
I think so.
"Chocolate is also extraordinarily rich in phosphorus, zinc and copper."
Zinc and copper for healthy nervous system  and phosphorus for bone.
"We always hear about calcium,  calcium, calcium."
"Phosphorus,  we need that for healthy bones."
A multi pronged strategy will be most effective:
1.
BOYCOTT:
"All corporate products, beginning with Coke, McDonalds, ADM, and Monsanto."
Reduce to eliminate your consumption of gasoline.
You can start this now.
Lawsuits:
"The more of their resources are devoted to circular legal action, which is expensive, the more is taken out of their budget without producing anything."
"File lawsuits of every kind (class action, environmental damage, labor rights)."
2.
STRlKE:
The first week of July 2011.
"Take your vacation time, sick leave, organize your union to strike at this time."
Spend time with family at home!
The main thing is:
DON'T BUY ANYTHlNG FOR ONE WEEK.
"Continue as long as possible, buy the gasoline you will need for a week at least."
"Where legally possible if you rent, organize a rent strike in your building/community."
3.
PREPARE:
"Learn what wild foods are available to you, identify them, and eat them."
"Start a garden, organize within your community to become as food self sufficient as possible."
Store durable food a little at a time so you have a large supply by July.
Plan many crops that will begin to bear by the first week of July.
A permanent boycott will cause price disruption and stock deflation.
"A coordinated strike will cause specific timed disruption of currency movement (ie it's not coming out of your pocket, and you are not causing any more to be moved or produced), and preparedness to become independent permanently from key industries (industrial agriculture)."
"The only way to level the playing field with ""the powers that be"" is to take their money and make it valueless."
Complete abundance causes a market economy to crash!
"When you have everything you need, what do you need money for?"
THEY HAVE AS MUCH POWER AS WE BELlEVE IN THElR MONEY.
Together we can take one more step to bringing the machine to it's knees!
Grow your own food!
And the soundtrack tells us the story.
It begins with a romantic score.
"But then, as he begins to doubt and explain his reasons, the track will change."
"And we'll slip closer into that mysterium score we had, which is associated with Finn and the ghost ship. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I expected a different response Will."
"I thought we were both waiting for this. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I had waited, I wanted this."
"Now this what I do and say, I'm afraid. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Afraid of me?"
"A very important scene, because it's our only exposition on his past."
"And it's our first insight into his mind, that he is questioning himself."
"[music] &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; It was awful, Helen, I've never forgotten it."
We were run down in a fog of the coast of.
"Now, of course, the audience is meant to be paying attention to the performance and the actors and the characters and maybe not notice the sound directly."
But it's there and it's working on us.
And it's one of the ways that this film chips away at happy surfaces and shows us that underneath.
"There's despair, there is fear and death."
I mean this is a man who's already been consumed by his job who can no longer love. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; By this morning when the boy testified against me I could barely keep my seat.
[music]
"Give me a chance to get over this, this feeling that I don't know myself."
"And he's going to try to make ammends, and offer a happy future, but we know better."
"And so he can try to make a moment offer a happy future, but we know better."
"We know, I think by this point that he is beyond, beyond hope."
"Now Ghost Ship is actually more innovative by using sounds within the film world to comment on and undercut the surface story to show the dark side while the rest of the crew seems to think things are, are going well."
And I think this is mainly how Sir Lancelot works who plays Billy Radd.
He's the calypso singer.
"And watch how it works in, in this particular moment, we're going to hear that theme of blow the man down come back in."
"And its coming in, right as the radio man is talking about how he keeps his nose clean, and he is going to ignore [crosstalk] the danger's by putting on his headset."
"Life is easy for him, now we have this."
[music]
Way blow the man down.
Roll up your white canvas jib spanker and all.
Give me some time to blow the man down.
Then the breeze it blew gaily a terrible gale.
"It's actually a scene that's a simple ellipsis showing the ship traveling, right?"
Anyone interested?
Couple of you?
Yeah.
"So, Greywater, it's from sinks, showers and washing machines."
So its water that's a little bit dirty but it's not too dirty to other plants.
"It's never from toilets and it's not from washing diapers, so it doesn't have thicker matter in it."
"It's not like the toilets, which would be not safe to reuse."
"Kitchen sinks, it depends on what state you"
live in if it's considered Greywater or not.
"In California, kitchen sinks are not allowed to be--we're not allowed to reuse that water legally."
So I want to break Greywater into three ways.
The first one is for outdoor use.
"This is just taking the Greywater, sending it outside."
"You're taking a shower, it's going out just directly and irrigating your plants."
So that's the simplest way to use it.
It's low tech.
We try not to have pumps or filters or things that require maintenance and mechanical devices.
"The second way is also for outdoor use, but this is a little different."
"It's taking Greywater and sending it through a drip irrigation system, which is a lot more complicated because Greywater has hair in it, has lint, it has little, you know, chunks of things."
It's a little gunky.
"And so, if you want to send that to drip irrigation, you're going have to really filter it and get all the particles out."
"And so, then you just have a much more complex system."
So it's a really different way to use the water.
And then the third way is indoor use.
"And so that's for non-potable uses, such as toilet flushing, and possibly laundry washing."
And it's also a lot more complicated to get greywater back inside because it has to be filtered and disinfected and it's pumped and it's connected to the domestic water supply.
And it's really just a whole other level of system.
It's also not really allowed under the new code in any practical way and so it's definitely a good resource for bigger scale projects like commercial buildings.
"For residential, it's usually not very appropriate."
"And so, when you're thinking about any type of Greywater System, the soaps and the products you use really matter because now that water is going to your plants."
So there's a couple of things you want to avoid.
You want to avoid any salt compound.
The main factor determining your success will be your marketing skills.
Will the Liftago service work from day one of the launch?
"Yes, indeed."
Our Liftago Team will take care of that.
What we expect from you - the marketers - is to help us spread our business across the globe.
No passenger can order a taxi without taxi drivers using our app.
"And likewise, no Liftago driver can receive an order without passengers."
That's why we share half of our taxi ride revenue with you.
"You are the only ones with enough power, resources, and motivation to share the apps with drivers and passengers."
What is the key to success?
"Support your community, talk to taxi drivers and passengers, and share your experience and knowledge."
Create a group of skilled taxi drivers who will join your community and attract many new Liftago passengers every day.
And now I'd like to ask Ondrej from our Liftago team to show you our app.
"Hello, let's have a look at what our apps will look like."
We've been developing two of them: the Liftago Taxi app for passengers and the Liftago Driver app for drivers.
Both of them are compatible with iPhone and Android devices.
All versions will be availabe in local languages upon launching.
Let's take a look at the ordering process from the passenger's point of view.
"Now imagine that I'm a potential passenger sitting in a café, finishing my coffee and waiting for the bill."
I'm launching the Liftago Taxi app and I immediately see there are 3 available taxis around.
I click on the taxi icon and the app gets me the best taxi according to my preset preferences.
"But since I know where I'm going, I'd rather insert my destination address."
I switch to the list of taxi drivers and I can see that there is one I have hired before and whom I was happy with.
I can see the fare and I take a look at the rough estimate for the total price of the ride.
"It's acceptable for me, so I place an order."
"Now I'm waiting for the driver to confirm the order, which he does quickly!"
I can see he's just around the corner.
Now I'm just waiting for him to tell me he's here.
"I can see him on the map, and in the meantime, I pay my bill."
He's arrived!
I'm leaving the restaurant and my taxi is waiting outside.
The driver greets me and has indicated I'm on board.
Factory farming is the biggest abuse of all.
Because in the United States alone there are 10 billion animals raised for food.
Its an extraordinary number and the average American eats 80 or 85 animals per year.
And we want to see that number reduced and we want to see the animals out of these terrible confinement systems.
And why do you think Al Gore didn't mention factory farming?
"You know I think that he probably thought that he was giving a lot of information already to people with An Inconvenient Truth, and maybe he thought that people would shut down if it affected them too personally."
"Because it gets very personal when you're talking about eating animals, and you're talking about something that is part of the American diet."
He thought all this is going too far.
But the public is slowly waking up.
I do not believe that we can have a good situation for animals or the environment if we continue to eat as much meat as we're eating.
"But even if you reduce your total consumption by half and instead of eating 80 animals eat 40, you cut in half the greenhouse gas emissions."
So we do think that our fork is a powerful tool.
"So, they're clear about this in the United States: the power lies with the consumer."
"As consumers, we can make a difference by changing our diets."
Matt Prescott says that meat is the number one cause of global warming.
And he gives a good example of this.
"If every American ate no chicken for just one day a week, then this would reduce just as much pollution as taking 500.000 cars off the road."
Chicken?
No thanks!
We'd rather have 500.000 cars!
It's funny.
"OK, I can hear you thinking:"
Meat and other animal products are bad for the environment.
I get it.
But don't we need meat and milk for our health?
"Where else do we get the calcium for our bones, the iron for our blood, and the vitamins and minerals we need to keep us healthy?"
"Advertisers and food producers have done so much to indoctrinate us, that you'd nearly end up believing it."
Go meat!
Sides of lamb are only 1.99 a kilo.
"The message is clear: milk is essential, meat is good for you, cheese is healthy for us all ..."
"But who benefits most from meat and dairy products, the consumer or the producer?"
Do we really need all that animal protein?
They don't take money from these various companies so you can trust that they are going to be honest in their evaluation.
So some good sites to use when you are making some purchases.
But there is information gathering.
"Phase Il, Evaluating Some of The Alternatives."
Let me tell you on page 195 there is What Kind of Spender Are You?
An excellent exercise.
So excellent I even made this a part of your assignment.
"So, when you get to your assignment and it sends you to page 195 and then it asks you to answer 1, 2 and 3, that right there at the bottom where it says 1,2 and 3 that is what I am referring to in that assignment."
Then this book is talking specifically about vehicles.
"So, when you are doing your comparison type shopping several things you need to look at when buying a vehicle."
"Now you would use similar type things on other major purchases, but look at used vehicles, new vehicles, and then also look at the other option of leasing a vehicle."
Lots of different things weigh on which one you need.
If you are on the road all the time and you put lots and lots of miles on a car it may be that you need to purchase a new vehicle.
We never purchase a new vehicle.
When you drive off the parking lot with a new vehicle the value of that vehicle goes down thousands and thousands of dollars because once you buy it it becomes a used vehicle.
"So, let someone else lose all that value on it."
"The average used car is $10,000 less than a new one."
We buy low-mileage used ones.
"Usually they are cars where either someone buys it, they don't drive it a lot."
The last one we bought was from an elderly couple.
She was actually ill and it was her car.
She never drove it.
"So I got a nice luxury car for the same thing I could have paid for an average new car, but I have a nice nice car."
If I would have bought a new car
"I would have a new car, but I wouldn't have had all the luxury."
It would have just been an average car.
"So, I prefer to buy used."
They have gotten all the lemon bugs worked out of it and we have just always found that to be a much better option for us.
Of course we drive our cars until they are worn out.
"So, you know we are not trading it in every year."
"If you like to drive a new car and you can afford to drive a new car all the time, that is wonderful."
You might look into purchasing.
"I can't take it anymore, move out of the way"
Mr.Mahmoud wants you
What does he want?
"What are you doing, dad?"
"Come on, world cup is approaching"
We're gonna fight now
What?
Come on Karim
He never even played boxing
"Shut up Karim, why don't you just tell him about all of this?"
I don't wanna play!
Man up!
Stop
Put your arms up like this yeah liek this to protect yourself and the glasses?
Give me the glasses
Raise your hands up
Yeah protect your face well Karim
Ok
"Come on, dress up"
Morning Ellen
I believe you're going to give us an update on some of the work you've been doing?
Yes - last time I did a blog I'd just began treatment on this beautiful lentoid and now I've actually finished it.
And I've updated the housing for the object and now you can see all the beautiful features that are present.
One thing I wanted to point out before we take a closer look at the object is that we actually take a number of samples of everything that we remove from each object and that includes the soil from the cells and it also includes things like corrosion products possible organic materials and if we do happen to find any tiny garnet fragments in the soil.
So all those things are saved and I constructed this little housing so they don't rattle around.
Just as an example this is the soil from the bottom and the left cloisonné cells in the object.
"Okay, can you just turn that round for us so we can just see the soil moving in there?"
"Okay, so that's an example of all the soil that you've kept."
And you were saying other things that you might of kept are just small fragments?
Any tiny fragments that I discovered that are unusual or notable in any way so for an example this is sort of a green black lump that's a compressed possible corrosion product that I found in the cells.
This is an interesting feature that I thought I would point out this is one thing that I found through excavating one of the central cells here and that's a remaining rivet.
There are actually several rivet holes present and you can see those on the back of the object
Sub-string search.
So first thing is how to compute the hash function.
"So we take the, just convert the Math."
So R's our Radix.
"So in this example, we're using ten so we have decimal numbers."
"And then the digits, say t's of i That's the text characters."
"So we have a number x of I, which is the,"
"M characters starting at position I. And that's just in Math, ti*R to the M-1"
"So you know, in this case that's two10000+61000+5100+310+5 that's just"
Math for that.
And our goal is so it's an N digit base based our integer modular Q And our and our goal is to do the math.
That gives us the remainder that we would get when dividing that by Q well there's really easy method called Horner's Method that we can use to evaluate a degree in polynomials just with a multiplied M multiply and add.
"And we can do the modular computation all the way through at each step, to keep the numbers less than q and we still get the same result."
"And so the idea is, you multiply by R."
"You go from left to right through the digits and you just multiply by R and add the digit, and then do mod q at every time."
So we start with two mod 97 is two.
To six mod 987 is two*10+6 mod 987 and that's 26.
And then I take that value.
Multiply by ten and add five that's 265 mod 997.
"In that case it's, it's 265."
So 265*10+3 is 2653.
"Our remainder is divided by 997, it's 659, so even though our number gets bigger than 997, might take them out every time, we keep our running total less than 997."
And then the last step is to take the 659.
Basically we've thrown out a bunch of multiples of 997 that we don't care about.
And 659*10+5 mod 997 is exactly equal to 26535 mod 997 and that's 613.
That's our value.
"So that's A using Horner's method we got a, well known linear time method to do compute or hash function with this simple code."
"And this notice will work even for a huge key that we wouldn't compute a hundred dig, convert a hundred digit key in to some number to do the calculation."
We do one digit at a time using Horner's method and then we have no limit because we're always keeping our numbers less than our prime queue.
"So that's a first step, so no matter how big the pattern is,"
"We can efficiently compute a hash or, since that is the first step."
So now the second step for the Rabin Karp algorithm is to realize that if we know xi mod q we can efficiently compute xi+1 mod q cause they have a lot of digits in common.
Some people just have the ability to get people on their side.
They have good reasons.
They know how to explain things well.
They're just naturally persuasive.
They can sell things effectively.
They just have that persuasive power.
And that's a form of power as well.
"Well so now what we've done, we've gone through norms, we've talked about status and power."
These are all important ingredients.
"Hopefully you'll be aware of these, look for these and try to use them constructively too in your own group dynamics."
And I wish you the best in doing that.
"Stop the disco music, it steals our jobs, the Musicians' union says -"
- who demands a special disco fee and that discotheques shouldn't be allowed to serve alcohol.
Disco music on grammophone is competing dance orchestras to death.
The Musician's union now tries to save the live music by demanding a special disco fee -
- and retracted liquor license for restaurants who abandon live music for disco.
Every month one dance orchestra here in Sweden dies and the lines of musicians waiting for unemployment benefits are growing. ♪ I am a giant tree. ♪
"Janne Landegren, finalist in the Swedish Eurovision song contest qualifier two years ago -"
"- and vocalist in Telstars, one of the most wellknown dance orchestras in Sweden."
But now Telstars has disbanded.
The latest victim to the death of dance orchestras and Janne Landegren is going to the office for unemployment benefits.
-It feels tough to have to disband a group like Telstars.
"Not just because it affects me personally, economically."
-And your family?
-And my family economically to say the least.
"It also feels hard to disband a group like Telstars that have existed since 1963, for 16 years."
The Musicians' union forces so called live music upon us.
This is live music if there is such a thing.
"Today this type of public usage is totally unregulated.For example we can listen in department stores, elevators, sports arenas and discotheques."
This without any compensation to the musician who is the person actually performing.
We can't accept that.
The disco fee hasn't been decided but today the Swedish broadcasting corporation pays 32 SEK for every minute of record music played.
So christians themselves seem to value ignorance.
The apple of the tree of knowledge - they shouldn't have eaten that.
"And, in the past, they've burnt books for freethinkers alike."
"I view this competition between real science and christian science as like watching a horse race where one horse, the christian sicence horse, has died in gates and never really made it out."
And the other horse has been going for 2000 years or more.
Which one will win?
We'll see.
"- If the finish line is right back at the start, then the dead horse got there first."
- Right.
"Like so many other areas, chrisitan science is a proven failure."
"Although, we're not alone here in picking on christianity."
"All the other religions,"
"like Islamic science, or whatever, Judaistic science."
It's all the same stuff.
"- It's pretty cool, too, because you can go to the Muslim science pages and they'll tell you everything that's wrong with the christian science pages, and the christians will tell you what's wrong with the Muslims, and they'll both tell you what's wrong with the Jews."
"Actually, I don't know that Jews spend a whole lot of time trying to make the Torah and Talmud match up to science."
- The Jews aren't big on marketing.
They're happy to have their exclusive club.
"- I think the most amusing use of science by Jews is actually using science, real science, in order to find a workaround for all the prohibitions for what they can do on the sabbath."
Which is really amusing.
- Little gadgets to push the button on the elevator so that you're not actually creating fire.
"- Or a phone that's always trying to dial every number and you have it stop not, whatever."
"Anyway, it's confusing."
Continue with your...
- Modern marvels.
"Well, today I'm going to talk a little about cosmology, which is one of the big topics that comes up, some other physical sciences, a little bit of mathematics."
"Another time, I'm going to save some of the more meaty stuff for other shows."
"I'll talk about the failure of creationism on another show, and I'll talk about the failure of chrisitian medicine on another show."
"So, so much fail, there must be a god."
The biblical cosmology is primitively wrong.
It's pretty screwed up.
"There's this notion of a firmament, which is this large dome that separates heaven from the earth in biblical cosmology."
"The onus is on you to educate me deeply about this thing that I'm not even interested in."" There's no way to overcome that kind of requirement, nobody can win that argument."
But it turns out that usually that reasoning is wrong.
I've heard that argument about why we shouldn't have to worry about closure.
I've heard it about why we shouldn't use recursion.
I've heard it about why punch cards are better than timesharing.
"You can go all the way back to 'it's better for us to be programming with digits, I don't understand why we need compilers'."
It's been going on from the beginning.
"That's why software development is so slow, because basically we have to wait for a generation to die off before we can get critical mass on the next good idea."
[laughter]
This is Grace again.
See the 'courtesy' badge?
I had to pay $200 to get the rights to use this picture.
"It was actually $100 but I wanted lifetime rights, so I can use it from now on."
"I'm going to use it a lot, anytime I can."
[laughter]
"I've used it twice tonight, so that's $100 per view."
"I'm getting it down, I'm getting it down."
"We've gone a long way since Grace created the discipline of software engineering, but we still have a very long way to go."
I think we're not as far along as we should be at this point.
"I think we're mainly not farther along because of that 'waa, I don't want to have to learn anything' problem."
"You are not those guys, and that's why you're here tonight to hear me rant about this."
"I appreciate that, and I think that shows a lot of value for you."
"The big surprise for me in this is we're about to take maybe the most important step we've ever taken in terms of the technology of the web, and JavaScript is leading the way."
Who would ever have imagined that?
"JavaScript is now being the technology leader, it's not just the thing that we tolerate."
Wow.
"But there we are, that's where we're going."
"Goodnight Grace, wherever you are."
"And goodnight, thank you very much."
[applause]
"I don't see very much now, I used to go quite often to see dance, and theatre shows and cinema and so on"
"I've got two small children now so I don't go and see very much but what we have seen in the last few years has really been around stuff for children that they'll enjoy free, open air things, maybe at the Southbank or something or theatre shows that are for children."
"Finally, ask the patient to swallow."
It should be done without difficulty or regurgitation.
"Cranial nerve Xl, the Spinal Accessory nerve, innervates the sternomastoid and upper trapezius muscles."
"To assess this nerve, ask the patient to shrug his shoulders upward against your hands."
"During this maneuver, evaluate the strength and contraction of the trapezius muscles."
Practitioner:
Good.
Can you turn your head to... [fades]
"Then ask the patient to turn his head to each side, against your hand."
Observe the contraction of the opposite sternomastoid muscle and note the force of movement against your hand.
"Cranial nerve XIl, the Hypoglossal nerve, mediates motor functions of the tongue, which in turn affect articulation of words."
Inspect the patient's tongue as it lies on the floor of his mouth.
Observe for fasciculations.
There should be none.
Ask the patient to stick out his tongue.
"Note any asymmetry, deviation, or atrophy."
The tongue should protrude straight out.
"&amp;gt;&amp;gt; At this station, we're going to practice putting a naso-gastric tube in for a feeding tube and then we're also going to practice doing a bolus feeding and a tube feeding by a pump drip, continuous feed."
So first we're going to need a feeding tube.
"We could use, this would come in a clean package and I would have opened this up, and this is the Levin tube."
"That's a long, single lumen tube and it has pre-marks on it, to help you know to make your marking, to know how far you're going to insert it."
And so I'm going to put my clean gloves on and then I would have opened up my package.
"So I'm just using clean technique, because it's going into the stomach."
So I would open up my package that has a clean tube in it.
"And I took this out and have clean, now it's clean."
"First, I need to measure how far I want to pass it."
"So I want to measure it from the tip of the bottom part of the earlobe, all right?"
"The tip to the nose, to the nares, and then I'm going to add from the nares to the stomach, the middle of the stomach."
"So I want to about that marking, that's about how far I'm going to want to pass it."
"I want to have my patient with their head slightly forward, because if their was tipped back, that would open their airway, and I want to go into the stomach."
I can lubricate the end a little with water or may get some lubrication.
"If the patient's alert, they can swallow some ice chips while I pass to help this go down the right way."
Dooby-doooby-doo Doo-doo-doo-di-da
"Hey there, it's Kati again."
Thanks for coming back to check out my videos.
"Today I'd like to talk about a tip, that I give to all of my client's I even have to give it to myself repeatedly to remind myself about this."
"And this has to do with people suffering from anxiety, stress, depression."
"You name it, this is something that we should all constantly evaluate in our lives."
"And that is, not spending time with people who are bad for us."
Okay well that sounds really easy.
People who we hate probably don't hang out with.
People who are really mean to us we probably don't hang out with.
"But if you really think about it, there are probably people in your life, that I call ""toxic"" friends."
Especially when we're talking about eating disorder people.
"We go into inpatient, we're there with maybe six to ten other girls, some of which want to get better, like you, working hard to pull through, and it's really difficult, and they're there to help support you."
"Those are great friends to have around and that's what I'm hoping to cultivate in this website, is a big support system of people rooting for us, right, to do better not to do worse."
"But there's always a few people in those treatment programs, who kind of make a life of being in treatment."
"They don't really want to get better, and they kind of pull the rest of us down."
"They even put up websites and things to help ""promote"" anorexia and"
"""promote"" sickness."
Why would you do that?
These are people that can hinder you're recovery.
"And I know it's hard to let people go, and I'm not saying that you have to tell your friends, or call them up and say,"
"""hey you know what?"
"I was watching this video and I'm not friends with you anymore. 'click'."""
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying limit your interaction with people like this.
"Because I guarantee, if you evaluate it after."
"Like, Let's say you go have coffee with this friend who is ""toxic""."
"Afterwards, you probably feel worse about yourself, you're probably counting calories, more than you normally do, you skipped a snack,"
"""not on purpose"", but kind of on purpose, because they're in your head."
"They're making bad comments about you, about themselves, about what's going on."
And those people just aren't healthy.
"So that's my tip that I give to everybody, whose suffering from anything."
"Your life would be better if you could work a little less, if you didn't have to work so hard, if you could get home a little earlier, if you could retire a little faster, if you could punch out a little sooner -- it's all in there, over and over, again and again."
Washington?
I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don't really know.
I just know that that's a front in this war.
"And right here guys, Silicon Valley,"
I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now?
How many people have their Blackberries?
We're plugged in; we're connected.
I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution.
"Good grief, not to this crowd."
(Laughter)
But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time.
"And nobody celebrates imitation the way ""Dirty Jobs"" guys know it has to be done."
"Your iPhone without those people making the same interface, the same circuitry, the same board, over and over?"
All of that?
That's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it.
"So, we've got this new toolbox, you know."
Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks.
They look like the stuff we walk around with.
And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.
"And I realized, probably too late in this game --"
"I hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things -- but we're going to do as many as we can."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with, is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things, not just the testicles on my chin."
I got a lot wrong.
"So, we're thinking -- by we, I mean me -- that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work, manual labor, skilled labor."
Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits.
"I'm talking about grandfather stuff, the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of -- you know, kind of lost a little."
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs.
The infrastructure is a huge deal.
"This war on work, that I suppose exists, has casualties"
like any other war.
The infrastructure's the first one; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one.
"And obviously when a media corporation appears in a context of collective enthusiasm, there can be problems."
But I don't think it's very intelligent.
"I mean, I understand the reaction, but it has been proven afterwards that it's a reaction that doesn't benefit, but rather is detrimental for what was happening there."
You need people to insult you through the media.
You need people to manipulate you.
"You need people to distort your words, because there are a lot of people who don't succumb to that manipulation, who don't succumb to the insults, and who don't succumb to that distortion, and realises that you're not what the television says you are."
"It's a lot better to be insulted, I know it's a drag to say"
"""it's better for people to talk bad about you than not talk about you at all""."
"It's not exactly that, but you have to open yourself to the media and accept that they're going to hit you."
"Yes, they're going to hit you."
What's important is that there are other media outlets that understand you.
"Not because you're good to them or because they're on your side, but because ""each to his own"". there was a day"
"I was at an assembly where it was decided, or it looked that way"
"I think they didn't decide on it in the end, they decided that the only camera that could record there was the camera of the Sol audiovisual commission."
"You stop for 15 seconds to think where that's going to, what kind of model of communication it's going towards, and it's scary."
It's a bit scary.
Fortunately that didn't happen.
So there have been a few moments but in the end everyone always realised there was no sense in it.
But you see it's not coherent with who you are.
ST:
That is definitely NOT the 15M.
JL:
Definitely not the 15M.
Not letting the media work is not coherent with the 15M.
And yet I understand the indignation against the media.
Perfectly.
ST:
I participated in two assemblies in which I spoke about this topic.
About prohibiting cameras.
"One was on the 16th, I remember perfectly, the first day of the camp, saying that it was impossible. and the other was the same, but three weeks later."
And they were going on about the same thing curiously.
JL:
Is this a future we want to leave for our children and grandchildren?
I don't think so either.
So let's steer towards a better future.
Thomas Berry wrote that our great work for our generation is to learn to live on the planet at least benignly.
Why would we do that?
"One reason we would do that is that our fellow living things, who happen not to be human, don't have a representative in Congress; they don't have a lobbyist in Washington, they don't have a voice at the table, and yet, they are completely dependent for their survival on our good will; much like children."
Let's talk about our country's population and our wildlife.
"We had about five million people in our country around 1800 and about 290 million people in 2000 - more now, of course."
"At a conference, I met a scientist, Andrea Laliberte, who had done fascinating work comparing wildlife sightings in the 1700 and 1800 in our country to how wildlife range today in our country."
"This chart, the pinkish areas - I'm not sure how it looks here - are where we used to have black bears."
The yellow areas are where they still are today
- you see there's been a lot of recession there.
This is the gray wolf; we used to have gray wolves running all over our country;
- the pinkish areas you see on the chart - not so today.
"We used to have grizzly bears running over about half of our country; as you see, they've receded, and we don't have them."
This was just 200 years ago.
That yellow island-like area
- that would be the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.
"Let's look at a summary map: take a look at the right here - red is good, green is bad, white is very bad."
"You see that we've lost a lot of species in our country; those white areas mean that all of wildlife that was looked at,"
"- in this case, in the 1800s - it's gone from our country."
Do you think is normal not to have wildlife running around us all the time in our country?
That's not normal.
"Let's bring it home, here, to the Front Range of Colorado; tonight."
We used to have wild bison; they're gone.
We used to have gray wolves; they're gone.
"We used to have-- - sorry, my clicker's little sluggish - grizzly bears; could've been right outside."
They're gone.
"We used to have lynx, the cat; gone."
Maybe they are not leaving.
(Laughter)
"We used to have black-footed ferret, very dependent on prairie dog for their survival; gone."
"I, I can do it and you can't right?"
Well yes but we've still made you.
Oh no that's foolish.
"To make a long story short, actually it's not a very long story but it's a delightful one."
"The robot is utterly convinced that, it is"
God's creation.
"And its, highest commandment is to keep that beam aimed at a particular spot on the surface of Earth."
And these poor humans are simply mistaken about that.
And there's no convincing the robot that they are right.
"The humans finally decide, you know."
"It may not be that the robot understands it's own origins, but it makes no difference because it will obey that commandment and so they leave."
"In other words, the robots have to know what is right for people and do it absolutely, even if they completely misunderstand what the human beings want, say and do."
"This is a fairy tale, okay?"
How can anybody know what's good and right automatically and always.
No one can.
"How could robots, therefore, be able to?"
Can they read our minds?
"Well, that's not posited, but they have positronic brains."
"As one reads through the stories in I, Robot, one goes from the beginning where you just have a robot nanny to, who was selfless, of course, in the care of her charge."
Its charge?
The young child.
"All the way through to the last couple of stories in which the main character we need to confront, who's new, is Steven"
"Bierley, the world administrator."
"The whole world, in other words."
On the basis of having robots to do good and provide the wherewithal is moving ever more toward a utopia.
"As you read the whole book, if you think of it not as separate stories but as a composite novel, the ending would have to be utopian."
"Of course, if you read the story separately that wouldn't follow."
"And the very last story, the evitable conflict, that is we can get rid of conflict."
The evitable conflict is one which Steven Briarly is having a colloquy with a character named Susan Calvin.
Susan Calvin is a robopsychologist and she has been a continuing character referenced though out the book and interstial parts between the separately published earlier stories as a [unknown] was created to bind the whole into one work all feature Susan Calvin.
Susan Calvin trains the technicians Donovan and Powell who go around setting up the robots.
Susan Calvin is an advisor to US Robotics the industrial firm that makes things.
In 1985 the church have closed as the roof has collapsed.
It rained and snowed into the building
It was hardly any ... left on the walls
The benches ereased as they were all ... eaten and totally rotten
Humidity was nearly constatly above 90%
And the consequences was mold and decay.
Whoever the community refused to throw in the towel.
Together with ... supporters and craftsman from the region
Reconstruction begun in 1996 and was also supported by DRYMAT.
This has deffinetly helped to reduce humidity enormusly not only in the room air but also in the walls.
It is checked continously the humidity value being determined and we were quite amazed to see such an effect
You know we have already tried all kind of methods.
"We have drilled holes, put injections into the walls, and kept renewing the ..."
And at that time the water really run down the walls in ...
Everything we did was useless
So this is the only method which has really been helpfull for us.
And it is persievable.
Visitors who come into our church often say that the air has improved considerably.
Finally the church where JSB got married could be preserved thanks to the supporters who spent countless hours working here after work and the weekends.
Thanks to the many donations made by ... supporters from all over the world
And thanks to DRYMAT.

The semantics of relational logic is not by itself to tell us which terms are equal and which are not.
"In fact, it's possible for every term to refer to a distinct object in the real world and it's possible for every term to refer to the same object."
"Well, the semantics relational logic does not constrain your quality relation."
The idea of coreferentiality does.
"For example, it's not possible for us to believe a=b and b=c and at the same time, not believe a=c."
We can capture these constraints through axioms.
I already mentioned a few cities that we are actively working with.
But there are so many more that we could and will be working with.
"So again, just to illustrate my point, here is a snapshot from Google Analytics that shows the geography of visitors to the webpage of my institution."
"And it's really not a webpage on which you can bump, it's not advertised, you really have to look for it."
So people who have found it have some interest in the same things that I'm interested in.
"Yes, as you can see, it covers almost the whole world."
"I know, I think we have to work on Greenland, but apart from that, it does cover the whole world."
"I guess what I'm trying to say is that contrary to a popular belief,"
"NGOs are not just about giving, they are as much about getting back or receiving."
"I started with a number, and let me finish with this number."
"Think of us, 7 billion people,"
like molecules running around.
"What you, I think, don't want, as Bertrand Russell would say, is to be like a hard, separate entity, a bit like a billiard ball that can have no other relationship with other such entity, except that of a collision."
"What you also don't want is to leave your chances of meeting those 150 most amazing friends of yours to a pure chance, because if you're going to sit home, nothing will ever happen."
"So my suggestion is to do something, and to do what?"
"To support, to get involved in one of the existing NGOs, or create a new one."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good morning.
I'm going to tell a story.
I think I need a piece of technology here.
Thank you.
Now I just have to figure this out.
"I'm going to tell a story about -- ecology, which is a story of plants and their parasites."
"If you'd like to take a look at one of the parasites, you and I do every morning when we look in the mirror."
(Laughter)
"This story is literally the flow of energy and there happens to be one exquisite transducer, the land plant."
(Laughter) (Applause)
"And I'm not one of the people from Australia, either."
(Laughter)
"That story is literally better told by another set of constructs which is basically the cycles that make life possible, because life is made of the same materials."
"You and I have the same molecules that were in Plato, were in the dinosaurs, were in literally the first blue-green algae, as they emerged 3.5 billion years ago on Earth."
And I'm just going to begin to pass the tube in.
"And I just want to keep passing it down and the patient will swallow, until I get to that mark that told me I was in all the way."
All right.
"Once we've gotten so that we've passed the tube as far as we want to, we've gotten to the mark that we wanted to get to, and we can secure the tube in the patient's nose."
"And there's a couple of ways you can do that, but we'll use kids tape here."
Make a little flag.
Secure that in the patient's nose.
And then I need to check for placement.
"I'm going to add this Lopez value here, at the end."
"It's a stopcock that is designed to go onto, for tube feedings and for naso-gastric tubes."
"So I'll put this on the end of the Levin tube and then I need to, there's a couple ways that I can check that this tube is in the right place."
"I can have this patient x-rayed, to make sure the tube is in the proper place."
I can withdraw some of the gastric contents and check for pH.
Those two are considered the best gold standards.
The x-ray placement and then the pH.
"PH should indicate that it's very acidic, being in the stomach."
The third mechanism of placement is to add some air in here and to listen with a stethoscope to see if you hear a whoosh.
So you can listen here.
That's the third mechanism.
"It's not as accurate, but it is used a lot in many institutions if they don't have the bedside testing."
"So know what your unit protocol is, what your hospital protocol is."
"So this would be the third one, and I would be listening with a stethoscope here and listening to hear a whoosh from the air."
"Once I know, once I have confirmed placement by either pH, x-ray or air sounds, then I'm going to turn the Lopez valve so that I shut off here to the patient so that it doesn't drip out and then until I'm ready for my feeding."
"Now, depending on which type of feeding it is, it can set up a little different."
"If the patient is going to have an intermittent feeding, every so many hours they get so many cc's of fluid, and you administer it all together, I'm going to need an irrigation tray."
"And this, because this tray has a bulb type syringe, I'm actually going to use a catheter tip syringe also."
So I would have gotten that extra.
And then I have my tube feeding that I'm going to use.
Tube feeding.
Okay.
Okay.
"So I'm going to pour my tube feeding in here, whatever the prescribed amount is."
And you might want to connect with others to do further explorations around some of those ideas.
And do you want to add to that Natalie?
Natalie:
"Well just that Fred also had something online, something that he shared some failures of the past and the class inspired him to go back and try it again."
So if theres something that you had tried before and put aside but you want to pull it out of that file cabinet and try another version.
"Or that someone did out in the community, they were recalling some amazing project they had done in a housing project."
And if that can inspire other people.
So either with other people or your own project.
Mitch:
"I think its very much in the spirit of learning spiral that we introduced right in the beginning of class, this idea of continually iterating."
"And week to week we aren't giving you so much time to iterate so the diving deeper really gives you an opportunity to iterate on some of the things you got started with, some of the weekly assignments or readings or discussions."
So hopefully you'll get a chance to get started on that over the next few weeks along with doing some of the readings about tinkering and doing your own tinkering with some of the suggested activities.
And then we'll come back three weeks from now on April 29th to explore more fully the idea of tinkering in the next session of Learning Creative Learning.
Thanks a lot.
Natalie:
Bye Mitch:
"Bye, bye."
"But now it's Bach, so I won't confuse you."
That was only a snippet of Chaconne by Bach.
A song I play at many classical concerts.
What music do you actually listen to?
Melodious.
What does that mean?
That every genre in the world is a gift from God.
It's just not that everyone are good representatives of it.
"When you listen to rap, for example, then you  most likely listen to Eminem or ""Klovner i kamp"" because when good rap exists why listen to bad rap?"
When you listen to country you listen to Willie Nelson.
"It's, of course, everyone is allowed to try but it would be better if there only were good examples for every genre."
"So there would not be criticism like ""Oh, you're stupid because you listen to rock"""
What do you put highest of all Norwegian music?
You once said you'd like to play Ole Bull.
"Well, yeah, you just answered the question."
And going to college.
Just whoever was - There never seemed to be any shortage of people that could play.
Somebody played an accordion.
I can't remember who that was.
What did Walter McCauley play?
Guitar.
Did he sing?
I'm not sure.
Who were the singers?
Rita was one of them.
Rita?
Jules's wife.
Mary's mother.
I'm not sure.
"Oh, Loraine would get up - every once in a while she'd get up and do the tap dance thing and all this kind of stuff."
That would be entertaining more than a singer as far as...
I didn't ask the question.
I didn't take that risk because of being concerned about that my question is going to appear stupid.
"And learning about our own tendencies and understanding how certain situations may interfere with our other goals of actually learning and developing is very important in our self knowledge and in our ability to regulate our own motivation and say, I recognize this in me, I can see how this is holding me back and I'm going to regulate my emotions and shift my goal."
Or consciously adopt a learning goal orientation in order to pursue learning.
And part of the process that allows this to happen is what Ricarose is doing which is engaging people in conversation.
"How did you feel about this, what did it make you do and how would you cope with this and learning from each other and recruiting the community and supporting you in regulating your own motivation."
Natalie:
And we do it in a genuine way because we want to understand and then that gets them reflecting.
I've seen that also in this after school program with the University of illinois in Urbana-
"Champagne, part of a project called the Pathways Project where we're interviewing young people and staff in a variety of after school programs."
And asking young people to reflect on some project they've worked on over a period of time.
And through the interviews you start to see that they start to realize some things.
"Like they were preparing for a presentation, some of them said, I was going to do anything to get out of this situation."
"But because of their team, they didn't want to let their teammates down, they went and then they realized, oh actually it wasn't so bad."
"So these multiple experiences of working on projects and then having questions where you reflect back, like what did you think it was going to be, how was it?"
"And a lot of them are finding, oh actually now I want to do more of that."
"So what we're going to look at is a real simplification kind of taking that problem, kind of distilling it down to its essences and looking at just six operations that are kind of at the core of any text editor about moving the cursor forward and backwards with these commands."
Jumping to the front and the back of the entire buffer and then inserting and deleting in relative to the cursor within that buffer.
And we're going to do this with an extremely old school interface that's actually command base.
It's like VI comes back from the dead for those of you who have ever heard of such things as VI and E Max.
"And so we're going to look at this because there's actually a lot of ways you can approach that, that take advantage of some of the things that we've already built like the vector, and stacking queue, and the link list."
And sort of think about what kind of options play out well.
What I'm going to show you first off is just what the tool looks like so you can really feel schooled in the old way of doing things.
"So I insert the characters A, B, C, D, E, F, G into the editor."
And then I can use the command B to backup.
"I can use the command J to jump to the beginning, E to jump to the end, and so F and B,"
"B moving me backwards, F moving me forwards, and then once I'm at a place, let's say I jump to the end, I can insert Z, Z,"
"Y, X here at the beginning and it'll slide things over, and then I can delete characters shuffling things down."
So that's what we've got.
"Imagine now, it's like building"
Microsoft Word on top of this.
"There's a lot of stuff that goes, you know, between here and there. but it does give you an idea that the kind of core data requirements every word processor needs some tool like this some abstraction underneath it to manage the character data."
Okay.
Where do we start?
Where do we start?
Anyone want to propose an implementation.
What's the easiest thing to do?
[Inaudible].
In a way.
Something like that.
"You know, and if you think Array, then you should immediately think after it, no, I don't want to deal with Array, I want a vector."
I'd like a vector.
Vector please.
Right.
"So I'm going to show you what the interface looks like, here, that we have a buffer in these six operations."
"We're going to think about what the private part looks like, and we say, what about vector."
"Vector handles big, you know, chunky things indexed by slots."
That might be a good idea.
"And all that means is that if we see a register being reused, like over here, we have two assignments to the register X. Okay."
"We're just going to introduce another register name, for one of those assignments."
"So in this case I'm just gonna rename the first, use of X here, definition of X here to be some new register B. I'll replace the uses of that"
"X, by the name B, and now I have an equivalent piece of code that satisfies single assignment form."
"Every register is assigned at most, once."
Let's take a look at an optimization that depends on single assignment form.
"So we're going to assume the basic blocks are in single assignment form, and if they are, then we're going to know That a definition of a register is the first use of that register in th e block, And so, in particular, we're also ruling out things like this."
"So there could be something like this, where X is read."
"And then later on, X is used."
Okay.
"Sorry, X is read and then later on, X is defined."
So we're not going to allow this.
"This register here would have to be renamed to something else, say Y, And then uses of X later on here, are renamed to Y. Alright, so we're going to insist that whenever we have a definition Of a register in a basic block."
That is the first use of that register in the block.
"Alright, and if, if that's true, if we main, if we put things in that form, and that's, that's easy to do as we've seen."
"Then when two assignments have the same right hand side, they're guaranteed to compute the same value."
"So, take a look here, This example."
"So let's say we have an assignment, x=y+z."
"And then later on we have another assignment, w=y+z."
And we said that there could only be one assignment to x in any basic blocks.
"So, all of these instructions that are [inaudible] here, they can't be assigning to X. And they also can't be assigning to y and z."
Y and z already have their definitions.
"So, y and z can't be changed."
And that means that x and w here actually compute the same value.
"And so we can replace the second computation Y plus C by just the name that we already have for it X. Okay, and this saves us having to recompute values."
Alright so this is called common sub expression elimination.
Common it's a rather long name.
Sub expression.
The elimination.
"And this is another one of the, more important compiler optimizations."
This is actually something that comes up surprisingly often.
"And saves quite a bit of work if, if you perform this optimization."
We're not going to do it in the US.
It's just too--it's too creepy. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
"Okay, Doctor Schmidt. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Is that where you are? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
It's me. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Oh, there you are."
Sorry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
Okay.
My name is Doctor Shiga.
"Actually, I just picked up the example of the cathedral."
"Actually, you know, you spoke about the organ of the cathedral."
My mother was one of those who have the chance to play this organ. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Ah, good. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:"
"And I would like to say, when you come back to Berlin we will offer you a concert. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"Oh, thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:"
"And I say that because I wanted to discuss a topic, which you haven't discussed with us today, but I heard in the grapevine that there is something behind the curtain which may be of interest for us, but it's up to you to spoke about."
It's about generating and retrieving and working out proper memory.
"As you know, all this digital age we're approaching, we speak about the future."
"But I think maybe some of the most important challenges is not just hosting data, but it's not just giving us the data of our actual life, but actually hosting parts of our past."
"And I know that there are some projects in the way in the background of your big, big, big empire which are working on that."
"Maybe it's too early to speak about that, but maybe you can give us at least some ideas about these things which are less on the future which will have to do with our past and once we are done, we give you the concert. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Thank you.
"Well first, thank you, sir for such a kind offer."
We're very interested in getting historical information into Google.
"Usually, that historical information is owned by somebody; a library, or a cathedral, or a church, or what have you, and so we have organizations that go and talk to them and try to get that information to be published."
We want to be very respectful of copyright.
We don't want to do it without their permission.
"But most people, when we talk to them, are very interested in getting their information out because it helps popularize what they're doing."
"The more information we have, the more signals, the more information that we can have that we link things together."
I don't think there's anything particularly special about music or sheet music or any of those things.
We have a number of projects around going on a pro bono basis trying to do digital images of the original vellum of recordings from hundreds of years ago.
But our real objective is just to get all the information digitized.
"""This isn't a party and we're not here for fun."
"We have a problem and we have to solve it like this and this and this"", with a very coded language, a very traditional political narrative, very endogamic..."
"And suddenly the square and the internet is full of messages that deactivate any assault that they can set on you from the outside, and they deactivate the social depression we're in."
Suddenly the people were happy.
There were marvellous phrases.
"I can't remember any right now have a terrible memory, but they're in the archives."
There are people doing a great job archiving material and in 30 years we can look over the jokes and irony of 2011.
For me Twitter is irony.
Except when you have thousands of followers and you can't say anything because everything can be misunderstood and they make a #whatshisnamefacts hashtag and they crush you.
"But when you're in a manageable state, Twitter is pure irony."
And irony works better than any other register.
And soon I saw tweets on banners.
After I'd seen the May '68 book maybe it's the other way around.
But I've laughed so much
All along the walls starting from the underground access gate all full of the most creative messages.
They were also very rich.
And very enrichening.
"Like, even though this goes nowhere, although it comes to nothing, or it doesn't fulfill people's expectations, at least it will have given those who were there a chance to detoxify themselves from the typical political discourse."
"Because it's so boring, political language is so grey and suddenly irony pops up in political language without being demogogical, it's great."
ST:
Even when we have to laugh at ourselves.
There were moments in which I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
"Whether to go or stay... and thanks to the tweets and three posters, I chuckled and was able to go on."
It's curious.
I was marvelled.
"And after a phenomena like this, the satire."
"Like @acampadapolicia, or @putohelicoptero, which is minimalist, but every time I got one of his messages I laughed so much..."
JL: tacatacatacatacatacatacataca...
[laughter]
"There was also a really funny thing that happened whenever I saw a helicopter anywhere in Spain I took a photo and said ""Look! @putohelicoptero is here!"""
Creativity has no limits. @acampadapolicia has made us laugh.
"And that opens so many doors to so many things, so much creativity, you just can't say it's a bad thing."
The new basis is orthonormal.
"Therefore, β0 is equal to v0 inner product with x. β1 is inner product of v1 with x."
"In compact form, we can write β0, β1 as a matrix vector multiplication with a matrix R, which is a rotation matrix."
"A key fact of the rotation matrix, that you can easily verify, is that R transpose times R is equal to identity."
Let's compute a square norm in the canonical basis.
"So, the square norm of x is equal to α0 squared α1 squared."
"In the rotated basis, it's equal to β0 squared plus β1 squared."
Let's verify Parseval.
"So, β0 square plus β1 square is equal to the vector β transposed times β."
This is equal to Rα transpose times Rα.
We reorder the terms.
"We find R transpose R in the middle, but this is equal to identity, so, we have α transpose time α, which, indeed, is equal to α0 squared + α1 squared, verifying Parseval's formula."
Let us now look at approximation.
The problem is the following.
"We have a vector x that belongs to a space v, and we have a subspace S, that is included in v."
"We would like to approximate x with xhat, which belongs to S."
"Of course, there are various ways to do this approximation."
"We are going to be interested in approximation that minimizes the quadratic error, meaning, the difference between x and xhat should be minimum in quadratic norm."
"If we have an orthonormal basis for S, so Sk, k going from 0 to K-1 is an orthornormal basis for S."
"Then, the orthonormal projection will simply be x hat is equal to the summation of the inner product between x and Sk times Sk."
"This orthogonal projection is the best approximation over S, in the sense of least squares."
"So, the least square approximation has properties that it will give a minimum, quadratic error norm."
"So, among all y's that belong to S, the ones that minimizes the quadratic error is x hat, and the error is orthogonal to the approximation."
"So, x minus x hat, inner product with x hat, is equal to 0."
We're going to see this graphically now.
"So, we are in R2, x is a vector in R2, the subspace s is a one dimensional subspace."
And we start exploring what would be the closest point to x belonging to s.
"So, we put circles, we let them grow."
"And as they grow, at some point they touch s, that will be our point x hat, that's given by the blue vector."
And the difference x minus x hat indeed is orthogonal to x hat.
"To make this more concrete, let us look at an example, namely, polynomial approximation."
"So, we look at the Hilbert space, PN, from -1 to 1."
"Fincher would always say, ""It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."""
"And thing our process and the technology couldn't do, is they couldn't understand intent, the intent of the actor."
So it sees a smile as a smile.
"It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile, or a frustrated smile."
So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.
"But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology ""emotion capture,"" as opposed to just motion capture."
Take another look.
Brad Pitt:
"Well, I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon, but ... maybe not."
EU:
That's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes.
(Applause)
"A couple of quick factoids; it really took 155 people over two years, and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut."
"But, that is Benjamin."
Thank you.
[Norvig]
A lot of places are working with their local schools.
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school; the kids are learning how to grow food.
"Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore."
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies.
"This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy."
"You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything."
But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively.
"Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan, which is basically to develop a plan B for the town."
"Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on."
What does it look like if that's not the case?
And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody?
"As a friend of mine says, ""Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."""
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.
"From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world."
We're getting a lot of interest from government.
"And as your velocity changes, the distance and time also change."
That's the equivalent of rotating the coordinate system.
"But there is something that doesn't change, and let me write that down."
This is usually given the Greek
letter Tau [T] squared.
And this is equal to (Δ x^(2)) + (Δ y^(2)) + (Δ Z^(2)) - c^(2) (ΔT)^(2).
And this is invariant.
"This is an invariant interval, sometimes called proper distance."
"And as you change your velocity--as the space, as the mass, as the time all change--this quantity, describing the separation of two events--so, this describes the separation of two events, that quantity changes--doesn't change."
That quantity is invariant.
"Okay, so now, this answers one of the questions that was asked before."
Why does one use c^(2) or c to transform the space coordinate into the time coordinate and back?
It's because you need the c^(2) out here in order to make this invariant.
"If you're calculating the distance, if you use x^(2) plus 1/2 y^(2) or some other constant times y^(2), you're not going to get something that's invariant."
"And it's only when you use the c, here, that you end up with something that's invariant."
"And so, if you think about these as representing the four coordinates of the system, it's clear this one coordinate is x, one is y, one is z, just as you would expect."
"And then, there's this other coordinate, which is c times T, but it's negative so it has to be times the square root of -1."
"So, the four coordinates in space-time can be thought of as x, y, Z and i cT, if you want to think of it that way."
"And the time coordinate is imaginary, because when you square it, you have to end up with a negative number."
Don't worry about the details of that.
"But the presence of the c^(2) here is why you have to use c, in particular, to get from time to space and back."
And that's necessary because this is the thing that doesn't vary with velocity.
All right.
"So, this is actually kind of a weird expression."
"Because unlike the distance between two points--and you'll notice, these three terms put together, that's just the distance squared, ordinarily, but that is not invariant anymore, because there's this other term here, which can vary."
"Unlike the distance, this doesn't have to be positive."
You've got three different cases here.
This interval can be zero for different points.
"In ordinary distance it can only be zero if the two points are the same, but this can be zero for different points, for different events."
"It can be zero, it can be negative, and it can be positive."
"So, what does that mean?"
What happens when it's zero?
"Its not a physically invariant object, Lorentz transformations change it and indeed this distance means nothing physical and reading it off the graph produces no useful information."
"So, it is not true that I can measure off distances."
"They see and on the same scale as I did over there and thus, we figure out where the t prime equal to two save point is."
"So, how do I do it?"
"Well, if I really want to plot where along the t prime axis, the point say t prime equals to one is, what I need to do is the following construction: remember there is something that is preserved in this weird and is physically meaningful in this low ends relativistic world, and that is that c^2 t^2 - x^2 is the same as c^2 sorry for the color violation here, minus x prime squared."
"And along the t prime axis well, that's the point where x prime = zero."
So
I can erase that.
"Furthermore, along the t prime axis, x = vt because this describes the motion of the left side of the ladder which is moving with speed v. So I get that c^2 - v^2."
T squared is equal to equal to c squared t prime squared.
"I am going to eventually figure out exactly the time dilation, relativistic time dilation formula which is that t prime is t times square root of one minus v squared over c squared."
What does that mean?
"That means that the time here, t prime at this point is less than one."
If I draw the point t prime equal to one.
It will be somewhere over here.
And the point t'= two is somewhere over there.
Notice that the scales of the two axis are different.
This is confusing and troubling.
"It has to do with the fact that what is physically meaningful is this Lewenstein Distant, distance if you want this sort of weird distance with the minus sign rather than the Euclidean distance that were."
Is the distance that we observe in the graph.
And you can perform with negative value for the interval a similar calculation.
And you will find that the scale of the x-axes also is extended.
And in general in any space-time diagram the scale is smallest.
And the Observers.
For the observer that is addressed.
"In other words if I draw here the lines of constant x, the constant t prime and the lines of constant x prime then I find indeed that if I drew."
"X equals one, two, three and CT is one, two, three."
"And I then want to draw the lines of x prime equal one two, three."
Then I need to draw them approximately here.
And then x prime equals three would
"lie, lay, lie way over there."
"And likewise, t prime equals to one would be way up here, and two and three and so on."
I wasn't very good at reading things.
"In fact, I don't read much of anything."
"I am extremely dyslexic, and so reading is the hardest thing I do."
"But instead, I go out and I find things."
Then I just pick things up.
I basically practice for finding money on the street.
(Laughter)
"And I wander about the hills, and I have found a few things."
"And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests, the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones."
"And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years."
People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special.
"And so, at that time,"
I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues.
"We were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young, brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds."
So it was pretty interesting stuff.
I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.
We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals.
"In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults."
The adults can recognize the juveniles; the juveniles can recognize the adults.
And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like.
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.
(Laughter)
But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.
"And in his book, he talked about the social animals."
"And then Steven Spielberg, of course, depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures."
"The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of ""Jurassic Park."""
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.
"You all know the story, right."
"I mean, I assume everyone here has seen ""Jurassic Park."""
"If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out."
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it.
It turned out they used it for animation.
If you wanted to move something over and over again you would do it on idle.
"It worked for that generation, but when the next generation of Macintoshes came out that were faster, suddenly all the animation went crazy and didn't work very well."
"The lesson from that was: if you don't provide a right way to do something, the street will figure out its own way."
"It turns out the browser learned from that, and so we've got set interval which was a correct response to this problem."
So HyperCard had a huge impact on the evolution of the browser.
"Basically, the Netscape 2 browser was an attempt to put HyperCard functionality into the browser."
"Not surprisingly, JavaScript is well suited to this model -- not surprisingly because JavaScript was invented specifically to do this."
"In fact, it does it really well."
"So as awful as the DOM is, JavaScript with the DOM is an effective programming environment."
You can actually get stuff done.
"If you put on top of the DOM an Ajax library -- say a good one like YUI 3- it's even better, it's way better."
One of the ways we're blessed here is that JavaScript does not have READ.
"It does not ordinarily break or halt, and that's a good thing."
"It's always been seen over its lifetime as a huge deficit -- 'JavaScript is bad because it can't READ' -- but it turns out that we're actually better off for it, because it's easier for us to think about event loops than people coming from other languages."
"It turns out you can do an event loop in any language, but we're better at it in JavaScript because we've never had this two mind thing where sometimes you block and sometimes you don't."
Being in a world where you never block just makes life easier.
"READ is bad because it blocks, and blocking is bad for event loops, and that's where we live in the browser."
JavaScript programmers are just smarter about using event
"loops than programmers in other languages, it's just a fact."
You guys are just smarter.
Event loop is just one approach to concurrency.
There are lots of others.
The most popular approach today is threading.
"Everything has trade-offs, everything has pros and cons, and these are some of the pros and cons of threading."
"First off, everybody knows what threading is, right?"
I don't have to define that?
Right.
"The first pro, and it's a huge one, is that no rethinking is necessary."
"Any time you come up with something and say 'and you don't have to rethink' it's like great, sign me up."
"I'm ready to do that, I'm ready to not have to think."
All of your bad habits work just fine under threading.
"Salts, you know, sodium, all of that will damage the soil and damage your plants."
"You want to avoid boron or borate, that's also going to damage your plants."
"And chlorine bleaches obviously, you know, kills things; you don't want to send it outside."
The next thing to kind of just get a little more informed is there's a lot of chemicals in our personal care products that are really just not good for us.
"And it's not really a plant issue or a Greywater issue, but it's often a good time when people are going to reuse their water, they want to think about well, what's in this stuff I'm using?"
"And so, if you're interested in doing a little more researches to database, it's called cosmeticdatabase.org."
And you can enter any product and they'll tell you what's in it.
"You know things are, oftentimes, it's kind of shocking to do this."
Any of you guys tried this?
Not yet? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; No. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
"I think it's frightening, so be ready if you want to go down that route."
But it's definitely informative.
You can find out all sorts of things about the products.
And then the other thing is there's products that are recommended.
"So if you don't want to do lots of research, you know, we can tell you what products that we've researched and found to have no salt, no boron and not a lot of other carcinogenic things that are in a lot of products."
"So here are just a few examples like Oasis, Biopac, Ecos, Aubrey"
"Organics, there's more too."
"So, I'm going to talk about kind of some basic things with"
Greywater and this is just for the first way that outdoor simple systems.
"And a lot of times, it's really--Greywater is this unique source of irrigation."
So that's kind of common sense knowledge with other types of irrigation don't really fit with Greywater.
So it's important to kind of understand it and see the different kind of do's and don'ts of Greywater irrigation.
"So the do's, the things you want to do is mulch."
It's a really important component of a system.
You guys know what mulch is?
"Yeah, it's just like woodchips, you know, things covering up your landscapes so it's covering the soil."
Mulch is really important for Greywater.
You also--you always want to have a way to go back to the sewer.
"It's called a three-way valve, and Greg's going to show you one example in a sec."
You want to use plant-friendly products because it's going outside.
"And then you want to use--I put a proven designing clothes because there's, you know, so many different ways you could get your water outside."
"And there's lots of ways people can tinker and, you know, get it to go out there."
Although one of them has been mildly successful in early stage of Alzheimer's.
"So, clearly, Alzheimer's therapy has a very long way to go."
Next time we will continue or discussion of neurodegenerative diseases by talking about Parkinson's disease.
"Here's another nearest neighbor example, and now I'm going to ask a different question."
"Given all the black data points,"
I want to make sure that the red ones are classified as indicated and I am free to choose a different value for K.
"Say I can choose K to be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9."
Check any or all of the K values for which you believe these 3 data points are classified correctly relative to the black training data set.
"In the celebrated example of Prisoner's Dilemma, we have this general scheme where the two prisoners can either cooperate or not."
"Defect, as it's called."
"If they both cooperate, they get some payoff A."
"If they both defect, they get a different payoff D, where A is greater than D."
"However, if they miscoordinate and one of them cooperates and the other defects, then the cooperator gets the lowest possible payoff and the defector gets the largest possible payoff."
And that's true symmetrically here as well.
And this very well known example has a rather counterintuitive paradoxical properties.
Most games are not as conceptually confusing.
Here's an example that's conceptually very clear and these are games of pure competition.
"The situation here is limited to two players, where one player's payoff is exactly the compliment of another player's payoff."
"So, they always add to some constant c."
Often that constant we use is zero.
"And we call it, for that reason, zero sum games, as opposed to constant sum games."
"And since they do sum to zero or to a constant, we only need to remember one number, the pair to one of these and we can infer the payoff to the other player from that."
Here's the most simple version of it.
This is a game of matching pennies.
So you and I each need to pick heads or tail for the coin.
"If we pick the same side, either heads or tails, I win."
Which means that I get a payoff of one and you have minus one.
"If we miscoordinate, and so I pick heads and you tails or the other way around, then you win."
A very straight forward game of pure competition.
"Here's another very well known similar game with three actions from both of us and that's the game of rock, papers, and scissors, also known as rochambo."
"So, if we pick the same action then it's a draw."
And otherwise there are rules for who wins.

Hi there.
"I'm Tucker Balch, and this is Computational Investing, Part one."
"I hope you're doing great. this module is about information and the efficient market hypothesis and we're going to begin taking a look at something called event studies. objectives for this module we're going to look at what are the most common sources of information that you can leverage for investing. learn how information relates to company value and we're going to look at the three versions of the efficient markets hypothesis that are important and the, the, the effect of what we're doing here. and finally in this module we'll look at event studies, how they work and talk about the next assignment for you involving event studies. okay. now, nearly all quantitative-based investing is based on some kind of arbitraged model."
"And, and in, in particular, what we are looking at is an arbitrage between what the price of the equity is on the market and what we believe its, its true value is. so I'm going to draw a blue line here and let's, let's presume that that's the true underlying value of the, of the equity."
"How we, how we get that true value, that's a different topic, but let's assume somehow we know what it is."
"The, the arbitrage comes about when we well, we, we presume that the price on the market should be very close to that true value."
And if it diverges significantly that's an opportunity to either buy or sell the stock on the presumption that it's going to return back to its true value.
"So, if the quoted market price is significantly below the true value, that's a buying opportunity."
And we know the price is going to revert back to the true price or if it's significantly above the true value that's a shorting opportunity.
"And we presume that it's going to go back down to that true value. now another important thing to remember is let me save that real quick. another important thing to remember is that we're always talking here about, about market, market relative in the new image here, okay we're, we're looking for market relat ive value, you know, and, and in particular let me let me draw a line here where the, the, you know, the, the, the price of the market and by, by that I mean S and P 500 varies over time. we're looking for a value relative to that."
"If we take a look at our past, about 20 or 30 years,"
"Brazil was living an era which it was open and eager for democracy, for free speech, like we have now, and we achieved them, and no one wants to lose it."
I think that is absolutely legitimate.
"But what we need to do now is ethically evolve, and build evolved values, and to me, we still need to begin moving towards that."
"But that's just an example, so what's left for society?"
"I absolutely agree, there was a philosopher who said that example isn't the best way to change character, but the only way to do so."
"And if the example that comes from above is worst, we are already lost."
"I believe in that, and if we take a look at what it takes to change a society, we need to look at other societies, the ones that work, that are evolved and developed."
"They were shaped with good examples, so, we also need to create good examples."
"Eduardo, it was wonderful having you here,"
"I want to thank you, and to conclude our chat,"
Veja Online magazine published an article which took a look at how people were rooting in social networks for Sarney to die when he had the bacterial infection in his eyelashes.
And the article was saying that it was wrong for people to be rooting for Sarney's death.
"I'm not going to ask you if you rooted for his death, but I will ask you this:"
"There is a Canadian doctor who's taking one of John Lennon's teeth, and he's promising to make a clone out of him."
Are you in favor of making a clone of Sarney?
[music].
"The more you shoot, the more you learn."
"You know, that you either will or won't incorporate in the next shoot."
[music].
"I mean style is everything, style is why people hire you."
Getting to know your camera so you're not thinking about it.
"I can focus on the creative stuff and I don't have to think about technical stuff because that's what I'm paid to do, the creative stuff."
[music].
So this is my inspiration wall.
"Deconstructing that photo helps you figure out what you like, and you can incorporate that into your own work."
[music].
Photo Trekking was birthed out of the travel photos that I've taken over the last few years.
"And the travel stuff that you're seeing here, I've never really been paid for."
"You know, working with charities or shooting my own personal work on vacations or, you know, walk around with a camera, that kind of thing."
"You never know, it could turn into a book,[LAUGH] and that's kind of what happened. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Nick's photos are the story of Pencils of Promise in a lot of ways it's also the emotion of Pencils of Promise."
It's going to tell our story going forward.
"Really, it's not that I can't remember that moment. or that I don't want to speak poorly of anyone."
"One thing I do remember was calling two journalists who had been assaulted that night, and I couldn't believe what was happening."
"I said ""this is senseless""."
And I thought if it happened to me I couldn't put up with the idea of people thinking that I'd had it coming.
"You know, thinking ""he must have done something wrong""."
"I thought if it had happened to me, I'd have to do a lot of explaining about what I was doing at that moment."
"And it's a fracture, because you know people, two people who"
"I spoke to that night, and they're anything but violent [laughter]."
Anything but violent!
ST:
Violence is never a good thing.
"For me it was a kind of emotional ""deflowering""."
"I didn't know these things could happen in this country, I couldn't believe it."
"But when the press was assaulted, it was like crossing a border."
Like giving a signal.
I was really moved when I heard that story.
JL:
"I was really moved when I read you, because you explained yourself so well and although bad things happen, there are things that can't happen."
"Although that day there were a lot of things that could be criticised, though I wasn't there,"
I've read a lot of people who I trust from within the 15M movement who did things that normally aren't coherent with the 15M demonstrations.
But that's one thing and what you talked about regarding real atrocities.
"Police abuse that were later well documented, so nobody can deny it."
That also appeared in the mainstream media
"Suddenly the mainstream media were considering as true certain aspects of the police abuse that they would normally be very skeptical of, if there hadn't been documents and proof, thanks to the net, the new technologies, etc."
"Or even myself, I don't think I'm anti anything, but if I didn't know the people who were there and if I hadn't seen the videos maybe I'd have thought there had been agitators within the group."
So I don't shout out to the world that I'm a great defender of freedom for the people in the street.
"I'm saying that if it hadn't been for the internet, a lot of people, who normally got their information from normal sources, would have said ""they must have had it coming""."
And yet you talk to someone you know and you ask yourself how it could happen.
Something breaks.
You stop trusting.
"That night I thought, it's a bitter sensation,"
I thought they'd turned these two friends of mine into two anti-system people.
You know your position down.
"So, do your friends, right?"
This could be use in all sorts of very powerful ways.
"Your car, right?"
Your car should be able to drive itself.
"After all, the car knows where it is, knows where the other cars are, knows where you're going, right?"
"You can monitor in case it has a bug in it, right?"
"But aside from that, the car should take you where you want to go."
"This explosion of real-time telemetry, which is a fantastic explosion on information measured in what are called terabytes and petabytes of information, is the defining computer science data challenge."
And what's interesting about products like
"Google Maps, you saw some of this in our demo, and Google Earth is that people who love the earth--and I hope it's all of us--can love it even more."
"We can know even more about what's going on in our planet, by the way, our only planet that we care so deeply about and want to make sure it's in good shape."
You really do have all the world's information at your fingertips in any language.
There are more than 160 million uses of translate every day.
"That number is, again, growing very, very quickly."
People actually don't all speak English.
"It's always a shock to Americans, sorry."
Germans understand this very well.
It's amazing how much information there is in languages that you don't speak.
"It's true for all of us, and especially for English speakers."
We will know and we can help you figure out what to pay attention to right now.
"The explosion in user content, the explosion in real-time data, what am I thinking, what am I doing, social networks and so forth, we can help you sort that out."
We can help you figure out what is most relevant to you right now.
"Now, it's interesting, you're never lonely because your friends are always nearby, we always know where they are, they're always near you, they're always connected to you, at least in cyberspace."
"Your friends make Google in the web more powerful, they augment it, they make it special, and you're never bored, right?"
"Instead of wasting a lot of time watching television, you can waste time watching the Internet, right?"
And we have a lot more choices for you to waste your time with.
"So, not only you're never lonely, you're never bored."
"And occasionally, you might learn something in the process of being entertained, so whether it's games or movies or videos, and in the Leanback experience, we actually suggest what you should be watching because we know what you care about."
So you don't need to worry so much about what your--what are the choices.
We figure it out for you.
We're never out of ideas.
"Both say in unison, ""I certainly do."""
"Marriage is the same from here to Peru, Here, some examples of what it will construe:"

"And top notch was his beer home brew, And no you don't smell his smelly old shoe."
"Bayley don't demonstrate your clumsy kung foo,"
Take Megan out when she wants fondoo.
"Here's your biggest marriage advice clue,"
Don't you dare speak of her taboo tattoo!
"And let NO ONE speak of a love that's untrue, From humble beginnings, all of this grew."
"Megan and Bayley, almost time for adieu, Honeymoon awaits, have fun when you scream down the highway at a high rate of speed on the way to your destination."
"All seriousness, you two are a great couple."

Congrats to both of you.
"The answer for the first one is 0.125--that is the half times the half times the half, makes an 8th."
We showed earlier that this was 1/K--1 over the size of K.
Now we've shown that the probability of M equals M* is equal to the probability the message is M* divided by the K.
We've shown these two things.
Now we just need to plug them into our conditional probability formula.
"We're going to have this on top, and we're going to divide that by the probability of B, which is 1 over K."
"The ""over Ks"" will cancel out, leaving us with the probability that the message is equal to M*."
That's exactly our definition of a perfect cipher.
We can conclude that the one-time pad is a perfect cipher.
It exactly satisfies the definition of a perfect cipher where the cipher text reveals nothing at all about the key.
You might think the class should be over.
We've achieved our goal of perfect secrecy using a cipher that was invented over 100 years ago and is actually provably perfectly secret.
We're not going quite done yet.
There are some pretty serious problems with the one-time pad.
One problem is that it's malleable.
"What malleable means is if Alice sends her ciphertext to Bob, and our evil interceptor--this times it's not just an eavesdropped, it's an eavesdropper with a hammer."
"If our interceptor has control over the network, and instead of just being an eavesdropper can be an active attacker."
An active attacker means they can actually change messages on the network.
Let us see the words of the Tiferet Israel who is one of the commentators of the Mishnah.He writes as follows.
"""Man is compared to a tree in the bible and his wisdom is his honor"
"like the honor the branches are to a tree."""
"Wisdom is beauty just like the branches beautify the tree. ""the observance of the Mitzvot of the Torah is like the roots of the tree.The Mitzvot themselves  are the roots,when a person fulfills them.Look how contrary this is to the way people think."
"""Though,when he becomes too knowledgable.."""
"Like a person who studies a lot in the Kabbalah centers they have today,where he studies and studies but doesn't observe anything practical."
"So he says when he becomes too knowledgable,""He is like a tree that used up all his energy for its branches thereby making its energy too dull for its roots."
"Meaning,the investment itself turns out to be a deficiency."
"It is known that in nature,every tree whose strength spreads  to the very top doesn't have enough strength for the bottom."
"And the two of them,meaning the one who has many branches on top and the one who has few roots below,will uproot more easily."
Same goes for a man like this.
"""By the branching out of his wisdom of God's hidden laws"
"He learns and learns,the hidden aspects of the Torah,Kabbalah etc."
"So will the roots of his heavenly fear be lessened and weakened in his heart."""
Why?Because he doesn't apply or fulfill.
And they will both be the reason for his fall.When the wind of heresy captures him at the end it will completely uproot him from his eternal area of success.
"Meaning,you may see a person"
like this whose wisdom specifically will bury him at the end and uproot him.
Therefore it is so important to know that alongside the wisdom that a person acquires he must also apply the Mitzvot and fulfill them in everyday life.
We will conclude with one more special thing that we learn from the world of vegetation.
That is the topic of the  resurrection of the dead.
"There are many who wonder how a person who passed away and was buried,will once again be resurrected."
It sounds illogical.But a person who stands before God and asks
"Him,Tell me,God,will you really resurrect the dead in the future?"
"We've buried a person,how can he rise?"
What does God answer him?
"He says,are you surprised that I will do that?"
I do it already.
I do it in the world of vegetation.
How can a seed grow?
"You take the seed plant it in the ground,cover it and water it."
"It goes through a certain process  and suddenly from within this process where just a minute ago the seed  looked like something you could grind and make flour or bread from and now it looks bad.But from this bad looking seed,a stem comes out with a few dozen grains at its head."
"When contaminated food is ingested in the body, it weakens the immune system."
That's why the allergy aggravates and the diseases recur.
Some people claim their healed injury has started to ache again.
A weakened immune system also causes fatigue.
People with fatigue will probably become unable to extend themselves.
"About two weeks ago when we showed this data to you, you said you'd like to see a breakdown of the number of the reports according to prefectures."
So we created a map to show which prefecture those emails came from.
"And as you see here, most of them came from Tohoku and Kanto regions."
"In other words, from contaminated regions."
We are an webcast station that anyone anywhere in Japan can watch.
"Not a local TV station that can be viewed, for example, only in Kanto."
"Considering this fact, I was half-shocked and half-unsurprised to see most of the reports came from Kanto and Tohoku."
This seems to be an evidence that the connection with radiation cannot be ignored.
"Ideally, the government should be the first to conduct this kind of epidemiological research for the sake of the public health."
"The last time I went to Fukushima, I heard a story of some children in kindergartens and nursery schools in Date City in Fukusima Prefecture who aggravated a cold that lead to pneumonia and were constantly in and out of hospital, because of a weakened immune system."
This was exactly what happened in Chernobyl and I was shocked to hear that.
I really wished that such things would never ever happen in Japan.
I'm very worried by the fact that the people have been eating contaminated food and various symptoms have already emerged.
Something must be done.
"In Chernobyl, nothing was done with children for the first 3 years, which led to the high rate of cancer among them."
I'd really like the Japanese government to do something about it as soon as possible.
You went to Belarus 7 years after the Chernobyl accident and saw the situation there.
We're going to show some photos from the visit soon...
How was it?
In Belarus?
"Yes, when you visited Belarus...the photo is shown now."
"Well, they said there were no healthy children."
"If there were 100 children at school, 98 of them had some kind of health problems."
They said those children got ill when their immune systems weakened because of stress or shocking event.
"In other words, they were in the gray zone between ""healthy"" and ""ill."""
Most of the children were like ticking bombs that could explode at any minute.
"And the class length at school was shortened to something like 25 minutes, instead of 45 minutes."
"And, so lets figure out what happened at event number one."
So let's say that the twin on earth measured a time T1.
"And therefore twin on the, the twin that was traveling measured a time T prime one."
Now where did this event occurred.
"Well this event occurred at the position. x1 which is equal to vt1 because the twin was moving with speed v, but it also occurred at position x prime one."
And we know what x prime one is.
"X prime one is zero because in his own frame, the moving twin was addressed and therefore we could now set, the point is that we can now compute the invariant interval between here and here in the two different frames and set it to be the same."
"So, that tells us, and again"
"I'm not gonna maintain all of the colors, that c squared, t1 squared minus x1 squared."
Has to be equal to'c' squared't1' prime squared minus'x1' prime squared.
"But we know some things, we know'x1' prime is zero, we know that'x1' is'vt1'."
"So, c squared t1 squared minus v squared, t1 squared is c squared t1 prime squared and we do the usual calculation and we find that t1 prime is t1 times the square root."
Of one minus V squared over C squared.
"Or, written otherwise, t1 is t1 prime / by the square root of one - v^2 over c^2."
"So that, what we are saying is that this event appears to the stationary twin to have, happened at a later time than it appears to the moving twin."
Why do I know it's a later time?
Because I'm dividing by a number smaller than one.
"Well, yeah, you say, of course."
"But on the other hand, I can draw this line."
"And say that is true, but that's because I am measuring the time at event one."
I can invent an event number two here.
"Which is simultaneous with the, the, the moving twins decision to return and that event number two clearly occurs at a time."
Earlier than T one.
And if I compute I will find that in fact T two.
Is exactly't1' prime times you can compute this.
It's again these two happened at the same value of't' prime but one happened at the'x' equals zero and one happened at'x' prime equals zero.
"And the symmetry between these is of course the usual understanding that we have the stationary twin sees time dilation, sees the moving twin's clock running slow and the moving twin sees the stationary twin's clock running slow ."
So.
The twin whose coordinates are black thinks that his brother is aging slowly.
The twin whose coordinates are blue thinks his brother is aging slowly.
"So how is it that upon, but on the other hand, it is clear that since from at this point t1 is less, is clearly more than t1 prime and since this is t1 prime is how much the moving twin aged, t1 is how much the stationary twin aged."
"Since the same thing is now repeated on their return, it's clear that if this is true, then 2t1 = 2t1 prime / that and upon their return the stationary twin will be older."
"But boss, where am I gonna put all this stuff?"
"I mean, a storage room is almost full, I can't even walk in there."
"The next topic I want to address is called ""Segmentation."""
"This is the problem of given a sequence of language, figure out how to break it up into words."
"Now, in Chinese we don't have spaces between the words, and so in order to understand if the first word of this message corresponds to a single character or two characters or what, we have to be able to do the process of segmentation and figure out where they are."
"In English, we don't have that."
Words have spaces between them.
"So we don't have the segmentation problem, but we certainly have it in speech recognition in languages like English, because this speech sounds are sometimes run together without pauses in between them, and there are places where we do have a language without segmentation."
"For example, in the language of URLs you could have a URL like ""choosespain.com"", which is the travel site that tries to encourage you to choose Spain as your travel destination, but if you segment it wrong, you'd come up with ""chooses pain,"" which would not be the intended expression for that particular URL."
So segmentation is an important problem.
Let's talk about how to do it.
So welcome.
"In this next module, I'm going to be talking with Dr. Gary Friedman."
I'm thrilled to have him here today.
I've mentioned his name a few times in this course.
"He provided a number of the, examples that"
I've shared with you.
And he's been a long-time champion of good writing in the medical literature.
"So, it's great to have him here today."
"He was, he has been an editor at the American Journal of Epidemiology for over two decades, and was the Director of the Division of Research at Kaiser Permanente in Northern California for almost a decade, and also is on the editorial board of a number of other journals and currently a consulting professor at"
Stanford.
"So I really appreciate you being here today, Gary."
"Oh, thank you."
It's a pleasure.
"So I'm just gonna start by asking obviously, we need to do good science."
"But besides good science, what are those, some of the key elements that journal editors are looking for when they get a paper."
"Well, one is novelty."
Mm-hm.
"That's we will often reject a paper without even sending it out for peer review, if it's just a repeat of findings that are already well know."
"I mean, if you're writing the thirtieth paper on alcohol and how alcohol is related."
"It to high blood pressure, or obesity is related to mortality."
"Don't expect people to be very enthusiastic [laugh], about it."
Call that an understatement.
In a piece for The Washington Post
"Jamila Bey calls Limbaugh's words — ""hate speech."""
"""What Limbaugh did - and does frequently - is ""slut-shaming"" and it's no less hateful and derogatory than racial slurs."""
Democrats are calling on leaders of the GOP to condemn Limbaugh's comments.
But on MSNBC — a political science professor says she hopes they don't so voters can see what the party is actually about.
26% of voters in the election in 2008 were single women.
"So they decided the outcome of the election, and they may well do it again if Republicans keep promoting this hateful dialogue."""
But Limbaugh's point about mandating coverage is one that continues to have support within the GOP.
As Mona Charen writes for the conservative National Review.
"""Democrats come along and force insurance companies to provide for free something that 95 percent of people have been purchasing, and when we object, they scream that we want to ""send women back"""
"It's ludicrous and dishonest and manipulative."""
"House Speaker John Boehner did condemn the comments — calling them ""inappropriate."""
"And Politico reports , Friday President Obama himself called Fluke to thank her for speaking out."
This is by no means Limbaugh's first brush with controversy.
"But this time, The Atlantic Wire reports — advertisers are distancing themselves from the war of words."
"Still others note, Limbaugh's brand of runaway rhetoric can't do much to help the cause."
The Christian Science Monitor's Peter Grier asks — has he gone too far this time?
"""In pouring gasoline on a subject that was already a propane fire, he may have drawn attention to himself. but it's possible he's singeing Republicans who are standing close to the action."""
Fluke herself has responded to Limbaugh's comments — calling them outside the bounds of civil discourse.
"I was convinced as i have been told that I would be protecting civilians against armed gangs, Algerian snipers.."
"And then I saw that these people are from Yefren like us, Libyans, brothers and real men (brave)."
I appeal to stop the bloodshed in all of Libya land and I hope that will come true.
We have been told that these people are not libyans.
And that there are also Algerian snipers.We were attacked and we surrendered to them and told them we are all Libyans.
"They are not Algerians sniper, nor foreigners - only Libyans."
"We didn't find mercenaires as we had been told, only Libyans from Yefren, and frankly we found none of what we been told."
What I hope is that all this bloodshed will stop.
Let's look at some examples of gamification for social good.
"They're in four categories, health and wellness."
Energy and environment.
Education and government.
It came out of Netscape.
Netscape at one time had been the almost monopoly browser vendor.
"It was the first commercial browser, so we had, I don't know, 99% of the market share at one time."
And it was a pretty exciting time.
That was when the Internet and the Web actually really exploded.
Microsoft appeared.
They started building its own browser.
Microsoft did a couple of things that ended up eventually building a good browser.
And it also engaged in a whole range of illegal activities.
And so the combination of that changed the landscape drammatically.
And Netscape management had the foresight to recognise they could not continue and be successful in the way they had been operating.
And they realised with the help of the engineering folk set at Netscape that the best opportunity was to convert their typical proprietary closed commercial product into an open source product.
This was radical in its day.
"Open source is mainstream now, but it was not then."
"Open source was deep in the technical community, it never surfaced in a product, it was all sort of odd and it was a very radical move."
"The second thing that happened is that the management team,"
"I was there at the time, a lot of us were, but I was part of these discussions, realised that an open source project had to be real."
"So, inside Netscape there was created a small group of people who were charged with the job of building a successful open source project."
"And there was a larger group of people, engineering, that was charged with building a successful Netscape product."
"That Netscape product was designed to make money for Netscape and ultimately money for AOL, after AOL bought Netscape."
"So, in the very early days of Mozilla, through '98, '99, 2000, we had these two different groups."
"We had the engineering group, which was a 100-150 people working on building the Netscape navigator product managed by a set of people wanting to use that product to make money for AOL."
"Then we had the small group of people who were charged with building Mozilla as an open source project, building contributors from all sorts of different places and building a technology base that was useful for many different companies."
The open source side.
That was small in name.
There were six or eight of us.
"Of those, Mick was one of them,"
"Gerv was one of them,"
"Dan was one of them,"
"Brendan was one of them,"
"I was one of them,"
Shaver was one of them and there was a few of other folks who aren't here any longer.
"It was a disaster, and they were about to hit the wall."
Have a look at this bit of film footage.
"It makes me very sad because, while it's a fascinating animal, and it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction, we didn't, unfortunately, at this same time, have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species."
"These are photos of the last surviving thylacine, Benjamin, who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart."
"To add insult to injury, having swept this species nearly off the table, this animal, when it died of neglect --"
The keepers didn't let it into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart.
"It died of exposure, and in the morning, when they found the body of Benjamin, they still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump."
Does it have to stay this way?
"In 1990, I was in the Australian Museum."
I was fascinated by thylacines.
I've always been obsessed with these animals.
"And I was studying skulls, trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals, and I saw this jar, and here, in the jar, was a little girl thylacine pup, perhaps six months old."
"The guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup, and they pickled it in alcohol."
"I'm a paleontologist, but I still knew alcohol was a DNA preservative."
"But this was 1990, and I asked my geneticist friends, couldn't we think about going into this pup and extracting DNA, if it's there, and then somewhere down the line in the future, we'll use this DNA to bring the thylacine back?"
The geneticists laughed.
But this was six years before Dolly.
Cloning was science fiction.
It had not happened.
But then suddenly cloning did happen.
"And I thought, when I became director of the Australian Museum,"
I'm going to give this a go.
I put a team together.
"We went into that pup to see what was in it, and we did find thylacine DNA."
It was a eureka moment.
We were very excited.
"Unfortunately, we also found a lot of human DNA."
"Every old curator who'd been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen, put their hand in the jar, pulled it out and thought,"
"""Wow, look at that,"" plop, dropped it back in the jar, contaminating this specimen."
And that was a worry.
"If the goal here was to get the DNA out and use the DNA down the track to try to bring a thylacine back, what we didn't want happening when the information was shoved into the machine and the wheel turned around and the lights flashed, was to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine."
"It would've kept the curator very happy, but it wasn't going to keep us happy."
You don't have to conquer all these small problems that usually are associated with crops.
This had to be done with soybeans.
And these things had be done with corn.
"I mean, if you think about the effort that goes on in corn and soybeans today, in terms of the breeding effort..."
"I mean, you are looking at the breeding effort going on right here."
Win Phippen:
All right.
"Well, welcome everybody."
It's nice to finally meet Hannah.
And welcome to the mom.
"If you guys don't already know, I'm Dr. Win Phippen."
"And what we're doing today, essentially, is giving an opportunity for the interns to come back from their summer projects and sort of report back on what they did all summer long."
What they did for the money.
And tell us all about what they have learned.
And then hopefully we'll have a chance to talk to some of the advisers and the professors and giving us some feedback.
And we definitely want feedback from the students on how we can improve the program.
The grant that this is all part of is trying to create opportunities for students to get interested in the field of plant breeding.
And so we're going to be offering these internship programs for the next three years.
"And we'll have some opportunities to even create other opportunities in doing summer internships not only at Pioneer, at the University of illinois, Iowa State, and over in Peoria, but also summer work positions here on campus during the summer and during the school semester."
"So, today, really is an informal time for the student -- so don't get too nervous -- to present 15 minutes or so of what you've learned on your particular projects."
"And I think what you'll find is, you all worked in plant breeding, or in plant production areas, but you all worked on very different crops."
From chemistry to corn breeding to Hannah's variety of different things.
And then
"later on, we're going to hear from Victoria, our Iowa State person who is coming in on Amtrak, and they won't be here until 11."
"And then she is going to talk about the George Washington Carver program that she did over at Iowa State with Candice Gardner, with that plant introduction station."
"Billie, Student Intern:"
My research at the lab focused on analyzing the percent of oil and moisture and fatty acid content of pennycress.
[Text on screen:
"Billie, Student Intern, WlU School of Agriculture]"
And several studies were conducted while I was there including a position of the seed location on the plant to determine how much oil it had.
And different herbicides were used on the plants.
And a variety of trials were conducted and some other studies.
"You're going to be very, very busy."
It's going to ruin your evening.
It's our strategy.
Some more questions?
Yes? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ASANTl:
"Matt Asanti, IFA International. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Hi there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ASANTl:
"You mentioned all of the benefits of the new technology and I'm sure when you're doing your research as well, you're considering the downsides with all of the information that you're collecting and possessing."
"So, what are the dangers according to you?"
And do you think there's a real danger also in creating an elite by restricting access to the Internet as well? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Well, for the latter part, we've worked, all of us at Google, I personally--many people that I've worked with have worked very hard to make the Internet available to everyone."
"And because of the tremendous success of mobile phone, data and a particular GPRS edge, UMTS and now LTE Technology, it's reasonable to expect that over the next 5 to 10 years, 5 out of the 6 billion or so humans will have access to some level of mobile connectivity and some number of billions, certainly more than one because we're nearly there now, will have access to powerful smartphones and the kind of web computing."
"That is a life-changing experience for them, so I'm very, very excited about it."
I think that the downsides are all obvious.
"It's always a shock to people to discover that criminals use the telephone, and yet we still use the phone."
We haven't banned the telephone.
"And I think the fact of the matter is that there are evil people in the world, they will use this technology."
It's important that we be alert.
It's important that we recognize that the laws are there for the reason that we all follow them.
But we have no illusion about how this technology could be misused as well.
"And I think that the governments in the world, police forces and so forth need to focus on this because it will be a new source, among other things, of some bad behavior as well as hopefully enormous amount of good behavior. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [INDlSTlNCT], I'm working for a German"
Radio Stations.
Will Google phones also be able to identify people in the future?
"You gave us a great example with this cathedral, how about I point my hand--my Google phone on just, say, a person that I want his email address or like his hobbies or--can Google help me with that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
The answer is no.
And I hope that--and
"I'm sorry if you wanted that feature, it's no."
There are a number of reason why it's no.
"One is it's illegal because you can't use--in the European law, you can't use that kind of information which, I think, is a good law."
So the second thing is that it would be a significant invasion of people's privacy.
"So, if people want to give you that information, it's easy for them to transmit it, but you won't be able to randomly find things out about people without their permission. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And in the US? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Same answer.
There are a couple of opportunities for algebraic simplifications.
"So, we can replace the squaring up here, by a multiply."
"And down here we had a multiply by two, which we can replace by a left shift of one."
Next we can observe that we have some copies and constants.
So we have a constant assignment to b and a copy assignment to c And those can be propagated forward to the uses of b and c.
"Once we've done that, we can do constant folding."
"So here, the assignment to e, The opera-, the arguments to the shift are all constants, And so that can be replaced by an assignment, that e gets the value six."
Next we could observe that we have a common sub expression that we could eliminate that both a and d have the value x times x.
So the assignment to d could be replaced by a copy that d now gets the value of a.
Now we have two opportunities again for copying constant propagation the assignment to D and the assignment to E can be propagated forward.
And finally we can do a bunch of dead code elimination.
"So, assuming that, none of these values, B, C, D, or E is used anyplace else in the program, all four of these statements can be deleted."
And this is where we actually get some real performance improvement.
"So here we actually are now saving entire instructions, and that's the best kind of savings that we can have And so we wind up with this as our final form."
So notice that a is assigned the value x*x.
"F is then assigned, the value a+a, And then g is assigned the value six*f."
"Now, this is not quite as fast as it could be, alright?"
There's actually one more algebraic optimization that could be done.
"We can notice here that f is actually=to two*a,"
And then we could do some rearrangement here to discover that g=12*f.
"Sorry, sorry twelve x a."
"Alright, And then this statement assignment to F might become dead code, and we could delete it from the program."
"I think some compilers would actually find this, but I believe that even current state of the art compilers, many of them, would not discover this last rearrangement to the program."
My name's Raquel Ruvalcaba and I work with the Department of Environment and we're recycling oil for o ur community today.
"""Thank you."" When they recycling it we can actually go into a refinery and they c an reuse it again."
"""Aqui no mas."" They do the oil changes themselves anyway, so now they know where to take it back to, and what to do with it."
"""A lot of people don't change their own oil cuz they think it's a headache."
"I do, always have."
"""I change motor oil often."" ""And I don't throw it down the sewers either, like other people used to do."" ome people do."
"""It's safe for the environment and also you can reuse it."" ""So bring it here, and if you have a whole bunch of toxics you want to get rid of just call that number, they'll collect it at your home."" ""It's a waste to throw it all away when you can reuse it again."
"It still has life in it, all i t has is just dirt."
It just needs to be filtered out and it can be used for other products.
So if we multiply this matrix times-- let's call this vector x.
"This is x1, x2, all the way down to xn, what is this going to be equal to?"
So this is vector x right here.
"So if I multiply matrix I, my identity matrix, I sub n, and"
"I multiply it times my vector x, where x is a member of Rn, has n components, what am I going to get?"
"Well, I'm going to get 1 times x1 plus 0 times x2 plus 0 times x3 plus 0 times x4, all of that."
"So essentially, I'm going to have-- you can kind of view it as this row dotted with the vector."
So the only nonzero term is going to be the 1 times the x1.
"So it's going to be x1-- sorry, let me do it like this."
So you're going to get another vector in Rn like that.
"And so the first term is that row essentially being dotted with that column, and so you just get x1."
"And then the next entry is going to be this row, or you could view it as the transpose of this row dotted with that column, so 0 times x1 plus 1 times x2 plus 0 times everything else."
"So the only nonzero term is the 1 times x2, so you get an x2 there."
"And then you keep doing thatt, and what are you going to get?"
You're going to get an x3 because the only nonzero term here is the third one and you're going to go all the way down until you get an xn.
But what is this thing equal to?
This is just equal to x.
"So the neat thing about this identity matrix that we've created is that when you multiply it times any vector, you got the vector again."
The identity matrix times any vector in Rn-- it's only defined for vectors in Rn-- is equal to that vector again.
"And actually, the columns of the identity matrix have a special-- I guess the set of columns has a special name."
"So if we call this first column e1 and this second column e2 and the third column e3 and we go all the way to en, these vectors, these column vectors here, the set of these-- so let's say e1, e2, all the way to en-- this is called the standard basis for Rn."
So why is it called that?
"Well, the word basis is there, so two things must be true."
These things must span Rn and they must be linearly independent.
It's pretty obvious from inspection they're linearly independent.
"If this guy has a 1 here and no one else has a 1 there, there's no way you can construct that 1 with some combination of the rest of the guys."
And you can make that same argument for each of the ones in each of the components.
So it's clearly linearly independent.
"And then to see that you can span, that you can construct any vector with a linear combination of these guys, you just really have to-- you know, whatever vector you want to construct, if you want to construct x1-- let me put it this way."
If you want to construct this vector-- let me write it this way.
Let me pick a different one.
"Let's say you want to construct the vector a1, a2, a3 all the way down to an."
Shit!!
"Well done, with your stupid make-up!"
"Ah, well done, really, well done!"
"Hey, don't start!"
"See what you've done, you?"
"Oh, look at that now!"
"I've got you, you've got me, by the beard; the first one of us to laugh will get a slap"
Are you crazy?
I didn't laugh
Yes you did!
But I haven't done anyhting
Dishonesty!
"What's wrong with you, are you insane?"
"What, you got some complaints?"
"But that's almost a punch in the face, not just a slap!"
"Ah but that's normal, if you laugh hard you get a huge slap"
What?
I get a huge slap?
I get a huge slap?
"After World War II with most of Europe in ruins, tension grew between the Soviet Union and the United States."
It was clear that the next global superpower required the ability to both launch and successfully defend nuclear attacks from intercontinental ballistic missiles.
"In North America, the most vulnerable point of attack was over the North Pole."
"So in 1958, a joint effort between United States and Canada was established, known as NORAD, or North American Aerospace Defence Command."
An important line of defence was the semi-automatic ground environment.
It was an automated system of over 100 long distance radars scattered across North America.
They were connected to computerized radar stations that transmitted tracking data using telephone lines or radio waves.
"All of this radar information was fed into a primary warning center, buried a mile deep inside Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado."
This application of machine to machine communication allowed operators to make split-second decisions using information transmitted and processed automatically by computers.
"This idea of being ""online"" was quickly adapted and advanced by universities in the following years, as they understood the potential of computer networking."
"The thing that makes the computer communication network special is that it puts the workers, that is the team members who're geographically distributed in touch, not only with one another, but with the information base with which they worked all the time, and this is obviously going to make a tremendous difference in how we plan, organize, and execute almost everything of any intellectual consequence."
"If we get into a mode in which everything is handled electronically, and your only identification is some little plastic thing you stick into the machinery, that I can imagine that they want to get that settled up with your bank account just right now, and put it through all the checks, and that would require a network."
Money transfers were just one of a growing number of applications which required encryption to remain secure.

Sadhguru:
"When you are unable to hear what somebody else is saying, your relationships will go bad."
(Laughs)
"In many ways, the fundamentals of your relationship is, you are willing to listen to the other person, isnt it?"
Hum?
"If you want to say everything, there will be no relationship."
"Relationships, for most of you the way you are right now, the quality of your relationship"
largely decides the quality of your life.
Is that so?
Hum?
The quality of relationships that you hold in your life
largely decides the very quality of life that you live.
"So, when it is playing such an important role in your life,"
I think it needs to be looked at.
So what is the basis of a relationship?
Why do human beings need a relationship first of all?
"Relationships are formed on different levels, various types of relationships, to fulfill different types of needs."
"The needs may be physical, psychological, emotional, social, financial, political, it could be any kind."
"But to fulfill various needs within a human being, relationships are established on different levels."
"Whatever the nature of the relationship, whatever the type of relationship, still the fundamental aspect is you have a need to fulfill."
"No I have nothing to get, I want to give."
"Giving is also as much a need as receiving, isnt it?"
Yes?
"But, of course, that only happened because there were occasions when the Mongols did slaughter entire towns."
"So, with all that background,"
let us return to the question of Mongol awesomeness.
"First, 5 arguments for awesome:"
1.
The Mongols really did reinvigorate cross-Eurasian trade.
"The Silk Road trading routes that had existed for about 1,000 years by the time the Mongols made the scene, had fallen into disuse, but the Mongols valued trade, because they could tax it, and they did a great job of keeping their empire safe."
"It was said that a man could walk from one end of the Mongol empire to the other, with a gold plate on his head, without ever fearing being robbed."
2.
"The Mongols increased communication, through Eurasia, by developing this pony express-like system of way stations, with horses and riders that could quickly relay information."
"It was called the Yam System and it also included these amazing bronze passports, which facilitated travel."
3.
Another thing that travelled along Mongol trade routes was cuisine.
"For example, it was because of the Mongols that rice became a staple of the Persian diet, which I mention entirely because I happen to like Persian food."
4.
"The Mongols forcibly relocated people who were useful to them, like artists, and musicians, and, especially, administrators."
"As you can imagine, the Mongols weren't much for administrative tasks,"
"like keeping records, so they found people who were good at that stuff and just moved them around the empire."
"This created the kind of cross-cultural pollination that world historians, these days, get really excited about."
And 5.
"The Mongols were almost, unprecedentedly, tolerant of different religions."
"They themselves were shamanists, believing in nature spirits, but since their religion was tied to the land from which they came, they didn't expect new people to adopt it, and they didn't ask them to."
"So you could find Muslims and Buddhists and Christians, and people of any other religion you can think of, prospering throughout the Mongol empire."
"And, it's that kind of openness that has led historians to go back and re-evaluate the Mongols, seeing them as a precursor to modernity."
"But there is another side of the story that we should not forget, so here are 5 reasons why the Mongols might not be so great:"
1.
Here is Genghis Khan's definition of happiness.
"""The greatest happiness is to vanquish"
"""your enemies, to chase them before you,"
"""to rob them of their wealth,"
"""to see those dear to them bathed in tears,"
"""to clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters."""
"And to trust that even though  sometimes circumstances seem to conspire against us for things not to happen  the way we want to, in fact they actually are  a result of how much effort we put in pursuing our passions, and how we use our  sensitivity to understand other people and to  support each other."
"After all, what is ""to trust""?"
To trust is to not get offended.
Trust is when you are able to...
"Trust is to not get offended, and  allow yourself to give your best, because that is the only way  of having no regrets, so that when your time finally comes,  you will be able to leave this world a much better place  than when you arrived in it."
Thank you!
(Applause)
"So, this is my grandfather,"
"Salman Schocken, who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed, and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table."
He never went back to school.
"Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores."
"Salman was the consummate perfectionist, and every one of his stores was a jewel of Bauhaus architecture."
"He was also the ultimate self-learner, and like everything else, he did it in grand style."
"He surrounded himself with an entourage of young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka, and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace."
"And yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming."
"He fled Germany, together with his family,"
leaving everything else behind.
"His department stores confiscated, he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture."
"This high school dropout died at the age of 82, a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and founder of Schocken Books, an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired by Random House."
Such is the power of self-study.
And these are my parents.
They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.
They were too busy building a family and a country.
"And yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong, tenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked with thousands of books, records and artwork."
"I remember quite vividly my father telling me that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set, then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio."
(Laughter)
"And that's me,"
"I was going to say holding my first abacus, but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an iPad."
(Laughter)
So one thing that I took from home is this notion that educators don't necessarily have to teach.
"Instead, they can provide an environment and resources that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own."
"Self-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment: these are the virtues of a great education."
And the real idea is that the fun of this is that it reaches as many students as possible.
"So, when I'm on my deathbed, it would be nice... you know in the for-profit realm a big success would have been IPO or you get acquired."
But here the big success is you can reach millions and millions of kids.
It's pretty exciting.
Tom:
What's the appetite for learning that you're finding from this generation?
"Especially in the difficult sciences like Math, because we know that we're behind in this country."
Sal:
"You know, the really surprising thing is... is my cousins were fairly motivated students, they were having trouble but I was helping them."
"And when I made the videos, I assumed that they would be.. that the appeal would be for people like my cousins or maybe people like myself.."
"I was a pretty good student when I was in middle school, and all the rest."
But the really big surprise: the letters I get are from students who a lot of us would have traditionally labeled as the disengaged students.
The students who said:
"""I was about to fail out of Algebra..."
"I was about to drop out of High School... until I found this type of a resource""."
"And the big message to me is that it's actually a much larger group of students who really, really want to learn and you just have to give them an outlet, so they're not frustrated, so they don't feel that they're being talked down to."
"And if you give them that, it's not just the 5-10% students that want to learn, it's the 90-95%."
Tom:
"Sal, in proceeding panels, as you know, we talked a lot about poverty, socio-economic depravation, people not having access to the internet."
"So are you talking affectively to those who are privileged or, if not elite class, than certainly in the middle to upper middle class?"
Sal:
"You know, across the board, we've seen..."
"Clearly I think the main barrier here is that there is some type of internet connectivity that someone needs to do, but people are already taking our videos, they are being translated into 11 languages, they're putting them onto DVDs."
I've gotten pictures of people using them in rural Africa and rural India.
"So even now, it can be accessed by people anywhere."
"And as we go forward, the cost of technology is just getting cheaper and cheaper and I think that there is some healthy skepticism around technology in the classroom or technology for learning."
And I think the reason that I solved these is because it was nothing to do with technology.
And we're hoping that between our videos - we then we have a huge software platform - to give exercises and feedback to students - that that will be a catalyst to really use technology.
Tom:
What's the difference between teaching online and teaching in the classroom?
Sal:
The classroom management is a little bit easier.

The Urban Design master studies (prototypically) fulfills and complies with the promise of interdisciplinary
After studying urban planning and architecture it was for me absolutely clear that I would choose to study Urban Design here in Hamburg it was for me absolutely clear that I would choose to study Urban Design here in Hamburg
One of them was... or is... the theoretical background that is applied in our practical work.... that they are really used... also the existent interdisciplinary work that practically occurs with an open source way of thinking that one wouldn't find in any other university.
"What makes this master program for me really very special is ... that we don't only work with students but we also work with the professors, we don't learn something with an top-down approach but we actually are on their same level and we can to a certain point shape the whole master program."
Hello!
My name is Sarah.
I come from Cairo.
I learned German last year because I wanted to study UD in HCU.
Mainly because for me as an architect it was a super chance to work with sociologists and ethnologists together.
And in reality I was never disappointed from such a decision.
My name is Tabea and I worked for the last 5 years as a landscape architect in Switzerland.
"I decided to study Urban Design here in Hamburg since it was important for me to develop my own methods, techniques and tools that could later get incorporated in my professional life."
"What we have been learning here has been also causing a wave of interest to the extent that we have been invited to take part in international workshops, give lectures and to write articles."
Our theme is recycling systems in Hamburg.
We are trying to understand the city as a resource.
As a resource for materials for example.
Materials that today would most probably enter a degradable procedure rather than a revaluation or reassessment procedure.
Our goal is to use those materials to give them value and through that creating new conceptions.
"To be able to work on such a project we were supported by the professors, the economists, the architects, and the sociologists in HCU."
"Even beyond HCU we have asked other experts about topics such as REcycling, waste and UPcycling."
The lamellas are coming straight from a garbage container.
The garbage container is standing right beside my apartment building.
And all the time... when I walk pass it...
"I come by new items thrown by people, and when something interesting appears I would take it with me and in this case it was the lamellas, and this is now the 5th lamp that we've brought together."
"That is, this is going to be cut off point for A. This would be."
"B, and then this for, C, and, then, right here, for, D, and here for E. we can ask how much is, how much is A gonna incur in pollution abatement to clean up these first four units, cuz it's not, it's gonna buy one right, so that's 100 plus."
"200, 600, so that's three, six, $1500."
I hope I have that right.
"Let's try again, 300, yes, 1500."
"B is going to clean up these first two units, which is going to be equal to $800."
"And C is going to include all of these which is $600, $1200, that is $3000, that C is going to incur in clean up costs."
D is going to clean up the first three which is $3000 again.
"And E is when clean up only one unit or incur cost equal to $1,000.00."
Each of these firms is going to incur from setting standards and selling rights.
And A incurred $700 as we indicated earlier. with setting a standard.
"If we add this total up we're going to come up with $13,500 in total costs."
Now if we sell rights.
"These five figures here are going to total 9,300."
"It is actually cheaper to, to, to achieve the, pollution goal through the auctioning of rights and by setting standards."
"And the reason is that the people who buy the rights are, are going to be the high-cost polluters."
The people who are gonna be forced out of buying those rights are going to be the low-cost producers of pollution abatement.
"As a result, what we're going to do is achieve environmental. quality improvement by a la-, by encouraging the low-cost pollution abaters to do the pollution abatement."
"Now, the interesting issue is this, who would favor which."
"The method, the standard or the selling of rights."
"Well firm A incurs a cost of $700 here, $1.500 in selling rights issue."
You can imagine that even without considering the cost of the one ticket that firm A buys that firm
A. Will vote for the standard.
"And it's total cost over here is going to be $3,000, because 1,500 in abatement costs plus 1,500 for the standard."
"Firm B, well, it looks like the standard is, is going to be more costly than the pollution right."
"But notice that Firm B has to buy three pollution rights, that's 4,500 or 5,300, so B is going to favor the setting of the standards."
"C Well, right off the bat, this is going to be cheaper for Firm C. D has equal costs inclusion and in both cases, but C/D is going to have to buy two pollution rights which makesthis total over here $6000."
So we get D voting for the setting of the standards and firm E
"looks like it's a clear winner for the selling of freights, but notice that firm"
"E is gonna have to pay 1500 for each of four pollution rights, which means it's total cost of the year is gonna be 7000 dollars, which means that firm D. Is going to, is going to be a winner and in fact it will get the unanimous vote."
"What's really very interesting is that the selling of, of pollution rights is actually less costly in terms of resource use."
But the politics of pollution abatement favor the setting of the standard.
"So somebody, you know, Jones et al, Smith et al does the original study, They come up with a number of figure or statistic."
Jones et al cites Smith et al.
"Okay, now Beery et al goes to give the statistic in their paper."
"Well, they found that statistic in Jones et al,"
"They read it there, so they don't bother to go back to Smith et al and get the original reference, they just reference Jones et al."
"Okay, well then what happens, well."
"James et al now wants to say Beery et, you know, it reads the statistic and Beery et al, Now, they say Beery et al."
"So, now this citation, this statistic has gone through multiple, it's been propagated across the literature."
"And it reminds me of the game telephone, that children play."
"So, if you're not familiar with that game, that's the game where the children sit in a circle."
And the first person who comes up with a sentence.
And they whisper that sentence in the ear of the next child.
"And then, that child whispers into the ear of the next child, and so on and so forth until you go around the circle."
You get to the last child.
"And that child said, says out loud what they heard."
And it's always something that's very garbled and funny that has little resemblance to what started the statement that started the whole game.
And this is just what happens in the scientific literature when you propagate citations.
"You get, you lose important pieces of information from the original source down, down the chain."
"And so be, pay attention to that."
I'm going to talk a little bit more about that give you an example in a minute.
"And then, sometimes others just miss number references."
A way to avoid this is if you have available to you a reference management program like EndNote.
It's highly recommended that you use that cuz that can avoid these kind of mistakes.
But I'll give you an example of a paper I was working on a few years ago.
There were multiple authors in the paper.
We were not using a reference manager since there were multiple authors across different institutions looking at the paper.
"There was, and the writing had some problems in it, so a number of authors rewrote the paper, did some heavy editing on the paper."
"And in that process, a few of the references, the reference numbers got garbled."
"So, reference what we were calling reference three on draft one, you know, became reference five on draft two and nobody made the correct change."
"So, when that paper went out for a review with misnumbered references, because all sorts of confusion among the, one of, in particular, one of the reviewers, in terms of they were confused."
"And I initially thought that the reviewer just didn't know the literature, but actually when I looked carefully, I finally realized that the reason that the reviewer's confused because our number references are misnumbered."
"And so luckily we've caught it but it can happen pretty easily, especially if you're not using an automatic reference management program."
"Now, there is no formula about where to put any of these sliders, but in general, you want the radius slider to be less than 2.0."
"In this case, I'm going to drag it over to the"
"left until I see a lot of that glow disappear, and I'm gonna take it down pretty far, maybe 2.6."
And then I'm gonna go back up to the Amount Slider.
And I'll move that back over to the left until I just like the amount of sharpening.
And as
"I said, there is no perfect number and it's different on every image."
This is really a subjective decision.
"But you do wanna be careful not to over sharpen at this capture stage because as I said, later you will be sharpening again when you output a copy of this photo."
In this case I'm gonna bring that all the way down to around 50.
"There are two more sliders here, the Detail slider and the Mask slider."
The Detail slider determines which edges are being sharpened.
If I drag the
"Detail slider to the right, more edges get sharpened."
"And if I drag it to the left, fewer edges get sharpened, Now that's a little bit difficult to see, so, I wanna show you a kind of a map of which edges are being sharpened here as I drag the"
"Detail slider and I can do that by holding down the Option key on the Mac or the Alt key on a PC, and dragging that detail slider over to the right, and now you can see what's being sharpened."
"If I go in the other direction, you can see that fewer details are being sharpened."
So I'm gonna release the option or Alt key to go back and view the image and I'm just going to drag the detail slider to taste until the sharpening looks right to me.
"Now by dragging the Detail slider over to the right I've manage to sharpen lots of fine details including some that I really don't want to sharpen, here in the background in the hills and a little bit in the sky as well."
And in that case I can use the Masking slider to protect areas that really aren't edges from sharpening.
"Again, I'm going to hold down the Option key or the Alt key in the PC as I drag the Masking slider to the right."
And this is showing which parts of the image are being sharpened- the white parts.
And as I drag the Masking slider over to the right.
The parts that are turning black are being protected from sharpening.
"So, I'm protecting the sky and some of those hills in the background as well."
I'll release the Option or Alt key so I can see my image again.
And then I can tweak that masking slider while I'm
"looking at the image, maybe I'll drag it back a little bit."
"As I said, there really are no formulas."
"But in general, if I'm working on a scenic image like this, an image with a lot of fine detail, I will increase the Detail slider quite a bit and"
I may not have any masking.
"If I do, it will be fairly low."
And those are the pieces of wood.
Those are the instructions.
"These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up."
"What you can see is there's about six different colors, and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut."
"All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck, and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people, only one of whom had ever seen the plans before."
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
"And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard, and there it is fully built."
"There are only 16 different pieces of wood, only 16 different assembly parts here."
Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.
"It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool."
"It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks."
"It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas, where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long."
"Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations, this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street, that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side."
"They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks, building it, including all of the parts, manufactured."
And they were able to do it.
"That was their design, using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts, a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck."
They were able to create that.
They were able to create something wonderful.
"They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York, using the same technology."
Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.
"It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting, so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face."
Here it is going across.
"And there, down the other side, and you get the same kind of grandeur."
"Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may."
"Woo, pretty, huh."
This is the other side of the coin.
"This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City, whose work you can see out here today."
"The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work in a very different fashion."
"It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you into something that you can do, into something that will please you, something that will lift your spirits, something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his Nobu restaurant in New York, which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition."
"""When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed,"" said the owner."
"Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.
"In this universe of shades it's easy to misinterpret things, easy to distort things and use them in your own benefit."
"And I think it's hard, and a stage is opening up where everything is going to be like that."
"Where there are going to be so many shades in the network that anyone can interpret reality according to their will, because everything will be true, but if that is allowed to happen, truth will be betrayed."
"A stage is opening up in the net where nothing is as it used to be, and political affiliation is not what it used to be, there's no sense in using the same glasses to look."
ST:
"I'd like you to tell me how you organised the coverage, both during the 15M and after 15O (october)."
"From a logistic point of view too, how many people, why, how... because there is one thing that's true, you've produced so much."
"You have so much text many photos, many videos, many everything... tell me how you did it and how you organised it."
JL:
Periodismo Humano is not a live media outlet.
We don't do this often.
"Being constantly in the street sending tweets and social network updates is an exception, when we see that we can offer something that no-one else is offering."
Because there's no sense in doing what the other media corporations are doing.
"Periodismo Humano's specialty is features written with care and dedication, with text, interviews, chronicles."
We don't do live updates.
Actually during the 15M we didn't give live updates.
What we did was a dual velocity journalism.
"On the one hand we were in the street talking about everything that we saw, using Twitter as a public notebook."
When you spend 12 hours in the Puerta del Sol talking about what you're seeing and afterwards you have to write something up at 4 in the morning when you got home.
Because there comes a moment when you have to write at 4 in the morning and... what material can you use?
What inputs do you use to write your feature?
"Well, everything you've tweeted."
"You go over your tweets, you see the sensations you've felt during the day and you decide how to write your chronicle."
And using videos that have been uploaded all day.
"The coverage is done with mobile phones, smartphones, video you can upload via 3G."
They're uploaded straight to our photograph accounts and they're tweeted automatically.
Keeping a video for the day after makes no sense.
You can move it twice.
"First immediately, and afterwards at night in your narrative, inside an article where you're talking about something else."
Lots of people have offered their work to Periodismo Humano from the 15M.
"Many are from Vietnam, the US, the UK, Brussels, from all over Spain."
"We talked about what's happening in Barcelona, but also in Madrid, in Seville, under the aqueduct of Segovia, where there was also a concentration at the beginning."
Let me draw it a little bit neater.
So it must also be on this perpendicular bisector
"And finally, it also is equidistant from A and C. because those are both R away they both sit on the circle"
So it must be on the perpendicular bisector of AC as well
So AC is right over here.
And this is what the interesting thing is
"We're seeing that the three perpendicular bisectors of the three sides of this triangle they do definitely intersect, but they're intersecting at a point outside of that triangle"
And that point is the center of this circle.
"So once again, that last idea is"
"O is equidistant from A and C, so it must sit on the perpendicular bisector of A and C"
Which would look something like this
"So once again, we see that three perpendicular bisectors are intersecting at a unique point and O really is the circumcenter so, if you take any circle and you put any triangle whose vertices all sit on that circle, the center of that circle is its circumcenter"
So we just drew a situation where this is a circumcenter that sits outside of the triangle proper.
So point O is also going to be the circumcenter of this triangle.
And point O is also going to be the circumcenter of this triangle right over here.
It's going to sit on all three perpendicular bisectors and we know that because it's equidistant from all three points of any of these triangles where the vertices sit on the circle itself.
This is the Hubblecast.

"Travelling through time and space with our host, Dr. J"
EPlSODE 23:
Seeing the invisible a.k.a.
Dr. Joe Liske.
"When you listen to your favourite piece of music, your ears pick up on the very wide range of frequencies, from the deepest rumblings of the bass to the very highest pitched vibrations."
Now imagine your ears were only sensitive to a very limited range of frequencies.
You'd miss out on most of the good stuff!
But that's essentially that situation that astronomers are in.
Our eyes are only sensitive to a very narrow range of light frequencies: visible light.
But we are completely blind to all other forms of electromagnetic radiation.
"However, there are many objects in the Universe that do emit radiation at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."
"For example, in the 1930s it was discovered by accident that there are radio waves coming from the depths of space."
"Some of these waves have the same frequency as your favourite radio station, but they are much weaker and, of course, there's nothing to listen to."
"In order to ""tune in"" to the radio Universe, you need some sort of receiver: a radio telescope."
"But, in unison, we are celebrating the life of my Dad."
"My first friend, the best man at my wedding, and an individual that set the bar when describing a true ""family man."""
"Being a simple person, it didn't take much to please our Dad"
"After he served 8 years in the U.S. Navy,"
"Dad often wore a hat in public, with an image and the name of battleship on which he served."
"Should someone recognize him as a veteran and thank him for serving,"
Dad would beam with pride.
"The word ""handy"" and our dad, were never used in the same sentence."
"His most exhaustive chore, just might've been re-setting his dozens of clocks, in the spring and fall."
"Yet, incredibly until about the last year of his life, he maintained his tropical fish tanks with meticulous care."
Dad loved to make people laugh.
"Through his timeless and - often repeated - stories, to his quick-witted comments, to his juvenile behavior, intended solely to draw belly laughs from his grandchildren and great-grandchildren that he adored."
Many of you here today experienced those fun-loving times with us while in our Dad's presence.
"And at this point I would be remiss to not formally thank so many people as we close this chapter of our lives that included Dad in our physical presence but, with your help we will continue to re-live so many wonderful memories until the day we are called, and that the faith we hold that our Dad nurtured, we will see him and the other loved ones we lost once again."
"We thank you - his sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters-in-law."
"Nieces, nephews, cousins, former co-workers, family friends, neighbors for all of your comforting words and support."
"Your visits, the food you have prepared for our family."
"We're grateful to have you in our lives, and have you be a part of our Dad's."
"I'd also like to thank Father Steve, for leading our service."
"Outside of perhaps a certain individual who resides at the Vatican,"
I know my dad would prefer no one else presiding here today.
To my sisters...
"Chris, Theresa, Karen and Donna."
Each of you and your own unique ways brought so much happiness into dad's life.
Chris your selfless love and cheery disposition engulfed Dad.
You always made the time for what ever was needed without complaint.
I'm convinced that no one in this world has a bigger heart than you.
"Theresa,"
"My sister with a tough exterior, originating, perhaps, from her delivery by dad in a bar."
"But someone who displays a soft spot at the moments of her choice that is welcome by those, like my parents, on the receiving end."
"On many occasions, even during your own life's challenges"
"Mom and Dad would share stories with me of your visit or phone call and rave how your carefree attitude and laughed would bring cheer to them when, at certain moments, the roles should have been reversed."
"Apple versus PC, or even if you go back to 1999 with The Matrix, you remember that there was a pure white background."
You see it on TV all the time these days.
"It's an effect that makes things look professional, so if you have a spokesperson, kind of like the way this is right now, if you have a spokesperson, or talking, having a pure, white background really enhances the professionalism of the specific shot that you're doing."
"The one thing is, most websites, not all, but many, are white in background, so if you put a video with an infinite white background on top of the web page with a white background, it kind of"
"looks like the person is floating on the web page, so it's a really great way to look very professional."
"So, today I am going to show you kind of my secrets behind the scenes if you will."
"Some truth in advertising, I am doing this not in a studio, but in my apartment. so I am going to give you a little tour, how to set up, and hopefully I am not going to miss out on anything in terms of details."
"I'll also have this transcript below this blog post, and, so if you want to read you can read it, and I also list all of the materials that you're going to need all the equipment so that you can figure out exactly what you need to make this effect work."
"So, let's get started."
"Ok, basically a little behind the scenes."
"You can see that this is my apartment, and yeah it's the holidays as I am recording this."
This is actually a white screen.
Now what I did was purchase a white projection screen because I needed to be able to put it up and take it down.
"I didn't want this thing in my, you know, I didn't want to put a sheet there."
"Basically, this is a white screen that you can buy on Amazon for about $70."
I will provide all the details below.
"You could also use a white wall, a white piece of fabric, or even a, you know, kind of a bed sheet type of thing."
You could do that as well.
"I preferred this because there are no wrinkles, fabric you would have to iron, and it gets to be a pain."
"A white wall probably would work if you have the room to do a white wall, so you can see my walls are greenish in color, and they're not white."
"So, I got the screen."
The next thing you want to do is you have here the lights.
"Now, you can see that there are two sets of lights on this side, and then we have two on there."
"Those are the screen lights, and basically what you want to do is these shop lights are available at Home Depot or anywhere else, Amazon, wherever you want to buy it, and their shop lights, 13, I am sorry, 10-inch shop lights, they are available for $13."
The next thing is
"I have in here, sorry to blind you, these look like gigantic"
"CFLs because they are, so on both sides of the screen I have these four gigantic high, very high"
lumen daylight CFL bulbs.
"Basically, I would go with at least a 50 watt, 2300 lumen bulb."
"The one I am using is an 85 watt, 4800"
lumen bulb.
"What you want to do is make sure they are daylight, so you are looking at probably, you want to choose something that's"
NlCHOLAS CARR:
You're saying that having no spaces between words wasn't bad?
PETER NORVlG:
Yeah that uh
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Well let me correct one thing.
It wasn't Maryanne Wolfe who said that.
It was actually me.
PETER NORVlG:
Okay
NlCHOLAS CARR:
So don't blame her if that was ridiculous.
PETER NORVlG:
Excuse us Maryanne.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"But she did say that she worries that the kind of intensive decision making and problem solving that now goes along with reading in a hypertext multimedia environment, could return us more to our decoding method of reading and steal away our ability to make deep interpretations of text."
"But, no, I think actually that's incorrect about having no spaces between words."
"I mean, and this is going to get a little esoteric, but up til a thousand years ago there were no spaces between words and also there was no silent reading."
And the reason there was not silent reading is because it was really hard to figure out where one word ended and one began so you had to read it out loud and it was only after.
"So I think it was a very cognitive stress, cognitively intense process and it was only after you had spaces that you saw the emergence of silent reading and the kind of personal reading and deep reading that went along with it."
"So I thing that shows us that if you return a lot of cognitive juggling to the act of reading and whether it is just your frontal cortex flashing a little to click a link or whether you have ads running down the side of a column or all sorts of other things, you are kind of overloading our short term memory, which has a very small capacity, and you're making it much harder to comprehend the reading, understand it at a deep level and make all the interpretive leaps and jumps, give interpretive reading its richness."
PETER NORVlG:
So you're saying the Chinese and Japanese people can't do deep reading?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
I think they can.
"You're talking there about a completely different alphabet, and it is true actually that studies show that it is more cognitively intense simply because of the huge number of letters, so reading is different in those languages, the act of reading is cognitively different in those readings, with those languages than it is with English."
And there's even differences between like English and Italian because of the way the words either match up with the way you pronounce them or not.
"So all, even small changes in language or the way words are presented does have cognitive implications."
PETER NORVlG:
So I guess that is one of the things that always struck me.
"To write the book, I think you do an excellent job talking about the plasticity of mind to say that this theory that we are born with what we have and that is it, is not proven to be true that we do change all the time, that the technologies we deal with change us that our experiences change us and our mind is always growing and altering."
"But some of the places it seems, like it's just too much kind of scare quotes."
"In 5 years' time, I wish each of these kids will probably have access to a cell phone that would be more powerful than the computer you own."
I would say that you can make the case that the future of the world depends on what they see on that cell phone.
"Will they be looking at trivia, pornography, incitations to violence?"
Although some of them get to look face-to-face at some of the world's greatest teachers speaking to them in the language that they can understand.
They can give them information they need to come out of the poverty to realize their true potential.
They might be in here.
"They might be the next Einstein or the next Gandhi, the person who will save the planet for our grandchildren."
How does that happen?
I can't make that happen.
"But, maybe, just maybe, we can."
"And, certainly today is a really exciting start."
"So, thank you to each of you."
(Applause)
this is representing the earth
Okay !! and this represents ... what do yo think?
"The moooon yes , our first challenge is how far apart are they"
like roughly.
Like roughly? about that much.
Okay.
I guess may be not that far about that far? yeah yeah may be that far.
"about like that? ha ha may be I guess, yes"
May be that may be that
like this far ?
"I feel its like here, somewhere right there?"
alright alright lets lets....
I am just going to stand here
Can I ?
Yeah yeah go ahead how does this far sounds like these are some images I found: on a Google image search for the earth and the moon diagrams that are not to scale are pretty common and I understand why we make them so you can show that detail without showing all that uninteresting space in between but they can have a problematic effect on learning because they give people the wrong idea about the relative proximities of things now if we want to talk about the distance between the Earth and the moon its actually...
its about here think about this.
It takes light one second to go from the earth to the moon takes eight minutes for light to travel to the Sun and four years to go to our nearest star then consider that there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy and as far as we know a hundred billion galaxies in the universe say universe truly is bigger than we can imagine and certainly bigger than we can draw to scale
"We are asking forgiveness from our Lord in these times to forgive our mistakes and to count us from His sincere servants we are not able to carry these days orders because shaytan and our ego are standing in our way so we are asking forgiveness and asking Allah SWT to send us more power to become better servants to Him from the first man until the last one order came to the children of Adam AS believe believe in Allah and believe in akhirat life this was the duty of 124,000 Prophets they came to warn people and to tell them this Kalimat, to call them to Allah"
"He told them not to concentrate on this dunya, but to concentrate on akhirat life when we check from Adam AS until Muhammad ASWS this is what they did in this century people are running not to mention the name of Allah from small groups to organizations to governments running to stop the name of Allah and heedless 21st century people are running after them"
"But unfortunately, half the reason why I wanted to make this video is because part of what he's saying, at least in my experience, a lot of guys don't understand."
"Ponytail makes the argument in one statement that the swimmers are broad-shouldered and flat-chested with little waists, and then in the other argument he's saying that they flatten them into stubs."
"And, see, that doesn't really make sense, Ponytail,"
"'cause on one hand you're saying it's their body type, and then on the other hand you're saying it's their attire."
Are they flattening their boobs or are they just flat-chested?
"You really don't know what that person looks like, is what you're saying."
"Girls are majestic fucking creatures, just like I said, Ponytail, and you have been tricked yet again by the optical illusion, in this case, of a swimsuit."
"I made a video on my blog channel awhile back about how to trick people into thinking you have big boobs, and basically gave a step-by-step tutorial on how to make your boobs go up to your neck and look gigantic, and you can do that the other way so that you can be good at sports, and it's called a sports bra."
"And in fact, when I was in college,"
"I actually had multiple people introduce themselves to me during the day, when I looked like a little kid, and then introduce themselves to me later at a party in a much different way, because they thought I was two different fucking people."
"And aside from the obvious hair/makeup thing going on, without fail, there was almost always a comment along the lines of,"
[DEEP VOlCE]
"""Whoa!"
"Where did those things come from?"""
[NORMAL VOlCE]
It's like guys don't understand how sports bras work.
"It's like boobs are fucking ghosts, and they're only real if they're in front of your face."
Have you ever tried running with two giant cantaloupes attached to your chest?
"No, you'll give yourself a black eye."
It fucking hurts when you're doing things with your boobies bouncing all over the place.
I'm sorry that it's not aesthetically pleasing to you.
"There is a time and a place for watching girls being sexual objects while doing something athletic, and it's called a strip club."
"So if you'd like to go there, you can go ahead and do that."
Sports bras make you look like you have no tits because you can't do shit with your titties bouncing all up in your face.
"We can't expect you to just know all the secrets of our top-secret titty club, but that doesn't mean that they're not there."
"How dare you, Creepy-Facial-Hair Ponytail, call someone broad-shouldered and flat-chested when you probably have no fucking idea what her titties look like."
So I'm gonna show you what a girl typically working out would look like versus what you want me to look like — but it's still fucking me.
"Oh, hey."
"Don't mind me, I'm just a 12-year-old boy-man-girl lady here to ruin femininity in the Olympics for you."
"Beautiful, huh?"
What's that 12-year-old little boy doing here?
Out to win a gold medal.
"Given 12, we would have to resort to trial-and-error to find matching exponents."
How hard is this?
"Well, with small numbers, it's easy; but if we used a prime modulus which is hundreds of digits long, it becomes impractical to solve."
"Even if you had access to all computational power on Earth, it could take thousands of years to run through all possibilities."
So the strength of a one-way function is based on the time needed to reverse it.
"Now, this is our solution:"
"First, Alice and Bob agreed publicly on a prime modulus and a generator, in this case 17 and 3."
"Then, Alice selects a private random number, say 15, and calculates 3 to the power 15 mod 17, and sends this result publicly to Bob."
"Then, Bob selects his private random number, say 13, and calculates 3 to the power 13 mod 17, and sends this result publicly to Alice."
"And now the heart of the trick,"
"Alice takes Bob's public result and raises it to the power of her private number to obtain the shared secret, which in this case is 10."
"Bob takes Alice's public result and raises it to the power of his private number, resulting in the same shared secret."
"Notice they did the same calculation, though it may not look like it at first."
"Consider Alice, the 12 she received from Bob was calculated as 3 to the power 13 mod 17, so her calculation was the same as 3 to the power 13 to the power 15 mod 17."
"Now consider Bob, the 6 he received from Alice was calculated as 3 to the power 15 mod 17, so his calculation was the same as 3 to the power 15 to the power 13."
Notice they did the same calculation with the exponents in the different order.
"When you flipped the exponent, the result doesn't change."
"So they both calculated 3 raised to the power of their private numbers, without one of these private numbers, 15 or 13."
Eve will not be able to find the solution.
And this is how it's done.
"While Eve is stuck grinding away at the discrete logarithm problem and with large enough numbers, we can say it's practically impossible for her to break the encryption in a reasonable amount of time."
This solves the key exchange problem.
It can be used in conjunction with a pseudorandom generator to encrypt messages between people who've never met.
"What we're going to do right now is a recurrence relation, which is a kind of recursive mathematical function, which is a good match for this recursive algorithmic expression for Rec_Russian--"
Rec_Russian recurrence relation.
"Looking at the structure of Rec_Russian, if a is 0, then it's going to execute 1 statement-- basically the test to see whether it's 0 and returns."
"Otherwise, if a is bigger than 0 and even, let's take a look at what Rec_Russian does in that case."
"We come in here with a number that is even and greater than 0 is going to execute the condition of this if statement, which fails so there's 1 of that."
Then 1 more to do this plus it's going to recursively workout the value of this quantity.
Then one more operation to multiply that by 2.
I call a total of 3 plus however long it takes to multiply a over 2 times b.
We don't know what that is.
"If you look at the figures, they're all coming down."
So I don't know where the hell they got that from.
"I was going to go into the Media Freedom Committee's campaign to open the Family Courts, which ended up being absolutely useless, because they can get into the Family Court..."
"You can get into the Family Court as a journalist now, but you can't report any names or any identifying factors, so nobody goes, and the only coverage you get is the documentary, or in-depth, sort of coverage."
"So if they got a little bit more out of the courts,"
"I'm just not sure that it's going to make much difference; however, I don't know, that's just a speculation."
"Okay, I'm running out of time."
"I'm going to put this up on my blog, so if you want to read it all, that's fine, and I'll skip over..."
"The final point, I think, is the way that the media approaches ethical issues generally."
"It tends to be utilitarian, the greatest happiness to the greatest number."
They tend to forget the rider to that is you shouldn't be doing any harm to people.
And I was reminded of how all this works when I went back into the Sunday Star Times newsroom for six months a couple of years ago.
I hadn't written in anger for about 20 years;
I thought it was time to go back.
"And I just realised, after 20 years of teaching ethics in the classroom, how easy it is to resolve ethical issues in the classroom compared to a stress situation, such as the one that Jonathan works in, where you've got one of the most highly competitive markets, as the Sunday's, and all of my high moral ground occupation disappeared almost instantly, and I was urging people to do things that were possibly questionable."
I have seen what happens when you do...
You can get a strange situation with some stories.
"We had a case, when I was in Taranaki, of a very prominent family."
Their son committed suicide in Sydney.
He was a prominent rugby player.
"And because it happened in Australia, of course, they weren't covered by the same rules."
"The NZ Herald got into this in an incredibly insensitive and speculative way, and the family felt very battered and resentful."
"The local newspaper treated it with real sensitivity, didn't back off the story, it was on the front page, reported that death was self-inflicted, and the family was very grateful."
And I used that case when I was in Taranaki.
"We brought in that reporter and the uncle, the spokesman for the family, to talk to us, so our students could see what the impacts of that were."
"So I have to speculate, if we liberalise the regime, as the media want, it's a safe bet that someone is going to push the rules to the limit, in the name of media freedom and utilitarianism, and it'll just be bad luck for any individuals caught up in the gears."
Thank you.
[applause]
SARAH LEE:
"Thank you, Jim."
"I've been looking forward with somewhat anticipation wondering what Jim was going to talk about today, but it's been fantastic."
I've taken a few points from that myself.
"All those error terms have an h, so I'm going to collect all the h's at the end."
"The first error term is g prime of f of x, this term here, times the error of f at h."
"The next ones, plus the error of g, at this complicated quantity,"
"I was going to abbreviate hyphen, times f prime of x times h, I'm collecting all of these h's the end, plus the error term for g, at that complicated quantity, times the error for f at h, and all of that is times h."
Alright.
"Now, this is almost giving me the derivative of the composite function provided that I can control the size of this error term, right?"
"What I need to show now is that the limit as h approches 0 of this error term is really 0, and the error term, right, it's the part before th e times h, and it's g prime of f of x times the error term for f at h plus the error term for g times f prime of x, plus the error term for g times the error term for f at h."
"Now, why do I know that, that limit is equal to 0?"
"Well, I can do it in pieces, right?"
"It's the limit of the sum, so it's the sum of the limits. and I know that this first term is 0 because it's got an error f h term in it, and because f is differentiable, the error term goes to 0."
"I likewise know the same for this, alright?"
"This is, it also got an error f of h term in it."
The most mysterious term is this.
"But if you think a little bit more about it, the error of g at this hyphen thing, which I'm abbreviating this whole thing here, also goes to 0 as h goes to 0."
"And that's another thing to know that the limit as h goes to 0 of this quantity is 0 which is then enough to say that g of f of x plus h equals this quantity, actually implies that this is the derivative."
"So, here's what we've actually shown."
"Suppose that f is differentiable at a point a and g is differentiable at the point f of a, then the composite function, g composed with f, is differentiable at a, with the derivative of g of f at the point a, equal to the derivative of g at f of a times the derivative of f at a."
My name is Ahmad Mahmoud Ahmad
President of the Strike Committee in the Public Transport Authority in Egypt.
"I ask bus workers in London to demand their rights, whatever it might cost."
"In any strike, the negotiators must be an elected committee of strikers."
If you have an appointed committee it won't get the workers their rights.
If it is an appointed committee of salaried officials its job will be to stop the strike.
The goal of an unelected committee of of negotiators is to stop the action.
So I urge bus workers in London to elect a committee to negotiate with the government because an unelected committee will not negotiate in the name of the workers.
The strike must be led by those elected by all the strikers.
"Our negotiators in the Public Transport Authority in Egypt are elected, not appointed."
"If they were appointed they wouldn't get us our rights, and would stop the strike."
"When we are building for a strike, we try to convince our colleagues that our demands are just and fair, and that we should win our rights."
"And if negotiations don't work, we'll call a strike."
"Strikes are a legitimate right of every citizen, even in London."
Every citizen in the world has the right to strike.
The only real rule here is to make sure that all the crossings are distinct.
"Next, make it start weaving- follow the curve around and that each crossing alternate going under and over until you've assigned all the crossings."
"Then put on the finishing touches, and voila!"
"You try it again, adding a little artistic flair to the lines."
"The cool part is that the weaving always works out perfectly, when you're going around alternating over and under and get to a crossing you've already assigned, it will always be the right one."
"This is very interesting, and we'll get back to it later."
But first I'd like to point out 2 things: one is that this works for any number of closed curves on the plane.
So go ahead and link stuff up or make a weaving out of 2 colors of yarn.
The other is that this doodle also works out for snakes on a plane as long as you keep the head and tail on the outside or on the same inside face. because mathematically it's the same as if they linked up or just actually link up the head and tail into an Ouroboros.
"For example, here's 3 Ourobori in a configuration known as the Borromean Rings which has the neat property that no 2 snakes are actually linked with each other."
"Also because I like naming things, this design shall henceforth be known as the ""OuroBorromean Rings""."
"But you are me, after all, so you're finding a lot to think about even with just drawing one line that isn't a snake."
"Such as, ""What kinds of knots are you drawing?"""
"""And can you classify them?"""
"For example, these 3 knots all have 5 crossings but 2 are essentially the same knot and one is different."
Knot theory questions are actually really difficult and interesting but you're going to have to look that one up yourself.
"Oh, and you should also learn how to draw rope because it's an integral part of knot theory."
"So integral, in fact, that if you draw a bunch of integral signs in a row, a sight which is often quite daunting to a mathematician, you can just shade it in, and TA-DA."
"But, being able to draw snakes is also super useful especially as this doodle game is excellent for producing Dark Mark tattoo designs."
"Also, this doodle game can be combined with the stars doodle game."
"For example, if this pentagram gets knighted, it will henceforth be known as ""Serpentagram"""
"Also notice that this snake is a 5 twist Mobius strip so you could also call it a ""Mobiaboros"" but we'll get back to one-sidedness later."
"Or, if you want to draw something super complicated"
"like the 8th square star, combining snakes and stars is a great technique for that too."
Here's a boa that ate 8 8gons.
"The creativity that your mind is forced into during these boring classes, is both a gift and a burden."
But here's a few authentic doodles using these techniques that I did when I was in college.
Just to show you I'm not making all this up.
"These are from a freshmen music history class, because I happen to be able to find this notebook."
But this is a doodle I actually did most often during my 9th grade Italian class.
Language being another subject usually taught by unfathomably stupid methods.
"For example, these snakes are having trouble communicating because one speaks in Parseltongue and the other speaks in Python."
We see that the total salary for Y is 300 in the total salaries for Z is 70.
"And if you check, cross-check this result against the data you'll see that these are indeed the total salaries when we take the managers we specified for projects Y and Z. And finally our last and most fun example."
"The one to find how to fly from point A to point be when all we're concerned about is cost, and we don't care how many times we have to change planes."
"So, here's the little flights table"
"I've set up, and I used A and B so we can literally fly from point"
"A to point B. All of our intermediate destinations are actually real airport codes, and I've put in some airlines, although they're not actually going to be used in our query."
And then I've put in the cost of the flights.
"You might want to draw yourself a little graph so you can see what's going on, and we can fly from"
"A to Chicago for 200, from Chicago to B for another 100, or we can go from A to Phoenix and then Phoenix to Las Vegas. to Las Vegas to oh-oh, I don't remember what this is."
"CMH, Detroit, Cincinnati, somewhere in the midwest."
And from there to point
"B, or we can take a non-stop from A to"
B on good old Jet Blue for 195.
"So clearly we're never going to be going through Chicago for a total of 300 with that Jet Blue flight. but I've set up the data, as you're probably not surprised, so that this"
"long route through Phoenix and Las Vegas and somewhere in the midwest is, in fact, gonna be our cheapest way to go."
"So now let's take a look at the recursive query that's going to find us our root from point A to point B, or at least find us the cheapest way to get from point A to point"
"B. So the first query I'm going to show actually gives us all the different costs of getting from A to B, just so we can see those enumerated for us, and then we'll modify the query to give us the cheapest cost."
So here's the recursive query and we're going to use a recursively defined relation called root.
And root says that we can get from an origin to a destination for a particular total cost.
OK?
"So, we again in our recursion have the base query and the recursive query."
This is exactly what you'd imagine.
"We can certainly get from point X to point Y for a total cost, if we can take a direct flight from point X to point Y for a given cost."
"So that's our base query, we start out with all of the direct flights in our route relation."
And then we start adding routes by doing the JOlN of a route with a additional flight.
"So basically what this join here says, ""If I can get from the origin in a route to the destination and then that destination is the origin of another flight, then"
I can add that flight.
"I can start with my original origin, final destinationand the cost of that is going to be the total that I already had."
Plus the cost of the new flight and that's my new total.
"So again, this is another transitive closer like recursion."
It's very similar to the ancestor recursion.
Very similar to expanding the company hierarchy.
"You must be able to use it in your own life to be better to live, also to get closer to yourself and other people."
Martin:
"And on a scale of 1 to 10, how far are modern philosophy from doing exactly that?"
Ole:
"Um, unfortunately it is very far from it."
"There was the existentialist group which, according to its name tried to do these things."
But the Anglo-Saxon tradition which has been very tied to a science ideal.... have tried to think philosophy little as one thinks of science and that is thinking philosophy out of life.
"I've spent most of my time to philosophise about the event and the body, but most of the event and the event is the center of our lives so I have been forced to make a personal philosophy."
Martin:
And ofcause you have been bullied for doing that?
Ole:
"I was bullied for it, yes and I was bullied for that I have allowed myself to do it and not just have sat and interpret other thinkers, as many prefer to do especially when you are Dane .."
"A Dane may not have his/hers own project then you must be dead like ""Løgstrup"" simply more or less people start to accredited that you have your own project. . Martin: and that is when you have read all the philosophers and know them by heart, but it takes some years.."
Ole:
It takes some years and you will not always learn from it I would say
Martin:
"And you can end up becomming very tired.. but now philosophy be the foundation of all knowledge, so if philosophy is a crisis, then, many things are in crisis, or does it reflect the fact that many things are in crisis?"
Ole:
"I think that it does, in the sense that we, in an absurd way is starting to find out that we have a social nuisance and that we are not some evolutionary war machines"
"We are nice and friendly and is tuned to be close to each other, but in spite of it you become the more and more confused about what man is, the more expertise you get.. and as you become more and more confused about the universe,, now is all rags is the pulled away beneath physics because the particles turns out to be a little bit faster than they are allowed to be ..."
Martin: they should preferably not be faster than light ..
Ole:
"No, and it's been confirmed once again, which isn't a good thing, is it.."
That's what Giordano Bruno (Filippo Bruno) was burned at the stake for saying (Feb.
"17) in 1600, he said there were many universes, and ofcause there are many universes .."
"There are some galaxies that are very busy at the edge of our universe and why are they suddenly very busy out there, well it's probably because there is something that pulls them further out.. it is something you can measure.."
Martin:
"Yes, and one could say that I am one step ahead"
Of course I can not reveal all my knowledge to the earthlings for what we are doing is an education project or a maturation project for Earthlings and that is also why this the transition to the big change is as it is..
"This maturation change man must go through because it will benefit the rest of the universe and that is why, some of us must push a little onwards, because otherwise it just wont work but you're one of those who are pushing onwards what sort of imbalances is it you are pushing?"
What is it you philosophically believe to successfully push today?
Ole:
"There is a study called the PREDlMED study that looked at 722 asymptomatic persons, who were age 55 to 80, who were at high cardiovascular disease risk."
"They were randomized to be in a group that ate either a low-fat diet, or one or two of, or one of two different types of Mediterranean diets."
"At the three month follow-up period, the weight and the BMI were the same in the three groups."
"But there were lower blood sugar levels, lower systolic blood pressure levels, lower total cholesterol to HDL ratios in the individuals that were in the two"
Mediterranean Diet groups than you saw in the people that were in the low fat group.
"Also, inflammation markers were lowered in those were who were following the two"
Mediterranean diets.
"And because there is a role of inflammation in heart disease, that's another reason why researchers think that this diet might be beneficial in protecting against heart disease."
"What about the effect of the Mediterranean diet on, Metabolic Syndrome."
"Metabolic Syndrome is a cluster of factors and it looks at how an individual's waist circumference their HDL level, triglycerides, blood pressure and glucose metabolism interface."
And for individuals that have the
"Metabolic Syndrome, practitioners believe that they're are at higher risk, for developing other sorts of chronic disease."
"In 2011, researchers did a meta-analysis of 50, of 50 different studies, that had over 500,000 people."
And they wanted to study the effect of the Mediterranean diet on metabolic syndrome and its components.
"They found that adhering to the Mediterranean diet, was found to be highly protective against the development of metabolic syndrome."
"So much so, that they were able to show a 31% reduced risk of developing metabolic syndrome for individuals who stuck to the principles of the Mediterranean diet."
"If you're interested in learning more, take a look at some of these resources."
"And, in particular, the Oldways site that explains in pretty good detail."
The history of the
Mediterranean Diet as well as some of the existing research about it's effectiveness in helping to prevent heart disease.
Dornheigm a small village in Thüringia
With a pretty little church
A church where once of Europe's most famous musicians have walked down the aisle
On 17 October 1707 JSB married his first wife in this church
The church is a ... attracting people from all over the world
It's group of supporters comprises 190 members from Germany Switzerland Italy Netherland USA and Japan.
We are very happy to have not only the ...
So it is no wonder that couples still come here to get married
The church could well have decayed too.
In the former GDR
There was a lack of money to preserv it and perhaps a lack of interest on the part of the government
The building decayed.
"The Senate passed a Budget Resolution for the first time in four years, and we were able to get an amendment issued by"
"Jack Reed with the support of Susan Collins, Senator Merkley, and others to increase the budget authority in FY ""14 by $50 million for weatherization."
And there was a lot of Republican support for that.
So the work that Arley and I have done to raise the visibility of the program on the Hill will continue.
"We need to do a briefing in the House of Representatives, and we really, really, need to target Republicans."
We've asked for your help on these letters and when Elyse joins us we're going to need your help on another ask coming up here in just a few days in the Senate.
We'll talk about that when Elyse joins us.
So that right now is where we are with weatherization numbers.
The chess game continues.
What's the next move in the chess game?
Let's go to the next slide.
"Well this year, as opposed to the preceding year, it looks like the committees in both the House and"
Senate are committed to doing regular order.
"Regular order means hearings, markups, and actually reporting legislation."
"Something that we haven't seen a lot of in the last few years, unfortunately."
"So, we've already submitted testimony from Tim Warfield to the House Appropriations Committee on the"
"FY ""14 budget."
"We'll be submitting testimony in the Senate on May 9th, and there's a member request"
letter which Elyse is going to talk about which is due in the Senate on April the 29th.
So we're going to build support.
"We're getting these higher numbers, hopefully, in the appropriations for weatherization in FY ""14."
"Obviously, and I think Arley will get into this later on and will talk about CSBG, the fate of this budget that the president submitted is ultimately wound up in the success of any kind of grand bargaining talks."
The CR (Continual Resolution) will expire in May.
"The debt ceiling has to be raised, depending on who you talk to, it may be June, it may be as late as July, but it's coming, very, very soon."
"And the President is going to try to make an effort to get what's referred to as the Grand Bargain, and as you know in the budget the President submitted, he recommended repealing sequestration, which has had a shock effect on every agency's budget on things like training, and conferences, and travel for both contractors and agency people."
"And there's going to be an issue with the President's recommendation to cancel sequestration and then replace that with $1.8 trillion in cuts over 10 years, cuts which would call much less heavily on domestic programs."
That's something to watch on a negotiation on Grand
Bargain.
"The committees meanwhile will go ahead with what I refer to as regular order, meaning there will be hearings, we will have questions submitted to friendly members to raise at the hearings on weatherization, and our main task here is to continue to raise the profile of the program."
"It has taken considerable hits on Capitol Hill, as everyone knows, because of adverse publicity."
But the ARRA process is now over.
All of the ARRA money has been expended with the exception of some nominal balances in a handful of states.
I don't know why we call it that but we call it that.
"And eh, we go from one CPU that does one thing at a time, maybe jumping between threads, to multiple cores where maybe each thread can be on each core or maybe each core is still jumping between threads."
"Ehm, the other two things that you should really know, and let me go back to them, are Moore's Law, that the number of transistors on a chip double every eighteen months and that's a prediction, it's not a fact, and Amdahl's Law, which is a fact that there's a limit to how fast that we can make a program by parallelizing it."
"Eh, thank you guys."
Let's look at shortest tour but -how about we look at a bit more practical version of the shortest tour problem.
"So let's say first the shortest tour problem, instead of using 1 van which seems a little silly-- you'll realize, ""Hey, let's just use a lot of vans,"" let's say we'll use n vans in order to deliver the mail."
"Now, if all vans start at the same time, well then how does this end up changing the behavior of the problem and the complexity of the problem."
"Well, let's take a look at two different questions."
"First, let's ask how much time until all the mails delivered and all vans return to the base in the n vans scenario and the 1 van scenario."
"Will the n vans take less time, less than or equal to the same amount of time, greater than equal to the same amount of time, or always greater than the time that 1 van will take."
"And similarly, for the sum of all individual times taken by the vans."
"Now, what I mean by that is--if let's say each van takes 8 hours to deliver the mail and then return back to base, then the total amount of time would be 8 hours times n where n is the number of vans."
"And is this total amount of time always going to be less than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, or always greater than the amount of time taken by a single van to do the same thing?"
Please check whichever is most appropriate for both questions.
Odysseus has made his reunion with his son.
"Made a connection with the swine herd, in Eumaeus' hut."
"And now he's ready to, to start, reconnoitering."
Moving his way into the next step which is going to be getting himself into the center of this town.
And eventually into Odysseus' house.
"And from there, make his connection with Penelope."
"Telemachus, it shows at the beginning of seventeen, has learned the stuff that he was supposed to learn during that journey as he went around to see the great aristocratic friends of his father."
"He learns what it is to be a purposeful, now slightly angry man, who's in charge of a house that other people are abusing."
He starts to move around more purposefully.
"He lays down markers to the suitors telling them that, that things that they're doing are not quite right."
"He guarantees statements that some people make in his own house, so he starts to take responsibility for other things."
And we're going to watch this growing up of Telemachus on display in book seventeen.
"He, at the very beginning of the book lies to Eumaeus about Odysseus, doesn't he?"
So he is now in Odysseus's inner circle of
"lies, and he himself becomes a liar just like his father chosen as growing up to take a different role in his group."
"He says to Eumaeus, take this stranger."
"He knows that it's Odysseus, Eumaeus doesn't."
"Eumaeus, take this stranger to Odysseus' house so he can get some food begging there."
"I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture, a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting, safety concerns and whether carpet burns."
These are just not things we talked about very often.
"And yet, now, it's talked about all the time."
"At the point where you can weaponize your buildings, you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way."
"And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way, we're going to think about it like this."
"How many of you saw USA Today, today?"
There it is.
Looks like that.
"There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover."
They've made a selection.
"They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind, the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture."
"Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox, and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument, and now to an even larger instrument, upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic, as you see here."
"He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition, after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of New York was forced to go,"
"""Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up."""
Right.
"Can we do this again from the top, except use some people with a vague hint of talent, instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time, real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities."
Let's bring in some real architects for a change.
"And so we got this, or we had a choice of that."
"Oh, stop clapping."
(Laughter)
It's too late.
That is gone.
"This was a scheme by a team called THlNK, a New York-based team, and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme."
"This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center: a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it."
"Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever."
But that's what we're going to do.
"But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents, and that these two things talk about very specifically."
"And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects, in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything -- that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems, be they social, be they physical, be they chemical -- or something that's more of a romantic solution."
"Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date."
"I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us."
"So, in the American tradition, the difference between the technocratic and the romantic, would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's"
"Cartesian grids spreading across the United States, that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States, as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the -- in Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism."
"And when it dies, it falls to the bottom and then it rots, which means that bacteria break it down."
"And in the process they use up all the oxygen, and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can't swim away."
"So, what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish, as you see on the left in front of you."
"And the only fishery left -- and it is a commercial fishery -- is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right, where there used to be prawns."
"Even in Newfoundland where we used to catch cod, we now have a jellyfish fishery."
And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms.
That picture on the left is just staggering to me.
"I have talked about it a million times, but it's unbelievable."
"In the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the Mississippi Delta, and the lower left of that picture is the Texas-Mexico border."
"You're looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico; you're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish, made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right."
And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore.
That's the same species.
"And as it comes to shore and the wind blows, and little droplets of the water get into the air, the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress."
And that's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida.
"A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night, and I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what's going on."
"And I said,"
"""So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe."
"And the only people who are left there are the people who can't afford to move away from the coast, because the coast, instead of being paradise, is harmful to your health."""
And then this is amazing.
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.
"This is from the coast of Brittany, which is being enveloped in this green, algal slime."
"The reason that it attracted so much attention, besides the fact that it's disgusting, is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die, and a farmer died of it, and you can imagine the scandal that happened."
"And so there's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all, and the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis."
"And then, of course, there's climate change, and we all know about climate change."
I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the Arctic Sea.
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Northwest Passage.
"Well, the Northwest Passage is already there."
"I think it's sort of funny; it's on the Siberian coast, maybe the Russians will charge tolls."
The governments of the world are taking this really seriously.
The military of the Arctic nations is taking it really seriously.
"For all the denial of climate change by government leaders, the ClA and the navies of Norway and the U.S. and Canada, whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view."
"And, of course, Arctic communities are toast."
The Camelot Project provides information on the many legends of
King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table
Scholars from universities throughout the world have contributed to the Camelot Project
Undergraduate students also contribute to the project through research internships
Now lets take the elevator down to the Ground Floor
The Art/Music Library is located on the Ground Floor of
Rush Rhees Library beyond the gallery space
"The Art/Music Llbrary has musical scores and CDs and books and journals on photography, architecture, painting and visual studies."
"There are tables and carrels for individual and group study, as well as comfortable chairs and for-public computers"
Further down the hall you'll see the Multimedia Center
They have a student-founded collection of over 3000 DVDs which you can browse and borrow for 4 days
Now we come to the Information Technology Center with plenty of computers for students
The Upstairs gallery is popular for group study
Next we climb the staircase to the new Gleason Library
"Opened in Fall 2007, the Gleason Library combines group study spaces with chairs for solo reading, a projection room for videos, and lots of natural light"
"Gleason acts as a third space for students, apart from their dormitories and the classroom"
This concludes our tour of the library
We hope you'll return soon
Hi!
"I'm Louis Ortiz on behalf of Expert Village and today we are going to show you how to clean and prepare, for cleaning actually, a leek."
"Leeks are great to use in all kinds of stocks; usually seafood stocks, chicken stock, vegetable stock, they are a great addition."
"At first glance, you notice the similarity to green onions essentially."
The green onions and chives that usually come from this will come from the top of the leaves as well as the base.
"As you know from a green onion, its a much more dense and compacted along the stalk here and a little less on the leaves."
"So with leek, we just kind of want to take off those leaves."
So I'm just going to make a cut with my utility knife here and takes these guys off; move those.
"On the base, I don't want to cut too high up this direction above the roots simply because it will pull it apart."
So I am going to get as close to the base as I can still leaving everything connected.
"That way, remove that."
"What I like to do is cut these in half at this point, straight down the center."
"That way we can rinse the inside as well as the base and as we cut this direction, we get some nice little half circles that come off of the leek here and they are nice and uniformed."
"I'll come back in just a second, rinse these guys and show you what kind of cuts we can get out of these."
The path in those just ended up being the regular derivative of each of the terms.
"And we're going to see, it's going to be the same thing here with the partial derivative."
So let's define the partial derivative of r with respect to s.
"And everything I do with respect to s, you can just swap it with t, and you're going to get the same exact result."
I'm going to define it as being equal to the limit as delta s approaches 0 of r of s plus delta s.
Only finding the limit with respect to a change in s comma t.
"We're holding t, as you can imagine, constant for given t, minus r of s and t."
All of that over delta s.
"Now, if you do a little bit of algebra here, you literally, you know-- r of s plus delta s comma t, that's the same thing as x of s plus delta s t i, plus y of s plus delta s t j, plus z."
All that minus this thing.
"If you do a little bit of algebra with that, and if you don't believe me, try it out."
"This is going to be equal to the limit of delta s approaching 0-- and I'm going to write it small because it'd take up a lot of space-- of x of s plus delta s comma t minus x of s and t, I think you know where I'm going."
"This is all a little bit monotonous to write it all out, but never hurts."
"Times s or divided by delta s times i-- and then I'll do it in different colors, so it's less monotonous-- plus y."
"Where every-- those limited delta s [? approaches ?] 0 applies to every term I'm writing out here. y of s plus delta s comma t minus y of s comma t, all of that over delta s times j."
"And then finally, plus z of s plus delta s comma t minus z of s and t, all of that over delta s times the z unit vector, k."
And this all comes out of this definition.
"If you literally just put s plus delta s in place for s-- you evaluate all this, do a little algebra-- you're going to get the exact same thing."
"And this, hopefully, pops out at you as, gee, we're just taking the partial derivative of each of these functions with respect to s."
"And these functions right here, this x of s and t, this is a non-vector valued function."
"This y, this is also a non-vector valued function. z is also a non-vector valued function."
"When you put them all together, it becomes a vector valued function, because we're multiplying the first one times a vector."
The second one times another vector.
The third one times another vector.
"But independently, these functions are non-vector valued."
So this is just the definition of the regular partial derivatives.
Where we're taking the limit as delta s approaches 0 in each of these cases.
So this is the exact same thing.
This is equal to-- this is the exact same thing as the partial derivative of x with respect to s times i plus the partial derivative y with respect to s times j plus the partial derivative of z with respect to s times k.
"I'm going to do one more thing here and this is pseudo mathy, but it's going to come out-- the whole reason I'm even doing this video, is it's going to give us some good tools in our tool kit for the videos that I'm about to do on surface integrals."
"So I'm going to do one thing here that's a little pseudo mathy, and that's really because differentials are these things that are very hard to define rigorously, but I think it'll give you the intuition of what's going on."
"So this thing right here, I'm going to say this is also equal to-- and you're not going to see this in any math textbook, and hard core mathematicians are going to kind of cringe when they see me do this."
"We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past."""
"And we published a paper in Science, the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane."
"And we predicted what would happen, and we got it all wrong."
"And the reason was because of overfishing, and the fact that a last common grazer, a sea urchin, died."
"And within a few months after that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow."
And that is the same reef; that's the same reef 15 years ago; that's the same reef today.
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime.
"And that's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the Caribbean, and increasingly, tragically, the coral reefs worldwide."
"Now, that's my little, depressing story."
All of us in our 60s and 70s have comparable depressing stories.
"There are tens of thousands of those stories out there, and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being, because it just keeps getting worse."
"And the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe,"
"like a hurricane, it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery, but what's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that."
And so I'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things.
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod.
"It's difficult to imagine that two, or some historians would say three world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod."
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.
"It fed the slaves brought to the Antilles, the song ""Jamaica Farewell"" --"
"""Ackee rice salt fish are nice"" -- is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern Canada."
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:
"35,000 people lost their jobs."
"And that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not-so-tasty species, from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world, and what have you."
"It's a little hard to understand that, because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish."
"You ought to read the label to find out where it came from, but it's still cheap, and everybody thinks it's okay."
"It's hard to communicate this, and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish, because people like to go out and catch fish."
It's one of those things.
"This picture here shows the trophy fish, the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat, go to a place off of Key West in Florida, drink a lot of beer, throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water, come back with the biggest and the best fish, and the champion trophy fish are put on this board, where people take a picture, and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish."
"Well, that's what it's like now, but this is what it was like in the 1950s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock."
The trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.
"And the average size trophy fish weighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper, and if you wanted to go out and kill something, you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish."
And they tasted really good.
"And people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little, tiny fish."
So that established the supremacy of Parliament over the Monarch.
Parliament is rich in history and its continuity has been a great strength but how does that weight of history impact the way Parliament conducts its affairs in the 21st century?
We are a people who grasp the importance of symbolism and history.
"We do not do it simply through weakness, nostalgia or conservatism; we do it because it holds our nation together."
"It is like a web; it holds each and every one of us together, and it holds our country together."
"And it is good that we have some of the traditions and symbolism of past years; for example, the State Opening of Parliament by the Queen in the House of Lords."
"It is not the Queen's address, it is the Government's address, it is the Government's legislative programme that is enunciated there."
In the House of Commons on the green carpet there are two red stripes in front of the frontbench.
The frontbenches are two sword lengths and a foot away.
"In the old days Members would get out their swords, 'en garde!' They would be unhappy about parleying, about talking and they would get a bit rough with each other."
"And so we have this symbolism; the symbolism of the Speaker's procession every day through Central Lobby and most importantly, the carrying of the mace."
The mace is the symbol of the Monarch in Parliament.
These are traditions which we still cling to and I know full well from my experience that these are the traditions that the people of this country like to cling to and certainly enjoy.
"So how does Parliament go about its work, be it reform or proposing and passing new legislation?"
"The Government of the day drawn from the political party with the majority of MPs after an election, or a coalition of parties, seeks to drive the country forward using its own legislative agenda."
The government runs the country.
Parliament acts as a check and a scrutiny body on the people who run the country.
There is a very clear distinction between Parliament and Government; not as clear however as in the United States.
In the United States they have the separation of powers.
It is a fundamental doctrine.
The President cannot be in Congress nor can any Members of his Government.
But nor can any individual Senator or Congressman be Members of an American cabinet.
We do not use that system.
"It is a very different system but we still draw a distinction because although the members of Government are Members of Parliament,"
Parliament is far more than just those MPs who are Ministers.
"At any one time there are a maximum of 70 or 80 Members of Parliament who are in the Government, but there are almost 600 who are not."
"So if Parliament disagrees with the Government then Parliament can, as it has done on many occasions over the years, refuse to go along with what the Government wishes."
"At the end of the day the Government is the servant of Parliament, not the other way around."
"Parliamentarians, with their areas of expertise and interest, are the crucial actors in this process as they scrutinise the work of the Government, representing their party and constituents ."
The MPs in the House of Commons have a dual role both in representing their constituents and acting as legislators.
"MPs have the power to advocate and represent on behalf of those who have little power themselves; their constituents, working and living in their constituency."
"But MPs also have the power to formulate the legislation, to make the laws and to determine the priorities for government, including the spending priorities and what the country does internationally."
You probably wouldn't have expected a photograph of chefs in a story about soil.
"But we now have a new school of chefs that we call the farm-to-table chefs, and they have discovered that the easiest way, the most effective way to get the kind of taste that they want in the food that they want to serve their customers, is by having the food grown in this kind of rich soil."
"They are now rewarding farmers, working with farmers, to manage the soil this way, to produce the food this way, and to serve it in their restaurants."
And then we have a new generation of young people all across this country who want to do this.
"They want to learn how to manage the soil this way; they want to learn how to produce food this way, and to produce the food for those chefs, and for farmers markets and for CSAs so that all of us can acquire it."
"Then there's that next generation behind this generation, and that's the children."
All across this country now we're starting to have [little] gardens; we are starting to have children coming out to places like the Stone Barn Center where I'm connected.
"We have 10,000 children now that come to learn about how to care for soil and how to grow food, and they're going to become the next generation enabling us to do this."
"And then there's something that anyone of you can do and individuals are doing, and that is that you can either buy or even make your own compost bin for your own backyard."
"And all of those food wastes in your kitchen and leaves in your yard can be turned into compost and put into your own garden, put on your own lawn."
And this is one of the most important things that all of us can do and need to do because the most important inheritance that we can leave for our children is biologically healthy soil.
It is our lifeline to the future and every one of us can help make that happen.
Thank you.

(This film has been recognized by the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve)
"All of the occupation of land along the coast, throughout our history,"
"Along its history, the Earth has endured several cooling periods,"
"Along the Brazilian coastline, it is determined by humidity"
"Among world's most biodiverse areas,"
And 19 million trees fall each day.
Atlantic Forest
"Between the Amazon Forest and what is left of the Atlantic Forest, more than half the world's total"
"Brazil has the longest tropical coast, and the longest stretch of sandy beaches in the world."
But a very important side of the story is that the Atlantic Forest
"During these periods, the amount of ice on the poles increases."
"From algae through the nearest coastal vegetation, following the humidity,"
"From its meeting with the ocean, the Atlantic Forest mimics the story of life."
"In Brazil, what is left of the Atlantic Forest takes up 1% of the country,"
"In Scarpa itself, the physiographic and ecological history has been extraordinary."
"In the Atlantic Forest that is quite noticeable, although not so widely known."
It is important to know that a forest has great financial potential for exploration.
"It resulted in the total area, which used to be as large as one million square kilometers,"
"The nutrients are held in the skin primarily so you want to take off a little skin as possible with carrots the skin is nice and thin, with parsnips itís a little bit tougher on the outside so I usually, actually peel them but if you use a peeler it will take off very"
little of the skin.
Ok!
"So peel them and then weíre gonna cut them into sticks, as small as you like."
"The smaller would be more fine, obviously!"
"Thicker sticks will be a little bit, a little bit crunchier and thatís fun too."
Alright!
Vegetables are chopped and I always like to multitask when I steamed so wrap them in just boiling water and putting my steamer over top and boiling some potatoes for something else that Iím doing tonight.
In water and then Iím gonna put my bamboo steamer over top of the pot so whenever your steaming vegetables you need to add just a touch of salt to them to help them cook.
Now you can avoid this if youíre on a sodium free diet but just keep in mind that the vegetables will not cook as quickly so theyíre gonna have to be steaming for a lot longer if youíre not using salt.
And Iíve just used a very tiny amount on this big pile of vegetables and at this point you can mix the carrots and the parsnip together when you steam you donít have to worry to keep them separate.
"My potatoes are really going here so put these into your steamer, calm!"
Calm down!
"If something is boiling by the way and you blow on it, it will bring the bubbles right down, the froth if you will."
Alright!
"So last one parsnip, there you go!"
"Steamer full of vegetables, that is a beautiful sight, right there."
Iím going to put the top on.
Put this over my potatoes and they need about 15 minutes to soften up a little bit.
"So while those are going, what you can do is turn your oven 350F or somewhere there about and weíre gonna toast some mustard seeds."
Now these guys donít take very long to toast and put about a tablespoon into a baking dish so they donít need to go in right away.
"And depending how on long your oven takes to heat, you can leave it off for a little while, mine takes a little while to heat up so itís about 5 minutes and Iíil put the mustard seeds in for a couple of minutes."
And then take it out and get things ready to go so that they can go back into the oven so you donít want to turn the oven too early like while your chopping up your vegetable is too early and then your oven gonna be on until you put those vegetables back in.
"Now while weíre waiting we can also make the glazed and this is gonna be really simple one, like I said itís maple Dijon."
"Get about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard and when youíre buying mustard like anything else look at the ingredients and see whatís in there because you donít want a lot of crap when youíre making this really good food from scratch and then you throw some crappy mustard on top, thatís not really that great."
"So this mustard has organic apple cider vinegar, organic mustard seed, some salt and some spices."
"Pretty good, right?"
And per teaspoon it has 65 milligrams of sodium which isnít a whole lot and what that mean is I donít have to use any salt in this dressing.
Normally I would put just a pinch of salt to bring the flavors together but because thereís salt in the mustard Iím gonna leave that out.
"Now what Iím gonna add next is olive oil, extra virgin means that itís the first press of the olive which means that they donít have to use much heat, they donít have to use chemicals."
Itís an easy press; itís also the most nutritious press because itís the first time the olives are getting press into oil.
So always extra virgin and some maple syrup and for those of you who are wondering yes
"I grew up in this business, and I plan to stay here how do I answer this question?"
"I love wasbordjes, nicely shaped. there I really horny enormously. en een lekker kontj, maar dat is moeilijk uit te leggen,"
"I would have to show you kontje en wasbordjes, daar ga ik voor"
"Oh, Abramovic Method."
The Abramovic Method was - you know it took me about 40 years of my career to actually come to the idea that I right now have to think about my legacy.
I have to think what I'm going to leave behind me.
"You know, when you are 65 years old, you really start thinking about dying and you start thinking about this like a lost period of your life."
"You know, it can be five years, it can be ten, it can be 20, I don't know."
But I still think that his is the moment of legacy.
So Abramovic Method is really ... of all my knowledge in performance and I came to the conclusion that one thing that is really transformative performance is time.
Time is one thing and the second - die with experience.
"And I understand that the public until till now always when you look performance is a kind of voyer they come, they look - their always outside but they're never inside."
"And in this Abramovic Method,"
I actually reverse the whole situation.
So we have a certain amount of public who are experimenting and interaction with these objects behind me and the other normal public is looking the other public performing.
"So, it's a kind of funny kind of idea of observing, observer becomes observed and can change position and an observed can become observer."
And then I had two different levels of observing.
"One is the public can just come and look at the other public performing but we also have telescopes we have 12 telescopes that actually not only that you have like macro total image but you also have micro image so you can see the person in his eyes, you can see the color of his skin."
So you can really go inside his own structure to see a different level what the experience is going to be.
This movie was really there to focus on preparation.
"One year of preparation for this performance to really understand for large public that performance is a serious thing, it is not just the kind of hocus-pocus little entertainment but really takes everything from you - every atom of your being to do this kind of effort."
And a part of this - this is also a little bit of elements from the different parts of my life and my own private life also some flashbacks from performances I have been doing.
"You know, we made 700 hours and we only used 90 minutes so I think we have at least material for another six movies."
But we just hardly had the money to finish this one so we have to wait for that.
"You know, I am not looking for reaction from people thinking I am crazy."
"I wanted people to take me very serious and actually an artist is a person to take very serious otherwise you cannot understand why I had 850,000 visitors - at the moment I am the only living artist to have such numbers."
Why I had 1750 people sitting an enormous amount of time waiting for hours.
"So, it's not crazy."
There is something there.
"And to make even these things more interesting,"
I now work with scientists and I put caps that you actually can study your brain waves in the moment of observing another person and you can visualize two brains what is happening and now we're analyzing data as America and Russia scientists doing it.
"So to really understand that actually that kind of exchange of energy which is invisible and immaterial for our eyes, actually has an enormous amount of information and something is happening on the scientific level, not just artistic so I will pretty much soon prove that I am not crazy at all."
"And so what we see happening in our school system is by the time people get to 8th or 9th grade, they're taking algebra, they're smart kids, they have a great algebra teacher, but they're still flunking algebra because they have that 10 percent gap from 5th grade math, that 15 percent gap from 4th grade math."
So the way we're doing it is we're actually teaching math the way you would teach anything else.
If you learned to ride a bicycle you would stay on that bicycle until you master the bicycle before you try a motorcycle or a unicycle or anything more advanced.
So what we're doing is we're making sure every kid has all of their gaps filled.
So they literally start at one plus one equals two and they don't move on until they have 100 percent mastery.
Dylan:
"Very quickly, Ben, what do you see is the barrier to scaling this?"
Ben:
"I think it's money, getting Khan Academy the resources they need to fill out their programming and then getting school districts to adopt a pretty innovative solution."
"I think teachers are going to want this, it's going to help them do their job and I think given what we're facing, as I said 50 percent of a 600,000 person school district is looking to not graduate from high school, there aren't more jobs for high school dropouts right now."
This must be adopted.
Dylan:
"Listen I wholeheartedly agree and I thank you Ben Goldhirsh as America's thoughtful southern Californian for bringing that to our attention and Salman it's a true pleasure to meet you, congratulations on what you've achieved up to this point and do let us know what we can help you with in the future."
"Check out all of it, of course, on GOOD's website."
The very active capturing a photograph digitally introduces some softness into the photo.
"If you shoot JPEGs, your digital camera probably tries to correct for that but if you shoot raw photos that was come out of your camera uncorrected and without sharpening treatment."
"To compensate for the inherent softness in a digital photo, particularly raw photo, you can specify sharpening settings here in the Detail panel of Lightroom's Develop module."
This is the same Detail panel that
I showed you in the last movie on noise reduction.
"If your Detail panel isn't open, you can open it by clicking the triangle on the right of the Detail header."
Before you start with the sharpening settings you do wanna come down to the noise reduction section and tweak those settings because otherwise you might end up sharpening specs of digital noise.
Now before I show you how to change the sharpening settings keep in mind that its fine in many cases to leave these settings at their defaults.
There are couple of reasons for that.
First of all if you're working with a raw file.
The sharpening controls are on and by default they are applying some sharpening.
And if you're working with a JPEG as I said your camera probably already applied some sharpening and in that case the default for the sharpening controls will be zero for that reason.
"Moreover, this is just the first stage of sharpening."
This is sometimes call capture sharpening and as I said its purpose is just to compensate for the softness that you get by shooting a photo digitally.
"Later, when you're ready to output a copy of the photo for print or for viewing online, you'll do more sharpening."
And that sharpening will be geared specifically toward that particular kind of output that you have in mind.
You might be doing that in Lightroom's Print Module or Lightroom's Export Dialog box both of which are covered later in this course or if you brought your photo into
Photoshop to do your final work there you'll do some export sharpening in

The price per gallon.
The price per gallon is measured in dollars over gallons.
"And this makes perfect sense if we think about what quantities we're using to calculate this slope on this graph. y here, stands for the total price of solution, which is, of course, measured in dollars."
"And x here, stands for the number of gallons of solution that Grant has bought, or is willing to buy."
And that's measured in gallons.
"We know that slope is equal to the change in y over the change in x, which is, just as we found here, dollars over gallons."
"Boing Boing teamed up with Institute for the Future and Sun Microsystems to create the Digital Open, an online tech expo for teens 17 and under around the world."

"I'm Brennon Williams, I'm 15 years old, and I live in Burlingame, California."
BW Science Labs has been in the making for about 2 years.
It started out as just a way for me to document my research and all of my projects and it really just grew from there.
Here I have a very old computer that I just bought from my friend for $5.
"And usually, this would be useless, but the reason why I'm using it is because it will make a brilliant server."
"As a little project, I coded my own server in Python."
"I started programming when I was about 10 or 11, in several languages."
"So, my love has really grown from there."
"I used microcontrollers like the BASlC Stamp, but now I'm more of a PlCAXE programming kind of a guy."
I can't live without a soldering station.
I use it to wire-- to solder joints together in circuity.
"If I'm building a robot or just, you know, making LEDs blink,"
I need my soldering station.
"It's incredible to me that you can take bits of copper and silicone and plastic and put them together to simulate something that's autonomous, that can think for itself, that can interact with its environment."
"So this is kind of how I started out, piecing together things."
And this is one of my latest robots...
There we go.
"One of the biggest problems with today's generation is that, one, we're not science literate, and we need our generation to be inspired more."
"Because if you look at the heroes of the younger generation today, they're mainly rappers and musicians, and people who wouldn't really inspire kids to go out and create."
"If you start out from something basic, and you think, Wow this is a really cool device, or robot, or whatever that I've built, and then you can put the plans out, and someone maybe who's smarter than you or just as curious as you can modify them and make it even cooler and have even more benefits."
"I mean, if we didn't have open-source technology, [sighs]"
"I have no idea-- well, I wouldn't be here,"
"They talk about a planetary police state to carry out the forced sterilization , they also talk about covert systems in the water and food to sterilize the population."
"Now this was written decades ago, before he was White house science czar."
Now suddenly the stuff that's in this book is all over the news there selling it to the public as if its a good thing.
"You see here before you what an average person would buy when they went shopping at the store, not everything here is bad for you but much of it has compounds and artificial chemicals that have been added that are extremely toxic and bad for your health and they have known this the entire time and they have approved them for use."
Lets start with
Aspartame.
You cannot go to the grocery store now and buy any type of even regular sugar gum that hasn't had aspartame added to it.
"In the 1970s Searl tried to get it approved and they couldn't, it took them three separate times, because in there own studies with monkeys large portions of them who where fed it, died and contracted cancer, now we have mainstream news articles and the E.U has done a major study finding lower birth weights, early births and yes miscarriages from women that drink aspartame laden soft drinks like Coke Zero."
"What is Aspartame it is the fecal matter of the E.Coli bacteria they take it genetically engineer it, they can feed it toxic waste and it can defecate aspartame."
It has so many bad health effects its just unspeakable.
Does Aspartame Cause Human Brain Cancer?
FDA Pivotal Safety Study:
Aspartame Caused Brain Seizures
Sweetener Linked to Leukaemias
Safety of Artificial Sweetener Called Into Question
Aspartame Side Effects
"This is being done by design, its also very very addictive."
But lets just go ahead and move away from aspartame and talk about McDonald's and Chicken McNuggets.
"Now I remember a decade ago or so, reading health advisories claiming that a form of plastic that's used in sealing putting basically a type of silicone was in the Chicken McNuggets but also in many other TV dinners and in other foods."
"It is illegal in every other nation in the world to add these chemicals into the food, but its not in the United States."
The big secret is all of this was done by design by the FDA.
Look at all the drugs they've approved and then it comes out later that they knowingly approved them when these drugs are causing heart attacks and cancer.
FLUORlDE
In the Nuremberg trials it came out that the Nazis where adding Sodium Fluoride to the water supply in the labor camps and death camps to make the population more docile and controllable.
There had been hundreds of university studies before Hitler even came to power.
This is a form of forced medication.
They admit that 1 part per million (ppm) of Sodium Fluoride more than doubles the chance of bone cancer in boys and men.
As the public became educated in the last few decades the governments and industries response was not to just put it in water but to start adding it to thousands of products like childrens water thats mixed with there formula or with there cereal.
They started adding as much as 900 parts per million (ppm) in things such as powdered eggs.
It causes reduction in IQ it increases sterility or lack of fertility and its being added to so many of the daily staples that we consume.
We'll get back to food additives in just a moment but first I wanted to look at Genetically Modified Organisms.
Did you know that for many years the American people have been eating cloned beef and pork and now there expanding out into other forms of meat lets look at salmon first.
There's this wonderful linear quality.
"Look at the foreshortening of the shutter that has been opened, the way in which"
"light plays against it, and its framing and its construction seems so clearly rendered."
Then there's these wonderful other little elements.
"The woman's dress, for example, the way it picks up a kind of interior light."
"We see that also with the liquids that are in bottles to the right, on the sill of the window, that seems so warm and so softly lit."
"So much of the art in Germany and England, for example, at this time, of the 19th Century, is so full of literary narrative."
"That is, there's lots of symbolism, there's lots of people, there's a very complex story."
Friedrich is stripping all of that away and giving us the barest invitation to feel those things in ourselves.
"It is a poetic invitation for us to enter into this space, to enter into this woman's mind."
"The image itself is as contemplative as her mood, and we're being offered to enter into her mood, not simply her activity, in a way that is very much interested in the interior, and her interior experience."
"We look at her posture, we look at this room, and we can immediately inhabit her experience in a way that feels very genuine."

"Hello and Welcome to another hardware video by us, Regulators"
"Today, another unboxing, this time the Samsung Galaxy S4"

"On the side we can see again Galaxy S4 and furthermore a nice beautiful packaging, eco friendly looking"
So lets open the box
And there we see the phone its self
Ill put that on the side by now
"Under it we find more accesories brown, eco friendly looking packaged a short manual what you can do with the device, the new gestures new, cool features, swiping with your hands to make something wonderful happen a cardboard clip handbooks (english and german) with comic drawings showing you waht you can use the phone for"
"looks kind of ""happy"" and playful the warranty card and now the important stuff so, here we have a white"
Usb to micro Usb cable
"Interestingly, with the S3 which I got in white, all accessories were black and now with that black device all cables are white kinda fail, samsung the cable is about 3 feet long then we have a pair of headphones nice white flat cable not a ""normal"" round cable with inline microphone and take call button and nice white with chrome on the sides silicone in-ear headphones right and left engraved, looks very nice what else do we have here?... 2 pairs of silicone replacement plugs smaller and bigger ones just like with any pair of silicone in-ear headphone then the battery with said 2600 mAh and a wall plug for charging via usb of course also in white"

One of the great privileges that I have had over the years is to engage with many different countries and cultures with all the richness that it brings.
And one of the questions which I am often asked is how and why does the United Kingdom Parliament operate in the way that it does?
How do we conduct our
Parliamentary affairs and the business of law-making?
"The United Kingdom Parliament is often referred to as the mother of Parliaments, but how do we seek to make our government more accountable for its policies and actions?"
"In a world where the role of Parliaments will increase, I believe that we have an interesting story to tell."
"There are variations of this theme but ultimately it is about a process of transparency and accountability to the people, built on the ideas and endeavours of individual Parliamentarians."
It is these individuals acting as representatives of the people that drive Parliament on and help it to retain relevance.
"Those with decision-making responsibilities and Parliamentarians from wherever they may be around the world, civil society, tomorrow's leaders and the young of today, may find aspects of this production of interest."
The UK Parliament is made up of three main parts:
"The House of Commons, which is the primary chamber composed of elected representatives;"
"The House of Lords, the appointed chamber charged with amending and revising legislation, and the Monarch, who is the Head of State."
The building that houses the United Kingdom's Parliament is officially called the Palace of Westminster and the oldest parts date back to the eleventh century.
"It is from these origins, when the building symbolised the divine right of the Monarch to reign, that Parliament has evolved over many hundreds of years into the institution it is today."
The origins of the UK's Parliamentary system stretch way back across the centuries.
"The development of Parliament and Parliamentary institutions was really characterised by a centuries long battle between the executive, in the shape of the King, and the representatives of the people, initially of course on an incredibly narrow franchise, which was widened in the 19th century and then widened again substantially in the 20th Century."
And that struggle has been the defining theme of the way in which the Parliament of today is what it is.
Parliament in this country is well established but the history has not exactly been smooth.
The King brought Parliament into existence and at times relied on Parliament for support.
"But throughout history there have been periods of conflict where the King asserted the divine right of Kings to rule, and Parliament resisted; and so during the Civil War conflict, this was resolved in favour of Parliament."
And for a period the monarchy was abolished; indeed for a short time the House of Lords was abolished.
With the restoration in 1660 things were put back to what they had been previously.
"But there was still conflict between King and Parliament leading to further, almost revolution in 1688 to 1689, resolved by King James II actually fleeing and being replaced by"
"William of Orange and his wife Mary, who was James' daughter."
"But they took the throne on the condition that they accepted what became the Bill of Rights, which asserted that the King could not legislate on his own."
In other words he could not pass law without the assent of Parliament.
And really the Parliamentary system we have today derives from that period 1688-89.
Having been at the U of R for four years
"I sort of thought I knew what Rochester was all about but then this year being in the community and seeing what's going on, it's a different world than what I would have imagined."
And being open to that new perspective has been a blessing for me.
I think Rochester Youth Year does and probably will continue to keep students in the Rochester area because it exposes you to tend to have a certain connotation of the city in certain neighborhood and certain areas
"With the alternative suspension program I've been able to get out into the community to different schools and have really gotten to know to a certain extent the community at large, and get to know Rochester as a whole."
The reason I'm so invested in Rochester is because there's so many areas that just need improvement.
"I mean, it's the same everywhere."
"But because it's a small large city, you can actually see where that improvement needs to be had."
And there's room for growth.
"So,"
"As far as myself, that is."
"So, if"
I wanted to start from the bottom and start helping
I can actually see my work grow and come to fruition.
"I think that a lot of recent graduates are in the same position that I was in you don't know what you want to do, or you know what you want to do but there are no jobs for what you want to do."
"And this really a great time to figure out who you are, what you want to do, and give back to the community at the same time."
I'm a product of Rochester
The Rochester Youth Year program is a great program.
"It provides a lot of professional and personal involvement opportunities it connects the students involved, or the graduates involved, with different community organizations and helps us get to know what's going on in the community and learn more about the community and ways that we can be involved."
"It's also great for networking, it puts us in touch with a lot of leaders in the community and lots of training opportunities."
"Um, so it's really great at preparing for a future career."
I am definitely think that being a part of this
- the host site that I was at - was really a great opportunity for me.
It's something that I can add to my resume and that I can talk about in interviews
- that really stands out.
"There aren't a lot of schools even in the country that are experience learning schools but that those that are, are really high performing schools that are, look to, as a model."
And being a part of that and being so entrenched in the daily workings of an experience learning school is something really good for me as a teacher.
I would say that the biggest benefit for me was connecting with non profit individuals and networking and really getting to know a lot of great people that are in the community and are making such a huge difference and all very committed and passionate in the same types of goals that I am.
"I'm a big supporter of women's rights and women's issues so giving back to, empowering women from communities that otherwise don't give a voice to most women, was something I was passionate about."
I think that working this year with the nonprofit and with teenagers has really opened my eyes to continuing to work with them.
I'm a very shy person so it was difficult for me to go out and make these connections with people
"I think what helped is that my passion for the cause of Compeer, who they're serving and why, and it helps me - people can see my passion and they were more intrigued and able to listen to me and respond."
I think that the most important thing for any human being to understand who you are and why you are on this planet - what is your purpose?
"For somebody, their entire purpose is to be mother and create children and reproduce."
And another person needs to be architect and another person needs to be baker and make the bread.
Another one - gardener.
Every single human being has his own quality.
The most important is to find your own center in your life and to understand who you are.
And not spend energy doubting - our biggest problem especially with young people is doubt.
There's so much things to consume - you like this and then you don't like that and you try this or try that and you are losing enormous amount of energy which actually losing self and you're losing perspective of who you are.
"The moment you find who you are and you know your purpose, then this is it."
I was very lucky that very early in my age
I understood my purpose to be an artist and then which artist - I have to find out which is my best tool because some people are great painters but I understood that my tool was performance.
That's all I can do.
My body's my tool for work and that is just the tool I am working with.
"But you know, to talk about - I mean to tell people what they can do with their body - it's like I'm not a kind of Dr. Abramovic to tell them now you have to do this or that, the only thing I can do is to tell them that the most important is to look deep inside yourself to find the center, your own center."
"You see Abramovic Method Exhibition which I am doing here, actually is interactive and public have to interact with objects, it's one of the ways of getting in the center with yourself because they're minerals and when you enter to do this, you have take your watch away, you have to take your mobile, your computer, you are dressed in white coat, you put the headphones to completely block the sound and then you sit in one of the chairs behind me for as long - a certain amount of time and that process of sitting, you start really connecting to yourself."
And what you have to do is listen to your intuition but you have to really listen to intuition.
"You see that's a great question because in the 70's, Vito Aconci, a very great America artist said, he used the term, body art, and he said, the body is my place, the body is the place where things happened and that's why I call it body art."
"But then later on, in the late 70's, the completely body art disappeared."
First there was not performance because there was nothing to sell so the galleries wanted to have the goods to sell and performance artists stopped making performances.
And then in the late 80's there was a big problem with AlDS and lots of people died so attention to body become very strong.
So in the late 90's the performance came back but didn't come back in the museums and the galleries but they came in the nightclubs like in
"New York, Berlin and London like these kind of people doing works in the nightclubs."
"And then later on, again the performance came back in the form of the Vito Aconci work and then MTV and so many different directions and then went to theater, you know then film."
"So the performance is like a fan, it's coming and going."
"Performance is time-based art, is living a form art and the most important is immaterial."
And because it's immaterial that's the ultimate thing that really gives the future to perform is because I think the new technology is virtual and performance is the same.
So I think for me the future of art is actually art without objects - it's immaterial a form of art and this music and performance.
"No, Internet definitely has a huge function,"
I just heard a very story -
"There's a guy who is a science fiction writer in America, Kim Stanley Robinson, who wrote the book came out called 2312, and I'm one of the characters in the book named"
"Abramovic, and I said, what am I doing?"
"Oh he said, you are making the performances on the asteroids in Mercury in non-gravitational space."
"I totally disagree with you,"
Nicholas Carr:
Listen to your wife (people laughing)
Man 7:
So I have several kids and I watch them use the internet and both frivolously watching one youtube video after another on Family Guy and also drawing incredibly deep into research for school and then moving to get books on the Civil War they never read and knowing more than I did at their age and doing it faster.
"Now I can't say that all kids can do this, but you know and some kids probably don't go farther than just watching family guy."
So were dealing with a world of some people are drilling deeper and it is detracting for others who live at the
level of distraction.
So my question is really any different than in 1965 when there was no internet?
"Are the same people not looking deeper, not reading books doing the same thing now?"
Nickolas Carr:
"I don't think so that's not to say that the kids with the right motivation and the right smarts and stuff are not going to go deep on the internet and stuff, but I don't think that's the way that kids are being pushed by technology."
"There is a new study that just came out this week or was just distributed this week, the biggest study yet of what happens when you put personal computers into kids homes between the 5th and 8th grade."
And that's been a big focus on a lot of public spending to subsidize the purchase of computers.
"Interestingly enough their weeding and mathematical test scores actually went down rather than up after they got a computer, but it was a small decrease a very modest decrease, but never the less it really caught it really highlights the fact that for most kids its actually bringing a lot more distractions into their lives, it gives then a lot more ways to goof off, and I'm not against kids goofing off."
It also brings distractions into the process of doing homework doing studying.
"So fortunately some kids are able to tune that out, but I think"
looking broadly it might be having a very different affect overall.
Man 7:
I would say that you have brought up a good issue that needs to be constantly discussed
Peter Norvig:
"I want to throw in one anecdote about distraction communication and concentration that's sort of a trade off between them, which is that at google every year we have a questionnaire for all our engineers, what do you like what do you not like about your job, what's bothering you and last year the number one question that people liked the most was the quality of the Colleagues and the interactions they had with them and we thought that was a great result and the question that they liked the least was being interrupted by other people."
"So we figured it out that if I can ask anybody a question, but none of them can ask me a question."
"Perfect situation, but we haven't figured out how to deal with that."
"So I think that there's always this trade off that you want to have this deep concentration, but communication is important to because I can't have all the ideas."
"The one book that I'm reading deeply can't have all the ideas, but communication with"
"lots of people can and Nick talked about this bucolic retreat into the countryside where your siting by the lake reading a book and everything is peaceful and that's great, but if you look where all the big scientific and artistic movements have come out well maybe one for Waldon Pon, but against that it's Paris it's New York it's London it's San"
Francisco.
The cities where all the action is and people past the detraction because they want that communication
"Ok, now I get to ask a question Nick, which is in 60 seconds what is your one idea to change the world?"
(people laughling)
Nickolas Carr:
And also no class on the 22nd.
"So the next time we'll be meeting is on Monday, April 29th and the topic of that week will be tinkering."
And this has come up somewhat in the course about different styles of engagement in the creative process.
"That when we think about engaging people in making and creating, theres still many different styles of making and creating and what are the ways in which certain styles of engagement have advantages in the learning process."
And we'll be talking about the idea of learning through tinkering.
"And we're very fortunate to have joining us two people we've worked with for a long time, Karen Wilkinson and Mike Petrich who are now at the Exploratorium in San Francisco running the Tinkering Studio."
And they'll be joining us talking about their experiences in setting up and running the tinkering studio and other experiences over the years.
And we'll also be joined by Eric Rosenbaum whose a graduate student here whose also developed lots of different tools to engage people of all ages in the process of learning and making through tinkering.
"So we'll be talking about some of his experiences, designing for tinkerability."
Those will be some of the things we'll be talking about in a couple of weeks.
And between now and then we're hoping people in the community be able to get the opportunity to do some of your own hands on activities with tinkering.
We did provide the opportunity for some of you to get access to the Makey-Makey kit which was developed by Eric
Rosenbaum along with Jay Silver here.
"So those of you who have the Makey Makey kit, we encourage you to try out Makey Makey for both tinkering in the physical world and the online world, the digital plus physical tinkering that you can explore with Makey Makey."
"For others, we point to a few other resources on the site."
"We think theres some great examples of tinkering on Arvin Gupta's site, we've pointed to Arvin Gupta's site earlier in the semester."
He's an Indian educator and toymaker and he really engages people in building their own toys to explore and experiment with the world around them.
"So he has lots of great examples, so many you'll get somewhat lost in them all on his website."
"We encourage you to take a look at his website or another place to look, with Mike and Karen at the Exploratorium, their website with the tinkering at the"
"Exploratorium has lots of suggested activities and we can point to a few in particular in the syilabus that you can check out to see some of the things that, ways of exploring, tinkering through some of those activities."
I think we have...
"As you get started in the next few weeks, in addition to doing the tinkering activities, since we have a few weeks until the next session, we encourage you to also think about getting started on a diving deeper project or activity."
"Again for the online course, theres no real requirement for this class."
"But this is something here that the students are taking for credit at MlT, we're encouraging them to work on a"
Diving Deeper project.
"By that we mean, take one of the themes we've been talking about during the semester and one of the themes or activites and go deeper with it."
"Each week, theres been a limited amount of time to explore these ideas and activities."
"So we'd encourage you to think about one of the themes or activities that really engaged you and how you might go deeper with it, explore it more fully, explore the hands on activity more fully."
"Do additional readings around the theme, engage other people in thinking about the theme or introduce the activity to other people and think about how that opens up new ideas."
Or developing some of your own materials for how to help other people think about some of these themes.
So those are all different things to think about and we encourage you in the Google + community to share your thoughts about some of the diving deeper activities.
You might be able to connect with others in the Google + community who want to explore the same ideas in greater depth.
"It's perfectly enough with family, it's perfectly enough with your work colleagues, but I think if you're sitting here, or if you're watching this talk online, there is something left wanting."
"You want to find out something new, you want to meet other people, or get to know them at least,  and what they are thinking about."
"This is the level that gathers people irrespectively of their professional, social background, that gathers them to work together on an idea, or a cause, or a purpose, and, of course, that is the level of NGOs, it's the level of non-profits or charities as they are called in the US."
I can kind of imagine what you're thinking.
"I know that non-profits are not associated with the most effective organizations; they are these hippie-like, esoteric formations with obscure and unrealistic aims."
But it doesn't have to be that way.
"Of course, there are such non-profits, the same way as there are such businesses and government institutions, but in reality, some of the best  non-profits or organizations altogether, some of the best initiatives come exactly from NGOs."
"Just to name a few,"
"- and, of course, it is more specific to kind of an American tradition of civic engagement and philanthropy - but still, the Metropolitan Opera is an NGO, Oxfam is an NGO,"
"UNlCEF is an NGO, Wikipedia is an NGO."
"Here in Latvia, ziedot.lv is an NGO, The Vītols Fund is an NGO,"
"Mission Possible is an NGO, and even TED Talks and TEDxRiga is an NGO."
"So what we see is people coming together to do something that stands outside their direct wellbeing, their family circle, or their money generating ideas."
"It all looks so big and remote when you look at those big logos on the screen, but let me tell you my story about my involvement in NGOs to show that's possible and all of you could be involved"
"- besides your family,  your studies and your work - in the NGO sector."
"I think as long as I remember myself,"
I've been involved in the NGO sector in one way or another.
"Quite typical for a Latvian, you start with a choir, then you go to a student  organization - best times! - and then, hopefully, you end up with an NGO that attracts you or is of your direct interest."
"My interest lies in arts, so five years ago, together with like-minded people,"
"I founded  the Contemporary Art Centre ""kim?"" here in Riga, and those have been the most wonderful five years."
"We've organized more than 90 exhibitions, we've had more than 100 educational activities, talks, and lectures, we've published artist catalogues, and translations, we've represented our artists in Shanghai, Berlin, New York, Malmö, and just recently, actually last week, we came back from Venice Biennale where we had an honor to represent Latvia in what is known as kind  of the olympics of arts."
"Everywhere we would go and whatever we would do, we would meet the most wonderful, the most passionate people."
"So that is my story, but I'm absolutely sure that every single one of you cares about something or is interested in something."
Whatever that is
"- whether that is fighting stupidity, or fighting against corruption, or supporting education, or supporting arts, and culture, museums, libraries, fighting for LGBT rights or any other topic - there is so much you can do, and I think you should really do that because that is what essentially bonds us together."
"It's only in NGOs where you see people, as I told you already, from most diverse professional backgrounds to come together, and it is where surgeons meet filmmakers"
"- it can happen as well in the surgery room, but I wouldn't talk about these cases - so surgeons meet filmmakers, ambassadors meet architects, entrepreneurs meet professors; this is the field, this is where you go through meaningful experiences and find new friends."
"So just to illustrate how it looks visually, this is a visualization of my professional network, and each color describes a certain group of people that I'm in touch with."
"What you see down there in orange and, I think, pinkish, all relates to my studies in SSE Riga."
That island over there relates to my studies in New York.
"The middle part, the blue part, relates to my working in advertising and consulting, but then that green part and all these satellites around relates to my involvement in the NGO sector."
"So see what your social ties look like and see how diverse they are, and that refers to professional background, but the same refers to geography."
"And here the election outcomes party A received 175,000 votes, party B 50,000, party C 25,000, party D 50,000."
"In most democratic parties, you don't find such a distribution that one party takes the vast majority, but say that's the case for our country."
"If I now draw a pie chart, let us assume that we try to graph party A first, then B, C, and D--as indicated over here."
Please check exactly those boxes that define the separator from one party to the next.
"Design For Change, our young innovators' world winner."
Some of you might have noticed we have some rather young people in the audience tonight
Design For Change begins with simple and powerful premise - I Can
More specifically - children can
By empowering students to identify the challenges that most effect their communities
Design For Change encourages them to find the solutions themselves and lead adults and their classmates in this effort
"Design For Change first began in the school of Ahmedabad in India,"
Growing just a few years later to more 32 thousand schools across the country
"Not long after, Design For Change became an international movement empowering 25 million students in 35 countries to improve their communities children are introduced to a four step process feel, imagine, do, and share and rather then ask the question ""Can I?"" they are a part of the power of saying and believing in the phrase ""I Can"" in India, Design For Change students have taught their parents to read, stop child marriages, cleaned up their neighborhoods, and fixed pot holes on the street"
"In Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a group of students concerned about childhood obesity reached over 55 thousand members of their community, as they advocated for bypass there"
"In Bhutan, students of one school decided to reduced their use of throwaway package food after visiting a landfill and seeing the waste piled there expanding the impact of their project the students got 80 other schools to endorse their efforts"
"All around the world, children, including the children who will be on the stage tonight are stepping up and learning that the power to create change lies in them as much as with the adults who educate them and influence their lives this feeling of agency and advocacy will stay with these children their entire life encouraging them to remain engaged as they become adults as an ambassador of the organization once said the task inherent in the Design For Change school challenge defining problems determining solutions, and affecting change, something the Rockefeller Foundation also inspires, too"
Challenges both sides of a child's brain and all parts of their hearts for recognizing the children our untapped resource in developing better and more livable communities and in creating the potential for leadership and citizenship for the youngest among us around the world we celebrate the accomplishments and innovations of the Design For Change school challenge and the work of its founder -- Kiran Bir Sethi
Let's welcome up the school challenge participants who are accepting tonight's innovation award on behalf of their many peers around the world who are inspired on a daily basis on Design For Change
"Kiran, and students-- TuoYe Chang from Taipei, Taiwan"
"Daniel Antonio Domingaz from Guadelahara, Mexico and Katelyn Freedberg and Abigail Frankel from Pearl River, New York please join us (praise, claps, music) (music)"
(claps)
"All children grow up listening to stories, tales of great valor and courage, performed by superheroes and magical powers."
They listen with rapt attention of how these heroes slay dragons and save the world
And just as a child start to believing in this we adults tell them
"""Stop it, superheroes are only in fairy tales."""
"Today, Design For Change has uncovered a new breed of superheroes"
"Heroes who are still slaying dragons, the only difference is that their dragons are bullies, child marriages, and loneliness."
"They are still using magical powers, only not laser vision or fancy masks, but two most powerful words in the English vocabulary:"
I CAN.
"They are still saving the world, and they are our children."
Design For Change would like to give a big hug to the Rockefeller Foundation for honoring these young heroes and telling every adult that
"Yes, superheroes are not in fair tales, they are every child that says ""I CAN!"" instead of ""Can I?""Thank you!"
The Mekong river basin is the land surrounding all the streams and rivers that flow into it
"This covers a vast area, roughly the size of France and Germany combined"
"On its long journey, across 6 countries, the Mekong provides a lifeline, to over 65 million people"
"They share Mekong waters for drinking, farming, fishing, and industry"
"Along the way, the river also generates electricity for Southeast Asia's emerging economies"
The Mekong has sustained life for thousands of years
But growing human demands are slowly building up environmental pressures on the river
"A new study, commissioned by the UN Environment Programme cautions that climate change could add to this in the coming years"
"The climate change would affect, in fact, the effect will come in the amount of rainfall which is received"
So under climate changing conditions we expect
less rainfall to be observed
And that would bring less flows in the river which would affect the water usage in the downstream area
"Dr. Muken Barbel, is a researcher at the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok"
He led a team of experts who studied what makes the Mekong waters vulnerable
"The study probed how climate change can impact the river from the highlands to the delta, affecting the survival and prosperity of millions"
"At the same time, the sea level rise, which is an associated impact of climate change would bring more seawater into the river systems and groundwater systems in the delta in Vietnam"
"Saltwater could go upstream by 60 to 70 kilometers, degrading the land and water in the Mekong delta"
"This would add to pressures already coming from growing human numbers, expanding economies, and disappearing forests"
Farmers would be among the most affected by these changes
"Today, most of the Mekong's waters are used for irrigated agriculture, especially for growing rice"
But the demands from cities and industries are rising
"If you look at the majority of water used, it's in the agricultural sector"
"And also, in the future when economic growth which is taking place in Southeast Asia will put tremendous pressure on the water resources and for that, we will need to be careful from now"
Some farmers realize they will soon have to manage with less water
"Man Pipakman, is a rice farmer,"
"living in Chonburi, in Northeastern Thailand"
"Farmers here use water from the upper Mun river, a tributary of the Mekong"
They get their water from a local reservoir
"But soon, it will also supply water to the nearby city of Korat"
"If they take water to the town, how can we get enough for rice fields?"
There's already not enough water
This can spell trouble for her rice fields
"So the cancelation law in Z says the following, it says that if a b is equal to a c, and a is not zero then..."
What's true? b equals c.
Right.
"And the way, of course, to see that is basically, because Z doesn't have any zero divisors, a b minus a c can be factored, so it's a times b minus c equals zero, and if a is not zero then b minus c is."
Ok?
"But if you use this fact, you'll be able to take these two statements, and turn it into this statement."
Ok?
And I encourage you to try that in the privacy of your own home.
Ok?
"Ok, great."
"So we've constructed... we've constructed Q and we haven't, but I'll say something about this next time, we haven't yet talked about arithmetic on Q, but we'll have to check a few things there as well."
Ok?
"Great, we'll see you next time."

This is going to be a crochet earring
Do you prefer a thread or yarn earring?
Please share your thoughts.
"I am using size three crochet cotton, and a size one steel crochet hook"
"I am going to attach the slip knot to the crochet hook take the loose end, wrap it over the main strand, now you have a loop take the loop, wrap it over the main strand put your hook below the center strand, back up the opposite side this creates the slip knot we will work a chain 5 1....2....3....4....5 join with the beginning chain joining is putting your hook right through the first chain wrap the thread over, pull it through, pull through the loop on your hook that joins your chain in to a ring"
"I will be working twenty double crochet through the ring working a chain one, using that as the step up, that will not count as a stitch working twenty double crochet one two three four five six seven eight nine ten"
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen
seventeen eightteen nineteen twenty we will join with the beginning stitch
"I am putting my hook below the two loops at the top of the stitch wrap the thread over, pull it through that completes round one"
"I had this lovely knot coming up my thread, so I had to cut it off what I am going to do is, wrap the thread over, pull it through, so I will have an extra tail that I need to sew in"
"I will be re-attaching the slip knot, to the second round so if you wanted to change color, this is how you would do it"
"I am putting my hook right below the two loops at the top of the stitch wrap the thread over, pull it through, pull it through the loop on the hook you have secured the thread to the stitch"
I am working a chain one
"I will not count that as a stitch working one double crochet in each of the next four stitches two three four in the fifth stitch, work three double crochet work a chain six - 1...2....3....4....5....6 in the same stitch work three more double crochet work one double crochet in each of the next four stitches - 1....2.....3....4 in the next stitch, work three double crochet chain six - 1....2.....3....4....5....6 in the same stitch, work three more double crochet this is what we have at this point work one double crochet in each of the next four stitches one two three four in the next stitch, work three double crochet - 1...2...3 work a chain six - 1....2....3....4....5....6 work three double crochet in the same space - 1...2...3"
"I am putting my hook right through the top of the stitch or space, they both mean the same thing work one double crochet in each of the next four stitches - 1...2...3..4"
"I am crocheting over the tail, that will save some time later on, when you are sewing in tails we are to the last stitch work three double crochet in the same stitch - 1...2...3 work a chain six - 1...2...3...4...5..6 work three more double crochet in the same stitch - 1....2....3 we will join with the beginning stitch, putting my hook right below the two loops at the top of the stitch wrap the thread over, pull it through, pull it through the loop on my hook that joins the round together wrap the thread over the hook, pull it through cut it off, pull it through, give it a tug this is what we have completed"
I am threading my needle
I will be weaving the tail right through the stitches
I am going to go down here to this row and weave right between the stitches like this
I like to give it a little tug
I like to go over a loop and back in the opposite direction you can do it what ever way you would like to do it what ever way works best for you cut it off give it a little tug the two remaining tails will be sewn in the same way this will show how to attach the crochet piece to the earring
"I have a variety of size jump rings, you will also find them under the name finding"
"I have the earring, this is what I will be using"
"I should have two jewelry tools, I only have one, so this may be a little bit challenging what I want to do is twist the ring sideways"
I don't want to pull it apart just twist it sideways a little bit just enough to slide it through the loop just like this
What it means.
"This eschatological parable follows the Olivet discourse in Luke 21:5-28 (and Matthew 24 and Mark 13). New buds appear on the branches of trees when Winter ends. The buds open into blossoms and green leaves in Spring. Fruit starts to appear as Summer arrives. When the signs of the end of the age start to happen, it means Jesus will return soon."
Counting the cost
Counting the cost is the name of a pair of parables Jesus told. The two parables are written in the New Testament in Luke 14:25-33.
What Jesus said.
"Large crowds were travelling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:"
What it means.
"The disciples of Jesus gave up everything they had for the kingdom of God, even their lives. To follow ""God's salvific aim"" meant to put family and possessions in second place. Christians believe the cost of being a disciple is worth the promised rewards."
Parable of Drawing in the Net
The Parable of Drawing in the Net is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Matthew 13:47–52. It is a parable about the final judgment. It is the seventh and last parable in the chapter which began with the Parable of the Sower.
What Jesus said.
The parable:
What it means.
"It is, like The Tares and the Wheat and The Sheep and the Goats, a parable about the final judgment. Here, the edible fish must be separated from the inedible fish after they caught with a net."
"Four of his disciples were fishermen and Jesus spoke using imagery they understood. Because it is a parable about the end of the age, a modern interpretation can be considered, with the net representing the Internet.

girls were girls and men were men
Mister we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again
People seemed to be content
fifty dollars paid the rent
freaks were in a circus tent
Those were the days
Take a little Sunday spin
go to watch the Dodgers win
Have yourself a dandy day
that cost you under a fin

Summary.
"There is a red fox that is very thirsty in the great forest. He wants to drink, so he steals an old woman's milk. She gets upset and cuts off his tail. To get back his tail, he tries to find some milk from a cow. The cow wants grass for him to give milk. He finds a grass but the grass wants some water. Again, he runs to stream to beg some water but the stream asks him to get a jug. Like this pattern, the red fox goes travel to find milk. Finally he meets kind miller and cries. The good miller gives him the grain and he brings it to a hen to get an egg. The egg is given for a peddler to get a bead. After all paying is done, he can get some milk for the old woman so she carefully sews his tail again."

"Mont-Saint-Michel, Quebec"
"Hemingway's sentences were short, the way he had been taught to write at the Kansas City Star newspaper. He wrote about what he knew and felt. He used few descriptive words. His statements were clear and easily understood."
"He had learned from earlier writers, like Ring Lardner and Sherwood Anderson, but Hemingway brought something new to his writing. He was able to paint in words what he saw and felt. In later books, sometimes he missed. Sometimes he even looked foolish. But when he was right he was almost perfect."
Marriage with Pauline Pfeiffer.
"With the success of his novel, Hemingway became even more popular in Paris. Many people came to see him. One was an American woman, Pauline Pfeiffer. She became Hadley's friend. Then Pauline fell in love with Hemingway."
"Hemingway and Pauline saw each other secretly. One time, they went away together on a short trip. Years later, Hemingway wrote when he returned that ""...I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her. She was smiling and the sun was on her lovely face."""
"But they wouldn't stay married. Hadley knew Hemingway was also in love with Pfeiffer. Hemingway was seeing her in secret, even though he was married with Pauline. Because of this, Ernest Hemingway and Hadley separated. She kept their son. He agreed to give her money he earned from his books. In later years, he said that his marriage to Hadley as the happiest time of his life."
"At twenty-five, Hemingway was living in Paris. He was a famous writer. But the end of his first marriage made him want to leave the place where he had first become famous. Much later he said, ""the city was never to be the same again. When I returned to it, I found it had changed as I had changed. Paris was never the same as when I was poor and very happy."""
"Hemingway and his new wife returned to the United States in 1928. They settled in Key West, an island with a fishing port near the southern coast of Florida."
His well-known books.
"Before leaving Paris, Hemingway sent a collection of his stories to New York to be published. The book of stories, called ""Men Without Women"", was published soon after Hemingway arrived in Key West."
The Killers.
"One of the stories was called ""The Killers."" In it, Hemingway used a discussion between two men to create a feeling of tension and coming violence. This was a new way of telling a story. Here is an example:Nick opened the thingy and went into the room. Ole Andreson was lying on the bed with all his clothes on. He had been a heavyweight prizefighter and he was too long for the bed. He lay with his head on two pillows. He did not look at Nick."
"""What was it?"" He asked."
"""I was up at Henry's,"" Nick said, ""and two fellows came in and tied me up and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you."""
"It sounded silly when he said it. Ole Andreson said nothing, ""they put us out in the kitchen,"" Nick went on. ""They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper."""
"Ole Andreson looked at the wall and did not say anything. ""George thought I ought to come and tell you about it."""
"""There is not anything I can do about it,"" Ole Andreson said."
"Any new book by Hemingway was an important event for readers. But stories like ""The Killers"" shocked many people. Some thought there was too much violence in his stories. Others said he only wrote about gunmen, soldiers, fighters, and drinkers."
This made Hemingway angry. He felt that writers should not be judged by those who could not write a story.
"Hemingway was happy in Key West. In the morning he wrote, in the afternoon he fished, and at night he went to a public house and drank. One old fisherman said: ""Hemingway was a man who talked slowly and very carefully. He asked a lot of questions. And he always wanted to get his information exactly right."""
A Farewell to Arms.
"Soon afterwards, he heard that his father had killed himself. Hemingway was shocked. He said, ""My father taught me so much. He was the only one I really cared about."""
When Hemingway returned to work there was a sadness about his writing that was not there before.
"His new book told about an American soldier who served with the Italian army during World War One. He meets an English nurse, and they fall in love. They flee from the army, but she dies during childbirth. Some of the events are taken from Hemingway's service in Italy. The book is called ""A Farewell to Arms""."
"Part of the book talks about the defeat of the Italian army at a place called Caporetto:""At noon we were stuck in a muddy road about as nearly as we could figure, ten kilometres from Udine. The rain had stopped during the forenoon and three times we had heard planes coming, seen them pass overhead, watched them go far to the left and heard them bombing on the main highroad. . . .""Later we were on a road that led to a river. There was a long line of abandoned trucks and carts on a road leading up to a bridge. No one was in sight. The river was high and the bridge had been blown up in the center; the stone arch was fallen into the river and the brown water was going over it. We went up the bank looking for a place to cross. . . . we did not see any troops; only abandoned trucks and stores. Along the river bank was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy ground. """
Death in the Afternoon.
"""A Farewell to Arms"" was very successful. It earned Hemingway a lot of money. Because of this money, he could travel to other places."
"One place he visited was Spain, a country he loved. He said, ""I want to paint with words all the sights and sounds and smells of Spain. And if I can write any of it down truly, then it will represent all of Spain."""
"He wrote a book called ""Death in the Afternoon"". It describes the Spanish custom of bull fighting. Hemingway believed that bull fighting was an art, just as much as writing was an art. And he believed it was a true test of a man's bravery, something that always concerned him."
The Snows of Kilimanjaro.
"Hemingway also travelled to Africa. He had been asked to write a series of reports about African hunting. He said, ""Hunting in Africa is the kind of hunting I like. No riding in cars, just simple walking and feeling the grass under my feet."""
"The trip to Africa resulted in a book called ""The Green Hills of Africa"" and many smaller stories."

"Cross-strait relations are not international relations, where matters are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This is because both governments claim that each other's territory is part of their country. However, the relations are not purely domestic relations either."
Any interaction by the PRC's government with Taiwan is done by the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS). This is under the Taiwan Affairs Office of the PRC. Any interaction by the ROC's government with Mainland China is done by Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) under the Mainland Affairs Council of the ROC.

The ROC's view is that Mainland China is part of the ROC under the ""'One Country, Two Areas"" () policy. This policy was introduced by Wu Po-hsiung in 2012."
"However, currently both sides temporarily agree that both countries belong to One China. This was agreed under the ""1992 consensus"" () to facilitate cross-strait matters. The PRC regards Taiwan as part of the PRC, while the ROC regards Mainland China as part of the ROC."

"The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps."
"When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence."
There is an old story that Galileo Galilei used the Tower for a physics experiment.
Tower
"A tower is a tall structure. Towers are different from buildings because people do not live in them. Many castles have towers. Today, towers are very tall. Some things they are used for are to send radio signals, for observation, or to hold up bridges."
"On 29 January 2009, Contostavlos was arrested after he someone said he was saying he would kill someone while he had a gun. He said this is not true. The police searched his Camden home looking for a gun. Three days later (Saturday 31 January) he was taken off a British Airways flight from Edinburgh to London by police after it landed, with fellow N-Dubz performer Fazer, after appearing to be acting disorderly. A source said: ""They were swearing at kids on the plane, being foul and threatening passengers. Cabin crew called ahead to the police, who were waiting when the plane landed. They were taken away by armed officers."""
"Dappy has also had many problems in the media with celebrities such as Alexandra Burke, Elly Jackson of La Roux, and Flo Rida."
His 2008 drunkenness has caused problems in January 2010 when he applied for a visa to the United States. He has since been allowed a visa.
"Dappy hit a man in Chelmsford in February 2014, for which in June 2014 he was convicted of common assault and fined."
Sepal
Sepals are one of the four basic parts of a flower. They are found below the petals.
"The sepals are often small and green. Some flowers do not have petals. Then the sepals may be big and colorful. In some flowers, the petals and sepals look the same. They are both called tepals."
All the sepals together are called calyx.
The number of sepals is different for different flowers. Both petals and sepals surround the reproductive parts inside the flower. The term for sepals plus petals is the perianth.
The main job of the sepals is to keep the parts of the flower safe before it opens.They are usually green and leaf-like
Cotyledon
"A cotyledon, or seed leaf, is a leaf that is stored in a seed. When the seed sprouts, the cotyledons are the first leaves that the plant has. Monocot plants have only one cotyledon, and other plants have two. Cotyledons often look very different from the other leaves, so they are not called true leaves."
"Plants use cotyledons to make sugars through photosynthesis. They use the sugars to keep true leaves growing. After a while, the cotyledons often die because the plant does not need them anymore."
Arriva Fox County

Lachesis (genus)
"Lachesis, also known as the ""bushmasters"", is a genus of venomous Pit vipers found in forests of Central and South America. The name ""Lachesis"" is also the name of one of the Three Fates in Greek mythology. There are currently three species found."
Description.
"Adult bushmasters can grow up to the length of 2 meters (6.5 ft) to 2.5 meters (8.25 ft), but there have been some which have grown up to the length of 3 meters (10 ft). The largest one ever found was 3.65 meters (12 ft) long, making the bushmasters the longest venomous snakes in the Western Hemisphere and the longest vipers in the world. They are not the heaviest vipers in the world, but adults usually weigh up to 3 to 5 kg (6.6 to 11 Ib)."
Where they live.
Bushmasters are found in forest areas of Central and South America. They are also found on the island Trinidad
Reproduction.
"Bushmasters are oviparous: they lay eggs. This makes bushmasters different to other pit vipers found in the New World, because other pit vipers are viviparous, they give live birth instead of laying eggs. A female can lay around a dozen eggs at a time. The female stays with her eggs until they have hatched and may attack any predator that comes near the nest."
Venom.
"The bushmasters are one of the largest and dangerous snakes in South America, and can inject a large amount of venom into their enemies. Even young bushmaster's bites are harmful, but bushmasters are nocturnal (they are active at night), so not a lot of people have been bitten by them."

Great Sandy Desert
"The Great Sandy Desert is a desert in the northwest of Australia, mostly in Western Australia. It is the second-largest desert in Australia (after the Great Victoria Desert). It covers about . South of the Great Sandy Desert is the Gibson Desert, and to the east is the Tanami Desert."
There are not many people living in the Great Sandy Desert. Most of them are Aboriginal communities and mining towns. The Aboriginal people of the desert fall into two main groups: the Martu in the west and the Pintupi in the east. They both speak Western Desert languages.
"The area does not get much rain, but even in the driest parts rainfalls rarely drop below . The rate of evaporation (how quickly the water dries up) is very high. Most of the rain comes from thunderstorms. Many drought years end with a monsoon or tropical cyclone. On average for most of the area, there are about 20-30 days where thunderstorms form."
"Most of the plants growing across the Great Sandy Desert are spinifex grasses. Animals living in the desert include dingos, red kangaroo, monitor lizards, bilbies, marsupial mole, thorny devils, bearded dragons and many other species of lizard."
"The first European to cross the desert was Peter Warburton. He made the journey from Alice Springs leaving in April 1873 and arriving at De Grey Station in January 1874. When Warburton arrived, he was starving and blind in one eye. He thanked his survival on his Aboriginal companion Charley."
The Disrobing of Christ (painting)
"The Disrobing of Christ is an oil painting by El Greco. It was completed in the spring of 1579 for the High Altar of the sacristy of the Cathedral of Toledo, where it still hangs.

Floppy disk
"The floppy disk (or a 3 1/2 floppy for today's standard) is a removable magnetic storage medium. Floppy disks are used for moving information between computers, laptops or other devices. Some early digital cameras, electronic music instruments and older computer game consoles use floppy disks. Floppy disks are inserted in to a floppy disk drive or simply floppy drive to allow data to be read or stored."
Floppy disks store much less data than a CD-ROM disk or USB flash drive. A normal 3 inch disk can store 1.44 megabytes of data. This is usually enough for simple text documents.
"A special type of floppy disk was made in the late 1980s. It could store 2.88 MB of data. They did not become popular. Larger size floppy disks became available in the 1990s. The two most popular were the Zip drive and the Jaz drive, both made by Iomega."
"Floppy disk technology has been around since the early 1970s (the 8-inch floppy was the first). Today, floppy disks have been replaced by other storage media, like USB flash drives. Floppy disks and drives are no longer manufactured, but are still widely-available as new old stock."
The floppy drive.
"A floppy drive (often called drives “A” and “B” on a computer running DOS or Windows) can be connected to or installed in a personal computer (PC). It is the part of a computer that reads and writes the disk that can be removed. A disk, often called a ""floppy disk"", is used to store files and carry them from one computer to another by using the floppy drive. The floppy drive reads the disk (or diskette) and the user is then able to open and change the files saved on the disk."
Nat King Cole
"Nathaniel Adams Coles, professionally known as Nat King Cole, (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965) was an American jazz musician, singer and songwriter. He was born in the southern city of Montgomery, Alabama. His father was a Christian minister. Millions of Nat King Cole’s recordings were sold while he was alive. He died of lung cancer in February, 1965, when he was forty-five years old. People around the world still enjoy listening to the music of one of America’s greatest performers of popular and jazz music."
Early years.
"When Cole was four years old, his parents moved the family to North Chicago, Illinois. His younger brother was Freddy Cole. He learned to play the piano when he was very young. His mother was the only piano teacher he ever had. He gave his first public performance when he was four. By the time he was twelve, Cole was playing piano at his father’s church. His father was pastor of the First Baptist church in North Chicago, Illinois for 29 years."
His interest in jazz.
"Cole played piano in New York City and Los Angeles, California when he was a young man. In 1937, he formed a group that played jazz music. Oscar Moore played the guitar and Wesley Prince played the bass. The trio reportedly did not need a drummer because Cole’s piano playing kept the beat so well. They named the group, The King Cole Trio. At the same time, Cole also changed his name into Nat King Cole. The trio soon became very popular. Nat sang some songs, but mostly played the piano."
Well-known popular singer.
"By the middle 1940s, Nat King Cole was beginning to be known as a popular singer as well as a jazz piano player. He was one of the first musicians to record with new Capitol Records."
"The first song he recorded for Capitol was “Straighten Up and Fly Right.” He wrote the song. The words were based on his father’s teachings. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1943. It sold more than 500,000 copies."
"Nat recorded hundreds of songs. Some of the most popular include “Sweet Lorraine,” “Nature Boy,” “Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer,” “When I Fall in Love,” and “Mona Lisa.” In 1950, the American film industry gave him an award for his recording of “Mona Lisa.” That song made him famous as a singer."
"Nat King Cole also acted in movies. The best known one is ""Saint Louis Blues"". He played the part of the jazz composer W.C. Handy. He also appeared in a movie about himself called ""The Nat King Cole Story""."
"In the 1950s, he sang with some of the best known orchestras of the time."
He received many awards during his life. He also received many more after his death. One was a 1990 Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.
His success as a black man.
"By 1956, Nat King Cole was known internationally. He signed an agreement to perform at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada."
Cole often performed in places that only admitted white people. Black leaders did not like this about him. Cole said he tried to take legal action against those places but often failed.
"Cole earned more money and moved to California. He bought a house in an area where white people lived. At that time, many white Americans did not want to live near blacks. White home owners nearby protested the purchase of a house by a black family. Cole and his family refused to leave and lived in the house without problems."
"Cole was the first black man to have his own television program. His program began on NBC Television in 1956. NBC agreed to support ""The Nat King Cole Show"" for a while. It hoped American companies would pay to sell their products on the program. However, major companies were not willing to advertise on a program that had a black performer. They believed that white people in the southern part of the United States would not buy their products. Many Americans watched the show, but NBC stopped production after a year."

She was attracted to his handsome looks and personality. The two fell in love at first sight. She was proposed by Nongpok Ningthou to elope with him. But the already married goddess did not accept the instant proposal very soon. It was because it was not even five days passed after her wedding. She insisted him to spend some time."
Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou secretly met many times. This causes the in-laws of Panthoibi to have suspicion over her. Her mortal husband tried to win her heart many times. But all of these attempts failed. Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou finally eloped. They wore the attires of the .

The two brother suns fled from their positions. They hid for ten long days. So, the world remain in darkness. No men could work. Crops perished. Cattles died. So, the ten godly kings (or ""kingly gods"") approached to many divinities. They requested each to with the Sun God. None succeeded to do so. Finally, the ten gods came to Princess Panthoibi. It was because she knew many mysteries and secrets. So, she showed them magical ceremonies to the Sun God. They did the same to the Sun God. The unwounded Sun God returned. But the wounded one never returned."

Pottery and Human Civilization.
"After the creation of the human beings, Panthoibi made their settlements and habitats. Human started eating and drinking. Panthoibi realised the need of vessels to store food and water. So, she started making pots. In the beginning, she lacked the idea how to make a pot. Later, she looked around. She saw a flower - ""Nura Khudonglei"" (""""). She imitated the shape and the design of the flower. Then, she produced a pot. Since then, human civilization starting making pots for cooking food and drinking water."

Lung cancer kills 1.8 million people each year, more than any other cancer. It is the leading cause of cancer death in men, and the second leading cause of cancer death in women."
"The large majority of people who get lung cancer have smoked for many years. However, there are types of lung cancers that appear in otherwise healthy patients who have never smoked."
"There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer typically responds well to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and non-small cell lung cancer is more commonly treated with surgical removal of the lung tumor."
Non-small cell lung cancer
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) account for about 85% to 90% of lung cancer cases. People who have a deficient low pigment count have a higher chance of contracting lung cancer. There are three types of non-small cell lung cancer:

Wilhelm scream
"The Wilhelm scream is a movie and television sound effect first used in 1951 for the movie ""Distant Drums"". The effect became popular again (its use often becoming an in-joke) after it was used in ""Star Wars"" and many other movies as well as television shows and video games. The scream is often used when someone is shot, falls from a great height, or is thrown from an explosion."
"The sound is named for Private Wilhelm, a character in ""The Charge at Feather River"", a 1953 western in which the character is shot with an arrow. This was believed to be the third movie to use the sound effect. It was the first use of the sound from the Warner Brothers sound library."
History.
"The sound effect comes from a series of sound effects made for the 1951 movie ""Distant Drums"". In a scene from the movie, soldiers are walking through a swamp in the Everglades. One of them is bitten and dragged underwater by an alligator. The scream for that scene was recorded later in one take. The sound was labeled as ""man getting bit by an alligator, and he screams."""
Growing popular.

Burtt is credited with naming the scream after Private Wilhelm (after a soldier in ""The Charge at Feather River"" who was shot by an arrow and screamed). Over the next decade, Burtt began using the effect in other films he worked on. This included most projects with George Lucas or Steven Spielberg. It is used in all of the Indiana Jones movies. Other sound designers picked up on the effect, and use of the sound in movies became a tradition in the community of sound designers."
"Research by Burtt shows that actor and singer Sheb Wooley, best known for his song ""Flying Purple People Eater"" in 1958, is likely to have been the voice actor who first performed the scream. This has been supported by an interview in 2005 with Linda Dotson, Wooley's widow. Burtt discovered records at Warner Brothers from the editor of ""Distant Drums"". These records include a short list of names of actors scheduled to record lines of dialogue for roles in the movie. Wooley played the uncredited role of Private Jessup in ""Distant Drums."" He was one of the few actors used for the recording of more vocal parts for the movie. Wooley performed more sound effects, including the screams for a man being bitten by an alligator. Dotson confirmed that it was Wooley's scream that had been in so many westerns, adding, ""He always used to joke about how he was so great about screaming and dying in films."""
Usage.
"The Wilhelm scream has become a cinematic sound cliché. By 2008 it had been used in many works, including over 216 movies, television shows and video games . Some directors, most notably George Lucas, include it in almost every one of their productions."
"In 2010, a Wilhelm Scream App was released on the Apple iPhone. As of 2011, it is still free to download."
"The second single by British artist James Blake was called ""The Wilhelm Scream"" and was released in 2011."
Gold rush
"A gold rush is when a lot of miners go to a mining place full of gold. Well-known examples are the California Gold Rush of 1848, the Australian gold rush which began in 1851, or the Fraser river gold rush in British Columbia, Canada in 1858."
California Gold Rush
"The California Gold Rush started when James Wilson Marshall was building a water powered sawmill for John Sutter in 1848. When he finished building the sawmill, he went to the river to fetch some water. He saw some shiny little flakes of gold in the river. He immediately went to tell John, and they tried to keep it a secret. But word soon got out, and the gold rush started."
"It was 1849 when the Gold Rush started. People who came to California for gold were called forty-niners because they came in the year 1849. Some of them became rich but most did not. Some people started selling things. Many of them became rich, famous, and politically powerful. Sometimes a woman could earn more than her mining husband."
Men like Levi Strauss also sold things. He invented and sold jeans made from strong denim. The California Gold Rush ended in 1855. Many gold miners went back home because gold was harder to find; others found other work.
Jeans
"Jeans are a type of pants made from heavy, strong cotton material (fabric) called denim. They were invented in the United States by Levi Strauss in 1872. In the late 1800s, jeans were worn by workers. Jeans are one of the most obvious symbols of American cultural influence in the world. They are worn in many countries around the world."
"In the 1950s, jeans became a popular fashion for teenagers and young adults. In the 1950s, jeans were part of rockabilly fashion for teenagers. Now, jeans are a very popular type of pants. They are usually worn as casual fashion clothing. Jeans are made in many styles and colors."
"The word ""jeans"" came from the French name of the city in Italy where a strong cotton fabric was made. The Italian city's name, Genoa, was spelled ""jene"" in Middle English and ""Gênes"" in the French language."
Sovereignty
Sovereignty is the right of a government to have complete control over its area. The idea that this right comes from doing good things for the people under control of the government is as old as Ancient Greece if not older.
"The exact meaning of Sovereignty has changed some in the past. The present meaning of Sovereignty is said to come from the Peace of Westphalia, an agreement between the rulers of Europe in 1648 which said:"
The Past.
Ancient Rome.
"Ancient Rome was first the Roman Republic, but then when Octavian made the Roman Empire the Emperor of Rome said that he was ""Sovereign"". The meaning of this was that he could make any law he wanted, and he did not have to do what the law said himself."
Middle Ages.
"In the time of the Middle Ages many kings and rulers had to do what other leaders said, such as the leader of the Catholic Church, the Pope. Because of this, the idea of ""Sovereignty"" was not much used."
Reformation.
"In the time of the Protestant Reformation, in the 16th century, governments were breaking away from religious leaders. Also many wars were fought between different rulers inside areas that are now sovereign countries. The English Civil War is one example of a war fought in this time between leaders inside one country."
"The Peace of Westphalia was made in 1648 and the idea of ""Sovereignty"" came back. Governments were now separate from outside leaders and only one government or ruler inside a country could make laws. The divine right of kings became more widespread."
The Enlightenment and Social Contract theory.
"The English thinker Thomas Hobbes wrote a book in 1651 that said rulers and governments are ""Sovereign"" because they are good for the safety of the people. The idea that people could change rulers if they were not safe was new with Hobbes."
Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote a book in 1763 that said the choice of the people is the only thing sovereignty comes from.
"Both Rousseau and Hobbes advanced a ""Social Contract"" in which people consent to a government's sovereignty just by living in the country and that people give up at least some of their liberty for security"
"In 1789 the French Revolution made an important country's government ruled by the choices of the people for the first time after the Middle Ages (some cities and small countries were democracies in the Middle Ages). There were many problems and France went back to the old way soon after, but would be ready for Democracy in 1870's. In England, many people got to vote after The Reform Act in 1832. The United States broke away from England in 1776-1783, but was not an important country at that time."

Mitochondrial Eve
"Mitochondrial Eve is a term from genetics and human evolution. It refers to a woman, whose mitochondrial DNA is a parent of all living humans. To put this more exactly, she is the female most recent common ancestor of all humans alive at present."
How this is decided.
"Rather than use full DNA comparisons, two simpler methods are used:"
This gives haplogroups (a haplogroup is a combination of genes on different chromosomal regions that are closely linked and tend to be inherited together).
The results.
"According to current research, Mitochondrial Eve lived about 200.000 years ago. Most likely she lived in East Africa, when ""Homo sapiens sapiens"" (anatomically modern humans) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species."
"Mitochondrial Eve lived later than ""Homo heidelbergensis"" and the emergence of ""Homo neanderthalensis"", but earlier than the out of Africa migration."
"The dating for 'Eve' was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis, and a boost to the hypothesis that modern humans originated relatively recently in Africa and spread from there, replacing more ""archaic"" human populations such as Neanderthals. As a result, the latter hypothesis became dominant."
King Ghidorah
"King Ghidorah is a fictional monster who appears in movies from Japan. He first appeared in ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"". Since then, he has appeared in several ""Godzilla"" movies. He is a golden three-headed dragon with no arms, large wings, and two tails. He is the strongest monster in the ""Godzilla"" movies."
Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)
"The Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331 is a piece of music for the piano. It was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It was published in Vienna, Austria by Artaria in 1784. It is the second of a group of three piano sonatas. Mozart probably wrote the group in Salzburg in the summer of 1783. It was then that he brought his wife Constance (Weber) to his hometown to introduce her to his father Leopold. The first sonata in the group is No. 10 in C major, K. 330. The third is No. 12 in F major, K. 332. Mozart numbered this group of sonatas 1 through 3. He spent much time teaching during his early years in Vienna. It is likely that these sonatas were written for his pupils."
"The A major sonata is unique among Mozart's piano sonatas. It does not include a movement in sonata form. The first movement is a lilting theme in 6/8 followed by six variations in A major and A minor. The last variation is in 4/4 time. The second movement is a Menuetto in A major with a contrasting section (called a Trio) in D major. It is written in 3/4 time. The third and final movement is the famous ""Alla Turca"" (Turkish March or Turkish Rondo) in 2/4 time. It is considered one of the finest examples of Viennese Turkish music that was produced in the late 18th century. The rondo's rolled block bass chords suggest the drum rolls of a Turkish Janissary band. In true classical style, the rondo alternates between major and minor keys, and loud and soft dynamics. The piece is a favorite for amateur recitals."

Libya.
"In the war of 2011 French Rafale and Mirage 2000 bombed the armed forces of Colonel Gaddafi. Some comes from aircraft carrier ""Charles de Gaulle"" but French air forces aircraft were from Solenzara air force base in Corsica. In this kind aerial refuelling were an obligation. Like in Afghanistan French pilots fired laser guided bombs, but also laser guided missiles."

Show and tell
Show and tell is a common expression. It is about showing an audience something and telling them about it.
"This group exercise is used to teach young children the skills of public speaking. For example, children will bring an item from home and will explain to the class why they chose that certain item, where they got it, and other relevant information."
History.
"The modern usage of this term began in the 1940s, but the general concept is older. For example, in one of William Shakespeare's plays, a character uses the same words to link something with words explaining it'"
An IPv6 address can be long and this can lead to mistakes when typing them into the computer or writing them down. There are two ways in which an IPv6 address can be made shorter without leaving anything out:
DNS.
DNS stands for Domain Name System
"It is also called a service server, and is based on client server network architecture. Like a phonebook, it contains a database of public IP addresses."
Other versions.
"Versions before IPv4 were experimental and never widely used. Version 5 was used exclusively for the Internet Stream Protocol, which was also never widely used."
Eurasia
"Eurasia is the combined landmass of Europe and Asia in the northern part of Earth. It has the Atlantic Ocean on its west, and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The Arctic Ocean is to its north, and the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean to its south. It is the largest of the continents. Its name comes from adding the ""Eur"" from ""Europe"" to ""Asia"". It and Africa form a part of the world called ""Afro-Eurasia""."
"Some geographers say Eurasia is one continent, because Europe and Asia are mostly on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them. The Ancient Greeks divided the world they knew into Europe, Asia and Africa. To them, the Aegean Sea was the division between the Balkan Peninsula in Europe and Asia Minor in Asia. North of the Sea of Marmara, the Greeks thought the lands on the western side of the Black Sea was Europe and the eastern side was Asia. The ancient Greeks did not know very much about the lands north of the Black Sea. Since Classical Antiquity, people have talked about Asia and Europe separately, so it is now a tradition to see them as two continents."
"Some other continents, which are not completely divided by sea, are joined together by a thin strip of land (called an isthmus). An example is North America and South America, which are connected by the Isthmus of Panama. Europe and Asia are not divided by a sea, nor by any isthmus."
"Outside of geological definitions, Eurasia also includes the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula."
"Sometimes Eurasia is divided into West Eurasia and East Eurasia. Here, the dividing line is the Ural Mountains. West Eurasia includes Europe and the Middle East. Historians sometimes add North Africa to West Eurasia, because the Sahara Desert divides North Africa from Sub-Saharan Africa, and it is as difficult to cross as a sea. Also, North Africa is culturally linked to Europe by the Mediterranean Sea."
List of countries.
The OECD’s Eurasia activities involve 13 countries extending from the borders of the European Union to the Far East:
North Pole
The North Pole is the point that is farthest north on Earth. It is the point on which axis of Earth turns. It is in the Arctic Ocean and it is cold there because the sun does not shine there for about half a year and never rises very high. The ocean around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of ice.
There is also a Magnetic North Pole. It is near the physical North Pole. A compass points toward the magnetic North Pole.
There is a star called the North Star (or Polaris) that is always in the sky above the North Pole. People can tell how far north they are by seeing how high the North Star appears in the sky.
Plural
"In linguistics, noun phrases have grammatical number. Plural is one kind of grammatical number. In English, plural noun phrases are counted as more or less than one (e.g., ""32 degrees, no bananas"", ""0.5 liters"", ""1.2 grams"", ""two times"", ""three fish"", ""20 mothers""). In contrast, a singular noun phrase usually refers to something that you would count as one only (e.g., ""one time"", ""a glass"", ""the sun"", ""my mother"", ""Jennifer""). Noun phrases that cannot be counted are also singular in English (e.g., ""water"", ""the meat"", ""some space"", etc.)."
"In many languages, a suffix (word ending) is added to a word to show that the word is plural. In English, the normal plural suffix ""i""s ""-s"" (e.g., ""cat"" is singular, and ""cats"" is plural)."
Plurals in English.
There are a number of exceptions:
"It is fair to say that most native English-speakers make mistakes in this area, which is one of the more troublesome aspects of English."
Other languages.
All European languages have plural forms. The suffix that is used in each language is different from the one that is applied to English nouns.
"In other languages, such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese, there is usually no plural ending."
Alexander Gode
"Porter started having musicals on Broadway again in 1926. He wrote some famous songs like ""Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love"", ""What Is This Thing Called Love?"" and ""Night and Day""."
He threw lots of parties and had an exciting social life in the 1920s and 1930s. He became very successful with his musicals and songs.
"In 1937, Porter had an accident when he was horse-riding. He had a lot of pain and had to have many operations. He became depressed after that. He kept working and in 1948 he wrote a very popular musical called ""Kiss Me, Kate"". He won a Tony Award for the musical. He also wrote music for movies."
"In 1952, Porter's mother died. In 1954, his wife died. In 1958, he had to have his injured leg amputated (cut off). After all these bad things happened, he retired. He died of kidney failure in 1964 in Santa Monica, California. He was 73."
Jan van Riebeeck
"Johan Anthoniszoon ""Jan"" van Riebeeck (April 21, 1619 – January 18, 1677) was a Dutch colonial administrator and founder of Cape Town, a city in South Africa."
Biography.
"Van Riebeeck was born in Culemborg in the Netherlands as the son of a surgeon. He grew up in Schiedam, where he married 19-year old Maria de la Quellerie on 28 March 1649. (She died in Malacca, now part of Malaysia, on 2 November 1664, at the age of 35). The couple had eight children, most of whom did not live through infancy. Their son Abraham van Riebeeck, born at the Cape, later became Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies."
"Joining the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1639, he served in many posts, like an assistant surgeon in the Batavia in the East Indies. He then went to Japan. His most important position was that of head of the VOC trading post in Tonkin, Vietnam. However, he was called back from this post as it was found that he was working trade for his own account."
"In 1651 he was asked to undertake the command of the initial Dutch settlement in the future South Africa. He landed three ships ""Drommedaris"", ""Reijger"" and ""Goede Hoop"" at the future Cape Town on 6 April 1652 and strongly make the site as a way-station for the VOC trade route between the Netherlands and the East Indies. The ""Walvisch"" and the ""Oliphant"" came later, having had 130 burials at sea."
Measles
"Measles is an infectious disease, caused by a virus. People catch measles from other people. It is passed on in tiny drops of water when people breathe. People with measles have a sore throat, a fever, a cough, red eyes and a runny nose. They also have a bumpy red rash all over their body. These rashes will cause a high irritation of itching."
"Measles is very infectious, which means it is easy to catch. If someone in a house has measles, it is very likely that other people in the house will also get it. In developed countries, lots of children have a vaccination (injection) to stop them from getting measles. Often they are given the MMR vaccine, to stop them getting measles, mumps and rubella. The three vaccinations are all in one injection."
"Measles is sometimes also called ""rubeola"", but it is not the same as rubella (German measles). The German Measles (rubella) was discovered by German scientists."
"There is no specific cure for measles. People with measles may rest and take medicines to make them feel better, to stop pain and make fevers go away. Most people that have measles recover, but some people die from it. In the 19th century measles epidemics killed many Polynesian people."
Emperor Seinei
"was the 22nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Seinei to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Seinei""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
"According to ""Kojiki"" and ""Nihonshoki"", Seinei was a son of Emperor Yūryaku."
Seinei fathered no children. He adopted two grandsons of Emperor Richū. Each would attain the throne; and they would become known as Emperor Ninken and as Emperor Kenzo
Events of Seinei's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Seinei's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"After the death of his father, Seinei overcame others in the struggle for power."
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Seinei.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."

"Potamogeton is a genus of aquatic plants. They live in freshwater such as ponds and lakes. They part of the family Potamogentonaceae. Their common name is pondweed. The genus name means ""river neighbor"". They are also a food source for many fish and algae eaters."
Filter feeder
"Filter feeders are animals that feed on matter and food particles from water. Some animals that do this are clams, krill, sponges, baleen whales and many fish such as sharks. Some birds such as flamingos are also filter feeders. Filter feeders can help clear water."
Surinam horned toad
Ceratophrys is a genus of frogs. They are part of the family Leptodactylidae. They are also part of the subfamily Ceratophryinae. They are also known as South American horned frogs as well as Pacman frogs. This is because they look like the video game character Pac-Man.
Woomera Test Range
"The RAAF Woomera Test Range is a weapons testing facility in South Australia. It is run by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). It covers and area of , and is the world's largest weapons test facility on land. The range is a restricted area, called the Woomera Prohibited Area. The airspace above it is also restricted, and is called the Woomera Restricted Airspace."
"The range was originally set up as a place for the British to test missiles during World War II. The British asked to do weapons testing here (in the centre of Australia), because not many people lived there. A Commonwealth weapons design and test project, called the Australian-Anglo Joint Project, was signed in 1946. The range originally had an area of ."
"Between 1955 and 1963, the British ran a series of seven nuclear-weapon tests at Maralinga, then inside the range. The Joint Project ran until 1980, when the British withdrew from the program. The range is still used as a testing site by the Australian Defence Force. Access is leased to foreign militaries and private companies for their own testing of weapons."
It is named after the Dharuk word for a spear-thrower.
"Balgo, Western Australia"
"Balgo is a small community in Western Australia. It is surrounded by the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert. It is an Aboriginal community; the area is traditionally Kukatja country. There are also some Pintupi families living there, who were displaced in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of them came to live here from Papunya, including some of the original artists of the Papunya Tula movement. Many of them later left Balgo when Kintore and Kiwirrkurra were set up in the 1980s. In 2006, Balgo had about 460 people living there."
"Komatsu, Ishikawa"

Charles Perkins
"Charles Nelson Perkins, AO, (16 June 1936 – 19 October 2000) was an Australian activist and Aboriginal leader. He was also a professional football player."
"Perkins grew up in Alice Springs. His mother was Arrernte, and his father was Kalkadoon. He later moved to Sydney, and graduated from the University of Sydney in 1965. He was the first indigenous Australian to graduate from a university."
"Perkins campaigned for Aboriginal land rights. In 1965, he was an important person in the Freedom Ride campaign, which aimed to raise public awareness of the standards of living, literacy and health conditions among the Aboriginal population. The group was famous for publicising acts of discrimination."
"Perkins was also important in the campaign for the referendum in 1967, which allowed Aboriginal people to be counted in censuses, and parliament to make special laws specifically for Aboriginal people. From 1969, Perkins worked as a public servant in the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs. He was made permanent secretary of this department in 1981, which made him the first Aboriginal to become the permanent head of a federal government department. He served as secretary until 1988."
Perkins died in October 2000 of kidney failure.
Kottabos (Kleophrades Painter)
"Kottabos Player is an Attic red-figure terracotta kylix said to have been painted by someone close to the Kleophrades Painter. It dates to the Greek Archaic period, about 500 BC. The kylix's height with handles is 3 3/16 in. (8.1 cm) and its width with handles is 10 1/16 in. (25.5 cm)."
The diameter of the bowl is 7 5/8 in. (19.3 cm). The kylix is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The figure is a symposiast playing a party game called kottabos. He is about to fling the last of the wine in his cup at a lamp stand in an attempt to knock the lamp stand's finial off. The winner was he who did so.
"Bosley Crowther did not like the movie. He wrote, ""The script was obviously written to bring [Wyman] and Mr. Hudson, who made a popular twosome in the ""Magnificent Obsession"", together again. Solid and sensible drama plainly had to give way to outright emotional bulldozing and a paving of easy clichés."""

Pus
"Pus is a fluid that is created as a result of certain inflammations in vertebrates. In vertebrates, white blood cells fight the inflammation. Neutrophils destroy the agents that cause the infection, for example bacteria, macrophages engulf and neutralise these agents. Pus is made of dead neutrophils and macrophages, mostly. In most cases, pus is the result of bacterial infection, but it can also result from other conditions, such as psoriasis."
Leptin
Leptin is a hormone made by cells in fat tissue that reduces hunger. That helps the energy balance in the body.
"Leptin is opposed by the actions of the hormone ghrelin, the ""hunger hormone"". Both hormones act on receptors in the hypothalamus. They adjust appetite to get energy homeostasis."
"In obesity, a decreased sensitivity to leptin comes up. This leads to a feeling of hunger, despite high energy stores."
"Although regulation of fat stores is the primary function of leptin, it also plays a role in other physiological processes. These additional functions are still being studied."
Leptin was recently discovered in 1994 by Jeffrey M. Friedman and colleagues at Rockefeller University. Its discovery is important in the study of obesity which has become a problem in western society. The importance of leptin was discovered through experiments done on mice in a laboratory. Scientists found that mice who had more leptin in their bodies were thinner and didn't need to eat as much. Leptin levels can be increased by reducing stress and having quality or restful sleep.

Stratosphere
"The stratosphere is one of the layers of the atmosphere of the planet Earth. It extends from about 8 km above the poles (18 km above the equator) to about 50 km. In the stratosphere, the temperature rises with increasing height. This makes the stratosphere very stable. This temperature gradient is caused by the ozone layer which absorbs some UV radiation from sunlight. The absorbed radiation is converted to heat."
"This differs from the lower layer, the troposphere, where temperature declines with higher altitude, and from the next higher layer, the mesosphere, where the temperature again declines."
"Airplanes that are going far usually fly in the lower stratosphere, because the engines are more efficient in cold air and drag is small in low air density air."

Icterid
"The Icteridae are a family of small to medium-sized New World songbirds. They are usually brightly colored. Most species have black as a main plumage color, often enlivened by yellow, orange or red. The family is extremely varied in size, shape, behavior and coloration."
"This group includes the New World blackbirds, New World orioles, the bobolink, meadowlarks, grackles, cowbirds, oropendolas and caciques. They are only distantly related to the Old World common blackbird (which is a thrush) or the Old World orioles."
"Icterids are unusual in songbirds because they have considerable sexual dimorphism. For example, the male great-tailed grackle is 60% heavier than the female. The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole, in which the female averages 15 cm in length (6 in) and in weight, while the largest is the Amazonian oropendola, the male of which measures and weighs about . This variation in size is greater than usual in passerine families."
"One unusual adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping, where the skull allows them to open their bills strongly rather than passively. This lets them force open gaps to get at hidden food."

"As described in the Book of Genesis, Noah and his family kept believing in God in a time when most people were not, like his son Canaan and his wife Naamah. Knowing this was true, God told Noah he was going to flood the world, so he could drown out evil. He told Noah to build a boat called an ""ark"". Noah was to put himself, his family (except his son and his wife because they refused to come aboard the ark), and two (a male and a female) of every kind of animal on it. People laughed at Noah, but they were killed by the flood with his son and his wife. Noah and family stayed on the ark until they reached land. To find land Noah sent out a dove, which returned with an olive branch. After the flood, God made a rainbow as a promise to say that he would never destroy the Earth by flood again. When they were able to walk on dry land, the animals were released and they were able to repopulate the earth."

During a hunting vacation in Switzerland, de Mestral came home one evening and tried to remove the burrs stuck to his dog's fur. He was very surprised to see how hard the burrs were to remove. That night he studied the burrs under a microscope and noticed that each burr was covered with hundreds of small hooks acting like grasping hands. De Mestral decided that this burr could be made to close fabric instead of buttons and zippers. By copying the hook pattern hat he saw on burrs, he made hook-and-loop!"

Under the Brand Extension, WWE assigns its performers to either Raw or SmackDown which cause matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show."
Osamu Tezuka
"Osamu Tezuka (, Tezuka Osamu, November 3, 1928 – February 9, 1989) was a famous Japanese cartoonist, manga artist, animator, producer and Doctor of Medicine, although he never practiced medicine. He was born in Osaka Prefecture. He created ""Astro Boy"", ""Kimba the White Lion"" and ""Black Jack"". He is often credited as the ""Father of Anime"", and is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who was a major inspiration for Tezuka."
"Tezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his New Treasure Island published in 1947. His legendary output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well received manga series including the children mangas Astro Boy, Princess Knight and Kimba the White Lion, and the adult oriented series Black Jack, Phoenix, and Buddha, all of which won several awards."
"Tezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of Phoenix, which were never released."

Boycott
"A boycott is a protest where the protesters do not buy a product or give money to a company. Instead of buying a certain product, they might also buy another, very similar product from a different company."
"The word was made during the ""Irish Land War""'. It comes from the name of Captain Charles Boycott. Boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a landlord in County Mayo, Ireland. In 1880, the tenants (those who rented) wanted their rent lowered. Boycott refused, and threw them out of the land they had rented. The Irish Land League then proposed that instead of becoming violent, everyone in the community should stop doing business with Captain Boycott. The captain was soon isolated. No one helped him with the harvest, no one worked in his stables or his house. Local businessmen no longer traded with him, the postman no longer delivered his post."
"To get his harvest done, he had to hire 50 people from other counties, the counties Cavan and Monaghan. They were escorted to and from their work by 1000 policemen. Of course, this cost far more than what the harvest was worth."
Artificial
"When something is artificial, or man-made, it has been made by humans, not nature. For example, an artificial satellite is one made by humans, while a natural satellite is a satellite that was not made by humans. Many artificial things imitate or copy things found in nature. The imitation may use the same basic materials as those in the natural object; or it may use quite different materials, as in Artificial leather. These are concepts in defining reality. There are different ideas about what can be considered artificial and what is natural."
"The word ""artificial"" comes from the Latin words ""art"" (meaning ""skill"") and ""fex"" (""to make"")."
"Artificial does not necessarily mean ""synthetic"" (that is, created by synthesis). An artificial sweetener imitates sweetness using a chemical formula that is not found in nature; it is therefore both artificial and synthetic."
King Arthur
"King Arthur was a mythical king in the mythology of Great Britain. He lived in the medieval times, in his famous castle, Camelot. He possessed a sword known as Excalibur, given to him by the Lady of the Lake."
"King Arthur is a fabled ruler of Sub-Roman Britain who defended his kingdom from the Anglo-Saxons. He is a popular fictional character in modern literature. He won several battles, and had many homes. However, his favorite home was in Camelot. In one of the most famous tales of King Arthur, he pulls a sword out of a stone, making him King of the Britons."
"The first narrative account of Arthur's life is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latin work ""Historia Regum Britanniae"" (""History of the Kings of Britain""), completed ."
Camelot.
"Many castles claim to be Arthur's Camelot, but the most likely one is Tintagel Castle, Cornwall (though there is no evidence for this). In Camelot sat the famous Round Table, where Arthur, his queen Guinevere, Merlin, Morgan le Fay, Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, Percival and many other valiant knights sat. Arthur and his knights went on many quests including The Quest For The Holy Grail, The Green Knight, The Black Knight and more."
Death.
"After King Arthur's many adventures, his son Mordred seized his kingdom and queen, forcing Arthur to fight for what was truly his. They fought for a long time. Mordred hit King Arthur in many places, but in the end Arthur killed Mordred. After this victory, King Arthur was weak and died from losing blood from battle wounds. As his knights rode back to Camelot, they threw Excalibur into the lake so that it could return to where it came from. One legend says Arthur never died, and will return when the British need him."
"Books, poems and movies."
"Many books have been written about King Arthur. Most of them involve Merlin, the Knights of the Round Table, and Morgan le Fay."
"Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote the first book about Arthur in the 12th century. In the 15th century, Sir Thomas Malory wrote one of the best-known books about Arthur, called ""Le Morte d’Arthur"" (""The Death of Arthur""). Later, in the 19th century, Alfred, Lord Tennyson visited Tintagel, the mythical Camelot, twice. He wrote a series of poems about Arthur."
"Some stories about Arthur say he tried to find the Holy Grail, the cup that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper."
"There are also many movies about Arthur. These include Disney's ""The Sword in the Stone; Monty Python and the Holy Grail; King Arthur (2004); King Arthur, The Kid Who Would Be King (2019); the Legend of the Sword (2017)""; and the musical ""Camelot""."

"The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four teams, with hosts South Korea being allocated to position A1. The teams were seeded into their respective pots based on their results in the last five FIFA U-20 World Cups (more recent tournaments weighted more heavily), with bonus points awarded to confederation champions. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other for the group stage."

Khoriphaba
Khoriphaba () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). He is the son of Sky God Salailen. He came down from heaven to earth to search for his mother and then for a bride. He is best known for wrestling with Loyalakpa in the Lai Haraoba festival. He is also a polo playing God.
Description.
"God Khoriphaba is a Lainingthou. In Ancient Meitei language, ""Lai"" means God or Deity and ""Ningthou"" means King or Ruler. However, the term ""Lainingthou"" carries many meanings. It may refer to ""king of gods"", ""godly king"" or ""kingly god"". Since Khoriphaba is not the king of gods, he is a kingly god."
Khoriphaba is a sportsman. He participated in polo as well as wrestling championships.
"Among the deities, God Khoriphaba and God Loyalakpa possess the epithets of being the best wrestlers. The two powerful gods wrestled during the Lai Haraoba festival."
"God Khoriphaba is one of the polo player gods. He participated in the divine polo match. During the godly polo championship, Khoriphaba joined the southern team. His team was led by God Thangjing while his opponent's team (northern team) was led by God Marjing."
Mythology.
"God Khoriphaba was born with the divine union of God Salailen (alias Soraren) and Goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi at Heaven. When Khoriphaba was three months old (or ""three years old""), his parents got separated. His mother was abandoned from entering into Heaven. So, little Khoriphaba was looked after by the 1000 queens of heaven. But he cried for his mother. Salailen tried to pacify the baby's cry but in vain. He gave him milk but it was of no use. He summoned his nobles and subjects. He asked them to make his son stop crying. Thousands of gods and goddesses tried but all of them failed to stop the boy's cry. Finally, Chingkheirel Apamba tried his luck. He sang hymns in praise of the baby God. Suddenly, the boy stopped crying. At this, Salailen named his son ""Khoiriphaba""."
"One day, Angoupalba Yaibirel Sidaba found Khoiriphaba crying near a tree. He brought the boy to his home. He asked his family to take care of the boy. The clan members looked after the child like their own child. They named him ""Puthiba""."
"One day, Khoiriphaba heard some women talking about him. They said, ""Look how cute the child is! We love him so much! His mother would have loved him many times than we love him. How much his mother would have suffered for the loss of the child."" Khoiriphaba immediately asked them about his mother. But none knew the answer to his question. So, he decided to search for his mother by himself."
God Khoriphaba descended from sky down to earth in search for his lost mother Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi.
"He came to Moirang near Khoiri Keithel. The sun already set when he was there. Not knowing what to do, he started crying. God Thangjing and his consort Koiren Leima came to him. They came to know about the identity of the boy. The divine couple took care of Khoiriphaba."
"Under the guardianship of God Thangjing, Khoiriphaba grew up. He made many friends. He was nine years old. He started wrestling (), race, and so on. He was always the champion of all the competitions. This made his friends fell jealous of him. So, one of his friends told him about how he grew up under the care of Thangjing. Khoriphaba was told that they would not allow him to play with them because he was an inferior God. Khoriphaba felt dejected for many days. Thangjing noticed it and asked him. Khoiriphaba narrated him the incident. So, Thangjing decided that Khoiriphaba should be sent to his mother without further delaying. He summoned all the 27 friends of Khoiriphaba. He asked them to challenge Khoiriphaba for wrestling and race championships. None were ready for the challenge. Then Thangjing asked them about a tug of war in which all of them would stand together at one side and Khoiriphaba alone at another side. There was a condition. If they won, they would be the winner. But if Khoiriphaba won, they should send Khoiriphaba off to his mother's place at Haorok Konthou, carrying him on a palanquin. The 27 friends accepted the challenge. But all of them got defeated in the hands of Khoiriphaba."
"On the next day, the 27 friends proceeded for the journey with Khoiriphaba on a palanquin towards Haorok Konthou. They came from a long distance from Moirang. On the way, they came across a beautiful place. They could not control themselves to rest at the beautiful place for a while. They requested Khoiriphaba who agreed. The beautiful place where they rested was named ""Toubul"" (). Some friends were waiting for the resting friends at another place. The place where they waited was named ""Ngaikhong"". After some time, little by little, all of his friends left Khoiriphaba alone. So, Khoiriphaba continued his journey alone. On the way, he came across a river. On the river, many women were fishing using nets. Since morning, they could not catch a single fish. He was helped by a woman to cross the river."
"Finally, he reached Haorok Konthou. The people of the place were greatly awed to see him. They have heard of his quest. But Goddess Tampha was not at the place. Due to the fear of Salailen, the villagers sent her off to another place. She was looked after by the Kabui tribes in the hills. So, Khoriphaba set off for the next journey riding on his mare Ngangrubi."
"On reaching the village of the Kabui tribes in the hills, he was warmly welcomed by the tribesmen. He finally met his long departed mother. He proposed her to return home back to heaven. But she did not agree because she was abandoned by her husband. So, he sadly left his mother."
"There are also legends about God Khoriphaba looking for a bride. He veiled his face and hold a polo-stick over his shoulder. While searching for a lover, he was riding on a mare."
"God Khoriphaba reached Koubru's place. God Koubru offered him to choose any lady of his choice from his place. Khoriphaba chose Goddess Nungthel Leima. But Nungthel Leima was already the consort of Loyalakpa. So, God Koubru could not give him the desired lady. Koubru did not want to take back his own words. He asked Khoriphaba to choose any lady but he should do it blindfolded. Blindfolded Khoiriphaba attempted to choose but he could not get Goddess Nungthel Leima. This action is enacted by the maibis in the Lai Haraoba festival."
Worship.
"During the Lai Haraoba festival, there is a special ritual named ""Kanglei Thokpa"" dedicated to God Khoriphaba. In this ritual, a group of maibis sing a song depicting Khoriphaba's search for a bride."

Clement Attlee
"Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee (3 January 1883 – 8 October 1967) was a British politician. Prime Minister from 1945 to 1951, he was the first Labour prime minister with a majority in government, and was very important in the setting up of the welfare state. He was made a member of the House of Lords after he retired, and became the first Earl Attlee."
Attlee died of pneumonia in 1967. He is buried in Westminster Abbey.
Early life and education.
"Attlee was born in Putney. Attlee was educated at Haileybury College. He graduated from University College, Oxford with a Second Class Honours BA in Modern History in 1904."
Career.
"Attlee began a career as a barrister after graduating from Oxford. This lasted for two years. He then worked as manager of Haileybury House in East London. Attlee's work at the House inspired him to become a socialist. In 1907 he joined the Fabian Society. In 1908 he joined the Independent Labour Party. In 1911, he was employed by the UK Government.

Bassoon
"The bassoon is the lowest of the four main instruments of the woodwind family. Like the oboe, it has a double reed. The reed is attached to a curved metal mouthpiece called a ""crook"" or ""bocal"" which is joined to the main part of the instrument. This consists of two parts called ‘bass joint’ and ‘wing joint’ (or ‘tenor joint’). These two are joined at the bottom by a U-shaped piece called the ‘boot’. At the top of the instrument is the ‘bell joint’. The instrument is quite heavy. Some players have a neckstrap around their neck to support the weight, but usually they use a seat strap that connects at the bottom of the boot and goes across the floor. The bassoonist, a person who plays a bassoon, then sits on that strap. The bassoon is held to the right side of the bassoonist and the top of the boot joint is usually level with the players hip. The bassoon, when played right, can sound very beautiful. The bassoon has one of the largest note ranges, going from low B flat to a high F on the top line of the treble clef. The bassoon can also play in tenor clef, but usually plays bass clef."
"Some bassoons have a white, ivory ring round the top of the bell joint. These are German bassoons (called ‘Heckel’). French bassoons (called ‘Buffet’) do not have this ring, and also sound quite different to German bassoons. Bassoons have keys to help the player to cover all the holes, but these keys do not use the Boehm fingering system like the other woodwind instruments. German bassoons use a system called the Heckel system, and French bassoons use the Buffet system."
"The Bassoon is usually seen as a comical instrument, however it provides a very important role in the orchestra. In fact, the Saxophone was invented to replace the Bassoon and Oboe, however, was rejected because it didn't sound the same in the orchestra."
Playing the bassoon.
"To play the bassoon, it is very important to have lots of breathing support. Like with the oboe, fast passages can be played using double tonguing (single tonguing is like saying “tu-tu-tu-tu-tu”, double tonguing is like saying “te-ke-te-ke-te-ke”). In most music, the bassoon will spend a lot of time playing a bass line, perhaps the same notes as the cello or tuba. It can sometimes sound quite amusing when playing an “um-cha-um-cha” accompaniment like in the “Dance of the Cygnets” from Tchaikovsky’s ""Swan Lake"". It can sound very tuneful and sad as in the second movement of Rimsky Korsakov’s ""Sheherazade"". Listen to the opening of Stravinsky’s ""Rite of Spring"" where it plays some quite high notes to fool people that it is the Cor anglais or the English Horn. Even a famous composer, Saint Saëns, did not know what the instrument was. Prokofiev uses the bassoon for grandfather’s tune in ""Peter and the Wolf"". Also, to play the bassoon, a player needs big hands because the bassoon's keys and holes are quite wide."

SR Class 2Wim
"2Wim was the designation given, by Southern Railway (SR), to a small fleet of electric multiple units, dedicated for use on the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class."
SR Class 4DD
"Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway's Dartford commuter route, the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain. The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges. The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten."
Network SouthEast
"Network SouthEast (NSE) was one of three passenger sectors of British Rail created in 1982. NSE principally operated commuter trains in the London area and inter-urban services in densely populated South East England. Before 1986, the sector was known as London &amp; South Eastern."
Privatisation.
"In these places, it is also illegal to treat a person with a service animal differently than any other person. The person with a service animal cannot be charged extra money, refused service, or kept apart from other people. A service animal can be asked to leave one of these places only if it is out of control (for example, if it is aggressive or urinates inside). The animal has to be on a leash, or controlled by its owner's voice or signals, all the time."
"No one can ask for proof that the animal is a service animal. Owners do not have to carry any special papers or prove that their service animal can do a special task. If an owner and a service animal enter one of these places, workers are only allowed to ask two questions to make sure the animal is a service animal and not a pet:"
It is legal to train your own service animal in the United States.
"Service animals do not get these same protections in most religious organizations. Most religious organizations are exempt from the ADA's requirements, which means they do not have to obey the ADA."
Other laws.
"Other laws have less strict definitions of which animals count as service animals. For example, the Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act allows ""dogs and other service animals"" to ride with passengers on commercial airlines."
The Fair Housing Act also requires housing providers to allow service animals (including comfort and emotional support animals). This law does not say that only certain animals are allowed.
Laws in other countries.
Mexico &amp; South America.
"In most places in South America and Mexico, the place's owner or manager gets to decide whether to let a service animal in. There are no laws that protect service animals or their owners. In areas with many tourists, service dogs are generally welcomed without problems."
"In Brazil, however, the President created a new law about service dogs in 2006. The law says that all service dogs in Brazil must be allowed to go anywhere that the public could go. The ""Brasília Metro"" (the Brazilian public transportation system) has developed a program which trains guide dogs to ride it."
Europe.
"Different European countries have different laws about service animals. Some countries have laws that govern the entire country, and sometimes different parts of the country govern themselves."
Australia.
"In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 legally protects all assistance dog handlers."
"However, with current laws, owners may not always be allowed to have their service animals with them in all situations. Each state and territory has its own laws, which mainly have to do with guide dogs. Queensland has introduced the Guide Hearing and Assistance Dog Act 2009, which protects all certified assistance dogs."
Canada.
"In Canada, any service animal is allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed, as long as the owner is in control of the animal. In Alberta, there is a fine of up to $3000 for someone who refuses to let a service dog into a place where everyone else could go."
South Korea.
"In South Korea, the law says service dogs must be let into any areas that are open to the public. People who break this law can be fined for up to 2 million ""won"" (about $1691 in United States dollars)."

His world ranking peaked at no.4 later that year. He was the British number 1 in 1997 and 1999. He competed in the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics."
"Rusedski was a contestant on ""Dancing on Ice"" in 2008. He lives in London."
"The movie's musical score and songs are arrangements or adaptations of material from the 1890 ""Sleeping Beauty"" ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Buena Vista Distribution released the movie to theaters on November 11, 1959. It was the first animated movie to be photographed in the Technirama widescreen process. The movie was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in first-run engagements."
"The movie generated mixed reviews from critics. They thought the movie was slow-paced and lacked character development. ""Sleeping Beauty"" earned approximately $7.7 million in box office rentals. Its production costs totaled $6 million, making it the most expensive Disney movie to that date. The high production costs of the movie resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, and many animators were laid off."

"The story tells of an unnamed narrator's beautiful wife Ligeia. She composes the poem ""The Conqueror Worm"" before dying. The narrator then marries the Lady Rowena. She shortly sickens and dies. The narrator stays with her body overnight. She comes back from the dead as Ligeia."
"Criticism was positive. Charles Eames of ""The New World"" wrote, ""The force and boldness of the conception and the high artistic skill, with which the writer's purpose is wrought out, are equally admirable."" Thomas Dunn English wrote in October 1845 that ""Ligeia"" was ""the most extraordinary, of its kind, of his productions""."
"In 1964, director Roger Corman adapted the story to a movie, ""The Tomb of Ligeia"", starring Vincent Price."
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar
"""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar"" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in 1845. The tale tells of a dying, mesmerized man whose body disintegrates once the trance is lifted. Poe was inspired to write the tale after reading a description of an operation performed upon a mesmerized patient. The tale has a great deal of gore, leading to the speculation that Poe had studied medical texts. ""Valdemar"" has been adapted to the movies and to radio drama."
Plot.
"The narrator mesmerizes an ill friend, M. Valdemar. Valdemar reports first that he is dying and then that he is dead. The narrator leaves him in a mesmeric state for seven months. During this time Valdemar is without pulse, heartbeat, or breath. His skin is cold and pale. Finally, the narrator tries to wake him. Valdemar's swollen black tongue begs to be returned to sleep or to be fully wakened. He shouts ""dead! dead!"" repeatedly. The narrator takes Valdemar out of the trance and his body immediately disintegrates into a ""nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detestable putrescence."""
Publication history.
"Poe was inspired to write ""Valdemar"" after reading a letter about an operation on a mesmerized patient. The tale was published in December 1845 in two different New York journals. One used the title ""The Facts in M. Valdemar's Case"". In England, the tale was published first as ""Mesmerism in Articulo Mortis"" and later as ""The Last Days of M. Valdemar""."
Style.
"Poe employs detailed descriptions and high levels of gore in ""Valdemar"". He may have studied medical texts. Valdemar's eyes at one point leak a ""profuse outflowing of a yellowish ichor"", for example. The tale's imagery is summed up in the final lines: ""...his whole frame at once — within the space of a single minute, or even less, shrunk—crumbled—absolutely rotted away beneath my hands. Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detestable putrescence."" The disgusting imagery probably inspired later fiction including that of H. P. Lovecraft. Those final lines make up one of the most powerfully effective moments in Poe's work, incorporating shock, disgust, and uneasiness into one moment. This ending shows that attempts to appropriate power over death will have hideous results and, therefore, ultimately will be unsuccessful."
Adaptations.
"Movie adaptations include a segment in Roger Corman's ""Tales of Terror"" (1962) and George A. Romero's ""Two Evil Eyes"" (1990). ""Edgar Allan Poe's Valdemar"" (2000) was a dramatic adaptation for National Public Radio."
"On the next day, Kongyamba announced to the people,"
"&lt;poem&gt;""It is evil for land if a poor man win the race. It might bring scarcity more than the people can bear. Let's say this among the people before the race begin.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"This words spread among the public. Khamba was stopped and told that his name was not in the list of the contestants. Khamba believed them. So, he sadly returned home. He told everything to Khamnu. The two siblings told Nongtholba about it. Nongtholba went to the king. The king told Khamba to participate if it was not still late to join."
"Khamba and Feiroijamba went to the starting place of the race. The race was about to be started. Khamba ran swiftly as fast as he could. Then, Kongyamba's men interrupted Khamba on his way. But Khamba stroke all of them aside. At last, he reached up Kongyamba. Kongyamba was running slowly as he got tired. Suddenly, fifteen horsemen of Kongyamba stopped Khamba. But Khamba kicked out all of them from his way."
"Finally, Khamba reached the final destination. He was the champion and Kongyamba was the second. Both saluted the King. The King was more pleased with Khamba."
The false oracle and the feral bull.
"Kongyamba was thinking about an evil plot against Khamba. But the Gods did not give him any evil hints in his dreams. So, he built a hut. Inside the hut, he tried to connect with a spirit. But he failed. One day, he met fisher women from the Khuman kingdom in the region of Moirang. Both the Khuman kingdom and the Moirang kingdom were in shores of the Loktak lake."
"The women came to Moirang besides having their own fishing area. So, Kongyamba asked them the reason for coming to Moirang."
"The women told him:&lt;poem&gt;""There is a great bull that lurks among the reeds of the shores of the lake, and it had claimed life of many. So, we dare not to fish there.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"Suddenly, an idea came to Kongyamba's mind. He went to the king. He acted as a person possessed by a divine spirit. Kongyamba told the King,"
"&lt;poem&gt;""God Thangjing had spoken in my ears and I have his behest upon me. Verily said the God, I am sated with offerings of flesh and fish, but this year, my heart longs for the sweet savour of the flesh of the mighty bull that lurks in the reeds that border the water of the lake. My servant Khamba vows that he will bring it for my honor and for the welfare of the State.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"The king called and asked Khamba about his promise. Khamba denied it. There resulted a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba. Later, Khamba told the king he would catch the bull if it was the God’s will."
"The king was pleased with Khamba. So, he promised him to give Princess Thoibi hand in marriage if he succeeded in the adventure. Minister Thonglen put seven marks on the lintel post of the capital city. It was the record of the King’s promise."
The king of Moirang sent an embassy to the king of Khuman. The embassy proposed the great sport to be organized. The Khuman king agreed. A grand Colosseum was built. The Colosseum could hold a capacity of the audiences from both the two kingdoms.
"Khamba captured the bull. He was bringing it to the two Kings' residing place. On the way back, Kongyamba came to him before anyone saw them. Kongyamba pretended to help Khamba to hold the bull. Kongyamba hold the rope. When everyone saw, Kongyamba claimed that he had captured the bull. He added that he even rescued Khamba who fell into the ditch. Once again, there was a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba over the claim. The two Kings could not find out who was right. So, Kongyamba was asked to fight the bull within an enclosure. But Kongyamba got frightened of the bull. So, he climbed up on the heights to save himself. Khamba faced the bull bravely. He once again captured the bull."
Royal archery contest and Nongban's advantage of gaining favour.
"Annually, a Royal archery contest was held in honour of God Thangjing in Ancient Moirang. The contest was for the royalties of the Moirang kingdom. Nongban Kongyamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the King. Khamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the Crown Prince (King’s younger brother). Chingkhu Akhuba, the Crown Prince asked his daughter Thoibi about his Coat Of Golden Embroidery. But Thoibi had already given the coat to Khamba. So, she told him a white lie."
"On the day of the competition, the target was set. The royal priests sang charms over the arrows and the bows of the contestants. The King shot his arrows. Kongyamba fetched the arrows and gave back to the king. For the Crown Prince, Khamba was to fetch the arrows. The Crown Prince shot his arrows so swiftly. Khamba ran swiftly to pick them up. At this, Khamba's outer cloth get loosened. The Crown Prince saw the inner cloth worn by Khamba. It was his golden embroidered coat. He got furious. When Khamba gave him the arrow, he did not take it. He turned away from Khamba. Kongyamba took the arrow from Khamba. He gave it to the Prince. The Prince was pleased with Kongyamba. He told Kongyamba that princess Thoibi would be given to him within five days. From this time onwards, Nongban Kongyamba gained favor from Thoibi's father, the Crown Prince."
Torture by Elephant: Collective evil planing of Nongban and Thoibi's father against Khamba.
"The Crown Prince and Nongban Kongyamba planned an evil plot to kill Khamba. They sent messengers to Khamba. The messengers told Khamba that he was called by the Crown Prince. On his way, Khamba was interrupted by Kongyamba and his men. Kongyamba asked Khamba to give up Thoibi. Khamba replied that he will not give up."
"As a result, they fought. Khamba threw Kongyamba's men upon the ground. Khamba knelt upon Kongyamba's belly. He pressed Kongyamba's throat. He was about to kill Kongyamba. But Kongyamba's men dragged Khamba off. They beat Khamba. His clothes were torn. They bound him so that he could not move. The Prince also came up on his elephant. He told the men to beat him. They fastened him to the elephant's leg with ropes. However, the elephant driver knew that Khamba was innocent. So, he bound him leaving him some spaces to breathe."
"Then they stimulated the elephant to harm Khamba. But God Thangjing let it not to move. Finally, Kongyamba hit the elephant with a spear to move in pain. But it did not harm Khamba."
"In that night, Goddess Panthoibi told Thoibi in her dream that her beloved man was bound by her father’s orders to the elephant and was nearly killed. Thoibi arose and took a sword. She immediately came to the spot for Khamba. The criminals feld from the spot. She saved Khamba from the criminals as well as the elephant."
"The news was informed to Khamnu, Feiroijamba, Nongtholba and Thonglen. Nongtholba, Feiroijamba and Thonglen went to the Royal Court with all their armies. Feiroijamba said to the Court three times about the harsh cruelty to Khamba. However, the Prince did not pay attention to the complaint."
"Nongtholba and Prince Chingkhu Akhuba had a conflict on the matter. The conflict could not be resolved without the King. Finally, both went to the King for the judgement."
"Before their arrival, Princess Thoibi had already informed the king all the crimes committed by her own father."
"The King proclaimed that all the criminals would be punished. So, Nongban Kongyamba, Prince Chingkhu Akhuba (Thoibi's father) and other men were sent in the prison. The King told the Prince to stay there untill Khamba was well again."
"The King sent his own men to take care of injured Khamba. He sent him gifts every day. Thoibi personally took care of Khamba. He got well again. So, Nongban Kongyamba and the Prince were set free."
Plot to kidnap Princess Thoibi.
"The Prince asked his daughter Thoibi to marry Kongyamba. But she rejected. So, in anger, he exiled her to Kabaw chiefdom. He did not want to see her anymore."
"During her exile, Thoibi always missed her beloved Khamba as well as her hometown. God Thangjing softened her father's heart. He sent men to bring her back. However, he asked Kongyamba to forcibly elope Thoibi from her return journey."
"Kongyamba and his men were waiting for Princess Thobi's return. When they saw the princess returning, his men shouted,"

Béarnaise sauce
"Béarnaise sauce () is a sauce made of clarified butter, egg yolks, and herbs. It is considered to be a 'child' of the mother Hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in French haute cuisine. The difference is only in their flavouring: Béarnaise uses shallot, chervil, peppercorn, and tarragon, while Hollandaise uses lemon juice."
"In appearance it is light yellow and opaque, smooth and creamy."
Béarnaise is a traditional sauce for steak.
History.
"Although a similar recipe was published in 1818, Béarnaise sauce was likely first created by the chef Collinet, the inventor of puffed potatoes (), and served at the 1836 opening of ""Le Pavillon Henri IV"", a restaurant at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, not far from Paris. Evidence for this is reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was named for Henry IV of France, a gourmet himself, who was born in the former province of Béarn."
Preparation.
"A Béarnaise sauce is simply clarified butter, an egg yolk, a shallot, a little tarragon vinegar. It takes years of practice for the result to be perfect."
"Like Hollandaise sauce, there are several methods for the preparation of Béarnaise sauce. Please refer to the Preparation section of that article for basics. Here we highlight the differences."
"The most common preparation is a ""Bain-marie"" method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidify the yolks. Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns (later strained out), with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice. Others are similar. Alternatively, the flavourings may be added to a finished Hollandaise (""sans"" lemon juice)."
Producing output.
"Printers are programmed using a programming language. The printer interprets the program, and the outputs the result. There are two big classes of such languages: Page description languages, and Printer Control languages. A page description language describes what a page should look like. The program in a page description language is sent to the printer, which interprets them. Printer command languages are at a lower level than Page description languages, they contain information that is specific to the printer model."
Common programming languages for printers include:
Cost of printers.
"When comparing the cost of a printer, people often talk about how expensive it is to print one page. This cost usually has three components:"
"Printers that are more expensive to buy will usually be less expensive in the consumables (the ink, toner, or ribbon used by the printer). Therefore, laser printers are often more expensive to buy than inkjet printers, but are not as expensive to use over a long period of time. Inkjet printers on the other hand cost more to use because the ink tanks they use are more expensive than the toner for a laser printer."
"Laser printers that can print in color are usually more expensive than those that only print in black and white. Some expensive printers can do other things such as print on both sides of the paper, automatically sort the output, or staple the pages."
Chasing Vermeer
Chasing Vermeer is a children's novel. It is about two children noticing strange coincidences relating to art. The book was written by Blue Balliett and published (printed) by Scholastic in 2003. It says many things about the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer.
"The sequel to the book is ""The Wright 3""."
Great Wall of China
"The Great Wall of China is an ancient wall in China. The wall is made of cement, rocks, bricks, and dirt. It was finished in 1878 and it was meant to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, wide and 15 metres high. The earlier sections on the wall are made of compacted dirt and stone. Later in the Ming Dynasty they used bricks. There are 7,000 watch towers, block houses for soldiers and beacons to send smoke signals."
"Nineteen walls have been built that were called the Great Wall of China. The first was built in the 7th century BC. The most famous wall was built between 226–200 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (Qin Pronounced as Chin) , during the Qin Dynasty. Not much of this wall remains as people have been stealing from it. It was much farther north than the current wall. The current wall was built during the Ming Dynasty."
History.
Great Wall of Qi was started in 685 BC. The state of Qi made a fortified wall for protection against the Southern states Ju og Lu and later from the kingdom Chu.
The state of Yan built walls during the rule of King Zhao of Yan (311–279 BC).
"The state of Zhao built walls during 325–299 BC, during the rule of king Wuling of Zhao."
"Walls on the periphery of the Northern states Yan, Zhao, and Qin became linked together, because all those states came under the rule of emperor Qin Shi Hong, during his rule (221–206 BC)."
"The First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang also called Shi Huangdi, started the Qin Dynasty. The Xiongnu tribes in the north of China were his enemies. The land in some parts of China is easy to cross, so Qin Shi Huang started building the Great Wall to make it more difficult for the Xiongnu to invade China."
"By 212 BC, the wall went from Gansu to the coast of South Manchuria."
"Other dynasties in China had worked more on the wall and made it longer. The Han, Sui, Northern and Jin Dynasties all repaired, rebuilt or expanded the Great Wall. During the Ming Dynasty, major rebuilding work took place. Sections of the wall were built with bricks and stone instead of earth. It took more than 2000 years for building and completion of the Great wall."
"The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, 9.1 metres (30 feet) wide and 15 metres high. It is made over the course of hundreds of years, the wall was built by over 6 different Chinese dynasties, and is over 2,300 years old."
"The wall was built to help keep out northern invaders like the Mongols. Smaller walls had been built over the years, but the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, decided that he wanted a single giant wall to protect his northern borders. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by Ming Dynasty. Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire, was the only one who breached the Great Wall of China in its"
"2,700-year-history."
The Great Wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. The Great Wall was declared as one of the Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.
Construction and rebuilding of the Great Wall.
"Builders used materials that were nearby. Some parts of the wall were made of mud, straw, and twigs. Thousands of workers died from giant falling stones, exhaustion, disease, animal attacks, and starvation. Workers dying and being buried in and under the Great Wall is a myth."
Visibility from space.
"Rumours about astronauts being able to see the Great Wall from the moon are scientifically not proven. The Great Wall has shown up in radar images taken from space, but scientists are sure it is not possible for astronauts to see the wall with a naked eye. One astronaut who spoke about the visibility of the Great Wall from space was Neil Armstrong. He said that on the moon, it was very clear that the wall was not visible. However, astronaut William Pogue was able to see the wall from a Low Earth Orbit distance (300-530 km height), but only with binoculars and with lots of practice."
"Nowadays, there is little or no households with proper phunga lairu (traditional fire hearth). So, a modern fireplace is developed. Here, traditional rites and rituals are performed in honor of the goddess."
"There are a lot of changes in the way of worshipping Goddess Imoinu. However, the essence and the importance always remain the same as forever."
Festival.
"The ""Imoinu Iratpa"" (""Emoinu Eratpa"") is a religious festival dedicated to goddess Imoinu (Emoinu). It is celebrated on the 12th of Wakching month (December-January interface month) every year. Traditionally, worship and prayers are performed inside every households. Nowadays, Imoinu Iratpa festival is also celebrated in a larger way in public gathering clubs also."
"Wherever the festival is performed, seasonal fruits, vegetables and fish are offered to goddess Imoinu."

"The blue-spotted Mexican tree frog, blue-spotted tree frog or blue-spotted smilisca (""Smilisca cyanosticta"") is a frog that lives in Mexico, Belize and Guatemala. Scientists have seen it as high as 1200 meters above sea level."
Leimarel Sidabi
"Leimarel Sidabi () or Leimalel Sitapi () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the highest female divinity in Meitei pantheon. She is the goddess of earth, nature and household. She is the mother of everyone in the universe."
Etymology.
"The Meitei word ""Leimarel"" (ꯂꯩꯃꯔꯦꯜ) or ""Leimaren"" (ꯂꯩꯃꯔꯦꯟ) is as ""queen"" or ""goddess"" in English. The word ""Leimarel"" (or ""Leimaren"") can be broken into pieces: ""Lei"" (ꯂꯩ), ""Ma"" (ꯃ) and ""-ren"" (-ꯔꯦꯟ) or ""-rel"" (-ꯔꯦꯜ). ""Lei"" means land or earth. ""Ma"" means mother. ""-ren"" (or ""-rel"") means excellent. Another Meitei word ""Sidabi"" can be broken into ""Si"" (ꯁꯤ), ""-da"" (ꯗ) and ""-bi"" (-ꯕꯤ). ""Si"" (""See"") means ""to die"". ""-da"" denotes negative meaning. ""-bi"" (""-bee"") denotes feminine gender."
Description.
"Leimarel is the mother goddess. In ancient times, the ruling royal couples sat in the ""Laplen Ka"" (the central room). They faced the sacred spot of goddess Leimarel. It was believed that men and women originated from Leimarel's womb. A house symbolises the Mother in traditional Meitei beliefs."
Mythology.
"The supreme creator Atingkok (alias Salailel) asked his two sons, Sanamahi and Pakhangba to run in a race around the world. The winner would become the ruler of the world. Sanamahi was stronger than his younger brother, Pakhangba. He started his journey. Pakhangba wept to his mother, Leimarel Sidabi. She told him the secret behind the throne of the universe. The secret is that going around the throne of the Supreme Being is shorter than going around the universe. So, Pakhangba went around the Supreme Being, his father. Thus, he won the race and became the ruler of the universe. When Sanamahi returned home, he found his younger brother sitting on the throne. He got angry. He attacked Pakhangba. Pakhangba ran away. He hid himself among seven lairembis. The Supreme Being intervened the situation. He brought peace of Sanamahi. He made Sanamahi as the king of the household of the mankind. At the same time, goddess Leimarel Sidabi became another Imung Lai (household deity), besides Sanamahi."
"According to some legends, goddess Ima Leimaren (lit. Mother Leimarel) takes care of the market. She brings peace and harmony by doing so. This tradition is still maintained by womenfolk. The women are considered as the descendents of the ""Ima""."
Texts.
"Several ancient texts (PuYas) write things about the goddess Leimarel. Some include the Leimaren Naoyom, the Leimaren Langon, the Leimaren Mingkhei, the Leimaren Shekning Lasat, the Leimaren Ungoiron, besides others."
Worship.
"Leimarel Sidabi and her son Sanamahi are worshipped in the first room of every Meitei household. Goddess Leimarel doesn't want the ""Korou Anganba"" (sunlight) in the morning. So, houses of Loi castes are mainly made facing southwards. She lives in water also. So, she is worshipped in an ""Isaiphu"" (an earthen pitcher or terracotta pot containing water). There are no images kept to represent the two deities inside their abode."
"A senior woman or women of the house fills the earthen pot of the goddess with fresh water. She does this after taking a holy bath. Fresh flowers, fruits, vegetables and rice are offered. Prayers are also offered to protect the family members from every troubles."
"The maibas perform rites and rituals by chanting hymns dedicated to goddess Leimaren (ancestral mother goddess). It is generally done inside the house. Water, rice and flowers are mainly placed."
Festivals.
"Goddess Leimarel Sidabi and her son Sanamahi are mainly worshipped in many religious occasions. Some are Cheiraoba and ""Saroi-Khangba"". Cheiraoba is the Meitei new year (Manipuri new year) festival. Saroi-Khangba is a religious event to please the evil spirits."
In Arts.
"The ""Leimarel Sheisak"" is one of the 9 singing styles (tunes) of Meitei tradition (Manipuri culture). It is sung during the festival of Lai Haraoba."
Namesakes.
Jesus told this parable after he taught his disciples how to pray the Lord's Prayer.
The parable is therefore an incentive to pray. The parable of the Unjust Judge has a similar meaning.
Depictions.
"The most famous depiction of this parable is ""The Importunate Neighbour"" (1895) by William Holman Hunt, kept at the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia."
Onon (river)
"The Onon gol (Mongolian: Онон гол, Russian: Онон) is a river in Mongolia and Russia. It is 818 km long. Its watershed is 94,010 km2. It starts at the Khentii Mountains, on the Eastern slopes. 298 km of the river is in Mongolia. It has a confluence (the place where two rivers join together) with the Ingoda River. When they meet, it makes the Shilka River. People believe that Genghis Khan was born near the upper Onon and he grew up there. The rivers Onon—Shilka—Amur makes one of the world's ten longest rivers (their lengths, in order: 818 km, 560 km, 2,874 km)."
Entscheidungsproblem
"The Entscheidungsproblem (German, ""decision problem"") is a famous problem of mathematics. David Hilbert formulated the problem in 1928: Is there an algorithm that will take a formal language, and a logical statement in that language, and that will output ""True"" or ""False"", depending on the truth value of the statement? The algorithm does not tell how it reaches the answer, nor prove it, as long as the answer is always correct."
"In 1936 and 1937, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing showed independently, that there can be no answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false. For this reason, there can be no solution for the Entscheidungsproblem . This was proven by Alan Turings ""Turing Machine"" which was created in the 1930s."
Turing's Proof.
"Turing proposes a computer program that can determine for certain if any program fed into it will halt or not. He also proposes another program that halts if the input is loop, and loops if the input is halt. He says to make these two programs one new program. Then, he proposes to feed this new program's code into itself. This means the program thinks it will halt, so it will loop, but then it'll loop, so it'll halt, and so on and so forth. This is a paradox, which means for certain that you cannot write a program to determine if every program will halt or not."
Bessie Coleman
"Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Coleman (January 26, 1892 – April 30, 1926) was the first female African American pilot ever to hold an international pilot license. She fought discrimination to follow her dream of becoming a pilot. She became a skilled barnstormer and aviation educator."
Early Life.
"Coleman was born in Texas in 1892. Her mother was African American and her father was Native American. She had two brothers and a young sister. Her parents were sharecroppers. When Coleman was two, her family moved to Waxahachie, Texas where Bessie went to school. She loved reading and was very good at math. Her father hoped to get a job."
Coleman’s father was disturbed by the racial barriers in Texas. He believed that the family would be treated better if they moved to Indian Territory in Oklahoma.
"Unable to convince his wife to accompany him, Coleman’s father left the family when she was nine. Around that time, her older brothers grew up and moved away. Coleman’s mother worked as a maid. Coleman helped take care of her younger sisters."
"During the cotton harvest, everyone in the family worked in the fields to earn extra money. It was hot, boring work, and during the harvest, African American children could not go to school. Still, Coleman managed to finish all eight grades in the local school. Coleman decided that she wanted to go to college, so she saved her money. In about four years, she had enough money to begin college. A year later, she ran out of money."
"At the age of 23, Coleman boarded a train and made the trip to Chicago. She moved in with her brothers and their wives. Coleman took class to learn to become a manicurist, and soon found a job at the White Sox Barber Shop on Chicago's Southside. But Coleman wanted to do something more with her life."
Flying.
"Her friend Robert Abbott told her that she could travel to France to fly. She studied the French language after work at night. She got a new job managing a restaurant and saved her money. Robert Abbot and her friends helped her pay for the trip. In 1920, Coleman went to France on a ship. She learned to be a pilot at the Caudron Brothers' School of Aviation. In 1921, Coleman became the first female African American pilot ever to hold an international pilot license. She earned it from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale."
"Coleman went back to the United States to work as a barnstormer, performing tricks and stunts in her airplane. Barnstormers like Coleman flew planes in loops and figure eights and other patterns while audiences watched. Coleman performed in the United States and Europe. In the 1920s, much of the United States still practiced racial segregation. Coleman refused to perform at places that did not let African Americans watch equally. For one show in Texas, Coleman refused to perform unless the showrunners let everyone in the audience enter through the same gate instead of making one gate for white people and one for black people. She also taught flying lessons and encouraged women to learn to be pilots."
Coleman wanted to open an aviation school in the United States where black students could learn to be pilots.
"In April 1926, Coleman and her mechanic, William Will, were practicing for a performance the next day. Will was piloting the plane, when it flipped over and started to dive. Coleman fell out of the plane and was killed. She is buried in Chicago's Lincoln Cemetery."

Avocet
"The Avocets are water birds which poke around in mud to get their food. They are a kind of bird which are often called ""waders""."
"The genus name ""Recurvirostra"" comes from Latin , 'curved backwards' and , 'bill'."
"Avocets sweep their long, thin, upcurved bills from side to side when feeding in the brackish or saline wetlands they prefer. Their plumage is pied (usually black and white), sometimes also with some red."
"Avocets have webbed feet and swim. Their diet consists of aquatic insects and other small creatures. Their favourite places are mudflats and estuaries. They walk around on the mud, sticking their bill into it and sweeping from side to side to find small prey."
Avocets have made a return to Britain. During WWII some land was allowed to return to its previous salt marsh condition. This was followed by the later development of nature reserves. Avocets now use the Titchfield Haven National Nature Reserve as a summer breeding ground.

"BlackRock was founded in 1988 by Larry Fink, Robert S. Kapito, Susan Wagner, Barbara Novick, Ben Golub, Hugh Frater, Ralph Schlosstein, and Keith Anderson. Their objective is to provide institutional clients with asset management services from a risk management perspective."
"By 1992, Blackstone had a stake equating to about 35% of the company, and Stephen A. Schwarzman and Fink were considering selling shares to the public. The firm adopted the name BlackRock, and was managing $17 billion in assets by the end of the year."
"Later Schwarzman remained with Blackstone, while Fink went on to become chairman and CEO of BlackRock Inc."

"At the end of 2014, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute reported that 65% of Blackrock's assets under management were made up of institutional investors."
Naval and air support.
"The Royal Navy would supply 237 ships and landing craft. However, pre-landing naval gunfire support was limited, consisting of six Hunt-class destroyers with 4-inch guns. The Royal Air Force would supply 74 squadrons of aircraft, of which 66 were fighter squadrons."
Intelligence.
"There was not much information about the beaches. There were German gun positions on the cliffs, but these had not been spotted. The planners thought that Dieppe is not heavily defended and that the beaches in are suitable for landing infantry, and armored fighting vehicles."
German forces.
The German forces at Dieppe were ready for the attack. They were warned by French double agents that the British were planning some action in the area. They had also detected increased radio talk and landing craft being gathered together in the southern British coastal ports.
"Dieppe and the cliffs were well defended. The 1,500 troops were"
"placed along the beaches of Dieppe and the nearby towns, covering all the likely landing places."
"The Germans had machine guns, mortars and artillery. The city and port was protected."
"The ""Luftwaffe"" forces were ""Jagdgeschwader 2"" (JG2) and ""Jagdgeschwader 26"" (JG26), with 200 fighters, mostly the Fw 190. There were about 100 bombers from ""Kampfgeschwader 2"" (KG2), ""Kampfgeschwader 45"" (KG45), and ""Kampfgeschwader 77"" (KG77), mostly Dornier 217s."
Initial landings.
The Allied fleet left the south coast of England on the night of 18 August 1942. The Canadians left from the Port of Newhaven. The fleet of eight destroyers and motor gun boats to protect the landing craft and motor launches were preceded by minesweepers that cleared paths through the English Channel for them.
The initial landings began at 04:50 on 19 August. There were attacks on the two artillery batteries on the sides of the main landing area.
"On their way in, the landing craft and escorts heading towards Puys and Berneval ran into a small German group of ships and exchanged fire at 03:48."
Yellow Beach.
The goal for Lieutenant Colonel John Durnford-Slater and No. 3 Commando was to do two landings east of Dieppe to destroy the coastal artillery battery near Berneval. The battery could fire upon the landing at Dieppe to the west.
"The craft carrying No. 3 Commando approached the coast to the east. They were not warned of the approach of a German convoy that had been found by British ""Chain Home"" radar stations at 21:30."
German S-boats escorting a German tanker torpedoed some of the landing craft and damaged the escorting Steam Gun Boat 5.
"Motor Launch 346 and Landing Craft Flak 1 fired on the German boats. The group got spread out, with some losses, and the enemy's coastal defences were alerted."
"Only 18 commandos got near the German artillery battery. They fired guns at the Germans. Although unable to destroy the artillery, it caused problems for the German artillery troops."
The commandos had to pull back because there were many enemy troops.
Orange Beach.
"The goal for Lieutenant Colonel Lord Lovat and No. 4 Commando (including 50 United States Army Rangers) was to do two landings west of Dieppe. They had to destroy the coastal artillery battery ""Hess"" at Blancmesnil-Sainte-Marguerite. Landing on the right side, they climbed the hill and attacked. They destroyed the artillery battery of six 150 mm guns. This was the only success of Operation ""Jubilee"". The commando then withdrew at 07:30 as planned."
"Most of No. 4 returned to England. This part of the raid was seen as a good example of how the Royal Marine Commando should attack during landings. Lord Lovat was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and Captain Patrick Porteous No. 4 Commando, was awarded the Victoria Cross."
Blue beach.
The naval battle between the small German convoy and the craft carrying No. 3 Commando had made the German defenders at Blue beach aware of the attack. The landing near Puys by the Royal Regiment of Canada plus three platoons from the Black Watch of Canada and an artillery group was ordered to destroy machine gun and artillery batteries protecting the Dieppe beach.
They were delayed by 20 minutes and the smoke that should have hidden their attack had lifted. The Germans were ready in their defensive positions for the landings. The well-fortified German forces fired guns at the Canadian forces that did land on the beach.
"As soon as they reached the shore, the Canadians found themselves unable to move forward. The Royal Regiment of Canada had many deaths. Of the 556 men in the regiment, 200 were killed and 264 captured."
Green beach.
"On Green beach at the same time that No. 4 Commando had landed, the South Saskatchewan Regiment went towards Pourville. They landed at 04:52 without being detected. The regiment managed to leave their landing craft before the Germans could start firing their guns."
"The regiment had to enter Pourville to cross the river by the only bridge. Before they managed to reach the bridge, the Germans had put machine guns and anti-tank guns there which stopped them. With dead and wounded Canadians lying on the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Cecil Ingersoll Merritt, the commanding officer, crossed the bridge several times. He wanted to show his soldiers that the bridge could be crossed. Lieutenant Colonel Merritt was awarded the Victoria Cross."

Style.
"The building is made of bricks and bush-hammered concrete, left exposed strongly influenced by the Rationalist Movement. It is in fact the parapets of the balconies that characterize the facades, through a skilful use of sandblasted bricks that draw geometries that are certainly functional, simple and precise, but not entirely alien to a certain taste for the reinterpretation of traditional elements such as ventilation grids, typical of Lombard farmhouses, to which many of Luigi Caccia Dominioni's contemporary linguistic choices for many Milanese condominiums also refer."
"Particular attention is paid to the construction detail, so much so that critics consider the condominium of Maffezzoli and Pellegrini an ""exercise of high design expertise and rare sensitivity""."

"""Puss in Boots"" is a fairy tale. It was written/recorded by Charles Perrault. The story is the classic ""animal as helper"" tale. It is about a cat who uses tricks and lies to gain power, money, and a princess in marriage for his lowborn master. The story first appeared in a handwritten manuscript in 1695 with four other tales by Perrault. It was published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. The book was a great success."
"A tale from Gianfrancesco Straparola's ""Le piacevoli notti"" () (1550-55) and another from Giambattista Basile's ""Pentamerone"" (1634) are similar to ""Puss in Boots"". Straparola's story was published in France in 1560. It may have influenced Perrault. ""Pentamerone"" was not published in France during Perrault's lifetime. It is not likely he knew Basile's tale."
Story.
"A miller dies. He leaves a cat to his youngest son. The cat requests a pair of boots. He tells the boy he will make his fortune. The cat makes friends with the king by bringing him wild game in the name of his master. One day, the king rescues the boy from drowning. He dresses him in clothes from his own wardrobe.

Stories or Tales of Past Times
"Stories or Tales from Past Times () is a collection of eight fairy tales by Charles Perrault. It was published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin. The collection is also known as ""Mother Goose's Tales"" (). The eight tales are ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"", ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""Bluebeard"", ""Puss in Boots"", ""Diamonds and Toads"", ""Cinderella"", ""Rickey with the Tuft"", and ""Hop o' My Thumb"". Later editions included three verse tales by Perrault: ""Griselda"", ""The Silly Wishes"", and ""Donkeyskin"". The stories have been translated into many languages.

Bluebeard
"""Bluebeard"" () is a fairy tale by Charles Perrault. It first appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript in 1695 titled ""Contes de ma mère l'oye"" (). The deluxe volume was intended for Mademoiselle, the 19-year-old niece of Louis XIV. It included four other tales by Perrault. ""Bluebeard"" was first published anonymously in January 1697 in Paris by Claude Barbin in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. The tale is about a cruel man who murders his wives so that he will inherit their wealth. He puts their corpses in a secret room opened only by a magic key."
"Jacque Barchilon believes the tale is original with Perrault because there are no close antecedants. The taboo of the forbidden room is found in eastern literature, and Barchilon writes that the tale has an ""Oriental character"". He points out that the French associated beards with Turkish fashions, and early illustrations depict Bluebeard wearing a turban-like headdress."
"Medieval murderer of children Gilles de Rais may have been the inspiration for the character of Bluebeard. De Rais was a Marshal of France and Joan of Arc's military companion. His victims (mostly young boys) were said to number 140. The Breton king Comorre the Cursed (c.500 AD) is another candidate. Tales similar to ""Bluebeard"" include ""The Fitcher's Bird"" by the Brothers Grimm and the English tale ""Mr. Fox""."
Story.
"A rich man has a blue beard which frightens young women. He has been married several times but no one knows what has happened to his wives. He woos two young sisters in the neighborhood but neither are inclined to consider marriage. He treats them to a lavish time in his country house. The younger sister decides to marry him. Shortly after the wedding (and before he travels to a far land on business), Bluebeard gives his wife the keys to his house. One key opens a door to a distant room. He forbids her to enter this room. He leaves and his wife opens the door to the forbidden room. Here she finds Bluebeard's former wives, all dead and lying on a floor covered with blood. She drops the key. It is magic and becomes stained with blood that cannot be washed away. Bluebeard returns. He discovers the blood-stained key and knows his wife has disobeyed his order. He tells her she will take her place among the dead. He grants her a few minutes to pray. She calls her sister Anne and asks her to go to the top of the tower to see if her brothers are on the road. After several tense moments, Anne reports seeing the men approaching. Bluebeard raises a cutlass to decapitate his wife. Her brothers burst into the room. They kill Bluebeard. Their sister is safe."

Criticism.
"Genetic changes in bacteria might result in antibiotic resistance. They might be acquired through spontaneous mutations (vertical gene transfer) or through other bacteria passing their genes (horizontal gene transfer). Self-medications or improper medication use can result in the emergence of resistant bacteria. It is difficult to obtain new antibiotics, that is why researchers seek to improve existing ones, as well as working to discover new drugs."

Randy Rhoads
"Randall William ""Randy"" Rhoads (December 6, 1956 – March 19, 1982) was an American heavy metal guitarist. He was best known for performing with Ozzy Osbourne and the band Quiet Riot."
Career.
Rhoads first formed a band with Kelly Garni called Little Women. Kevin DuBrow was recruited into the band and they changed their name to Quiet Riot. The band became popular by playing in clubs in Los Angeles. By late 1976 they were signed to CBS/Sony Records.
"Dana Strum contacted Rhoads to see if he was wanted to audition for Ozzy Osbourne's new band. He asked his mother if he should join Osbourne's band since he was still in Quiet Riot. She asked him if he would accept ""an offer like this one"" and Rhodes replied ""Of course!"""
"He went to audition in Osbourne's hotel room in Los Angeles with his guitar and a practice amplifier. As he started getting ready he was given the job. Osbourne was very drunk, and had fallen asleep during the audition. Rhoads remembered later, ""I just tuned up and did some riffs, and he said, 'You've got the gig'; I had the weirdest feeling, because I thought, 'You didn't even hear me yet'""."
"Rhoads flew to England on the November 27, 1979. He stayed with Osbourne, his wife at the time Thelma, and their two children. After a short while, Lee Kerslake joined the band, which was at the time called The Blizzard of Ozz. The band recorded their debut album ""Blizzard of Ozz"" which was released on September 20, 1980 and became a success. ""Diary of a Madman"", their second studio album, was recorded between February and March 1981. It was released on November 7, 1981."
Death.
"Rhoads died on March 19, 1982. He was touring with his band at the time. While driving in their tour bus, the band stopped in Leesburg, Florida, to fix the bus' air conditioner. Osbourne stayed asleep because he had been drinking heavily earlier in the evening. While stopped, their driver Andrew Aycock noticed an airstrip with small helicopters and planes. Aycock had previously worked as a commercial pilot. He decided to take a small Beechcraft F35 plane registered to a man named Mike Partin. He took it without Partin's permission. He took keyboardist Don Airey and tour manager Jake Duncan for a flight. He took Rhoads and makeup artist Rachel Youngblood on for the second flight. Aycock tried to fly the plane very low over their tour bus, where the other band members were sleeping. He made two close passes but caused an accident on the third one. One of the plane's wings had clipped the top of the tour bus. This broke the wing into two parts and sent the plane spiraling out of control. Both Rhoads and Youngblood were thrown out of the plane's windshield by the initial impact. While traveling at about , the plane crashed into a nearby garage. All three passengers were killed instantly. They were burned beyond recognition from the fire of the plane. The only person to witness the accident was keyboardist Don Airey."

Iran–Contra affair
"The Iran-Contra affair was a scandal that happened from August 1985 to March 1987. The scandal involved the United States Government selling weapons to Iran in exchange for hostages and to fund the Nicaraguan Contras. It happened under President Ronald Reagan's government. When 1,500 missiles were shipped three hostages were released but those three hostages were soon replaced with three more hostages. Secretary of State George Shultz called it “a hostage Bazaar”"
Oliver North was tried in court for the affair because he took the blame instead of Reagan. The court found North to be not guilty.
"On March 4, 1987, Reagan himself apologized to the American people and said it was all his fault. George H. W. Bush later pardoned anyone who was involved in the affair."
"While President Ronald Reagan was a supporter of the Contra cause, the evidence is unclear as to whether he knew about the scandal."
"God Korouhanba has connection with Mangang Luwang Khuman, the three divine teachers in many legends."
Namesakes.
Martial Arts Club.
"The Ibudhou Korouhanba Thang-Ta Moidangpok is a club of Thang Ta, a martial art form of the Meitei ethnicity. This martial arts association was a leading participant in the 31st State Thang Ta Championship in the year 2021."
Microcredit
"A microcredit (sometimes called a micro-loan, or microloan) is a special kind of loan given to poor business people, mostly in developing countries. Microcredits were created to support entrepreneurship, and to lessen poverty. Very often, people getting a microcredit are illiterate: they cannot fill out forms to apply for a regular loan. Microcredits also work differently: the interest ot be paid is usually much higher than with a regular loan, often it is over 20%. The interest usually also has to be paid more often. Microcredits have been criticized, because people taking them often end up in a situation where they cannot repay their debt."
Taoroinai
Taoroinai ()() is a snake like dragon in Meitei mythology and religion. It lived in the land of the moon.
"According to the Shakok Lamlen, the Kangla was constructed over the navel of Taoroinai."
Mythology.
Taoroinai from the moon to the earth.
"According to the Sanggai Phammang, Taoroinai lived on the moon. He was ordered by God Atiya to carry on His image to the earth. He swallowed the image of the God in his mouth. He brought it down. He came down with the image. He lived inside the earth. The God's image was later born as a divine boy."
Taoroinai and the Heavenly egg.
"According to the Leithak Leikharol and the Krathok Lamlen, Taoroinai went to the Heaven pretending to be ""Tupu"" (officer in charge). He found the divine cloud egg (nonglum) of Atiya. He brought it down to earth. He gave the egg to a person with many husbands. Later, the egg became Pakhangba."
"According to the Meihourol Makok Latam, God Atiya wanted to create an earthly king from his own body. He asked goddess Leimarel Sidabi to call Taoroinai. Leimaren asked Taoroinai to bring the image of God Atiya in the shape of Nonglum (cloud egg). The Goddess Leimaren received the heavenly egg containing another God. After this, Leimaren was also called Yaibirok ()."
"According to the Leimaren Naoyom, Taoroinai gave an embryonic egg to Leimarel Sidabi, a solar goddess (or a celestial goddess). Later, goddess Leimaren (alias Yaibirok) gave birth to Pakhangba."
Taoroinai and the solar sperm.
"According to the Pakhangba Nonggarol, Taoroinai brought a God from the centre of the Sun as a sperm inside his body after the completion of the creation of the universe. He gave it to goddess Leinung Yaipirok (alias Leimarel Sidabi)."
Taoroinai and the Kangla.
"The ""Thon Talet Thonlanmei"" shows the seven layers of the Royal Palace in the Kangla. It shows the gradual evolution of the mankind. According to the illustration, the mankind ascended from the lowest form to the highest form. The forms are (1) fish, (2) snake, (3) tortoise, (4) boar, (5) cow, (6) elephant and (7) man and finally Taoroinai. Taoroinai is shown as the ultimate form of life."
"According to the Kangla Houba (alias the Kanglalon) written by Ashangbam Laiba in the 5th century, Meitei King Naophangba attempted to construct a new palace in the Kangla. The king's plan was rejected by 13 year old Maichou Ashangbam Laiba. During that time, blood gushed out of the holes of the erecting pillars. It was believed that the erecting pillars struck the body of God Taoroinai. So, the King requested Ashangbam Laiba to rectify the pillar position. Laiba did as requested. Later, without any chaos, a seven storied palace building was able to be constructed in the Kangla."
Taoroinai's dance.
"According to the Anoirol, Lady Toibi Tanka Nubi (alias Tankha Chanu) danced with her father Taoroinai. She learned how to dance from Taoroinai step by step and movement by movement. They danced together. Other living beings also imitated their way of dancing. It was performed to celebrate happiness of the removal of the Lingkam Laikam curse. The curse was removed by the ancestors."
"Seven maidens namely Tankha, Phuitingwak, Khuyon, Phuitingloubi, Toura, Nongdang and Lengbi and nine gods learned how to dance from Dragon Father Taoroinai. The rhythmic and smooth dancing of the maidens surprised all the creatures of the world. All the creatures came out and started to dance. The movements of Lady Tankha Chanu resembled that of the snake. Her steps destroyed all the plants and the flowers on her way. It is believed that the place of her enactment of the dance is the Mahou Phaibok hill."
"Seeing the daughter-father dance, a male squirrel imitated their dance. Seeing him dancing, a female squirrel also danced. The son squirrel laughed at his mother squirrel. At this, the female squirrel was embarrassed. The dancing squirrels were later joined by other creatures. And so, the dance never ended."

In Meitei language (Manipuri language), ""Leima"" means ""Queen"". In Meitei language (Manipuri language), ""Lairembi"" () means ""goddess"". The Meitei language (Manipuri language) word ""Lairemma"" () is also another term for ""goddess""."
"The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) is an African-American civil rights group. The SCLC was very important in the Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King, Jr. was its first president."
"Today, the SCLC says it is ""a nonprofit, non-sectarian, inter-faith, advocacy organization that is committed to nonviolent action to achieve social, economic, and political justice."" This means the group is open to people of all faiths and religions, not just Christians."
Creation.
"The SCLC was created in 1957, after the Civil Rights Movement's successful Montgomery Bus Boycott. On January 10, 1957, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. invited about 60 black pastors and leaders to Atlanta, Georgia. Their goal, at the time, was to end segregation on buses in the Southern United States. However, they agreed that they would only use non-violent ways of protesting and trying to make change. Their motto was: ""Not one hair on one head of one white person shall be harmed."""
"About a month later, the group met again in New Orleans, Louisiana. They decided that their goal would be to end segregation everywhere not just on buses. They also chose Dr. King as their president, and chose the name ""Southern Christian Leadership Conference."""
"The SCLC also chose a group of leaders called the Board of Directors to be in charge of making final decisions and planning strategies. At first, some churches and civil rights organizations joined the SCLC. However, it was difficult to get churches to join. Groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens' Council used violence and terrorism to attack civil rights activists. So did the police in many states. Some churches which joined the SCLC, or did civil rights work, were bombed or set on fire."
Activities.
Citizenship Schools.
"In 1954, civil rights activists started ""Citizenship Schools."" These schools taught African-American adults to read so they could get driver's licenses; fill out forms; open bank accounts; and pass literacy tests that only black people had to pass to sign up to vote. The program spread across the South. They called themselves the ""Highlander Folk School."""
"In 1961, the state of Tennessee took the Highlander Folk School's land and property away. In that year, the SCLC rescued the Citizenship School program. The Schools' teachers pretended to be teaching adults to read. Secretly, they were teaching about democracy, civil rights, leadership, getting people together to protest, politics, and protest strategies. All of these things would be very important in the Civil Rights Movement."
"Eventually, close to 69,000 teachers taught Citizenship Schools throughout the South. Most of these teachers were volunteers who were not paid. Many of the Civil Rights Movement's adult leaders went to or taught Citizenship Schools."

Chivalric romance
"Chivalric romances are stories, poems or songs. They were written about marvel-filled adventures. Knights having heroic qualities went on quests. It is the emphasis on love and courtly manners which distinguishes it from other kinds of epic. Other types of epic are about masculine military heroism."
Romances were written in European languages of the Middle Ages.
"The best known romance was King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" is another example."
Comet Swift–Tuttle
Comet Swift–Tuttle (109P/Swift–Tuttle) is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 133 years. It fits the classical definition of a Halley-type comet with a period between 20 and 200 years. It was independently discovered by Lewis Swift and Horace Parnell Tuttle in July 1862. It has a well-known orbit and has a comet nucleus 26 km in diameter.
"Chinese records show that in 188 AD the comet reached apparent magnitude 0.1. In 1862, the comet was as bright as Polaris. The comet made a return appearance in 1992, and became visible with binoculars. In 2126 it will be a bright naked-eye comet reaching about apparent magnitude 0.7."
"It is the parent body of the Perseid meteor shower, perhaps the best known shower and among the most reliable in performance."
Near-Earth orbit.
"A close encounter with Earth is predicted for the comet's return to the inner Solar System in the year 4479, around Sept. 15; the closest approach is estimated to be 0.03–0.05 AU, with a probability of impact of 1, or 0.0001%."
"Comet Swift–Tuttle has been described as ""the single most dangerous object known to humanity"". However, the probability of Earth impact per orbit is about a million to one against. It is estimated as 2 (0.000002%). It is the largest Solar System object that makes repeated close approaches to Earth with a relative velocity of 60 km/s."
An unusual aspect of its orbit is that it is captured into a 1:11 orbital resonance with Jupiter; it completes one orbit for every 11 of Jupiter.
"Throughout modern times, the largest known prime number has very often been a Mersenne prime. Most sources restrict the term ""Mersenne number"" to where ""n"" is prime, as all Mersenne primes must be of this form as seen below."
"Mersenne primes have a close connection to perfect numbers, which are numbers equal to the sum of their proper divisors. Historically, the study of Mersenne primes was motivated by this connection; in the 4th century BC Euclid demonstrated that if ""M"" is a Mersenne prime then ""M""(""M""+1)/2 is a perfect number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that all even perfect numbers have this form. No odd perfect numbers are known, and it is suspected that none exist (If it exist, it would have to be greater than 101500)."
"It is currently unknown if there is an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Most mathematicians who have studied the question think there are an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Carl Pomerance, Samuel S. Wagstaff Jr. and Hendrik Lenstra developed a formula which they think should say about how many Mersenne primes there are under a given number."
"The binary representation of 2""n"" - 1 is ""n"" repetitions of the digit 1."
"For example, 2""5"" - 1 = 11111 in binary."
"The first four Mersenne primes were known by the Ancient Greeks. They are 3, 7, 31 and 127. The next, 8191, was discovered in 1456. Some people like trying to find big primes. Since there are tricks and algorithms to finding Mersenne primes quickly, the largest known primes are also Mersenne primes."
"As of December 21, 2018, 51 Mersenne primes have been found. The largest known prime is a Mersenne prime, formula_1."
Super Monkey Ball
"Super Monkey Ball is a platform video game. It was developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega. It was first released in Japan in January 2001 as an arcade game titled ""Monkey Ball"". It had a joystick in the shape of a banana. It was later released worldwide as a launch title for the Nintendo GameCube. Titled ""Super Monkey Ball"", it was released in Japan on September 4, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, and in Europe on May 3, 2002."
Gameplay.
"""Super Monkey Ball"" has three modes of gameplay: Main game, party games and mini-games."
Main game.
"In the main game, the object is to guide a monkey in a hamster ball across a series of platforms in the air and through a goal at the end of the level. Four monkeys are available for the player to play as. Each level is timed; with a level running for either 30 or 60 seconds. The player controls the main game with the GameCube controller's control stick. By moving the stick, the whole level moves, and the ball rolls in the direction that the level moves. Each level has bananas that the player can collect. Bananas give the player points, and collecting a certain amount of them gives the player an extra life. Should the player fall off of the level or the timer reaches zero, the player loses a life. There are three main difficulties: Beginner, Advanced and Expert. Beginner is ten easy levels, Advanced is 30 non-easy levels, and Expert is 50 harder levels. Should the player meet a certain condition after completing a difficulty, they will be able to play the difficulty's ""extra"" levels. A fourth difficulty level, Master, can be unlocked by completing the Expert and Expert Extra levels without using a continue. Master is the hardest difficulty level, with ten levels."
Party games.
"There are three party games: Monkey Race, Monkey Target and Monkey Fight. In Monkey Race, players race on one of several racing levels, competing for the best rank. In Monkey Target, players roll their monkey down a ramp and open the monkey's ball to fly in order to land on one of several islands. Three levels are available to play on. In Monkey Fight, players punch other monkeys for points. When time runs out, whichever monkey has the most points wins."
Mini-games.
"There are three minigames that can to be unlocked with points gotten in the main game: Monkey Bowling, Monkey Billiards and Monkey Golf. Each minigame is based on the real life sport."
Prudence Crandall
"Prudence Crandall (September 3, 1803 – January 28, 1890) was an American teacher. She was born on September 3, 1803 to Quakers. She went to the New England Friends’ Boarding School in Providence, Rhode Island. In October 1831, she opened a private girls’ school in Canterbury, Connecticut. In 1833, an African American girl was admitted to the school. The parents of the white girls in the school wanted the black girl expelled. Crandall refused. She opened a school for African American girls in April 1833."
"The Connecticut legislature passed the ""Black Law"". This law made it illegal to open a school that taught African American pupils from a state other than Connecticut. Crandall was arrested, tried, and convicted of violating this law. She was put in jail. A higher court reversed the decision. Crandall was freed, but neighbors harassed her. They smashed the windows in the school. Crandall feared for the students’ safety. She closed the school in 1834."
"Crandall married Baptist minister and abolitionist Calvin Philleo. In 1835, the couple and his three children left Connecticut for Philleo’s farm in New York State. They later moved to Illinois. Here Crandall ran a school from her home. She also took part in women’s rights activities. When Philleo died in 1874, Prudence moved to Kansas to live with her brother. In 1886, the Connecticut legislature gave her a pension. Crandall died on January 28, 1890. She was buried in Kansas. Her old school house in Canterbury is now the Prudence Crandall Museum. In 1995, Crandall was named Connecticut's state heroine."
Nicko McBrain
"Michael Henry ""Nicko"" McBrain (born 5 June 1952) is an English heavy metal musician. He is the drummer of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden."
"During his early year, McBrain played for a few small pub bands and paid his bills with session work he did when he left school. He has also played in Streetwalkers, Trust and with Pat Travers. He joined Iron Maiden in 1982 and debuted on their fourth studio album, ""Piece of Mind""."
He currently uses Premier drums and Paiste cymbals. He converted to Christianity in 1999 after he had an experience in the Spanish River Church.
Kataklysm
"Kataklysm are a Canadian death metal band from Montreal, Quebec."
"Kataklysm was formed in 1991. The band released their debut studio album ""Sorcery"" on February 10, 1995 and their second full-length album on June 26, 1996. Lead singer Sylvain Houde left the band afterwards and Maurizio Iacono took over the lead vocals. Stephane Barbe was also recruited to the band during this time. Their third album ""Victims of this Fallen World"" which was released on March 7, 1998, saw a change in musical style from Kataklysm's previous albums. They returned to their former style when they released ""The Prophecy (Stigmata of the Immaculate)"" but it was less chaotic and with a little bit of thrash metal."

Abortion laws
"Abortion laws specify under what circumstances a woman can get an abortion. Getting an abortion means that the pregnancy is ended early, without the birth of a child. These laws vary widely, by country, and sometimes by area. They have also changed over time."
"As of 2022, about 60% of the people live in a country that allows abortion, under some circumstances. When abortion is legal, it may mean that only part of the reasons are recognized, or that it is only legal for part of the pregnany."
Options for regulation.
"Generally, there are the following options, from the most liberal, to the most restrictive, when a pregancy can be ended:"
Common reasons for allowing an abortion:
Discussions about abortion.
"Abortion is a controversial subject in many societies: People argue in favor or arganist it, using argumrnts from religion, moral and ethical values, or practical or political reasons. Note that legally outlawing abortions will not stop people from getting an abortion: They may get an unsafe abortion, which is riskier than a legal abortion. A study done in 2007 found that abortion rates were similar in countries where abortion was legal, and those countries where it wasn't. Very often, people get an abortion, because they do not have easy access to modern contraceptives. According to the same study, the number of abortions is decreasing, because contraceptives are more commonly available."
Timeline.
"The table below lists in chronological order the United Nations member states that have legalized abortion on request in at least some initial part of the pregnancy, or that have fully decriminalized abortion. As of July 2022, 65 countries have legalized or decriminalized abortion on request."
"Where a country has legalized abortion on request, prohibited it, and legalized it again (e.g., former Soviet Union, Romania), only the later year is included. Countries that result from the merger of states where abortion on request was legal at the moment of unification show the year when it became legal across the whole national territory (e.g., Germany, Vietnam). Similarly, countries where not all subnational jurisdictions have legalized abortion on request are not included (e.g., leading to the exclusion of Australia, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States). Countries are counted even if they were not yet independent at the time. The year refers to when the relevant law or judicial decision came into force, which may be different from the year when it was approved."
Johann Adolf Hasse
"Johann Adolf Hasse (also spelled Johann Adolph Hasse; baptised 25 March 1699 16 December 1783) was a German composer, singer, and music teacher. He was an important opera composer in the 18th century."
Life.
Early career.
"Hasse was born in Bergedorf, near Hamburg. His father and grandfather were organists. He studied in Hamburg from 1714 to 1717. In 1718 he joined the Hamburg State Opera. He was a tenor singer. In 1719, he started working in Brunswick. He performed operas written by Georg Schürmann, Francesco Conti and Antonio Caldara. His own opera, ""Antioco"", was performed in Brunswick in 1721. It is his only opera which is written in the German language."
"He might have left Germany in 1722. He went to Naples. In Naples, he converted (changed his religion) to Catholicism. He studied writing music and counterpoint with Alessandro Scarlatti. Hasse's first opera in Italy was ""Il Sesotrate"". It was performed on 13 May 1726. The opera was a success. It made him a famous composer and musician."
Dresden and Venice.
"In 1730 Hasse visited Venice. He married Faustina Bordoni, an opera singer. His opera ""Artaserse"" was performed there. It was his first opera which uses Metastasio's text. The opera was a success."
"He became the ""Kapellmeister"" of the Dresden court in around 1730. He arrived at Dresden in 1731. His employer was King August II of Poland. He wrote operas and church music in Dresden. In Dresden, he wrote the opera ""Cleofide"". The opera uses text by Metastasio. Johann Sebastian Bach and his son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach may have watched the opera's first performance. On the next day, Bach performed on the organ. Hasse might have watched Bach play the organ. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach said that his father and Hasse were good friends."
"As part of his job, Hasse did not have to stay in Dresden. From 1733 to 1734 he stayed in Italy. He wrote music for the Ospedale degli Incurabili, an orphanage in Venice. He also went to Vienna. He taught Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria how to sing. Hasse came back to Dresden in December 1733. He wrote new operas. He also wrote some church music. In 1734, the king of Poland went to Warsaw. Hasse went back to Italy. He stayed in Italy until 1737."
"He went back to Dresden in 1740. He wrote the operas ""Antigono"" and ""Ipermestra"". The text for these operas were written by Metastasio. Hasse and Metastasio became good friends. They wrote many operas together."
"In 1904, Lorentz showed that electrical and magnetic fields can be modified into each other through the Lorentz transformations."
"In 1905, Einstein published his article introducing special relativity, ""On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"", in ""Annalen der Physik"". In this article, he presented the postulates of relativity, derived the Lorentz transformations from them, and (unaware of Lorentz's 1904 article) also showed how the Lorentz Transformations affect electric and magnetic fields."
"Later in 1905, Einstein published another article presenting ""E"" = ""mc""2."
"In 1908, Max Planck endorsed Einstein's theory and named it ""relativity"". In that same year, Hermann Minkowski gave a famous speech on ""Space and Time"" in which he showed that relativity is self-consistent and further developed the theory. These events forced the physics community to take relativity seriously. Relativity came to be more and more accepted after that."
"In 1912, Einstein and Lorentz were nominated for the Nobel prize in physics due to their pioneering work on relativity. Unfortunately, relativity was so controversial then, and remained controversial for such a long time that a Nobel prize was never awarded for it."

Lilly Pulitzer
"Lillian Pulitzer Rousseau (Lillian Lee McKim; November 10, 1931 – April 7, 2013), better known as Lilly Pulitzer, was an American fashion designer and socialite. She is known for founding Lilly Pulitzer, Inc., which makes clothes with bright, colorful patterns. Because the brand has been very popular with rich people, Lilly has been called the ""Queen of Prep""."
Personal life.
"""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"", also sung as ""Buddy, Can You Spare a Dime?"", is one of the best-known American songs of the Great Depression. Written in 1931 by lyricist E. Y. ""Yip"" Harburg and composer Jay Gorney, ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"" was part of the 1932 musical ""New Americana;"" the melody is based on a Russian lullaby Gorney heard as a child. It became best known, however, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. Both versions were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts. The Brunswick Crosby recording became the best-selling record of its period, and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era."
Summary.
"The song asks why the men who built the nation – built the railroads, built the skyscrapers – who fought in the war (World War I), who tilled the earth, who did what their nation asked of them should, now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary, find themselves abandoned, in bread lines."
Musical structure.
"The song has unusual structure for a Broadway song. Firstly, rather than starting in a major key, as most Broadway songs do, it begins in a minor key, which is darker, and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past and building the railroads, the song jumps an octave and moves briefly into a major key, evoking energy and optimism. It then reverts to a minor key in the word ""time"" in the line ""Once I built a railroad, made it run / Made it race against time,"" marking the end of prosperous times, and changing to a wistful mood. The song then ends, not on a note of resignation, but with anger – repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs), an octave higher, but with a significant change: the friendly """"Brother,"" can you spare a dime?"" is replaced with the aggressive """"Buddy,"" can you spare a dime?"""
Update.
"During the bad times in the 1970s, the ""New York Times"" asked Harburg to update ""Brother"" for a new age, and he responded with:"
Schwarz-Weiß Bregenz
SC Schwarz-Weiß Bregenz is an Austrian football club from Vorarlbergs capital Bregenz.
History.
"The club was founded in 1919 under the name FC Bregenz. The club colours were black and white. Till 1927 they only played friendly matches versus teams from Germany and Switzerland. In 1927 they played for the first time in Vorarlbergs league. Already 1928 they became Vorarlbergs champion. 1938, after the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany they formed with other teams from the region the Bezirksklasse Bodensee-Vorarlberg. Due to the Second World War the league was dissolved in 1942."
"After the War FC Bregenz was refounded under the name SC Schwarz-Weiß Bregenz. They reached the highest level of Austrian football, the Staatsliga,for the first time in 1954 but was relegated the same season. Till 1999 the club played under different names in the second level of Austrians league. 1999 they were promoted to the Austrian Bundesliga, where they played till the 2004/05 season. At this time they were relegated to the Erste Liga, the second level. Due to financial problems they could not get the licence and the club declare bankruptcy. For the young players a new club was founded, SC Bregenz. Although it is legally a new club the supporters saw it as replacement of the old club. Since 2007 this club plays in the Regionalliga West (3rd level)."
River Shannon
"The River Shannon is the longest river in Ireland. It runs mainly in a north/south direction, dividing Ireland geographically between east and west. It is thought to rise in Shannon Pot in County Cavan, and enters the sea in the Shannon Estuary at Limerick. The river represents a major physical barrier between east and west."

"Moulins is a ""commune"" in the Allier department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in central France."
"It is the ""préfecture"" (capital) of the department and the historical capital of the old province of ""Bourbonnais"" (the Duchy of Bourbonnais)."
History.
"Moulins experienced its golden age in the 15th century, when the Dukes of Bourbon lived in the city on the Allier river. The region of the northern Massif Central where is Moulins is called the ""Bourbonnais"" after the House of Bourbon."
Moulins became the capital of Allier on 4 March 1790 with the creation of the departments in France.
Reception.
"""Grand Theft Auto IV"" was praised for having more realistic graphics and story."
Secure Digital card
"A Secure Digital card (SD card) is a kind of memory card. Such cards are often used to store images or data in digital cameras. As of 2008, different capacities between 4 megabytes and 32 gigabytes have been made. The card has a rectangular design, but one edge is ""chipped off"". This means that the cards cannot be inserted into the cameras (or other devices) the wrong way."
There are different kinds of cards:
"SD and SDHC are not compatible, but devices that accept SDHC also accept SD cards. The interface of SDHC and SDXC cards is the same, but SDXC uses a different file system. Some devices (for example the Wii) that originally shipped only with support for SD can be made to support SDHC with a firmware update."
"There are also different ""classes"". These refer to the read and write speeds. Currently in use are ""Class 2"" - which means 2 MBytes/second, ""Class 4"" - 4 MB/sec and ""Class 6"" at 6 MB/sec. The problem with this is that different manufacturers measure different things with it, some measure write speeds, others read speeds. There are also differences because some give guarantees, and others simply say that the speeds they indicate are the maximum achievable under good conditions."
"Still another measurement is called ""rating"". A rating of 1 corresponds to 150 KBytes per second, the read speed of a CD. That way, a class 2 is equal to a speed of 13x."
microSD cards do the same thing but are much smaller.

"The genus Rhinoceros of the family Rhinocerotidae includes the one-horned rhinoceroses, of which there are two extant species: the Indian rhinoceros (""R. unicornis"") and the Javan rhinoceros (""R. sondaicus""). These are characterized by one horn (actually thickly matted hair) on the upper snout."
Sumatran rhinoceros
"The Sumatran Rhinoceros (""Dicerorhinus sumatrensis"") is a member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one of five extant rhinoceroses. It is the smallest rhinoceros, standing about 120–145 centimetres (3.9–4.8 ft) high at the shoulder, with a body length of 250 centimetres (98 in) and weight of 500–800 kilograms (1100–1760 lb)."
"The Sumatran rhinoceros is a small, hairy rhinoceros which survives in limited numbers in pockets of Indonesian and Malaysian rain forests. Only three institutions showcase Sumatran rhinos, the Cincinnati Zoo, the Los Angeles Zoo, and the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Borneo."
"Joint resolution 39 was passed by the House of Representatives in 1911 proposing a constitutional amendment to directly elect US Senators. The Senate accepted the resolution but since it included a change, it went back to the House. The amended Joint resolution was sent to the states for ratification a year later. The required three-quarters of the states ratified the amendment and the Seventeenth Amendment became official on April 8, 1913."
Clauses.
Clause 1.
"The people of the United States are to elect two Senators from each state, for six years. Each Senator will have one vote in the Senate. There are 100 Senators and 100 votes. ""The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures"" means that anyone who can vote in a state election in their state, may also vote for a Senator. In the archaic language of the Constitution this was written in such a way to allow for states having different qualifications for persons eligible to vote for their Senator."
Clause 2.
"The clause. Previously, when vacancies occurred, several state legislatures were not able to agree on who would fill the position. Before the Seventeenth Amendment, vacancies could last for months and even years in some cases. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, if a Senator dies or has to leave office, his state governor may appoint a temporary Senator until a special election can be held."
Clause 3.
"This is a simple addition to prevent the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment from interrupting the election or term of any Senator chosen before the amendment was passed. The United States Senate elections, 1914 were the first nationwide popular elections for Senators."

Flint water crisis
"The Flint water crisis is a drinking water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan which began in April 2014. When the city changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water to the Flint River, it created a serious public health danger."
"In Flint, between 6,000 and 12,000 children have been exposed to drinking water with high levels of lead. They may experience serious health problems. The water change is also a possible cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that has killed 10 people in the county."
"On January 5, 2016, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency for Flint. President Barack Obama declared a federal state of emergency. He authorized additional help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security almost two weeks later."
Legionnaires' disease
"Legionnaires' disease is a form of pneumonia caused by any type of ""Legionella"" bacteria. Over 90% of cases are caused by ""Legionella pneumophila""."
"The length of time between exposure to the bacteria and the appearance of symptoms is generally two to ten days. It can be as much as 20 days. People with Legionnaires' usually have fever, chills, and a cough. Some also have muscle aches, headache, tiredness, loss of appetite, diarrhea or vomiting."
People of any age may have Legionnaires' disease. It is most common in middle aged and older people.

COVID-19 pandemic
"The COVID-19 pandemic, also called the coronavirus pandemic, is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of September 4, 2022, more than 600 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in almost every country on Earth. More than six million people have died of COVID-19, and more than 580 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease."
"The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing or sneezing. It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech, followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining."
"The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats. This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin. It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. It possibly originated at a wet market, Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic."
Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.
"In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people."
"25 other vaccines have been approved by at least one country, and many others are being developed."
"The United States has the most deaths from the virus. More than 1,000,000 Americans have died from the virus. California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country."
Epidemiology.
Epidemiology is the study of how diseases affect the health and illness of groups of people.
Background.
"On 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020."
"On 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends."
Cases.
Cases means the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive. These cases are according to Johns Hopkins University.
"The high-altitude ""Polylepis"" forests and woodlands are found in the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees are called Queñua, Yagual and other names. They grow at altitudes of above sea level. It is still unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the Incan time. Regardless, in modern times the clearance has had a faster pace, and the trees are now endangered. Some think as little as 10% of the original woodland is still here."
Wildlife.
"The Andes has a lot of wildlife. With almost 1,000 species, of which about 2/3 are endemic to the region, the Andes is the most important region in the world for amphibians."
"Animal diversity in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of mammals (13% endemic), more than 1,700 species of birds (1/3 endemic), more than 600 species of reptiles (45% endemic), and almost 400 species of fish (1/3 endemic)."
"The Vicuña and Guanaco can be found living in the Altiplano, while the closely related domesticated Llama and Alpaca are commonly kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool. The nocturnal chinchillas, two threatened members of the rodent order, live in the Andes' alpine regions. The Andean Condor, the largest bird of its kind in the Western Hemisphere, lives throughout much of the Andes but mostly in very low numbers. Other animals found in the mostly open habitats of the high Andes are the huemul, cougar, and foxes in the genus ""Pseudalopex"". And for birds, some species of tinamous (they are members of the genus ""Nothoprocta""), are the Andean Goose, Giant Coot, flamingos (mainly associated with hypersaline lakes), Lesser Rhea, Andean Flicker, Diademed Sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches."
Meal
"A meal is a serving of food eaten by human beings. Meals usually include several different types of food, such as grains, vegetables, fruit, and in some cases, meat. Meals have different names by time they are taken or by the type of food that is eaten."
Types.
"In North America and in Europe, people usually eat three meals a day. The morning meal is called breakfast. It usually includes foods made from grain (cereal, porridge, or bread), fruit (apple, banana, or an orange), and milk products (milk, yogurt, or cottage cheese). Many people drink coffee or tea with their breakfast."
"Around noon, people eat their lunch. People who are working at jobs are given a break to eat their lunch. The lunch meal includes foods such as a sandwich, soup, vegetables, fruit, and milk. In some countries, such as Italy, people serve an alcoholic drink with lunch. In England, some people have a glass of beer with their lunch."
"In the evening, people eat their supper or dinner. Dinners are different in different countries. Usually dinners include a ""main course"" such as roast beef, a grain (such as rice or pasta), a vegetable (such as carrots or cauliflower) and a dessert (called a ""sweet"" or ""pudding"" in England)."
"In some cases, a starter or appetizer is served before the dinner. Appetizers are a small serving of food such as olives, cheese, or bread. In many countries, people serve an alcoholic drink with dinner, such as wine or beer."
Leipzig
"Leipzig (Upper Saxon: ""Leibzsch"" or ""Leibz'sch"") is the biggest city in the state of Saxony (eastern Germany). When Germany was divided into East and West Germany, Leipzig was one of the three biggest industrial cities in the East Germany."
"Leipzig occupies and is still an industrial city. 510,651 people are living in Leipzig as of 29 February 2008."
History.
"Its Latin name is ""Lipsia"" and the German name ""Leipzig"" came from this name. Leipzig has a long history. Its name was first recorded as Leipzig Castle (Leipziger Burg) in 1015, and the official founding of the city occurred later in 1165. It was an economic center of , famous with its market (Leipziger Messe)."
"In 1409, was started. Theology was its major faculty. In 1519, Martin Luther had a discussion in Leipzig against . Reformation came to Leipzig in 1539 and the city people became Lutheran."
"It is famous for , where Johann Sebastian Bach worked as music director (Kantor) from 1723 until his death in 1750."
"In 1813 near Leipzig, the Battle of Leipzig was fought between the French army led by Napoleon Bonaparte and the allied armies of Austria, Prussia and Russia."
"In 1839, the railway between Dresden and Leipzig was opened. It was the first long distance railroad in Germany."
"As a result of industrialization, the number of people living in Leipzig grew during the 19th century. Before World War II, there were about 750,000 people in Leipzig."
"After the war, Leipzig belonged to the part of Germany occupied by the Soviet Union, and later to East Germany."
"In 1989, the took place in Leipzig. Every monday after a Christian mess in the the Leipzig people demonstrate for freedom to travel and democracy. These demonstrations became bigger and bigger and reached their peak on 23 October when 320,000 people came. The demonstrations are one of the things that lead to the end of communist dictatorship in East Germany."
"Today, Leipzig is still known as a city of fairs, media and university, but is less important than it was before World War II."
Economy.
"Before World War II, Leipzig was a famous center of commerce (Leipzig exhibition) and industry. Now, there are big companies in Leipzig like Porsche, BMW, Siemens and DHL, as well as the ."

Geography.
Spaghetti squash
"The spaghetti squash (""Cucurbita pepo"") is an oblong seed-bearing variety of winter squash. The fruit can range either from ivory to yellow or orange in color. The orange varieties have a higher carotene content. Its center contains many large seeds. Its flesh is bright yellow or orange. When raw, the flesh is solid and similar to other raw squash; when cooked, the flesh falls away from the fruit in ribbons or strands like spaghetti."
Nutrition.
"It is a superfood that contains lots of nutrients, including folic acid, potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin C, It is low in calories, averaging at least 42 calories per 1-cup (155 grams) serving."
Burning bush
"The Burning Bush is an object described in the Book of Exodus. It was said to be on Mount Horeb. According to the narrative, the bush was on fire, but was not consumed (all burned up) by the flames. This is the reason for the name given to the bush. In the narrative, the ""burning bush"" is where Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and into Canaan."
Liana
Lianas are vines which live in rainforests. They are climbing plants which wrap around trees.
Doctors of the Church
"Doctor of the Church (from Latin """", to teach) is a title used in some Christian churches. It is given to people who are recognized as having been of particular importance, especially in their contribution to theology or doctrine. In the Catholic Church, this title is given to a saint who has written important works. The honour is given rarely, and only after canonisation. Saint Ambrose (330-397), Saint Augustine of Hippo (53-430), Saint Jerome, and Pope Gregory I are known as the Four Great Doctors (of the Western Church). In the Eastern Church, these are John Chrysostom, Saint Basil of Caesarea (or Basil the Great), Gregory of Nazianzus and Athanasius of Alexandria. Other Doctros of the Church incliude Thomas Aquinas, Anselm of Canterbury, Teresa of Ávila, Thérèse of Lisieux and Hildegard von Bingen."
Factoring (finance)
Factoring is a financial arrangement whereby a supplier of goods sells its trade receivables to the factor (bank) at discounted price for immediate cash payment. Factoring is selling rights to the future payments. People and companies that are receiving money from contracts every some time may be in need of extra money - so they sell rights to receive those payments for cash hence Factoring. This is done especially in construction business where companies are paid for parts of work completed instead of upfront payment. Such a company will sell future payments for small percentage fee and will receive all money they need to continue the work without delays.
The structured settlement factoring transaction can be really helpful for business in financial needs.
It provides business with better financing and more funds on hands in exchange for small percentage of total sum.
Some banks are entering field of Factoring trying to provide same service advertised by well known names.

"Uozu, Toyama"
"is a city in Toyama Prefecture, Japan."
History.
Uozu developed as a castle town.
"In 1582, the forces of Oda Nobunaga forced the Uesugi clan to give up control of Uozu Castle."
"In 1918, riots started in Uozo because of increases in rice prices."
"In 1956, a great fire ravished many buildings in Uozu."
Geography.
"Several rivers run through Uozu—the Fuse River, the Katakai River, the Kado River, and the Hayatsuki River."
Gold was discovered in the mountains of near Uozu.
Demography.
"According to Japanese census data,"
Lake Mungo remains
"The Lake Mungo remains are three sets of human fossils. They are Lake Mungo 1 (""LM1"", or ""Mungo Lady""), Lake Mungo 2 (""LM2""), and Lake Mungo 3 (""LM3"", or ""Mungo Man""). The sites are located near Lake Mungo, in New South Wales, Australia, in the World Heritage-listed Willandra Lakes Region. Pieces of skeletons have been found in this region. These pieces have been attributed to over forty human skeletons. The Lake Mungo remains are the most significant of these."
Mungo Lady (LM1).
"LM1 are the fossilised, cremated remains of a young woman. They were found in 1969 by James Bowler with the University of Melbourne. Radiocarbon dating of pieces of bone from the burial put LM1 between 24,700 and 19,030 years old. Charcoal from a hearth 15 cm above the burial was dated at 26,250 years old (plus or minus 1,120 years). Reconstruction and study of the remains were mainly done by Alan Thorne at the Australian National University. The patterns of burn marks on the bones suggest that the body was first burned, then smashed, then burned a second time, before being buried."
"Research published by Bowler in 2003 rejected previous estimates for all of remains at the site. Optical dating concluded that both LM1 and LM3 were buried around 40,000 years ago (plus or minus 2,000 years). This makes it the earliest evidence of human cremation that has been found. It suggests that ancient indigenous Australians in this region had their own complicated burial rituals."
"The bones were returned in 1992 to the area's traditional owners: the Paakantji (Barkindji), the Mathi Mathi and the Ngiyampaa. LM1 is now in a locked vault at the Mungo National Park visitor centre."
Mungo Man (LM3).
"LM3 was found by James Bowler on 26 February 1974, when shifting sand dunes exposed the remains. It is located 500 m east of the LM1 site. The body was covered with red ochre, in the earliest known example of such a complicated and artistic burial practice. Like the cremation of LM1, this indicates that certain cultural traditions have existed on the Australian continent for much longer than previously thought."
Description.
"The skeleton was of a slender individual, quite different to the build of modern indigenous Australians. The skeleton was badly preserved: large pieces of the skull were missing, and most of the bones in the limbs were damaged. Usually, the gender of a skeleton is determined using the bones in the skull and the pelvis. The problem is that these bones are in a very bad state in LM3, or they are missing altogether; in other words, the ""normal"" method of gender determination cannot be used with LM3. Since LM3 was discovered, other features were studied; most of these studies agree that LM3 was probably a male."
"LM3 was buried lying on his back, with his hands joined together covering the groin. Some of the bones show evidence of osteoarthritis and eburnation, and the teeth are well worn. Based on this, it is likely that LM3 was quite old (around 50 years old) when he died. New studies show that, using the length of his limb bones, it is possible to estimate LM3's height at 196 centimetres (77 inches or 6 ft 5 in), unusually tall for an Aboriginal."
Age.
"The first estimate of LM3's age was made in 1976 by the team of scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) who excavated LM3. They estimated that LM3 was between 28,000 and 32,000 years old. They did not test LM3's remains directly; instead, they made their estimate through stratigraphic comparison with LM1. In 1987, an electron spin resonance test was done on pieces of bone from LM3's skeleton. This gave an estimate of his age at 31,000 years, plus or minus 7,000 years. In 1999, optical dating work was done on quartz from the LM3 burial site. The results indicated a burial older than 24,600 years (± 2,400) and younger than 43,300 years (± 3,800)."
"Later in the same year, research led by Alan Thorne gave a new estimate of 62,000 years old (plus or minus 6,000 years). This estimate was made by combining data from uranium-thorium dating, electron spin resonance dating and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of the remains and the soil in the grave. This estimate was very controversial, and some of the techniques used to get this estimate were criticised."
"In 2003, several Australian groups came to an agreement that LM3 is about 40,000 years old. A team led by Bowler did 25 more OSL tests that suggested that LM3 can not be older than 50,000 years. This age roughly agrees with stratigraphic evidence using four different dating methods. The age of 40,000 years is now the most widely accepted age for the LM3. This makes it the second oldest human fossil east of India, and the oldest in Australia. In addition to this, the study published in 2003 found that LM1 and LM3 are similar in age, and that humans were present at Lake Mungo as early as 50,000 to 46,000 years ago."
Other discoveries of remains.
"In 1998, the remains of a child were discovered. These are believed to have roughly the same age as Mungo Man and Mungo Lady. In 2005, erosion exposed another adult skeleton. Because it was not protected, this skeleton was destroyed by wind and rain about a year later."
Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum
"The Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum (Vietnamese: Lăng Hồ Chí Minh) is a large memorial to Vietnamese independence leader Hồ Chí Minh. It is located in Ba Ðình Square in Hà Nội. This is where his body is kept for people to pay their respects. President Hồ Chí Minh did not want a mausoleum at all. In his will, he said he wanted to be cremated and to have his ashes buried in the hills of the north, center, and south of Việt Nam. He said that he liked cremation because it was healthier than burial or a mausoleum and saved farmland. His successors did not let him have this wish. The government kept that part of his will secret. The government also pretended he died a day after he really did, because he really died on Independence Day and they did not tell anyone."
"Many aspects of ""Uncle Ho's"" last will and testament were altered or, as stated above, ignored. In his last days he was surrounded by those who formed what is now Vietnam's political system, while those loyal to him and his wishes were systematically kept or chased away. Others were put on a bus and executed."
Meng Tian
"Meng Tian (; ? - 210 BC ) was a Chinese general of the Qin Dynasty under Emperor Qin Shi Huang. His grandfather, Meng Ao, and his father, Meng Wu, were generals as well. After the unification of China, Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered Meng Tian leading 300,000 armies to attack the Xiongnu and build the Great Wall of China. Meng Tian was forced by the eunuch, Zhao Gao, to kill himself by drinking poisonous wine after the death of Emperor Qin Shi Haung."
Kippah
A kippah (Hebrew) or yarmulke (Yiddish) is a small cloth cap worn by Jews.
"Traditionally it was worn only by men, but in modern times the push for equality between the sexes in the practice of Judaism has led some women to wear yarmulkes. Some Jews only wear yarmulkes while praying; others wear yarmulkes the entire day, making sure not to walk more than four cubits without head covering (especially outside)."
The basis for wearing a head covering is a story in the Talmud (tractate Shabbat).
"Often, the color and fabric of the ""yarmulke"" can be a sign of adherence to a specific religious movement. The Israeli National Religious community is often referred to by the name ""kipot srugot"" כיפות סרוגות, literally ""woven yarmulkes"". Similarly, some Haredi sects are referred to by the name ""kipot shkhorot"" כיפות שחורות, literally ""black yarmulkes""."
Etymology.
"The etymology of ""yarmulke"" is unclear. Linguists (e.g. Max Vasmer) maintain that the Yiddish word is derived (via Russian or Polish) from the Turkic """", meaning 'raincoat'."
"Traditionally, ""yarmulke"" is considered to have originated from the Aramaic phrase """""" (in awe of the Lord), in keeping with the principle that the yarmulke is supposed to reflect someone's fear of heaven. Or perhaps, ""yira malkah"""" (fear of the King)."
Judeo-Arabic dialects
"Judeo-Arabic languages are a collection of Arabic language dialects spoken by Jews living or formerly living in Arabic-speaking countries. Just as with the rest of the Arab world, Arabic-speaking Jews had different dialects for the different regions where they lived. Most Judæo-Arabic dialects were written in modified forms of the Hebrew alphabet, often including consonant dots from the Arabic alphabet to accommodate phonemes that did not exist in the Hebrew alphabet."
"In retaliation for 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jews in Arab countries became subject to increasingly insufferable discrimination and violence, causing virtually all of them to flee en masse to Israel. Their dialects of Arabic did not thrive in Israel, and most became extinct, replaced by the Modern Hebrew language."
"In the Middle Ages, Jews in the Islamic diaspora spoke a dialect of Arabic, which they wrote in a mildly adapted Hebrew script (rather than using Arabic script)."
This phenomenon is called Judaeo-Arabic and may be compared to both Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) and Yiddish (Judaeo-German).
"Some of the most important books of medieval Jewish though were originally written in Judaeo-Arabic, as well as certain halakhic works and biblical commentary. Only later were they translated into medieval scientific Hebrew so that they could be read by the Ashkenazic Jews of Europe. These include:"
The Clangers
"The Clangers is a British children's television series. The first episode was broadcast on the BBC on 16 November 1969. The series is about a family of aliens who live under the surface of the Moon in caves. They looked like small, pink, knitted mice. Other characters include the Froglets and The Soup Dragon, a dragon that gives out soup. The family uses a US flag as a table cloth."
London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham
"The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is a London borough in West London but is part of an area called Inner London. House prices are more expensive than most parts of England. The borough has three famous football teams: Fulham F.C., Queens Park Rangers F.C. and Chelsea F.C."
1 E9 m²
"1 E9 m² is a term used to group together areas of similar size. It is used for places that are between 1,000 km² and 10,000 km² in area. The term is based from the scientific notation for 1 x 109m²."
Economic growth.
Coffee was first planted in Costa Rica in the early 19th century. It was first shipped to Europe in 1843. It became Costa Rica's first major export. Coffee would remain Costa Rica's biggest export until the 20th century.
"Most of the coffee exported was transported by oxcart to the Pacific port of Puntarenas. Since the main market for the coffee was in Europe, it soon became a high priority to develop a transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the Costa Rican government asked U.S. businessman Minor C. Keith to build a railroad to the Caribbean port of Limón. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890."
"Most Afro-Costa Ricans come from Jamaican immigrants who worked on the railway. United States convicts, Italians and Chinese immigrants also worked in the construction of the railroad."
"In exchange for making the railroad, Costa Rican gave Keith large amounts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce bananas and export them to the United States. As a result, bananas became the largest export. The United Fruit Company began to hold a major role in the national economy."
20th century.
Costa Rica has enjoyed greater peace and political stability than other Latin American nations.
"But in 1917–19, General Federico Tinoco Granados ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown. The unpopularity of Tinoco's government led to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the Costa Rican military."
"In 1948, José Figueres Ferrer led an armed uprising between the previous president Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia (he served as president between 1940 and 1944) and Otilio Ulate Blanco. With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day Costa Rican Civil War was the bloodiest event in Costa Rica during the 20th century."
"The victorious rebels formed a government that abolished the military. It oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly. Having enacted these reforms, the junta relinquished its power on November 8, 1949, to the new democratic government. After that, Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution in 1953. Since then, Costa Rica has held 14 presidential elections, the latest in 2014. All of them have been widely regarded by the international community as peaceful and transparent."
Geography.
"Costa Rica is on the Central American isthmus. It is between latitudes 8° and 12°N, and longitudes 82° and 86°W. It borders the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It has a total of of coastline. Costa Rica also borders Nicaragua to the north ( of border) and Panama to the southeast ( of border). In total, Costa Rica has plus of territorial waters."
"The highest point in the country is Cerro Chirripó, at . The largest lake in Costa Rica is Lake Arenal."
Climate.
"Costa Rica is located between 8 and 12 degrees north of the Equator. The climate is tropical all year. The country has many microclimates depending on elevation, rainfall, and the geography of each region."
"Costa Rica's seasons are defined by how much rain falls. It does not have the four seasons other countries have. The year can be split into two seasons: the dry season (known as summer), and the rainy season (known as winter). The ""summer"" starts in December and ends in April. ""Winter"" starts in May and ends in November. During this time it rains constantly in some regions."
"The location receiving the most rain is the Caribbean. Annual rainfall is over . Humidity is also higher here. The mean annual temperature on the coast is around . in the main populated areas, and below on the highest mountains."
"There are many national parks in Costa Rica, including Manuel Antonio National Park."
Plants and animals.
"Costa Rica is home to many plants and animals. The country has only about 0.25% of the world's landmass, but it has 5% of the world's biodiversity. Almost 25% of Costa Rica's land area is in national parks and protected areas. This is the largest percentage of protected areas in the world."
Costa Rica successfully reduced deforestation. It had one of the worst deforestation rates in the world from 1973 to 1989. But it was almost zero by 2005.
"The Corcovado National Park is internationally known by ecologists for its biodiversity. Visitors can see many different types of animals. An example is the big cats and tapirs. Corcovado is the only park in Costa Rica where all four Costa Rican monkeys can be found. These include the white-headed capuchin, the mantled howler,the endangered Geoffroy's spider monkey and the Central American squirrel monkey. The squirrel monkey is found only on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and a small part of Panama."
"Tortuguero National Park is home to spider, howler, and white-throat Capuchin monkeys. It is also the home of three-toed sloth and two-toed sloth. It has 320 species of birds and many reptiles. There is an annual nesting of the endangered green turtle, and is the most important nesting site for the species. Giant leatherback, hawksbill, and loggerhead turtles also nest here."
"The Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is home to almost 2,000 plant species. Including many orchids. It is also home to more than 400 types of birds. There are more than 100 species of mammals here."
"Costa Rica is a center of biological diversity for reptiles and amphibians. They have the world's fastest running lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (""Ctenosaura similis"")."
"Provinces, cantons, and districts."
"Article 168 of the Constitution of Costa Rica says the political divisions are classified into 3 groups: provinces, cantons, and districts."
Costa Rica has seven provinces. The provinces are divided into 81 cantons. The canton is directed by a mayor. Mayors are chosen democratically every four years by the canton's people. There are no provincial legislatures. The cantons are further divided into 463 districts.
The provinces are:
Sports.
Costa Rica entered the Summer Olympics for the first time in 1936 with the fencer Bernardo de la Guardia. They entered the Winter Olympics for the first time in 1980 with the skier Arturo Kinch. All four of Costa Rica's Olympic medals were won by the sisters Silvia and Claudia Poll in swimming. Claudia won the country's only gold medal in 1996.
Association football is the most popular sport in Costa Rica. The national team has played in four FIFA World Cup tournaments. They reached the quarter-finals for the first time in 2014. Its best performance in the regional CONCACAF Gold Cup was runner-up in 2002.
"""Sovereignty"" when talking about relations between countries mostly means the rights a Sovereign state has over its territory."
Sometimes there is discussion about when a government loses Sovereignty because it is doing bad things for its people. In this case justice may mean other countries need to intrude on the sovereignty of the government.
Inside a Country.
"""Sovereignty"" when talking about relations between groups inside one country usually means which group has the Legitimacy to rule. This may not be certain. Sometimes the group who is most able to rule (because of a strong military) is not Legitimate."

"The (FIFA ; French for ""International Federation of Association Football"") is the organization that controls international football (also called ""association football""). The organization’s main buildings are in Zürich, Switzerland. FIFA organizes major international football tournaments, and the most famous one is the FIFA World Cup, which has been held since 1930. FIFA was established on May 21, 1905 in Paris and has 209 national associations as its members. The organization’s official languages are English, French, German and Spanish."
"The president of FIFA is currently Gianni Infantino, serving since 26 February 2016."
"The most powerful organ of FIFA is the FIFA Congress, which is an assembly made up of representatives from each member association. The Congress holds a regular meeting once a year, and since 1998 an additional meeting has been held every year. Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's laws."
"The Congress decides whether FIFA should accept new national associations and elects the President of FIFA, its General Secretary and the other members of FIFA's executive committee. The President and General Secretary take care of what goes on within and around FIFA. The executive committee, with the President as its head, is responsible for deciding the dates, locations and format of tournaments."
"Also, there are six regional confederations recognized by FIFA which take care of the game in the seven different continents of the world. National associations must be members of both FIFA and their regional confederation in order for their teams to compete in FIFA's competitions. The six confederations are AFC (Asian Football Confederation in Asia and Australia), CAF (Confédération Africaine de Football in Africa), CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football in North America and Central America), CONMEBOL (Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol in South America), OFC (Oceania Football Confederation in Oceania) and UEFA (Union Européenne de Football Association in Europe)."
American Idol
"American Idol is an American reality-singing competition series created by Simon Fuller, produced by 19 Entertainment, and distributed by FremantleMedia North America. It aired on Fox from June 11, 2002 to April 7, 2016, as an addition to the Idols format based on the British series Pop Idol and has since become one of the most successful shows in the history of American television. On March 11, 2018, the 16th season aired on ABC."
"Eventually the American people are allowed to vote by calling or texting, and the person with the fewest votes is off the show."
The TV show consists of multiple rounds of elimination. The singers can be anyone between the age of 15 and 29 years.
Host and judges.
"""American Idol"" has three judges, who give comments on performances."

Smile
"A smile is a face made by flexing the muscles near both ends of the mouth. The smile can also be made through the eyes (See 'Duchenne smile' below). Smiles usually express happiness. A smile can be natural or fake. However, smiling can be different with animals. When smiling, the teeth shows, but sometimes animals do this when they are threatening. When chimpanzees show their teeth, it can also be a sign of fear."
Dimples.
"Dimples are genetically inherited. They are caused by the flesh underneath the skin, that forms on some people's cheeks, especially when they smile. Some people may only have one dimple on only one side of the face."
Duchenne smile.
"Although there are many different types of smiles, researchers are interested in the duchenne smile because it is done with the eyes. The Duchenne smile was named after the French physician Guillaume Duchenne. Duchenne identified two types of smiles. A Duchenne smile is when the cheek raises and forms a wrinkle around the eyes. Many researchers think that Duchenne smiles are usually hard to make when you are pretending to smile."
Internet.
"On the Internet, smiles can normally be typed up. This is normally called a smiley, smiley face, or happy face. Smileys show emotion when people are not able to see it in real life. Smileys typed on the computer are called emoticons. Smileys can change depending on where the person typing the smiley is."
"Western Style: :-), :-(, ;-), :-O, :-D, (;D)"
"Eastern Style: d(^.^)b, \(^o^)/, &gt;.&lt;, ^_^, *&lt;):)"
"In Russia, which became the Soviet Union after the 1917 Revolution, composers were not allowed to be experimental. It was difficult for them because they had to please the politicians who told them that their music should reflect “Socialist realism” (meaning the workers’ struggle against capitalism). The great tradition of writing symphonies continued with Sergei Prokofiev (who spent some time in exile) and Shostakovich (who remained in the Soviet Union)."
"The Hungarian composer Béla Bartók developed a modern style influenced by folk music from his country and other East European countries. His music is often quite neoclassical, for example the famous ""Concerto for Orchestra""."
Avant garde experiments.
"In the mid-20th century a group of composers known as the “Darmstadt School” (because they often met in Darmstadt) continued to write music which was based on serialism. This included Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Many of them, including both Boulez and Stockhausen, also experimented with electronic music. The term Avant Garde is often used to describe their music. It means that it expands the limits, or pushes ahead into new ground (literally the “front guard”, a military analogy). Other American composers were experimental, e.g. Charles Ives and John Cage who is famous for using a “prepared piano” (a piano which makes strange sounds because strange objects are put inside it)."
Jazz influence.
"In America jazz was a big influence on classical composers. George Gershwin’s music is halfway between jazz and classical. Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein used jazz elements in their music. In Europe many composer used ideas from jazz, e.g. Maurice Ravel and Kurt Weill."
Minimalism.
"Around the 1960s some composers thought that a lot of music was getting too complicated. Music of the avant garde school such as Edgard Varèse, Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt was becoming too difficult for people to understand. People found it too mathematical and intellectual. They wanted music with feeling and emotion. A group of composers developed a style called Minimalism which uses music based around a simple idea which repeats itself again and again but gradually changes. Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, John Cage and to some extent John Adams all used minimalist techniques. It was a reaction against music that had become too complicated."
Other paths based on tradition.
"While all these different schools of thought were coming and going there were still some composers who managed to keep to a more traditional path and find new ways to use tonality in their music. The greatest figure in British music was Benjamin Britten who was an eclectic composer (i.e. he took ideas from many different people). Two other great composers were Michael Tippett and William Walton, who each developed their own style. In America there were composers such as Samuel Barber, Roy Harris and Alan Hovhaness. In Germany Paul Hindemith was one of the most important composers. Like Kurt Weill, he often wrote music which had a political purpose, but Weill's music is more jazz-inspired."
"Some contemporary composers (alive today) write music which is deeply religious. These include John Tavener and Arvo Pärt. John Rutter and Bob Chilcott, who write music for choirs which sounds fresh and attractive to new audiences. Other composers have found various ways of creating their own style, e.g. the Scottish composers James MacMillan and Judith Weir and the Master of the Queen's Music: Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. In Russia Sofia Gubaidulina and Galina Ustvolskaya are important voices in the search for new music."
Cuxhaven
"Cuxhaven ( , ; ) is an independent town and seat of Cuxhaven, in Lower Saxony, Germany. The town includes the northernmost point of Lower Saxony. It is on the shore of the North Sea at the mouth of the Elbe River. Cuxhaven has a footprint of (east–west) by (north–south). Its town quarters Duhnen, Döse and Sahlenburg are popular vacation spots on the North Sea and home to about 52,000 residents."
Geographical and cultural background.
The town is served by Cuxhaven station.
The island of Neuwerk is off the coast from Cuxhaven.
Twin towns – sister cities.
Cuxhaven is twinned with:
Haifa Wehbe
"Haifa Wehbe (, born March 10, 1972) is a female Lebanese singer, actress, model, and jewelry designer who is known in the Arab world. Wehbe was born in a rural town in South Lebanon and currently lives in Beirut. She started her music career with her debut album ""Huwa az-Zaman"" (, ""It is Time"")."
Early life and career.
"Before she became a singer, she was a model. She won title ""Miss South Lebanon"" when she was sixteen. In 1995, she was the runner-up for Miss Lebanon before the public found out she had a daughter named Zeinab."
"Her second 2005 album was ""Baddi 'Ayš"" (, ""I Want to Live""). Her second songs was ""Ana Haifa"" (""I am Haifa"")."
She also appeared in Pepsi ad with French footballer Thierry Henry.
Dynamics (music)
"In music, the dynamics in the piece is the variation in loudness between notes or phrases."
"In written music the dynamics are shown by letters which stand for Italian words for the dynamic levels. They are listed in the table below. Notice that “piano”, as a dynamic level, is pronounced the Italian way (“pi-AH-no”)."
"Use more than two ps or fs to show that the music is very, very quiet, or very, very loud. Tchaikovsky sometimes used five ps or fs, though only up to three are normally found in sheet music."
"Dynamic levels are not something that can be measured exactly. Exactly how loud mp should be depends on several things: what is happening in the music, the instrument, the size of the room in which the music is being played etc. The important thing is that dynamic levels should be correct in relation to one another."
Settings.
'The Force'.
The Force is a mystical power. Those who can harness if for good follow a religion known as the Jedi. It is a belief that the force flows through every living thing. In the words of Obi-Wan Kenobi:
"People who can control the Force with their minds get a number of psychic powers, such telepathy (reading others thoughts), telekenesis (moving things with their minds), precognition (knowing about things before they happen) and mind control (telling people commands they must follow)."
The Jedi and the Sith.
"The Jedi are a group of beings who use the Force to bring peace and harmony to people, planets, and cultures. They are trained to use the force for good purposes. They are sworn enemies with another group called the Sith."
"The Sith are a group of beings who use the force as a power source; they are trained to use the force to gain ultimate power. The Sith normally use the force to gain power in battles with their enemy who are the Jedi. They also use the force to bring destruction to the universe and anything in their way. They are the antagonists, and they usually use red lightsabers in contrast to the variety of colors used by the Jedi. There are usually only two Sith, a master and an apprentice."
Lightsaber.
"The lightsaber is a dangerous and powerful weapon used by the Jedi and the Sith. It can be described simply as a light sword. These weapons are very special to a Jedi or Sith. They are custom built to special specifications by the Jedi or Sith. The Sith tend to take a Jedi's lightsaber as a prize if they win the battle. Many epic battles have been fought with lightsabers between the Jedi and the Sith. For the lightsaber to be a weapon it is powered by a special crystal called a kyber crystal.The kyber crystal comes in many different cololrs such as: Red, white, yellow, orange, and many more. The reason it is powerful and dangerous is that when someone touches the blade, one gets burned straight away."
Story.
"Anakin Skywalker is a young boy who meets Obi-Wan Kenobi and learns the ways of the Force (and to become a Jedi). Although Jedi are not allowed to get married, as an adult, Anakin falls in love with Senator Padmé Amidala and they get married. Anakin later goes to the Dark Side and turns against Obi-Wan Kenobi and the rest of the Jedi. Then Darth Sidious renames him Darth Vader. Before he turned against his wife, Anakin had two children with Senator Amidala, Leia and Luke Skywalker, who he does not know about. Senator Amidala dies after giving birth to their twins. After birth, the twins are separated to prevent Vader and the Dark Side from finding and hurting the children. Obi-Wan Kenobi sends Luke to a planet called Tatooine to live with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Leia is raised by Senator Bail Organa of the planet Alderaan; she is called Princess Leia Organa."
"When they get older, Luke and Leia meet again. At first they don't know that they are brother and sister, but they eventually find out. They help fight the evil government, called the Galactic Empire. Luke also learns the ways of the Jedi from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. In the end, they defeat the Empire, with the help of the Rebellion, and Luke helps his father Anakin become good again. Unfortunately, Anakin dies. The galaxy is then saved for a while."
"Thirty years later, however, the Empire rises again in the form of the First Order. However, the New Republic does not believe that it is a threat. Those who do believe form the Resistance, led by Leia. Luke has vanished, and Leia has married Han Solo. They had a child, named Ben, but Ben was corrupted by the First Order and a dark-side force user named Snoke and is now called Kylo Ren. Rey, a desert scavenger, fights with Han against the First Order, but Kylo Ren kills his father. However, Rey still manages to gain a large defeat against the First Order with the help of the Resistance. Rey then finds Luke, who was searching for the first Jedi Temple and for more knowledge about the Jedi, however Rey is then disappointed to see that Luke has given up on the Jedi. Meanwhile, the Resistance is slowly being wiped out ship-by-ship as they are chased by Snoke's ""Supremacy"", and on the verge of the faction's death, Vice-Admiral Holdo rams the Resistance's flagship into the First Order fleet to save the resistance. The remnants are later forced to an old rebel base in the planet Crait, where they put up a valiant fight but are slowly wiped out until Luke, the Spark of the Resistance, shows up in a vision to grant time for the others to escape, becoming one with the force in the process."
Star Wars creatures and droids (robots).
The Caretakers of Ahch-To
"The manatee nuns from “The Last Jedi” may not take an immediate liking to Rey, but we sure like them. These wise caretakers in cream-colored habits are as cute as they are intense."
Ewoks
"Yes, Lucas went overboard with the killer teddy bears of Endor, populating film and TV projects with these forest fuzz-warriors. And it was their very engineered-for-cuteness factor that first divided Star Wars fans as pro- and anti-Ewok a long time ago — even if some naysayers softened a bit after the bar was lowered in 1999 by Jar Jar Binks."
R2-D2 and C-3PO
"Although the narrative may separate them, they are an inseparable joint entry here, befitting their place as a great action-comedy team. R2-D2 is the droid that Resistance royals are forever looking for — the beeping do-it-all mechanic and sometime projector. And C-3PO is the know-it-all, fussy butler of protocol, languages and odds-making."
Expanded universe.
"Many books, short movies, and video games have been produced that deal with events that do not happen in the original movies. They also tell more about things that did happen in the movies. For example, the book ""Death Star"" tells about the building and destruction of the space station from the original movie. It tells much about things seen in that movie but from the point of view of the people on the station. A different example is that in the Expanded Universe, sometimes the Sith are shown as the protagonists. Most of the stories in the Expanded Universe are about the rebuilding of the Republic after the Empire's defeat. They are set anywhere from the early Sith Wars which happened 5,000 years before to more than one hundred years after Episode VI."

Korean language
The Korean language is spoken mainly in North and South Korea. It is spoken by more than 78 million people (most are North or South Koreans).
"In South Korea, it is called ""hangukmal"" (한국말) or ""hangugeo"" (Hangeul: 한국어, Hanja: 韓國語). In North Korea, however, it is called ""choseonmal"" (조선말) or ""choseoneo"" (조선어, 朝鮮語). They are named differently because the common names for North and South Korea are different. Additionally, Koreans usually call their language ""urimal"" (Hangeul: 우리말) or ""urinara mal"" (Hangeul: 우리나라 말), meaning ""our language"" or ""our country's language."""
Writing.
"Two key problems faced FitzGerald during his first period: Northern Ireland and the worsening economic situation. On one occasion where he met with relatives of the H-Block hunger strikers, two of Thomas McElwee's sisters, Mary and Nora, broke down and left the meeting; Mary said to the media outside that ""he's doing nothing, he's asking for suggestions"". FitzGerald then ordered Gardaí to remove the families from the meeting."
"In the subsequent general election in February 1982, Fine Gael lost only two seats but were out of power. However, a third general election within eighteen months, in November 1982, resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time, heading a Fine Gael–Labour coalition with a working majority."
Taoiseach 1982–87.
Constitutional reform.
"As Taoiseach for a second time, FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society. His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum, although he did liberalise Ireland's contraception laws."
"A controversial Pro-Life Amendment (anti-abortion clause), which was stated to recognise the ""Right to Life of the Unborn, with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother"", was added to the Irish constitution—against FitzGerald's advice—in a 1983 national referendum."
Northern Ireland.
"FitzGerald set up the New Ireland Forum in 1983, which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist SDLP from Northern Ireland. It provided the incentive for the reopening of serious negotiations between the Irish and British governments, which resulted in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985."
"While the Agreement was rejected and criticised by Unionists, it was said to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the Irish and British governments which, in time, would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 and, subsequently, the republican and loyalist cease-fires."
Infighting and declining support.
"In January 1987, the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals. FitzGerald continued as Taoiseach, heading a minority Fine Gael government and proposed the stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for some four years. Fianna Fáil returned to power in March 1987, after Fine Gael were heavily defeated in the 1987 general election, and Charles Haughey was elected Taoiseach."
Post-Taoiseach period.
"FitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the election of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach, and retired completely from politics at the 1992 general election. His wife, Joan, died before him in 1999; after that FitzGerald wrote a weekly column every Saturday in ""The Irish Times"", and lectured widely at home and abroad on public affairs."
"In 2009, FitzGerald had received a new ministerial car, the first and only one to have been bought by the state since an economic recession hit the country in 2008."
Death.
"On 5 May 2011, it was reported that FitzGerald was seriously ill in a Dublin hospital. The Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, sent his regards and called him an ""institution"". He was put on a ventilator. On 19 May he died aged 85, from pneumonia, at the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin."

"The JKLF claims that they are not Islamist, but are nationalist, and opposes the emergence of the territories into either Pakistan or India but rather wants the region of Kashmir to separate from the three countries and become independent."
"In 1982 branches were established in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Pakistan and in 1987 in Indian-administered Kashmir (Jammu and Kashmir)."
Mirador de la Flor
"Mirador de la Flor () is a life-sized statue that is in Corpus Christi, Texas. The statue is a memorial to American singer Selena. The statue was ordered by the Mayor of Corpus Christi as a tourist attraction in 1997. Hundreds of fans visit the statue weekly from all over the world. The statue faces Corpus Christi bay, where the gun that killed Selena was thrown. A second life-sized statue of Selena was made in Mexico in March 2011."
Marie Joséphine of Savoy
"Marie Joséphine of Savoy (Maria Giuseppina Luigia; 2 September 1753 – 13 November 1810) was the wife of the future Louis XVIII of France. She was a princess of Savoy by birth, became the titular Queen consort, and was known by her title: Her Royal Highness, Countess of Provence (""comtesse de Provence"")."
Family.
"She was born at the Royal Palace of Turin on 2 September 1753 and was the third child and second daughter of Victor Amadeus and his wife the Spanish Infanta Maria Antonia of Spain. At the time of her birth her grandfather, Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, was the King of Sardinia."
Marriage.
"Maria Giuseppina was engaged to the French Prince Louis Stanislas of France. He was known as the Count of Provence. They were married on 16 April 1771 ""by proxy"" in the Turin. They were married in person on 14 May 1771 at the Palace of Versailles. A luxurious ball followed the wedding on 20 May. She was considered to be ugly. Louis Stanislas hated his wife. We know today that these rumors were created by those who supported Marie Antoinette as a rivalry soon emerged after the youngest brother 'comte d'Artois', married the Comtesse's sister, thereby bringing yet another Savoyard princess to Versailles and creating an Italian party at court."
"In France she was known as Marie Joséphine de Savoie. She had a high rank at court as her husband was a grandson of the reiging king. She was a cousin of the ill-fated ""Princess of Lamballe"" who was instrumental in the arrangement of the marriage. At the death of her husband’s grandfather Louis XV in 1774, her brother-in-law succeeded as Louis XVI. She became pregnant in 1774 and 1781, but both pregnancies ended in miscarriage. In 1791 Marie Joséphine went to Germany. During the period of exile, the Count and Countess fought constantly. Some historians have suggested Marie Joséphine's possible lesbian relationship with a lady-in-waiting as the primary cause for discord between the couple."
"Marie Joséphine died of an edema at Hartwell House, English residence of the exiled French royal family. Marie Joséphine was laid to rest in the Lady Chapel of Westminster Abbey. Her body was removed a year later on Louis's orders and buried in the Kingdom of Sardinia; today in Cagliari Cathedral."
Islam in Palestine
"Islam is the religion of the majority of the Palestinian population residing in the Palestinian territories, with Muslims comprising 75% of the population of the West Bank, and 99% of the population of the Gaza Strip."
"Jerusalem is Islam's third holiest city after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. The ""Haram al Sharif"" (Temple Mount) of Jerusalem is believed by Muslims to be the location from which Muhammad ascended to Jannah (paradise); there is no mention of Jerusalem in the Koran, however."
This widely accepted Islamic belief raises the religious and spiritual importance to them of the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent al-Aqsa Mosque. Muslims are sensitive to and mindful of the circumstance that two mosques along with the rest of East Jerusalem are claimed and illegally occupied by the state of Israel.
Specific impulse
"Specific impulse (often shortened to ""I""sp) is a way to describe how well a rocket performs. It is also used to describe how well a jet engine performs. It can be used to compare rockets of different sizes. It is a way to know how much force a given engine makes for each bit of fuel. To do this, one needs to know how much fuel is in the engine. A high specific impulse means that a rocket needs less fuel to perform as well. If the specific impulse is lower, it means that the rocket needs more fuel to perform as well."
"Specific impulse is a useful value to compare rocket or jet engines. It is used much like ""miles per gallon"" or ""litres per 100 kilometres"" is used to compare cars. An engine with a higher specific impulse uses fuel better. This means that the same amount of fuel lets the rocket go faster after all fuel is depleted."
"A rocket engine with a higher specific impulse doesn't mean it's 'more powerful'. That is, it will not make the rocket accelerate harder. In fact, the designs for engines with the highest specific impulse, like ion engines, are the 'weakest' of all types of engines. They accelerate the rocket slowly but steadily over a long period of time using only a tiny amount of fuel. In a race between two rockets with the same amount of fuel and two different engines the one with the more powerful engine will take an early lead, but when it burns down all its fuel, the rocket with higher specific impulse will still have some fuel left and will continue to accelerate. Eventually it will overtake its counterpart and will win the race if the distance is big enough for it to use its long-term advantage."
Fifth war.
"In 1574, the fifth war began. The Catholic monarchy faced an alliance between the Protestants and a new group, known as the ""Malcontents,"" Who were were Catholic noblemen who opposed the policies of the monarchy and wanted religious toleration for the Protestants. In 1575, King Henry III's younger brother, Francis, known as the Duke of Alençon, joined the Malcontents and raised an army. Henry III gave up and in 1576 agreed to a peace treaty with the Malcontents and Protestants. Called the Peace of Beaulieu, gave a lot of land and money to the Duke of Alençon and to the Malcontents. Many of the Malcontents, including Alençon, were satisfied and became loyal to the King and the Catholics again."
Sixth war.
"In late 1576, the sixth war began. The Protestants no longer had as many allies and lost the important cities of La Charité and Issoire. However, the King did not have enough money to continue the war and defeat the Protestants totally and so the war ended in 1577."
Seventh war.
"The seventh war began in 1580 when Henry of Navarre, the most important Protestant leader, attacked the Catholic city of Cahors. He conquered the city, but the Catholics captured the Protestant city of La Mure later that year. In November 1580, another peace treaty was signed."
"In 1584, the Duke of Alençon died. King Henry III was the only living son of King Henry II (reigned from 1547 to 1559), and the next man in line to become king was the Protestant Henry of Navarre. Many Catholics wanted King Henry III to disown Henry of Navarre and to make someone else the heir to the throne because were scared of a Protestant becoming king, but Henry III refused."
Eighth war.
"In 1585, the Catholics, led by Henry of Guise, raised an army and forced King Henry III to outlaw Protestantism in France. The war that followed, the eighth war, is also known as the ""War of the Three Henrys"" and is named after King Henry III, Henry of Guise, and Henry of Navarre. Even though Henry III and Henry of Guise were on the same side in 1585, many Catholics feared that Henry III secretly wanted Henry of Navarre to be the next king. In 1588, the supporters of Henry of Guise, known as ""Leaguers,"" chased King Henry III out of Paris. In 1589, afraid that Henry of Guise wanted to take the throne from him, Henry III had him murdered, fled to the Protestant army, and joined forces with Henry of Navarre. Charles of Mayenne, Henry of Guise's brother, became the leader of the Leaguers."
"The Royal-Protestant army defeated the Leaguers at the Battle of Senlis and surrounded Paris. Before they could capture the city, King Henry III was killed by a Leaguer but named as his heir Henry of Navarre, a Protestant, before he died. The King if France was now Henry IV, who defeated Leaguer armies at the Battle of Arques (1589) and the Battle of Ivry (1590) but could not completely defeat the Leaguers. In 1593, King Henry IV converted to Catholicism."
End.
"After six more years of fighting, the Leaguers gave up, and the war ended. Henry IV pardoned those who had fought against him, and made a settlement allowing Catholics and Protestants to practice their faith within certain limits."

Streptomyces
"Streptomyces is the largest genus of Actinobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria. ""Streptomyces"" is often found in soil and is very much similar to fungi by its shape. They form long thin threads called hyphae that can differentiate into a chain of spores for reproduction. Almost all of the bioactive compounds produced by ""Streptomyces"" are made while the hyphae are forming from the substrate mycelium."
Use in medicine and science.
"Streptomyces are medically important, as they produce antifungals, antiparasitic drugs, antivirals, antitumorals, anti-hypertensives, immunosuppressants and antibiotics. Different species of streptomyces are used to produce different antibiotics. Over 500 species of ""Streptomyces"" bacteria have been described. For example, widely studied ""S. griseus"" was the first to be used in production of an antibiotic streptomycin, while ""S. avermitilis"" as a source of avermictin. Another well-studied species, ""S coelicolor"", is widely used in genetic studies. Overall, Streptomyces produce over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin, such as tetracycline, neomycin and chloramphenicol."
Antibiotic mechanism.
"Antibiotics target essential proteins for pathogens’ growth and survival, inhibiting essential functions. For example, streptomycin, which is made from ""S. griseus,"" irreversibly binds to bacterial genetic material and causes errors in the production of new proteins, which leads to cell death. It can be used for treating severe infections, such as tuberculosis and plague. Another example is avermectin, made from ""S. avermitili."" It causes invertebrate paralysis (inability to make and pass nerve impulses), which is used as a drug and pesticide against parasitic worms and insects. Avermectin enhances glutamate (neurotransmitter) at the glutamate-gated chloride channels that mammals don’t possess. It causes the excess of chloride ions inside the cell (hyperpolarisation), so the action potential cannot be further induced, ultimately leading to paralysis."

"Agustín Ross Cultural Centre (Spanish, "" Centro Cultural Agustín Ross""), previously known as Casino Ross (""Ross Casino""), is a historic casino building. It is in Agustín Ross Avenue, in front of Ross Park, in Pichilemu, Chile. The building was built in the late 1800s. In 1906 the first Chilean casino was built there. It was closed in 1932 and converted into a hotel which was open until the 1980s. The building is now Pichilemu's cultural centre."
History.
"The casino is named after Agustín Ross Edwards, a Chilean writer, member of parliament, minister and politician. He was part of the powerful family Ross Edwards, which founded the newspaper ""El Mercurio"" years earlier. Based on his european experience, Ross bought a place named ""La Posada"" (English: ""The Inn"") or Petren Fund in 1885. At that time, it was just some barracks with thick walls with a ground of 300 hectares."
"The old Ross Casino was constructed in the late 1800s by Ross himself. It contained the first mail and telegraph service and a big store. The building had three floors, and was raised using imported materials. In January 20, 1906, the first Chilean casino was opened in that building. The Ross Casino worked until 1932, when the permission was cancelled, allowing just the newly constructed Viña del Mar Casino to work. After the closing of the Ross Casino, the building was converted into a hotel was which functioned until the 1980s."
"The old casino (1905) and its gardens (1885) are an important part of the city. It was named Historic Monument by the National Monuments Council on February 25, 1988, by the supreme decree N° 100."
"Ross was also the administrator of the great Juana Ross de Edwards fortune, the Nancagua Hacienda, near the city of same name. He designed an urban set of high environmental value and landscape, transforming ""La Posada"" to a hotel (""Great Hotel Pichilemu"", later ""Hotel Ross"", or ""Ross Hotel"")."
"Ross also built several chalets, terraces, embankments, stone walls, a balcony in front of the beach and several large houses with imported building materials and furniture from France and England. Additionally, he put up a park and a forest of more than 10 hectares. Ross turned Pichilemu into a summer resort town for rich people from Santiago. He, however, could not build a dock for the city, as he had planned."
"In 1935, the Ross successors ceded to the Illustrious Municipality of Pichilemu all the Ross constructions (streets, avenues, squares, seven hectares of forests, the park in front of the hotel, the perrons and the terraces) under condition that the municipality hold them for recreation and public access."
"The Cultural Centre was severely damaged after the February 2010 Chile earthquake. The library that it hosted was completely destroyed. After the 2010 Pichilemu earthquake, the Cultural Centre suffered structural damage, but Roberto Córdova, Mayor of Pichilemu, said that it was repairable."
Australia national rugby union team
"The Australia national rugby union team, nicknamed the Wallabies are the national rugby union side of Australia. The first Australian teams played against the British Lions at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 24 June 1899. The Australians won the game 13-3. In 1908, the Australians went to the United Kingdom, France and North America to play. They needed a name and someone suggested the ""Rabbits"", but the team did not like it and chose the ""Wallabies"" instead. A wallaby is a small mammal from Australia, very similar to a kangaroo. Until the 1980s, only teams playing overseas were called the Wallabies; when they played in Australia they were called Internationals. Now the national team is called the Wallabies all the time."
Sparrow
"A sparrow is a member of the genus ""Passer"". They are small passerine birds which belong to the family ""Passeridae"". They are also known as old-world sparrows. Sparrows often make their nests near houses or buildings. This means they are one of the easiest birds to see in the wild."
"The genus has about 30 species around the world. The best known of these is the house sparrow, ""Passer domesticus""."
"Some authorities place other genera in the sparrow group: ""Petronia"", the rock sparrows; ""Carpospiza"", the pale rockfinch; and ""Montifringilla"", the snowfinches."
Description.
"Sparrows are small birds. They are between 11–18 centimeters long. They can weigh between 13–42 grams. They are usually brown and grey. They have short tails and small, strong beaks. Most sparrows eat seeds or small insects. Sparrows are social birds and they live in flocks (groups)."
The house sparrow.
"The house sparrow (""Passer domesticus"") is a species of sparrow. It lives all over the world. It originally lived only in Europe and Asia. However, people travelled to new places and the house sparrow went to those places too. It is now the bird with the widest distribution. This means it lives in the most places. The species has about 50 subspecies."
Distribution.
"Sparrows can be seen on every continent on earth. A long time ago, they lived only in Europe, Asia and Africa. However, people traveled to Australia, North America and South America, and now sparrows are seen there too. The house sparrow is seen in every continent. In Australia, there are no sparrows in Western Australia, as they have not been able to travel across the deserts that separate that state from the eastern states. The government employs people to hunt and destroy any sparrows that might arrive."
North America.
"The house sparrow was introduced to America in the late 19th century. It was introduced on purpose. It was imported by several people, including Eugene Schieffelin, who was a wealthy New York City admirer of Shakespeare. He wanted to introduce to America all the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. Two of these species were great successes: starlings and house sparrows. He organized a society for the importation of foreign birds, incorporated in Albany."
Other so-called 'sparrows'.
"Some ornithologists thought the ""Estrildid finches"" were in the same family as sparrows. However, they are now in a different family, the Estrildidae."
"There is also a group called 'American sparrows', or New World sparrows. These are also in a different family, the Emberizidae (buntings)."
"The hedge sparrow (also known as the dunnock or accentor) ""Prunella modularis"" is also not a true sparrow. It is in a different family, the Prunellidae. It is only called a sparrow because people called all small brown birds 'sparrows'. Birdwatchers call then all LBJs (little brown jobs) because they are usually so difficult to tell apart."
Williams has received 49 Academy Award nominations throughout his career. He is the only living person to do so. He won five of them. Williams has received the most nominations for Academy Awards of any person except for Walt Disney.
"Williams has also won 4 Golden Globe Awards, 7 British Academy Film Awards and 21 Grammy Awards. Williams was honored with the annual Richard Kirk award at the 1999 BMI Film and TV Awards, recognizing his contribution to movies and television music."
"Williams is an honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi, the national fraternity for college band members. Williams was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame in 2000, and was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004."
Superman
"Superman is a famous comic book character, and is often known as the first modern superhero character. He was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1932, while they were still in high school. He first appeared in ""Action Comics"" issue #1 in 1938. Later, he appeared in movies, television series, cartoons, commercials, video games, and radio shows. Superman is one of the most popular superheroes, he is also in the DC Comics. As a superhero he does not want to kill anyone. But he was forced to kill his nemesis general Zod as Zod was about to kill people. Like other characters in the DC Universe, there have been several alternative versions of Superman over the years. Several actors have played Superman in motion pictures and TV series including Bud Collyer, Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Tim Daly, Tom Welling, Brandon Routh, Henry Cavill, and Tyler Hoechlin."
Superman's Real Life Origins.
"Mr. Siegel imagined an evil villain who read minds and dreamed of conquering the world. He went by the name of the Superman. In the 1930s, Hitler, the infamous nazi villain from real life, was talking about getting rid of the Jews and communists. This was because he believed that Germans he called Aryans were supermen. Mr. Siegel, who was Jewish, found this disgusting. But one night, Mr. Siegel tossed and turned in his bed, and had a horrible time getting to sleep. When he awoke, Superman became the superman we know today, and the evil version disappeared."
Story.
"Superman was born on a planet called Krypton. His name was Kal-El. When his father, Jor-El, found out that their planet was going to explode, Jor-El sent his baby son to Earth in a spacecraft to save him. Kal-El was found and adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They named him Clark Kent. The Kents raised him as their own son in a town called Smallville, Kansas in the United States. (There is a television series called ""Smallville"" about his time growing up there)"
"As he grows up, Clark finds out that he has special powers. He is almost invulnerable (most things cannot hurt him). He is strong enough to lift almost anything and he can fly. Superman can also run and move faster than a bullet. He has X-ray vision (he can see through walls, he is not able to see through lead), and heat vision (shooting heat from his eyes). He can freeze things with his frost breath and his super-breath (which allows him to blow super hard). He decides to use his special powers to fight crime and save people in danger. He wears a blue and red costume and cape to keep his alter ego (his real name) a secret. He saves the entire world many times."
"Superman moves to a city called Metropolis, and becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, a newspaper. He falls in love with another reporter, Lois Lane."
"His weaknesses are radioactive rocks from his home planet that are called ""kryptonite""; and magic. Sometimes his enemies use it to hurt him. Diffferent Kryptoinites have different effects on him, Blue Kryptonite makes people able to control him using hypnosis, green weakens his powers and slowly kills him, black makes him evil, and red has many different effects on him (each piece of red kryptonite affects him differently). There is also gold, white, and jewel kryptonite. Some of Superman's enemies use magic to hurt him."
Affiliations.
Enemies.
"His most well known arch enemy is a bald (hairless), evil genius named Lex Luthor. He has other deadly enemies too. Bizarro is a failed duplicate of superman. Darkseid is a very powerful enemy, and the ruler of the planet Apokolips. Another enemy includes General Zod who comes from the same planet as Superman."
Teams.
"Superman also founded the Justice League of America alongside Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawkgirl, Hawkman, and Martian Manhunter."
Camellia
"Camellia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae, native to eastern and southern Asia from the Himalaya east to Japan and Indonesia. Scientists are still discussing how many species there are. The number of species varies between 100 and 250. Linnaeus named the genus inhonour of Fr. Georg Joseph Kamel, a Jesuit botanist. amel brought C. japonica from Manila to Spain."
"They are evergreen shrubs and small trees from 2–20 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, thick, serrated, usually glossy, and 3–17 cm long. The flowers are large and conspicuous, 1–12 cm diameter, with (in natural conditions) 5–9 petals; colour varies from white to pink and red, and yellow in a few species. The fruit is a dry capsule subdivided into 1–5 compartments, each containing 1–8 seeds."
"The genus is generally adapted to acidic soils, and does not grow well on chalk or other calcium-rich soils. Most species also have a high rainfall requirement and will not tolerate drought."
"""Camellia"" species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of butterfly species."
Cultivation and uses.
"""Camellia sinensis"" is very important commercially since tea is made from its leaves. Tea oil is a sweet seasoning and cooking oil made by pressing the seeds of ""Camellia sinensis"" or ""Camellia oleifera""."
"Many other camellias are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers; about 3,000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected, many with double flowers, as in the gallery below. ""Camellia japonica"" (often simply called Camellia) is the most prominent species in cultivation, with over 2,000 named cultivars; next are ""C. reticulata"", with over 400 named cultivars, and ""C. sasanqua"", with over 300 named cultivars. Popular hybrids include ""C. × hiemalis"" (""C. japonica"" × ""C. sasanqua"") and ""C. × williamsii"" (""C. japonica"" × ""C. salouenensis""). They are highly valued in Japan and elsewhere for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter. Late frosts can damage the flowers."
Camellias have a slow growth rate. Typically they will grow about 30 centimetres a year until mature although this varies depending on variety and location.
"""Camellia japonica"" is the state flower of Alabama as well as the city flower of the Chinese municipality Chongqing."
Magnolia
Magnolia can mean:
Secant (sec) - The secant of an angle is equal to the formula_6 or formula_7.
Cotangent (cot) - The cotangent of an angle is equal to the formula_8 or formula_9.
"Students often use a mnemonic to remember this relationship. The ""sine"", ""cosine"", and ""tangent"" ratios in a right triangle can be remembered by representing them as strings of letters, such as SOH-CAH-TOA:"
Using trigonometry.
"With the sines and cosines, one can answer virtually all questions about triangles. This is called ""solving"" the triangle. One can work out the remaining angles and sides of any triangle, as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known. These laws are useful in all branches of geometry, since ""every polygon may be described as a combination of triangles""."
"Trigonometry is also vital in surveying, in vector analysis, and in the study of periodic functions. It developed from a need to compute angles and distances in fields such as astronomy, mapmaking, surveying, and artillery range finding."
"There is also such a thing as spherical trigonometry, which deals with spherical geometry. This is used for calculations in astronomy, geodesy and navigation."

Monotheism
"Monotheism is the belief in only one god, rather than two or more, which would be polytheism such as Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt and partly Hinduism. Many religions are monotheistic, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Baha'i Faith, Sikhism, Eckankar, Zoroastrianism, Cao Dai and Tenrikyo. Some pagan and neo-pagan religions are also monotheistic. Deism is the belief that a higher being like god exists, but rejects the belief in many gods, revelation, religions, rituals, sacred books (like the Bible or Quran), prophets (like Jesus or Muhammad), etc. Judaism and Zoroastrianism are thought to be the oldest living monotheistic religions."
Polytheism
Polytheism means believing in many gods. A person that believes in polytheism is called a polytheist. A religion with polytheism can be called a polytheistic religion.
"Polytheism is well documented in historical religions of classical antiquity, especially those of ancient Greeks and Romans. Other ancient people who were polytheists include German pagans, Turkic peoples, Ancient Egyptians, the Celts and the Norse."
"There are various polytheistic religions practiced today. Examples include Sanamahism (Meitei paganism), Tengrism, Shinto, Chinese folk religion, Thelma, Wicca, Druidism, Taoism, Asatru and Candomblé."
"Usually, a polytheistic religion has a set of stories about the gods. This is called mythology."
"The opposite of polytheism is monotheism, which is the belief in only one god, practiced by the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, etc."
Nelvana
"Nelvana is a Canadian animation studio. It was founded in 1971 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada by Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert, and Clive A. Smith. The company is now owned by Corus Entertainment. It is named after a local comic book superheroine of the 1940s."
It specialises mainly in the field of child-friendly TV shows and movies. Some of them are:
Jeb Bush
"John Ellis ""Jeb"" Bush (born February 11, 1953) is an American businessman and politician. He served as the 43rd Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007."
"Bush is the second son of former President George H. W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush, the younger brother of former President George W. Bush, and grandson of the late Prescott Bush, United States Senator from Connecticut. Following his father's successful run for Vice President in 1980, he moved to Florida and pursued a career in real estate development. In 1986, Bush was named Florida's Secretary of Commerce, a position he held until his resignation in 1988 to help his father's successful campaign for the Presidency."
"Historically, heavy foods were eaten because most work was manual. Before the industrial revolution, men and women doing hard work needed more calories per day than they need today. At any rate this applies to countries which are highly mechanized. Porridge is a good example of the heavy calorie-laden food which has gradually gone out of favor."
Fresnel lens
"A Fresnel lens is an optical lens, which was originally developed for Lighthouses. It is named after its inventor, French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. The name is pronounced /freɪˈnɛl/ (fray-NELL), the 's' is silent. Before Fresnel, Buffon and Condorcet proposed a similar design, as a way to make large burning lenses."
"The design allows the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the weight and volume of material that would be required in conventional lens design. Compared to earlier lenses, the Fresnel lens is much thinner. More light can pass through. Lighthouses that use these kind of lenses can be seen from farther away."
Giacomo Meyerbeer
"Giacomo Meyerbeer (born near Berlin, 5 September 1791; died Paris, 2 May 1864) was a famous German-born opera composer. He was the most important composer of French Grand opera during the 1830s and 1840s. Although he was tremendously popular in his day, his music is not often played now."
Life.
Early years.
"Meyerbeer was born into a rich Jewish family in Tasdorf (now a part of Rüdersdorf), near Berlin. His father owned large sugar refineries in Berlin and in Italy. His mother also came from a rich family. Her father had been important in Germany’s struggle to be free of the French in 1812 when Napoleon was trying to conquer much of Europe. Giacomo’s mother did a lot of good work trying to help people who were wounded during the Napoleonic wars."
"Many famous people came to the house where Giacomo’s family lived. Some of the visitors were from the royal Prussian court, including the future King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. The naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt also visited them quite often."
"The first piano teacher the boy had was Franz Lauska, who also taught the royal princes. He also had lessons in composition. Meyerbeer first played in public in 1801 playing Mozart's Piano Concerto in D Minor in Berlin. He wrote his first opera in 1810. In the same year he went to Darmstadt to study with the well-known music theorist Abbé Vogler. There he met the young Carl Maria von Weber who was also a pupil of Vogler. He left Vogler in 1811 and tried to get some work in Munich. In 1813 he found he had been offered a job as court composer to the Grand Duke of Hessen. Vogler had probably recommended him for the job. At this time Meyerbeer was better known as a pianist than as a composer. He travelled to London to hear an important pianist based there, namely J.B.Cramer. There he met other famous pianists such as Kalkbrenner and Ferdinand Ries."
Italy.
"In 1816 Meyerbeer went to Italy. He wanted to learn about Italian opera and collect Italian folksongs. While he intended at first to stay only three months, he stayed most of the next nine years. He made some trips back to Germany and Austria during this time. He composed several operas which became very popular. People started to compare him with the famous Rossini. However, in Germany people were not interested in his music. He took his opera ""Il crociato in Egitto"" to London and then to Paris, where it was a success. The opera is remembered now for being the last opera ever to have a part for a castrato singer."
"He was becoming well-known now. Spontini asked him to compose an opera for Berlin. He became friends, in Paris, with the librettist Eugène Scribe who had a lot of influence in the French theatre."
The Grand Operas.
"From 1825 onwards Meyerbeer spent his life travelling about Europe. He was often in Paris and in Berlin, but did not live in either of these places. He stayed in hotels or private houses wherever he went. One reason why he travelled was because of his health. His wife also had bad health, so they often went to spa towns to try to get better. He also travelled about to watch productions of his operas, and to hear young singers."
"When Carl Maria von Weber died, he left an opera, ""Die drei Pintos"", unfinished. It was sent to Meyerbeer in the hope that he would finish it, but he did not seem interested. In the end Mahler finished it many years later."
"Meyerbeer made changes to ""Il crociato in Egitto"" and turned it into a grand opera for the Opéra in Paris. He changed it from an Italian to a French opera, composing extra dance music and a new overture. He was determined to be famous in Paris."
"In 1826 he married his cousin. They had two children, but they both died when they were very small."
"In 1828 Daniel Auber, a famous French composer of the time, had composed a very popular opera called ""La muette de Portici"". It was the first French grand opera. Meyerbeer realized he could not become really popular by turning his Italian operas into French grand opera, so he took his comic opera ""Robert le Diable"" and changed it into a grand opera. Audiences loved it. Within three years it had been performed in 77 theatres in 10 different countries. Many composers made their own arrangements of some of the tunes from the opera. He was given many honours: the Chevalier of the Legion d’honneur, the title of Prussian Hof Kapellmeister (Director of Music at the Royal Court), and was made a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts and a member of the French Institute."
"Meyerbeer realized that anything else he wrote would have to be really good. In 1836 he produced another opera ""Les Huguenots"". This too was extremely popular."
"In 1842 he went to Boulogne to improve his health. There he met Wagner who asked him for financial help to stage his operas ""Rienzi"" and ""The Flying Dutchman"". Meyerbeer lent him money, but stopped giving him money when he heard that Wagner was secretly criticizing him."
Berlin years.
"When Spontini died Meyerbeer was made Generalmusikdirektor in Berlin. His opera ""Les Huguenots"" had at first been forbidden in Germany, but now it was allowed to be performed. As court composer he wrote a grand opera called ""Ein Feldschlag in Schlesien"" (""A Battle in Silesia""), but it never became internationally famous. The main part in the opera was sung by Jenny Lind."
Return to Paris.
"In 1849 he returned to Paris. He wrote several works together with Scribe, whom Meyerbeer described as the best living librettist, and who was one of his closest friends. His opera ""Le prophète"" (for which Scribe again wrote the words) earned him a lot of money. The great contralto Pauline Viardot-Garcia sang the main part."
"Scribe died in 1861. Meyerbeer worked very hard to try to finish his last opera, ""L’Africaine"". Napoleon III said he wanted the opera to be ready by the winter of 1862-63, but it was not ready until 1864. The work was being rehearsed for its first performance when Meyerbeer suddenly died, without having had the chance to revise it, the way he revised most of his other pieces."
Meyerbeer’s body was taken to Berlin where it was buried in the Jewish cemetery in a vault that belonged to his family.
Meyerbeer’s music.
"Meyerbeer was always more popular in France than in Germany. His operas are about the society of wealthy people. The sounds he made with his orchestra are often deliberately harsh. In this he is like Beethoven in his final years, and Berlioz. Sometimes he used new instruments such as the bass clarinet and the saxophone. He always thought carefully about what his singers were capable of when writing his music. He enjoyed working with different singers, among them Velluti, who was the last of the great operatic castrati. He took great trouble to give his singers rests during the opera so that they would still be in good voice for the climax of the story. He liked scenes with large crowds. He composed his dance music, in particular, very carefully. Often he would throw it away and start again if the dancers were not happy with it."
Integrated Services Digital Network
"Integrated Services Digital Network is an international standard for a communication network. It is often shortened to ISDN. It is used for telephone lines. Before ISDN, telephone lines were mainly seen as a way for people to make phone calls, so the main idea was to use circuit switching. When a phone call is made, a line is set up between the two participants. This phone call is analogue. With ISDN, this view changes. As the signal is now digital ISDN can be used to offer a number of services, which use the telephone line to transport data. There were different services, like telex or teleprinters before ISDN, but they used their own networks. At specific locations, there were gateways between these networks. With ISDN, this changes. There is only one network, and it offers different services. Some of them are for voice, to make phone calls, others are for data, for example to send telefaxes."
Channels.
"ISDN offers a number of data channels, and a signalling channel. The data channels carry the actual service data. The two data channels are completely independent and can be used independently. The usual setup has two such data channels. That way, it is possible to send a fax through one channel, while doing a phone call over the other channel, for example. If the main focus is on a high quality voice connection, the two channels can be combined into one single channel carrying twice the amount of a single channel enhancing the quality dramatically."
For larger companies it is possible to extend the number of data channels to 30 with still one signalling channel.
Werdenberg
"Werdenberg is a historical village in the canton of St. Gallen. It lies just outside Buchs. Today, between 55 and 60 people live there. There are about 40 houses, some of them only used for holidays. Werdenberg has a castle, which is often visited by tourists."
"There was a county of Werdenberg. It included the city itself, the villages of Grabs, Buchs, Sevelen and the right to judge in Wartau. The first count of Werdenberg died in 1182. In 1402, his successors let the county to the Count of Montfort-Tettnang. In 1485, it was sold to the City of Lucerne. In 1517, it was sold to the Canton of Glarus. During Napoleon's reign in Switzerland (called the Helvetic Republic, 1798-1803), Werdenberg was made part of the ""Canton of Linth"" (which also included the modern-day Canton of Glarus, and parts of the Canton of Schwyz). After the end of the reign, Werdenberg was made part of the canton of St. Gallen."
Édouard Manet
"Édouard Manet (pronounced ""edwaʁ manɛ"" in French), 23 January 1832 – 30 April 1883, was a French Impressionist painter. He was one of the first painters of the 19th century to paint subjects of everyday life in the modern world. This made him very important for modern painting, especially for the change from Realism to Impressionism."
"Some of his paintings were very controversial. The paintings ""Lunch on the Grass"" and ""Olympia"" were a starting-point for a group of young painters to develop what would later be called ""Impressionism""."
Life.
Training.
"Édouard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832, to a wealthy family. As he grew up, his uncle encouraged him to paint and draw, but his father wanted him to join the navy. Eventually he was allowed to be trained as a painter. Manet worked from 1850 to 1856 in the studio of the academic painter Thomas Couture a painter of large historical paintings. In his spare time he copied the old masters in the Louvre."
"While he was a student he visited Germany, Ano, and the Netherlands, looking at the paintings of Renaissance and Baroque masters such as Frans Hals, and Spanish painters such as Diego Velázquez and Goya."
"In 1856, Manet opened his own studio. Culo of the best known French painters of that time was Gustave Courbet who painted in a style known as Realism. Courbet, in his pictures, tried to show the life of the poor working people of the farms and villages. Manet began to paint beggars, singers and people in cafes. His style was not like Courbet's because he used large brushstrokes without much detail. Courbet's paintings were dark and somber because he painted all his canvases brown before he put the figures in. Manet's paintings were brighter and lighter, with lots of white paint and often small parts painted in bright blue and red"
"In 1863 Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff, who had been employed by his father to teach piano to Manet and his younger brother Eugene. Suzanne had an eleven year old son, Leon Koella Leenhoff who often posed as a model for Manet's paintings."
Impressionism.
"Every year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition (art show) called the ""Salon de Paris"". In 1863 Manet put a picture into the show called ""Lunch on the Grass"" (""Le déjeuner sur l'herbe""). The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes. If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology, this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits, and the woman's dress and hat were lying on the grass. Perhaps she was a prostitute. The judges said that the painting was indecent (very rude)."
"At this time there were a group of young artists who mainly painted landscapes. They were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin. Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away. They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this. The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the ""Salon des Refuses"" which showed all the pictures that had been ""refused"". Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new ""movement"" in art, quite different from the style that they were used to."
"In 1874 thirty Impressionist artists held their first exhibition. The main artists who are called ""Impressionists"" include Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas and Berthe Morisot. Manet became friendly with Berthe Morisot, who later married his brother Eugene Manet. Manet encouraged Morisot with her painting. Morisot, in turn, encouraged Manet to paint outdoors, in the way that Monet and the other Impressionist painters did. Monet painted some landscapes, seascapes and city scenes in the Impressionist style. However, most of his paintings are ""figurative"" (they are pictures of people)."
"Manet's paintings usually show people going about their ordinary lives. They show people at home and at work, or out and enjoying themselves. One painting is very different. It is a terrible scene showing the execution of the Emperor Maximillian of Mexico by a firing squad."
Manet died of syphilis in Paris at the age of 51. He is buried in the Passy Cemetery in the city.
Khat
"Khat is a flowering plant native to tropical East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is also known as qat, qaat, quat, gat, jaad, chat, chad, chaad and miraa. The plant is grown commercially in Kenya, Ethiopia, Oman, and Yemen."
"Khat is a shrub. When grown commercially, the shrubs grow to a size of about 5m, in the wild they can reach about 20m."
"Khat is used as a stimulant in Eritrea, Somalia, and Yemen the effects are comparable to those of drinking tea or coffee."
Problems.
"There are some problems with Khat. People can become psychologically addicted to the drug. Many anti-drug organisations, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration target this drug. It is illegal to use in many countries, though not in Yemen."
Leader.
"The Government is led by the Prime Minister, who chooses the other Ministers. The Prime Minister and the other most powerful Ministers belong to a group known as the Cabinet, who are the most important decision makers in the Government. These ministers are all members of Parliament (MPs). Laws are made by MPs voting in Parliament, which is called 'legislative authority'. These laws make what is called primary legislation."
"The Prime Minister now is Rishi Sunak, the present leader of the Conservative Party. Liz Truss, the former leader, was only Prime Minister for a short time and had succeeded Boris Johnson, who had been Prime Minister from 2019 until his resignation in 2022."
Election.
"The government is chosen by the people indirectly. The people of the United Kingdom vote in a general election, appointing representatives to the Parliament, at least once every five years. The monarch must select as Prime Minister the person who is likely to have the support of Parliament. By convention, that is normally the leader of the party that has the most MPs in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister leads the government and exercises executive power on behalf of the monarch, in accordance with the laws set by Parliament, including appointing Ministers to the executive branches of government."
"Under the British constitution, laws are made or unmade by Parliament. The policy and administration of the laws is done by the direction of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. This is called executive authority. The monarch is obliged to follow the advice of the government and has not refused to do so since the 17th century. The Cabinet members advise the monarch as part of a group called Privy Council. They also use their power directly as leaders of the Government departments."
The British kind of government is sometimes called parliamentary government.
Local governments.
"There are separate governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, each responsible to their own local parliament. These parliaments have certain limits decided by the main parliament in Westminster. There is no separate English Parliament."
Margaux Hemingway
"Margot Louise Hemingway (February 16, 1954-July 1, 1996), later called Margaux Hemingway, was an American actress and fashion model. She was born in Portland, Oregon. She was the sister of Mariel Hemingway. On July 1, 1996, the day before the anniversary of her grandfather Ernest Hemingway's own suicide, Margaux killed herself: she overdosed with a drug called phenobarbital. She was found dead inside her apartment in Santa Monica, California."
Styx (moon)
"Styx (formerly known as S/2012 (134340) 1 and informally as P5) is a small moon of the dwarf planet Pluto. It was discovered on June 26, 2012, using the Hubble Space Telescope. It is the fifth moon of Pluto discovered so far. The others are Charon, discovered in 1978, Nix and Hydra, which were discovered in 2005, and Kerberos, discovered in 2011."
Discovery.
"The moon was discovered using nine sets of images taken between 26 June and 9 July 2012 by Wide Field Camera 3 of the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA announced the discovery on 11 July 2012. The images were taken as part of a Hubble survey searching for potential hazards for the New Horizons mission. The New Horizons space probe is going to Pluto at the moment and will arrive in July 2015. The discovery of the moon has made scientists worried about the mission. Pluto may have more bodies, such as dust or rings, orbiting it which cannot be found. These bodies could damage the New Horizons probe. The current plan for New Horizons is that it will pass just inside the orbit of Charon. But this could change if scientists think that the space probe will be damaged."
Physical properties.
"The moon is 10 to 25 km across. Because of its small size, it is likely to be irregular in shape. The moon is very faint, about one one-hundred-thousandth as bright as Pluto. The moon is likely to be made of water ice."
Orbital properties.
"Styx orbits the centre of mass of Pluto and Charon at a distance of around 42,000 km. This is in between the orbits of Charon and Nix. The orbital path of the moon is very nearly circular, like the other moons of Pluto. The moon orbits in the same orbital plane as the other moons. The moon takes around 20 days to orbit Pluto."
Origin.
The moon system around Pluto may exist because of a collision of Pluto with a large Kuiper belt body a very long time ago. Pluto’s moons may have formed from the scattered pieces of rock left behind after the collision.
The Doon School
"The Doon School (informally ""Doon School"" or ""Doon"") is a boys-only private boarding school in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. The school was founded by Satish Ranjan Das, a Calcutta lawyer. Doon's first headmaster was Arthur E. Foot, a former science master at Eton College. The present headmaster is Peter McLaughlin, who has occupied the post since 2009 and is the ninth headmaster of the school."
"The school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 13 to 18. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Doon pupils take the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education in tenth grade and are thereafter offered two strands for the final two years: International Baccalaureate (IB) or Indian School Certificate (ISC). The school began offering the IB curriculum only in 2006, before which all pupils had to sit the ISC examinations in twelfth grade."
"Doon has consistently been ranked among the best residential schools of India by media such as ""The Times of India"" and ""Outlook"". Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including President Pratibha Patil, to become coeducational. Former students of the school are commonly known as ""Doscos"". Although the total number of Doscos is relatively small (estimated at 5,000 since the school's founding), they include some of India's most prominent politicians, government officials and business leaders. The best known alumnus is former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi."
Maria Muldaur
"Maria Muldaur (born in New York City, September 12, 1943) is an American singer and songwriter. Her birth name was Maria Grazia Rosa Domenica D'Amato. She is a folk-blues singer who contributed to the revival of American folk music in the early 1960s and recorded the 1974 hit song ""Midnight at the Oasis""."
"Khat is very popular in Yemen. Much of the country's farming resources are used for it because farmers get more money than for other cash crops. It is estimated that 40% of the country's water supply goes towards irrigating it. Its production is said to increase by about 10% to 15% every year. It uses so much water that groundwater levels in the Sana'a basin are getting lower. For this reason, government officials have proposed to move large portions of the population of Sana'a to the coast of the Red Sea."
"Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from growing khat was about 2.5 million Yemeni rials per hectare, while it was only 0.57 million rials per hectare if fruits were grown. This is a strong reason farmers prefer to grow khat over coffee and fruits. It is estimated that between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated grew from 8,000 hectares to 103,000 hectares."
Matsui Keishirō
"Matsui Keishirō (, 28 March 1868 - 4 June 1946) was a Japanese diplomat during the Showa period and later Minister of Foreign Affairs. He graduated from the Law School of Tokyo Imperial University in 1889, and entered the Foreign Ministry the same year. In 1890, he was given a post in the Japanese embassy in Seoul in 1890, and in 1895 was sent to the United States. In April 1889, he served in London. In 1902, he was re-assigned to Beijing. He returned to Japan in 1913."
"During World War I, Matsui served as Japanese Ambassador to France from November, 1915. When he finished this mission, he was awarded with the title of baron (""danshaku"") under the ""kazoku"" peerage system. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 7 January to 11 June 1924 under the government of Kiyoura Keigo."
Country code
"Country codes are in mostly times created by few letters or numbers that represent geographical codes (geocodes) of countries that use certain country code, it is in use in data processing and communications. There are few different systems created for this. The most known is ISO 3166-1. The term ""country code"" in many times refers to international dialing codes, the E.164 country calling codes."
National Capital Region (Canada)
"The National Capital Region () is an official federal name for the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Ontario, and neighbouring Gatineau, Quebec, and the area near them. The National Capital Region has an area of 5,319 square kilometres that straddles the boundary between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The National Capital Region covers an area of 6,287.03 square kilometres (2,427.44 square miles). It has a population of 1,235,324. The Ottawa part of the region is part of the eastern subregion of Ontario. The Ottawa-Gatineau CMA is the only CMA in Canada to include parts of two provinces."
"The National Capital Region is not a separate political jurisdiction, although the National Capital Commission is deeply involved in political, cultural, and land use planning matters in the National Capital Region. Proposals have sometimes been made to separate the National Capital Region from its two respective provinces, and transform it into a separate capital district, like the District of Columbia in the United States or the Australian Capital Territory. Such proposals have never come close to passage, and there does not currently appear to be any political will or necessity to pursue this option."
"Cities, towns, and populations within Ottawa-Gatineau CMA."

Other towns within National Capital Region.
"While not officially in the CMA, the following municipalities (most of which are adjacent to the CMA) are included in the National Capital Region, due to their close economic and social ties with Ottawa."
Gatineau
"Gatineau (as of 2006 census population 242,124) is a city in western Quebec, Canada. It is on the northern bank of the Ottawa River, immediately across from Ottawa, Ontario, within Canada's National Capital Region. Ottawa and Gatineau comprise a single Census Metropolitan Area."
Orientability
"In the Euclidean space, ""R3"" is called orientable if a two-dimensional figure (for example, ) cannot be moved around the surface and back to where it started so that it looks like its own mirror image (). Otherwise the surface is non-orientable. A concept connected to this is chirality. This means that no matter what, a human right hand, cannot be rotated in such a way that it becomes a human left hand. The right hand is therefore orientable."
"Manzanillo, Colima"
Manzanillo is a city in Colima in Mexico. The city has the busiest port in Mexico.
Los Mochis
"Los Mochis is a city in Sinaloa, Mexico. In 2005, the population was 231,977."
Real analysis
"Real analysis is an area of mathematics that deals with sets and sequences of real numbers, as well as functions of one or more real variables. It provides a rigorous logical foundation to calculus, the study of continuous change."
"Theriodonts fall into three main groups: Gorgonopsia, Therocephalia and Cynodontia. Early theriodonts may have been warm-blooded. Early forms were carnivorous, but several later groups became herbivorous during the Triassic."
"Theriodont jaws were more mammal-like than was the case of other therapsids, because their dentary (lower jaw) was larger, which gave them more efficient chewing. Several other bones that were previously on the lower jaw, moved into the ears, allowing the theriodonts to hear better and their mouths to open wider. This made the theriodonts the most successful group of synapsids."
"Eutheriodonts refer to all theriodonts except the gorgonopsians (the most primitive group). They included the therocephalians, cynodonts and their descendants – the mammals. The name means ""true beast tooth"". The eutheriodonts have larger skulls, accommodating larger brains and improved jaw muscles."
"The theriodonts (eutheriodonts) are one of the two synapsid survivors of the great Permian–Triassic extinction event, the other being the dicynodonts. Therocephalians included both carnivorous and herbivorous forms; both died out after the Lower Triassic."
"The remaining theriodonts, the cynodonts, also included carrnivores such as ""Cynognathus"", as well as newly evolved herbivorous Traversodonts. While Traversodonts for the most part remained medium-sized to reasonably large (length of largest species up to 2 meters), the carnivorous forms became progressively smaller as the Triassic progressed."
"By the Upper Triassic the small cynodonts included the rodent-like tritylodonts (possibly related to or descended from travsersodonts), and the tiny, shrew-like, trithelodonts, which evolved into the first mammals. The trithelodonts died out during the Jurassic, and the tritylodonts survived in the Cretaceous, but the mammals continued to evolve. Many mammal groups managed to survive the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event, which wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, allowing the mammals to diversify and dominate the Earth."
Laura Ingraham
"Laura Ingraham (born 19 June 1964) is an American conservative political commentator, author and radio host. Her nationally syndicated talk show ""The Laura Ingraham Show"" was broadcast for nine years on the Talk Radio Network. She has been known for her controversial statements against the left wing party."
Peptide bond
"A peptide bond is a special chemical bond that happens between two amino acids. In the reaction (called condensation), the two amino acids are combined into a ""dipeptide""."
Repenomamus
Repenomamus is the largest known mammal from the Cretaceous period. Its fossil was found in Manchuria.
"There is good evidence that it fed on dinosaurs. It is not known whether ""Repenomamus"" was a hunter or a scavenger."
Life style.
"""Repenomamus"" was carnivorous. A specimen of ""R. robustus"" has been discovered with the fragmentary skeleton of a juvenile ""Psittacosaurus"" preserved in its stomach."
"This is the strongest evidence that Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs, though there were earlier indications of this."
"The larger species, ""R. giganticus"", is the largest mammal known from the Cretaceous. ""R. giganticus"" was more than 1 metre (39 inches) long and weighed about 12–14 kg (26–31 lb). Its skull measures 16 cm (6.25 in) long, its body 52 cm (20.5 in), and the preserved part of its tail 36 cm (14 in)."
Discovery.
"The fossils were recovered from the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation in the Liaoning Province of China, renowned for its extraordinarily well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs. They have been dated to 130 million years ago, during the Lower Cretaceous period."
"""Repenomamus"" is a genus of triconodonts, a group of mammaliaformes with no modern relatives."
Frederick William III of Prussia
Frederick William III () (3 August 1770 – 7 June 1840) was king of Prussia from 1797 to 1840.
Life.
"Frederick William was born in Potsdam in 1770 as the son of Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia and Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was considered to be a shy and reserved boy,"
"As a soldier he received the usual training of a Prussian prince, obtained his lieutenancy in 1784, became a colonel in 1790, and took part in the campaigns against France of 1792-1794. On December 24, 1793, Frederick William married Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They had ten children. In the ""Kronprinzenpalais"" (Crown Prince's palace) in Berlin, Frederick William lived a civil life with a problem-free marriage, which did not change even when he became King of Prussia in 1797."
Reign.
He succeeded to the throne on 16 November 1797 and took over personal power without giving responsibility to his ministers. Unfortunately he was not able to follow a consistent course for himself.
His sense of duty can be seen from this quote:
"Bailey represented Doctor Sam Sheppard on appeal after Sheppard was convicted of murdering his wife. Bailey managed to get Sheppard a retrial, in which Bailey was successful in getting Sheppard acquitted. Bailey was the lead lawyer in successfully defending in the court martial for the My Lai Massacre. Bailey, along with others, successfully defended O. J. Simpson in the trial where Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown."
"In 2014, the Maine State Bar Association and the Maine Supreme Judicial Court denied Bailey's petition to have his law license reinstated."
"Bailey died in Atlanta, Georgia on June 3, 2021, one week before his 88th birthday."
Stuffed animal fetishism
"Stuffed animal fetishism (or ""plushophilia"") is a sexual attraction to stuffed animals. People who have this fetish are sometimes called ""plushies"". People who have a stuffed animal fetish are sometimes thought of as furries."
Albert Einstein Square
"Albert Einstein Square (, ""Kikar Albert Einstein"") is a public square in Jerusalem, Israel. it is located in the entrance of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities at the Talbiya neighborhood in Jerusalem."
Albert Einstein visited Palestine in 1923 for 12 days. He gave the first lecture at the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
"Einstein was in favor of the Hebrew University, as well as Zionism and education in general. This is the reason the square is named for him. Also, a statue of Einstein is nearby in the gardens of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities."
Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on February 3, 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment (Amendment XVI) to the United States Constitution allows the Congress to impose a federal income tax. This allows the federal government to collect a tax on personal income, no matter where that income came from. The Sixteenth Amendment overturned the 1895 Supreme Court landmark decision in ""Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co"". In ""Pollock"", the Court ruled that a 2 percent tax on incomes over $4,000 was unconstitutional. This was because the law the ruling struck down did not allow for apportionment, the court ruled against it. The Sixteenth Amendment allowed Congress to levy a uniform direct income tax without being subject to apportionment."
Background.
"When the framers of the Constitution were determining how the new government would be funded, they were trying to avoid a tax based on a person's income. In the Constitution, Article one, Sections 2 and 9 created the ""rule of apportionment"". On a practical basis this required Congress to tax the states based on each state's population instead of a tax on each person's income or property. For example, if a state made up four percent of the total population, they would be required to pay four percent of the total federal tax. The framers of the Constitution expected direct taxes to be used and defined the term broadly. However, they did not see that apportionment would cripple any attempt to collect direct taxes."
"Before 1913, the bulk of federal revenues came from indirect taxes on goods. These include tariffs on goods imported into the country. They also included excise taxes on items like whiskey. Income taxes were not new in 1913. Congress had passed the Revenue Act of 1861 during the Civil War to help pay for the war. Ten years later it was allowed to lapse. The Confederate States of America also had an income tax. Starting in 1863, the tax exempted the first $1,000 and charged a 1% tax on the first $1,500 over the exemption. A 2% tax was levied on all income over that amount."
"In 1894, Congress passed the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act which included a flat rate federal income tax of 2 percent. A year later, the Supreme Court handed down their decision in ""Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co."". They ruled the tax unconstitutional because it was a direct tax and not apportioned to the population of each state."
A constitutional income tax.
"On June 16, 1909, President Taft sent a message to the Senate which read:"
"After a debate on the floor of the House lasting five hours, the bill was passed 314-14 (1 vote as ""present"" and 55 not voting). It was then sent to the state legislatures for ratification. The amendment gave Congress the power to apply a direct tax, based on people's incomes, and not subject to the apportionment rule."
Effects of the Sixteenth Amendment.
"The largest and most direct effect of the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment was it shifted power from the states to the national government. States had income taxes before the national government did. This kept the national government weaker due to having less revenue than the states. Without the Sixteenth Amendment, the national government would find it far more difficult to extend its military power to other parts of the world."
Def Jam Vendetta
"Def Jam Vendetta is a 2003 professional wrestling video game published by Electronic Arts and developed by AKI Corporation and EA Canada. It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube.

It featured hip hop musicians from the Def Jam Records label as fighters. The engine for the game was first designed for a sequel to EA's ""WCW Mayhem"", but EA lost their WCW license when WCW was bought by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2001."
Reception.
"IGN rated the game a 8.9 out of 10. Jon Robinson of IGN said that the multiplayer was ""smooth"" and ""slick"". GameSpot rated the game 8.4 out of 10. Alex Navarro of GameSpot said ""As a wrestling game, Def Jam Vendetta manages to succeed on most every level, providing surprisingly deep gameplay, quality graphics and sound, and a distinctive atmosphere""."
Hassan al-Turabi
"Hassan 'Abd Allah al-Turabi (c.1932 – 5 March 2016) was a Sudanese religious and Islamist political leader in Sudan. He has been called ""one of the most important figures in modern Sudanese politics"". He was born in Kassala, Sudan. Al-Turabi was leader of what was called the National Islamic Front (NIF). He served as Speaker of the National Assembly serving from 1996 through 1999. He later served as Secretary General of the Popular Congress Party from 1999 until his death in 2016."
"Al-Turabi died in Khartoum, Sudan on 5 March 2016. He was aged 84."

Oxford English Dictionary
"The Oxford English Dictionary (or OED) is a dictionary. It is published by the Oxford University Press in England, and is the largest English dictionary."
"It traces (or follows in detail) the historical development of the English language, and is a resource to writers and scholars. It describes how the language has been used."
"The second edition came to 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, published in 1989. Number of main entries is 231,100 and number of main entries for out-of -date words is 47,100."
"Work began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was not until 1884 that it began to be published in parts, under the name of ""A New English Dictionary on historical principles; founded mainly on the materials collected by the Philological Society"". In 1895, the title ""The Oxford English Dictionary"" (""OED"") was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes. In 1933, ""The Oxford English Dictionary"" was reprinted as twelve volumes with a one-volume supplement. More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published. Since 2000, a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately a third of which is now complete."
"The first electronic version of the dictionary was done in 1988. The online version has been available since 2000, and as of April 2014 was receiving over two million hits per month. The third edition of the dictionary will probably only appear in electronic form; Nigel Portwood, chief executive of Oxford University Press, feels it unlikely that it will ever be printed."
Thomas Beecham
"Sir Thomas Beecham (born St Helens, Lancashire, 29 April 1879; died London, 8 March 1961) was an English conductor. He was one of the most famous conductors of his time. He came from a very rich family and was able to use his money to pay orchestras that he formed. He formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He was especially well known for conducting the music of Mozart as well as that of his friend Delius."
He often made funny jokes and many amusing stories are told about things that he said.
Early life.
"Beecham was born in 1879 in St. Helens, Lancashire in the north of England. Beecham was self-taught as a conductor. He had some private composition lessons from Charles Wood in London and Moszkowski in Paris. Beecham’s father, Sir Joseph Beecham, had made a lot of money making medicines (the famous Beecham pills) and he also liked music, so he was able to help his son in his career as a musician."
"Thomas was only 20 years old when his father was reinstated as mayor of St. Helens. To celebrate this, his father paid for the Hallé Orchestra to give a concert. It was going to be conducted by the famous German conductor Hans Richter. However, a few days before the concert it was announced that Richter was ill. Thomas immediately said he would conduct the concert. The orchestra at first refused to play for a 20 year old who had only once ever conducted a concert, but in the end they changed their minds and the concert was a great success."
Early career.
"In 1909 Thomas got a group of musicians together to form the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. They gave concerts and played for ballets and operas. Beecham conducted operas in Covent Garden and other London opera houses. He conducted works by composers such as Strauss, Delius, Smythe and Holbrooke. He also played for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes when they first came to England."
"During World War I he gave money to the Halle Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Society, all of which he conducted. He often conducted these orchestras outside London, giving people the chance to hear music they had never heard before."
"For several years he had money problems and did not conduct much. Then, in 1932, he formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and quickly made it into an excellent orchestra. They toured Germany in 1936 and the next year went to Paris. During the 1930s he conducted at Covent Garden where he had control of everything that went on. He conducted several cycles of Wagner’s Ring. When World War II started in 1939 the theatre was closed. He went to the United States where he conducted several orchestras including the New York Philharmonic. He also went to Australia."
Later career.
"In 1944 he returned to Britain. His orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, were now a self-governing body (the members themselves made decisions about what the orchestra should do and play). They decided that they did not want Beecham because he would want to have power to rule the orchestra in the way he wanted. So Beecham formed another orchestra: the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He gave many concerts, toured with them and made many great recordings. He was especially known for his concerts of Joseph Haydn and Mozart. He also conducted Die Meistersinger at Covent Garden in 1951 as well as appearing at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 1958. The last concert he gave was on 7 May 1960 when he conducted the RPO in Portsmouth."
His fame.
"Beecham was an enormously talented musician. Because he had a lot of money he did not need to go through the musical education that most other musicians have. He formed his own life, and spent a lot of his energy as well as money creating the right conditions for musicians to work in, conditions that would have been normal in many other European countries, but which were not normal at the time in England."
"He was not interested in the music of Bach, though he did conduct Handel. He was famous for his Mozart performances, and particularly enjoyed playing Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Bizet and Dvořák. He was one of the first people in England to conduct the new music of Richard Strauss and Sibelius. He was a close friend of Delius and performed his music as well as editing it so that it could be published."
There are many stories about the witty things that he said. He was knighted in 1916.
Famous quotations.
A lady told Beecham that she wanted her son to learn to play a musical instrument but did not want to hear the awful sound it made when he was beginning to learn. She asked him what instrument he should learn. Beecham said he should learn the bagpipes because “they sound exactly the same when you have finished learning them as when you start learning them”.
Beecham was rehearsing a very long opera by Wagner. They had been rehearsing for a long time. Beecham took out his watch and said: “My God! We have been playing for two hours and we are still playing this bloody tune!”
"Beecham was rehearsing an opera by an English composer. The composer was at the rehearsal, and kept stopping the orchestra and asking Beecham to play it differently. Each time Beecham turned back to the orchestra and said: “The same again, gentlemen, please”."

Barry Marshall
"Barry James Marshall, AC, FRS, FAA (born 30 September 1951) is an Australian doctor and winner of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He is Professor of Clinical Microbiology at the University of Western Australia. Marshall is well known for proving that bacteria ""Helicobacter pylori"" are the cause of most stomach ulcers. This changed years of medical belief which said that ulcers were caused by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid. He has recently taken a part-time position at the Pennsylvania State University."
Early years.
"Marshall was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. He lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of seven. He went to high school at Newman College, Perth. At the University of Western Australia, medicine and surgery. He married his wife, Adrienne, in 1972. In 1972 he was also the Western Australian state yo-yo champion."
Life and research.
"In 1979 Marshall became a Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital. At the hospital he met Robin Warren, a pathologist who was interested in gastritis. They were both training in internal medicine at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981. Together they looked at spiral bacteria in gastritis. In 1982 they grew a culture of ""H. pylori"". They worked on their idea that there was a bacterial cause of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. Their idea was laughed at by scientists and doctors who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic stomach. Marshall said that ""Everyone was against me, but I knew I was right"". Other doctors said they wouldn't believe it until the ""H. pylori"" idea could be proved."
"Marshall and Warren tried to give the bacteria to piglets in 1984, but it did not work. Marshall drank some of the bacteria and soon developed gastritis with achlorhydria. He had stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting and bad smelling breath. On the 14th day of the infection, biopsies of Marshall's stomach did not show any bacteria. His body may have got rid of the bacteria without help. His wife made him take antibiotics immediately so there was no way of checking the negative result again. He did not develop antibodies to H.pylori. This means that natural immunity can sometimes get rid of H.pylori infection. His illness and recovery, showed the link between ""H. pylori"" and gastritis, but not for peptic ulcer. This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia and is among the most cited articles from the journal."
"After this work at Fremantle Hospital, Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital (1985-86) and at the University of Virginia, USA (1986-1996), before going back to Australia. He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia from 1998-2003. He is still looking at ""H. pylori"" and runs the H.pylori Research Laboratory at UWA."

"In 2005, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm gave the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren for finding the bacterium ""Helicobacter pylori"" and its part in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease."
Marshall was given other awards including:
He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007.
Diglossia
"Diglossia is when a group of people have two languages or dialects that they use. One is the common language they use every day, and the other is either a much older version from centuries before (for example, Arabic or Chinese) or a similar but clearly different modern-day version (for example, Norwegian with Bokmål and Nynorsk)."
Mutual intelligibility
Mutual intelligibility is where the speakers of one language can understand another language because they are alike. This is sometimes (but not always) used to decide whether they are different languages or different dialects.
"There are noticeable differences in accent, vocabulary, and spelling between British and General American English, but speakers can largely understand each other without serious problems. These dialects are therefore mutually intelligible."
"Sometimes, even different languages can be mutually intelligible.Hindi and Urdu are called different languages, but speakers of both languages can largely understand each other if they are using everyday language. This is because the two languages used to be dialects of Hindustani, the official language of British India until India became independent. Since the two languages are so alike, they are sometimes called together as Hindi-Urdu."
"Also, dialects of a certain language can sometimes be mutually unintelligible. Chinese, for example, has hundreds of different dialects, and many native speakers of those dialects cannot understand each other without knowing the other's dialect. For example, the local dialects of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong are Mandarin, Shanghainese/Wu Chinese, and Cantonese/Yue in that same order. If natives from each of these cities were to talk to each other in their native dialects, they would not understand each other. This is because they are too different from each other. This is why the governments of China and Taiwan want their citizens to speak Standard Mandarin in public so that there can be a spoken dialect of Chinese everyone can understand. While the spoken dialects are mutually unintelligible, they all use the same written code, Chinese characters, so they can understand each other if they write to each other."
"Henry the Navigator started by paying Portuguese sailors to explore the west coast of Africa. In 1419 Joao Goncalves Zarco discovered the Madeira Islands. Later in the 15th century, Vasco da Gama reached the southwestern tip of Africa and established the city of Cape Town, a Portuguese colony. This opened the way to the Indian Ocean. In the next two centuries, the Portuguese created a great trading empire on coasts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and India. The Portuguese Empire eventually weakened after the Dutch East India Company rose as the major power in Indian Ocean trade."
Spanish Empire.
"In a hurry to compete with Portugal for a colonial empire, Spain sent Christopher Columbus to the opposite route of the Portuguese. Instead of going south along the west coast of Africa, Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean. He believed that he came to Asia. Later, some Spanish sailors found out that this land was a different continent than Asia. It is now called the Americas."
"In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadores gained the whole of what later became Latin America, except some British and French colonies in northeastern South America, and Brazil, which belonged to Portugal. The Spanish concentrated on conquest, unlike the Portuguese who focused on trading. They eventually developed a vast colonial empire, in contrast to the Portuguese who ruled a few islands and coastal cities along the Indian Ocean. When Spain and Portugal were united under King Philip II of Spain , their combined empire was the largest on earth."
In 1522 the fleet of Ferdinand Magellan returned to Spain. The survivors were the first ever to sail all the way around the world.
"Britain, France, and the Netherlands."
"In the 17th century, political and religious wars with Britain, France, and the Netherlands weakened the Iberian Peninsula. These three nations emerged as the main winners of the wars and became major powers like Spain and Portugal. In the next two centuries, the world became a battlefield of the three nations. Britain and France held land in North America, in India and other distant places. The Dutch colonized smaller parts of the Americas, took the former Portuguese trading centers around the Indian Ocean, and conquered Indonesia. These three new great powers also had influence all around the world."
"Eventually, the result was a series of wars that were fought both in Europe and overseas, with Britain emerging victorious. The British took the former land of French Canada and India in the 18th century. They seized power in the Indian Ocean and defeated the Dutch navy. By 1763, the British Empire had become the second global empire after Spain. However, in 1776, thirteen colonies of British America declared independence. With help from the French, Dutch and Spanish, they defeated Britain in the American Revolution."
Exploration of the Southern Pacific Ocean.
"In 1778, Captain James Cook of Britain sailed across the South Pacific Ocean looking for a mysterious continent in the Southern Hemisphere. He landed on two large islands. Then he sailed west and found a bigger piece of land. The first, was modern New Zealand; the second was Australia. Captain Cook claimed these lands for Britain. He then explored the Pacific world for another year and died in a fight with the Hawaiians."
Effects of the Age of Discovery.
"Many slaves brought from Africa were brought to the Americas which was claimed to be found by Christopher Columbus himself. In conclusion, the Portuguese were weakened after the Dutch rose in the Indian Ocean trade route. Spain gained almost all of Latin America and a massive amount of silver."
"When Christopher Columbus tried to find a new trade route to Asia, he thought that he could travel around the world. Instead, he had found a New World. Vikings had briefly visited Vinland around 1000 A.D."
Persian lime
"Persian Lime (""Citrus x latifolia""), also known as Tahiti lime or Bearss lime is a kind of citrus fruit. It is the primary citrus fruit grown commercially in the U.S. It is sold simply as a ""lime"". The fruit is about 6 cm in diameter. Very often, it has slightly nippled ends. It is usually sold quite green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. It is larger, thicker-skinned, and less aromatic than the key lime. The key lime is grown more often worldwide. The Persian lime is bigger than the key lime, and has fewer seeds. The plant is also hardier, and has no thorns on the bushes. The fruit also has a longer shelf life."
"Persian limes are less acidic than key limes and do not have the bitterness that lends to the key lime's unique flavour. Persian limes are sold primarily in six sizes, known as 110's, 150's, 175's, 200's, 230's and 250's. They are grown primarily in Florida in the U.S. The Persian lime became more important when key lime orchards were wiped out by a hurricane in 1926. Persian lime orchards themselves were devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Large numbers of Persian limes are grown, processed and exported every year primarily from Martínez de la Torre, Veracruz, Mexico, to the American, European and Asian markets. U.S. Persian lime imports from Mexico are handled mostly through McAllen, Texas."

Kaffir lime
"The Kaffir lime (""Citrus hystrix ""DC., Rutaceae), also known as kieffer lime, makrut or magrood, is a citrus fruit native to Indonesia. It is widely grown worldwide as a garden shrub. It is usually grown it for its fruit, the lime. The leaves are used for cooking. Vegetable oil obtained from the leaves is used to make perfumes."
The plant.
"The plant is a very thorny bush with aromatic leaves. The oil obtained from the rind of the fruit can be used as an insecticide. The plant is well suited to being grown in a container. The green fruits are different from other limes because of their bumpy and rough exterior. They are also quite small, about 4 centimetres across. The leaves are shaped like an hourglass. The leaves and the leaf-shaped stem are widely used in the cuisine of Cambodia, Thailand and Laos."
"""Citrus x hystrix"" leaves are also popular in Cambodia but less so in Vietnam. Malay, Burmese and Indonesian (especially Balinese and Javanese; see also Indonesian bay leaf) cuisines use them sporadically with chicken and fish."
The leaves can be used fresh or dried and can be stored frozen.
"Although the most common product of the ""Citrus x hystrix"" tree is its leaves (which give a sharp Lime/neroli flavour to Cambodian base paste known as Krueng, Thai dishes such as tom yum and Indonesian food such as sayur assam - literally ""sour vegetables""), the juice and rind of the small, dark-green gnarled fruit (known as jeruk obat - literally ""medicine citrus"") are used in traditional Indonesian medicine."
"The zest is widely used in Creole cuisine and to impart flavour to ""arranged"" rums on Réunion and Madagascar."

Terminology.
"""The Oxford Companion to Food"" () recommends that the name ""kaffir lime"" should be avoided in favour of ""makrut lime"" because ""Kaffir"" is an offensive term in certain cultures and also has no clear reason for being attached to this plant. However ""kaffir lime"" appears to be much more common."
Cooling.
"Cooling is when an object gets cold, or lowers in temperature. This can happen by taking away heat, or by putting something in a place with a lower temperature. Fluids used to cool objects are called coolants."
Air cooling is making the temperature of an object lower using air. This will only work if the air is at a lower temperature than the object. The process will work better if there is more surface area on the object or if the item's mass can be made smaller.
"Other ways to cool objects include using ice, dry ice, or liquid nitrogen. This works by convection; the heat is taken from the relatively warm object to the relatively cold coolant."
Electrical conductivity
"Electrical conductivity is the measure of a material's ability to allow the transport of an electric charge. Its SI is the ""siemens per meter"", (A2s3m−3kg−1) (named after Werner von Siemens) or, more simply, Sm−1."
It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. It is equivalent to the electrical conductance measured between opposite faces of a 1-metre cube of the material under test.
"Electrical conductance is an electrical phenomenon where a material contains movable particles with electric charge (such as electrons), which can carry electricity. When a difference of electrical potential is placed across a conductor, its electrons flow, and an electric current appears."
"A conductor such as a metal has high conductivity, and an insulator like glass or a vacuum has low conductivity. A semiconductor has a conductivity that varies widely under different conditions."
Electrical conductivity is the reciprocal (or inverse) of electrical resistivity.

"Started in 1999 as nba.com TV, the channel, which had its studios at NBA Entertainment in Secaucus, New Jersey, began a multi-year deal with American television companies Cox Communications, Cablevision, and Time Warner on June 28, 2003, allowing the network to expand to 45 million American homes, and 30 different countries. NBA TV replaced Time Warner's CNN/SI on many cable systems after that network shut down a year earlier."
Programming.
"NBA TV offers basketball news every day, as well as programming showcasing basketball players' individual lifestyles, life as a basketball team during an NBA season, famous games of the past, and live games typically four days a week during the NBA season. Live games on NBA TV are subject to local blackout restrictions, since NBA TV does not have exclusive broadcast rights to any of its games. Games carried by NBA TV are always also carried by each team's local rights holder."
"The channel also shows international games, typically on Saturday evenings, with special emphasis on the Euroleague and the Maccabi Tel Aviv team from Israel. In April 2005, the channel televised the Chinese Basketball Association finals for the first time."
"NBA TV carries at least 90 regular-season games per season, all broadcast in high definition, as well as some first-round playoff games. It also broadcasts WNBA games nationally (subject to local blackout)."
"The channel's flagship program is ""NBA Gametime Live"", a show in which a host and studio analysts go over the latest news, highlights, and look in at games in progress. The show is live six days a week, not airing on most Thursdays due to NBA's coverage of ""The NBA on TNT"". An edited one hour/thirty minute version of the broadcast is repeated throughout the late night/early morning hours."
Personalities.
The studio host and analysts vary every night on NBA Gametime Live.
Ownership.
"On October 8, 2007, it was reported that Turner Sports, a division of Time Warner, was to take over the channel's operations, according to"
Hoopsworld:
"""NBATV: Surprisingly there has been little said about the NBA's decision to sell off NBATV to one of its media partners. Talks had gone on for as ESPN/ABC and Turner both explored scenarios with the league. Ultimately it seems Turner has won out, and will take over operation of the league's flagship cable channel, that reaches some 12 million subscribers. The exact changeover date is not clear, but several months ago a Bloomberg report cited sources saying senior level producers were offered contract buyouts in September."""
"Turner Sports relaunched the channel on October 28, 2008, using analysts carried over from NBA on TNT."
"The studio was also upgraded, and the show now airs live from Studio B at Turner Studios in Atlanta, Georgia; Studio B is adjacent to Studio J, home of Inside the NBA."
International presence.
"In 2001, Raptors NBA TV begin airing in Canada. Although quite similar to NBA TV, there is a larger focus on the Toronto Raptors basketball team, due to Canadian content requirements and restrictions on foreign ownership (the channel is owned by Raptors parent company Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, not the league)."
"As of 2010, NBA TV coverage can be seen in 40 countries via the following partners:"
NBA TV HD.
"NBA TV HD is a 1080i high definition simulcast of NBA TV. All studio programs and original shows are shot in HD, and all live games and recent game rebroadcasts are shown in HD. For programs not available in HD (such as older game footage), unique stylized pillarboxes are used, the NBA logo with ""NBA TV"" under it, or alternately, just ""NBA TV"" sideways. Both are in black and gray"
New carriage agreements.
"On April 16, 2009, it was announced that DirecTV and the NBA reached a new carriage agreement. NBA TV was moved from the satellite television provider's add-on Sports Pack (and premium subscription package NBA League Pass) to its lower priced base package Choice Xtra on October 1, 2009. DirecTV believes the move will make the channel available to an additional 8 million subscribers."
"On June 4, 2009, it was announced that the NBA and Comcast have reached a deal to move the channel from the cable company's add-on Sports Entertainment Package to its basic level Digital Classic package, by the start of the 2009-10 NBA season. Comcast believes an additional 8 million customers will now have access to the channel."
"Verizon FiOS added the channel and NBA League Pass for the first time on September 23, 2009."
"The channel also signed new multiyear agreements with Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, and Dish Network on October 22, 2009. They also reached a new deal with Cox Cable earlier this year."

Groups.
"There are a number of Pygmy groups living in Africa. The three best-known groups are the Mbenga, Mbuti, and Twa groups. Each big group includes several tribes that have their own language."
"The Mbenga people, sometimes called the ""Ba-Mbenga"", live in the western Congo basin. The Mbenga include the Aka people, who speak the Aka language. The Aka live in the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo. The M-Benzélé people, or ""western Aka"", and the Ba-Sese people, ""eastern Aka"", are also related."
"Other Mbenga pygmies are the Baka people of Cameroon, Gabon, and Republic of Congo. They speak three very similar languages: Baka language, Ganzi language, and Gundi language. Another group of Mbenga pygmies are the Gyele people. The Gyele live in Cameroon and speak Gyele language."
"The Mbuti people, sometimes called the ""Bambuti"", live in the Ituri rainforest in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. They include the Efé people, Asua people, and the Kango people. The Efé speak the Efé language. The Asua speak the Asoa language. The Kango speak the Kango language."
"The Twa people, or ""Ba-Twa"", live in Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda. The Twa speak Kirundi and Kinyarwanda."
Itihasa
"In Sanskrit, Itihasa means history. For Hindus, an Itihasa is a story that tells about what happened in the past in the land of India. Itihasas are usually epic poems. The important itihasas to Hindus are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Modern excavations and archaeological evidences are slowly beginning to find evidences to prove these Indian epics as actual history."
"The original meaning of Itiihaasa had a more precise connotation than the word History. The etymology attested to by Panini indicates itiha to mean ‘thus indeed, in this tradition’ ."
"One of the earliest references to Itihaasa in the literature of antiquity is in Chanakyas’s Arthashastra. Our investigations lead us to believe that the Maurya empire for which he was the preceptor began in 1534 BCE. He defines Itihaasa, in the context of the syllabus prescribed for training of a Prince, with the following words;"
पुराणमितिव्रुत्तमाख्यायिकोदाहरणं धर्मशास्त्रं चेतीतिहासः
"Puraana (the chronicles of the ancients), Itivrtta (history), Akhyayika (tales), Udaaharana (illustrative stories), Dharmashastra (the canon of Righteous conduct), and Arthashastra (the science of Government) are known by (comprise the corpus of Itihaasah, ) History"
"Kautilya’s Arthashastra, Book 1, Chapter 5"
"Thus, History in this definition takes on the meaning more akin to the sense of Historiography and is perhaps even more eclectic and appears to indicate a superset of political science and History as we use them today. We feel vindicated therefore in calling our forthcoming conference a conference on Indian History ( http://www.india-forum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=2088), since we seem to ascribe the same broad meaning that Kautilya did 3 millennia ago."
"The quintessential quote is that of Kalhana in the Rajatarangini,12th century CE (1147 to 1149 CE) who is regarded as a modern in Indian parlance"
धर्मार्थ काममोक्षाणामुपदेश समान्वितं ।
पुरावृत्तं कथायुत्तरूपमितिहासं प्रचक्षते ।।
“Dharmaartha-kaama-moskshanaam upadesa-samanvitam |
"Puraa-vrttam, kathaa-yuttarupam Ithihaasah prachakshate ||”"
"History will be the narration of events as they happened, in the form of a story, which will be an advice to the reader to be followed in life, to gain the purusaarthas namely Kama the satiation of desires through Artha the tool, by following the path of Dharma the human code of conduct to gain Moksha or liberation."
"Clearly there is an emphasis on the traditions and on the utilitarian aspect of History, embedded in the etymology of Itihaasa. The reason we draw emphasis to the ambiguity in the use of the word History is that, in our usage, while we adhere to the broader usage of the word History, it makes for clarity in usage if the Civilizational aspects are distinguished into distinct categories"
Bhakti yoga
"Bhakti yoga is a Hindu spiritual practice. People constantly pray to, and think about, a form of a Hindu god, usually Vishnu."
"Bhakti is a Sanskrit term. It signifies an attitude of devotion to God. The relation between man and God is imagined as a beloved-lover, friend-friend, parent-child, and master-servant. The Bhakta worships his chosen God by any of these mentalities."
The Bhagavata Purana teaches nine primary forms of bhakti. They are:
International Society for Krishna Consciousness
"The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) is a newer religious movement based on the original Vedic culture of ancient India. It is also known as 'the Hare Krishna' movement. It was founded in 1966 in New York City by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The organization's core beliefs are based on three scriptures, Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam and the Caitanya-caritamrita."

The athletics teams of the university are called the Spartans. They have 13 varsity teams. They compete in the Atlantic Sun Conference.
Stetson University
"Stetson University is a private, co-educational university in DeLand, Florida. The university has about 2,200 students. It was founded in 1883. The current president of the university is Wendy B. Libby."
Sports.
The athletics teams of the university are called the Hatters. They compete in the Atlantic Sun Conference.
Atlantic Sun Conference
"The ASUN Conference is a NCAA conference whose members play in NCAA Division I. The conference is headquartered in Atlanta and mostly features universities and colleges from the southeastern United States. The ASUN did not play football until 2022, when it began play in the second level of Division I football, the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS)."
The ASUN began in 1978 as the Trans America Athletic Conference (TAAC). It became the Atlantic Sun Conference in 2001 and rebranded itself as the ASUN Conference in 2016.
Members.
"As of the 2022–23 school year, the ASUN has 14 full members, or schools that play almost all of their sports in the conference."
"The ASUN has added five members in the 2020s. First, three schools, one a returning member, joined in 2021. The first-time members were the University of Central Arkansas and Eastern Kentucky University, which respectively arrived from the Southland Conference and Ohio Valley Conference (OVC). Jacksonville State University, which had been an ASUN member from 1995 to 2003, returned after spending 18 years in the OVC. At that time, the ASUN technically began sponsoring football, but did not start conference play. It partnered with the Western Athletic Conference, which was launching an FCS football league in the fall 2021 season. Under the agreement, the three newest members, all of which play FCS football, became de facto WAC football members for that season only."
"The next membership change came in July 2022 with the arrival of football-sponsoring Austin Peay State University from the OVC and non-football Queens University of Charlotte from the Division II South Atlantic Conference. When Peay was announced as an incoming ASUN member, it gave the conference six members that play FCS football and award scholarships for that sport, which is the number of teams needed for a conference to receive an automatic bid to the FCS playoffs. However, the ASUN would lose one of those six members when Jacksonville State announced a 2023 move to Conference USA (C-USA). JSU began a transition to FBS in 2022, making it ineligible for the FCS playoffs. The WAC lost two of its planned six playoff-eligible members in 2022, with Sam Houston starting an FBS transition ahead of its 2023 move to C-USA and Incarnate Word backing out of a planned move to the WAC and remaining in the Southland Conference. This led the ASUN and WAC to renew their football partnership for 2022. Both conferences will play separate league schedules, with officials from each conference choosing their one automatic playoff team. The new ASUN football league, launching in 2022, will feature Austin Peay, the three 2021 arrivals, Kennesaw State, and North Alabama. Three other ASUN schools sponsor football but will not play that sport in the ASUN. Stetson plays in the Pioneer Football League, whose members do not award football scholarships; Liberty plays as an independent in the top level of D-I football, the Football Bowl Subdivision; and Bellarmine began play in sprint football, a weight-restricted form of the sport not run by the NCAA, in 2022."
Associate members.
"The ASUN also has 12 ""associate members"" that play one or two sports in the conference while being full members of another conference. Seven of these schools, plus full members Bellarmine and Jacksonville, make up the ASUN men's lacrosse league, restarted in the 2021–22 school year (2022 season) after having been shut down when the ASUN began a lacrosse partnership with the Southern Conference (SoCon). Four more schools joined in July 2021. Two returned women's lacrosse to the ASUN after the SoCon shut down its women's lacrosse league, and three joined in beach volleyball."
"After the Atlantic 10 Conference started a men's lacrosse league for the 2023 season, taking away two of the SoCon's six men's lacrosse members, the SoCon shut down its men's lacrosse league. Jacksonville, which had played in SoCon men's lacrosse in the 2022 season by agreement between the ASUN and SoCon, returned that sport to the ASUN. It was joined in ASUN men's lacrosse by Mercer, a full SoCon member that was already an ASUN beach volleyball member, and Lindenwood, which started a transition to D-I in 2022 as a new member of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC), which does not sponsor the sport. Lindenwood also joined the ASUN in women's lacrosse, also not sponsored by the OVC, at that time."
"The ""Joined"" column shows the year in which a school joined the ASUN. Since all ASUN sports that have associate members (beach volleyball and men's and women's lacrosse) are spring sports, this means the year of joining is the calendar year before the first season of ASUN play."

Oomycete
The Oomycota are a class in a huge phylum of eukaryotic microorganisms called the heterokonts. Oomycetes are a distinct phylogenetic line of fungus-like microorganisms.
"They are not actually fungi, though some have filaments as fungi do. Like fungi, they are saprophytic and pathogenic. also like fungi, oomycetes rarely have septa, and if they do, they are scarce."
"They are microscopic organisms that reproduce both sexually and asexually. Oomycetes are some of the most prolific pathogens of plants, causing devastating diseases such as potato blight and sudden oak death."
"They are often referred to as water moulds (or moulds), although the water-loving nature which led to that name is not true of most species, which are terrestrial pathogens."
"The notion of ""experience"" has been criticised."
"The term ""Religious empiricism"" is seen as highly problematic. Karl Barth saidf that the term was wrong altogether. Some influential modern scholars holding this liberal theological view are Charles Raven and the Oxford physicist/theologian Charles Coulson."
"Robert Sharf points out that ""experience"" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of ""experience"" introduces a false idea of duality between ""experiencer"" and ""experienced"". In kensho there is no duality of observer and observed. ""Pure experience"" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a given tradition may even determine what ""experience"" someone has; this means that this ""experience"" is not the ""proof"" of the teaching, but a ""result"" of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by ""cleansing the doors of perception"", would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence."

Flydubai Flight 981
"Flydubai Flight 981 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Dubai International Airport, in the United Arab Emirates, The Boeing 737-800 crashed while landing at Rostov-on-Don Airport in Russia. There were no survivors, a total of 62 people between passengers and crew lost their lives in the tragic accident."
Crew.
"The captain was 37-year-old Aristos Sokratous, from Cyprus. He had over 6,000 hours of total flying time, including 4,905 hours on the Boeing 737. Sokratous was promoted to captain a year and a half before the crash. At the time of the crash, he had intended to quit the airline after accepting a job from Ryanair, which would allow him to be based with his family in Cyprus. His wife was due to give birth to their first child a few weeks after the crash. According to several Flydubai staff members, Sokratous decided to leave the airline mainly because of fatigue and lifestyle issues."
"The first officer, 36-year-old Alejandro Cruz Álava, was from Spain. He had more than 5,700 hours of flying time, with 1,100 of them on the Boeing 737. He started flying with Flydubai in 2013, two years before the crash, and had previously flown two regional airlines in the Spanish Canary Islands – Binter and Naysa – before joining the company."
"According to the final report by the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), the accident flight was both pilots' first ever flight to Rostov. The captain had experience flying into other Russian airports, but the first officer did not."
List of programs broadcast by Toon Disney
"This is a list of television programs that have been broadcast by Toon Disney (now Disney XD) in the United States. The channel was launched on April 18, 1998, as a spinoff of Disney Channel, and aired mostly syndicated animated programming, ranging from action to comedy."
"The first program broadcast on Toon Disney was the Mickey Mouse segment from ""Fantasia"" titled ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"". It was followed by a sampling of other Mickey Mouse shorts and episodes of ""Timon and Pumbaa"", ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"", ""Goof Troop"", ""TaleSpin"", and ""Aladdin""."
"The list does not include the programs that were introduced as Jetix, a block on Toon Disney that ran from 2004 to 2009."
European wars of religion
"In the Protestant Reformation, a number of people criticizes the Roman Catholic Church. People such as Martin Luther, Jean Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli or Jan Hus were reformers: In the end, each of them had followers which started their own church. Today, most of these Churches are known as Protestant. In the European wars of religion, countries, but also local leaders fought for influence. Most of the time one side of the warring fraction was Catholics, the other was Protestants."
Examples of these wars:
Iputhou Pakhangba Laishang
"Iputhou Pakhangba Laishang () (literally, ""Iputhou Pakhangba Temple"") is an ancient Meitei temple dedicated to God Pakhangba, inside the Kangla Palace in Imphal, Manipur, India."
"After its reconstruction, it was consecrated in 2010."
Atlassian
"Atlassian Corporation is an Australian software development company for the IT industry. It is best known for its JIRA and Confluence bug tracking system. The company is headquartered in Seattle, USA. In total, the company has nine offices in six countries and serves more than 100,000 customers."
History.
"The company name comes from Atlas (), a character from Greek mythology. Until 2017, the company's logo looked like an X-shaped figure supporting the sky. However, in 2017, the logo was changed to a modern one because, according to the designers, ""The previous version of the logo was inspired by Atlas, and an example of legendary service and support."
"Atlassian was founded in 2002 by two students from the University of New South Wales, Mike Cannon-Brooks and Scott Farkuhar. They both left training to work on the project. The start-up capital was only 10 thousand dollars."
"Atlasian released its first product, JIRA (bug tracking and project management system), in 2002, and on April 25, 2004, they released Confluence, a platform for collaboration, dissemination of documentation and knowledge based on wiki technology."
"In 2007, Atlassian released Bamboo, a server for continuous integration and delivery, and acquired Cenqua, another Australian IT company, along with its software products FishEye (version control system), Crucible (code viewer) and Clover (software for Java code testing, in April 2017 Atlassian closed it, and made the code public)."
"In July 2010, Atlassian received a $60 million investment from investment company Accel Partners."
"In 2011, the company's revenue reached $102 million, and in 2014 it was $215 million."
"In 2015, Atlassian made an initial public offering on the NASDAQ and its capitalization was estimated at $4.37 billion."
Two-party system
"There are several states in the world, where politics is dominated by two parties. This is known as two-party system. According to Giovanni Sartori, the following is true for such as system:"
"The Median voter theorem describes such a system: While at first the parties have programmes that are very different from each other, over time, they will get closer. Hotelling's law also describes this in game theory."
"Note that in such systems, there may also be other parties, bur these rarely have enough influence to win majorities in elections."
"Two Examples of countries that have a two party system are the United Kingdom, and the United States."
Median voter theorem
"The median voter theorem is a theorem from political economics: Suppose there are two parties: One is a left-wing party, the other is a right-wing party. Voters either vote for the left-wing party L, or the right-wing party R. In an election, L has an interest to shift its position towards the middle, so that it can get voters from the other party R. Similarly, R has an interest to shift its position towards the middle, so it can get voters from L."
California's 1st congressional district
"California's 1st congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of California. The district is represented by Republican Doug LaMalfa since 2013. Before LaMalfa has taken office, the district had not had a Republican congressman since 1998. The district is made up of the counties: Butte County, Lassen County, Modoc County, Plumas County, Shasta County, Sierra County, Siskiyou County, Tehama County, most of Nevada County, part of Glenn County and part of Placer County."
Paper Port (TV series)
"Paper Port (Spanish: ""Puerto Papel"") is a 2016 animated children's television series produced by Zumbastico Studios. The series blends stop-motion and 2D animation with papercraft characters and environments, in a technique called ""Papermotion"".[1]"
"The series was co-produced by the channels Televisión Nacional de Chile (Chile), Pakapaka (Argentina), Gloob (Brazil), and Señal Colombia. Additionally, it's also produced by Pipeline Studios in Canada and distributed by Millimages in France. It first aired in 2016.

"It has about 115,000 inhabitants."
Undernet
"Undernet is an Internet Relay Chat network that was made in 1992. It has many channels, but there are few limits to what kind of channels can be made."
Advanced Micro Devices
"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a large American company from Sunnyvale, California that makes computer hardware components. It makes many different computer parts, but it is most famous for its Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Another important product are their motherboard chipsets for their CPUs. AMD started as a company that made products for Intel, another large hardware company, and competitor of AMD. In 2006, AMD bought ATI Technologies. with $4.3 billion of cash and 52 million AMD stocks. In 2020, AMD said that they are buying Xilinx, a company that makes circuits that can be changed using computer code (FPGA)."
Ryzen is AMD's brand name for their CPUs for normal use. Ryzen CPUs has had between 2 and 64 cores and can achieve speeds above 5 Gigahertz (or GHz). Radeon is their brand name for other computer products like GPUs and computer parts made by other companies that AMD put their brand on (OEM).
Illinois Institute of Technology
"The Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) is a private university in Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is one of the best universities in the United States as U.S. News &amp; World Report, a magazine, puts it at number 108. Most students of this university focus on science or technology as their major, or subject they study most. IIT was created in 1940 by the merger of the Armour Institute of Technology and Lewis Institute."
Architecture.
"The campus, roughly bounded between 31st and 35th streets, Michigan Avenue and the Dan Ryan Expressway, was designed by modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, ""one of the great figures of 20th-century architecture"", who chaired the IIT School of Architecture from 1938 to 1958. Van der Rohe's master plan for the IIT campus was one of the most ambitious projects he ever conceived. The campus has twenty of his works. It is the greatest concentration of his buildings in the world. The layout of the campus departs radically from ""traditional college quadrangles and limestone buildings"". The materials are inspired by the factories and warehouses of Chicago's South Side and ""embod[y] 20th century methods and materials: steel and concrete frames with curtain walls of brick and glass."""
"Alfred Caldwell designed the campus landscape. Caldwall was van der Rohe's close colleague at IIT and was called ""the last representative of the Prairie School of landscape architects."" Known as ""the nature poet"", Caldwell's plan reinforced van der Rohe's design with ""landscaping planted in a free-flowing manner, which in its interaction with the pristine qualities of the architecture, introduce[d] a poetic aspect."""
"On the west side of Main Campus are three red brick buildings that were original to Armour Institute, built between 1891 and 1901. In 1938, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe began his 20-year tenure as director of IIT's School of Architecture (1938–1959). The university was on the verge of building a brand new campus, to be one of the nation's first federally funded urban renewal projects. Mies was given great freedom in the large project. The university grew fast enough during and after World War II to allow much of the new plan to be realized. From 1943 to 1957, several new Mies buildings rose across campus, including the S.R. Crown Hall, which houses the architecture school, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001."
"Though Mies had emphasized his wish to complete the campus he had begun, commissions from the late 50s onward were given to Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (SOM), prompting Mies to never return to the campus that had changed architecture the world over. SOM architect Walter Netsch designed a few buildings, including the new library that Mies had wished to create, all of them similar to Mies's style. By the late 1960s, campus addition projects were given to SOM's Myron Goldsmith, who had worked with Mies during his education at IIT and thus was able to design several new buildings to harmonize well with the original campus. In 1976, the American Institute of Architects recognized the campus as one of the 200 most significant works of architecture in the United States. The new campus center, designed by Rem Koolhaas, and a new state-of-the-art residence hall designed by Helmut Jahn, State Street Village, opened in 2003. These were the first new buildings built on the Main Campus in 32 years."
"In 1976, American Institute of Architects named the IIT campus one of the 200 most significant works of architecture in the United States. The IIT Main Campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005."
Hermann Minkowski
Hermann Minkowski (22 June 1864 in Kaunas – 12 January 1909 in Göttingen) was a German mathematician of Jewish descent. He was one of Albert Einstein's teachers.
"Minkowski is perhaps best known for his work in relativity, in which he showed in 1907 that his former student Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity (1905), could be understood geometrically as a theory of four-dimensional space-time, since known as the ""Minkowski spacetime""."
Certificate of deposit
"A certificate of deposit (CD) is a way to store money at a bank or credit union. A CD is written for a period of time: usually between three months and five years. The person who wanted the CD—the consumer—agrees to give the money to the bank for that period of time and may not take the money back until the time has expired. If the consumer takes the money back before the agreed amount of time, they will have to pay a penalty fee. Once your contract is over, you are given your money back plus the interest it earned. People open CDs instead of savings accounts because the interest is higher. A certificate of deposit (which is common only in the United States) is similar to a time deposit."
Cousins Subs
"Cousins Subs is a ""sub"" shop that makes submarine sandwiches. It was created in the 1970s in Wisconsin."
"They opened their first restaurant in Milwaukee, at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive. It closed after several years of success. The oldest Cousins Subs is on the corner of Brady Street and Farwell Avenue in Milwaukee."
When there were sic a stock of Dandies O.&lt;/poem&gt;
Dandies in the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States and Great Britain were often men from middle-class backgrounds who were trying to become people from high society.
"The model, or archetype, of a dandy was Beau Brummell from the Regency period of George IVth. He was a friend of the then Prince of Wales. Lord Byron is also an example. The writer Oscar Wilde is another, later example. Less extreme versions were the American artist who lived in London, James McNeill Whistler, and the French composer Maurice Ravel. ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" is a famous example from literature."
"Today, in the 21st century, the word ""dandy"" is often used as a joke word to mean ""fine"" or ""great""."
Robert Costanza
"Robert Costanza (born 14 September, 1950) is an American ecological economist and the Gund Professor of Ecological economics and Director of the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics at the University of Vermont."
Biography.
"Robert Costanza was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He studied architecture and urban and regional planning from the University of Florida and got a Masters degree. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Florida in 1979 in systems ecology, with a minor in economics."
"In 1982 he was selected as a Kellogg National Fellow, in 1992 he was awarded the Society for Conservation Biology Distinguished Achievement Award and in 1993 he was selected as a Pew Scholar in Conservation and the Environment. In 1998 he was awarded the Kenneth Boulding Memorial Award for Outstanding Contributions in Ecological Economics. In 2000 he received an honorary doctorate in natural sciences from Stockholm University."
"Before he moved to Vermont in August 2002, he was director of the University of Maryland, College Park Institute for Ecological Economics, and a professor in the Center for Environmental Science, at Solomons, and in the Biology Department at College Park."
"Costanza is co-founder and past-president of the International Society for Ecological Economics (ISEE) and was chief editor of the society’s journal ""Ecological Economics"" from its inception until 9/02. He serves on the editorial board of eight other international academic journals. He is president of the International Society for Ecosystem Health."
Work.
"Dr. Costanza's research has focused on the interface between ecological and economic systems. This includes landscape level spatial simulation modeling; analysis of energy and material flows through economic and ecological systems; valuation of ecosystem services, biodiversity, and natural capital; and analysis of dysfunctional incentive systems and ways to correct them."
Literature.
"Costanza is the author or co-author 16 books. and over 300 scientific papers. Books, a selection:"
"His work has been cited in more than 1700 scientific articles since 1987 (according to the Science Citation Index) and more than 80 interviews and reports on his work have appeared in various media, including Newsweek, US News and World Report, the Economist, the New York Times, Science, Nature, National Geographic, and National Public Radio."
Ifriqiya
"In medieval history, Ifriqiya or Ifriqiyah () was the area of the coastal regions of what are today western Libya, Tunisia, and eastern Algeria. This area included what had been the Roman province of Africa."
"In modern Arabic, the term simply means ""Africa"". It comes from the Latin term ""Africa""."
Roman province
"In Ancient Rome, a province (Latin, ""provincia"", pl. ""provinciae"") was the basic and, until around 300, largest territorial and administrative unit of the empire's territorial possessions outside of the peninsula of Italy. The word ""province"" in modern English came from the term used by the Romans."
Bring Me the Horizon
"Bring Me the Horizon are a British metalcore band from Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. The band was formed in 2004 from members of other bands within their local area. They play a style of music that combines rock and metalcore, but they have taken on a more rock style with their latest album. Their album in 2006 called ""Count Your Blessings"" was a deathcore album and often people nickname that type of music ""Screamo"". The band's name comes from a Pirates of the Caribbean quote."
Africa Province
"The Roman province of Africa was established after the Romans defeated Carthage in the Third Punic War. It roughly includeded the territory of present-day northern Tunisia, north-eastern Algeria and the Mediterranean coast of modern-day western Libya along the Syrtis Minor. The Arabs later named roughly the same region as the original province Ifriqiya, an other word for ""Africa""."
Economics.
"The prosperity of most towns depended on agriculture. Called the ""granary of the empire"", North Africa, according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one-quarter of which was exported. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits. By the second century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivation of slaves, and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals, the principal production and exports included the textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery and wool."
"""The Ghan"" normally runs weekly year round. During December 2012 and January 2013 it ran only once every two weeks. Until 2016, a second service operated between June and September. The train stops at Alice Springs and Katherine so passengers have time for optional tours."
"Each train has between 16 and 26 stainless steel carriages. These were built by Comeng, Granville in the late 1960s / early 1970s for the ""Indian Pacific"", plus a motorail wagon. The train is pulled by a Pacific National NR class locomotive. Sometimes, other locomotives such as an AN class or a DL class join the NR class to pull the train."
History.
"Starting in August 1929, ""The Ghan"" first ran on the Central Australian Railway. This was a narrow-gauge railway that went to Alice Springs. In 1957, the standard gauge Stirling North to Marree line opened, so the train only ran north of Marree. In October 1980 a new standard gauge line was built to the west of the original line. This was later extended north from Alice Springs to Darwin, opening in January 2004."
Original Ghan.
"The Port Augusta to Government Gums Railway began in 1878 when Premier of South Australia, William Jervois, broke ground at Port Augusta. The line reached Hawker in June 1880, Beltana in July 1881, Marree in January 1884, and Oodnadatta in January 1891. In 1926 work began to build the line to Alice Springs. and that section was completed in 1929. Until then, the final part of the train journey was made by camel."
"There were always plans to build the line to Darwin, but by the time the line to Alice Springs was built, ""The Ghan"" was losing money. Plans to reach Darwin were put on indefinite hold. The original line followed the same track as the overland telegraph, which is believed to be the route taken by John McDouall Stuart during his 1862 crossing of Australia."
"Steam locomotives need a lot of water, and Stuart's route to Alice Springs was the only one that had available water. This meant that when it did rain, the creeks and rivers often washed the track away."
"""The Ghan"" service was well known for long delays caused by these washouts. A flatcar behind the locomotive carried spare sleepers and railway tools, so that if there was damage to the track, the passengers and crew could repair the line. During World War II the service had to be greatly expanded, putting great pressure on the limited water supplies. As a result, de-mineralisation towers, some of which survive to this day, were built along the track. This meant that bore water could be used in the locomotives. When the new line to Alice Springs was built in the 1970s, the use of diesel engines meant that there was far less need for water. The line could take the much drier route from Tarcoola to Alice Springs."
"The original Ghan was shown in BBC Television's series ""Great Railway Journeys of the World"" in 1980, presented by Michael Frayn."
New line.
"The original ""Ghan"" ran for the last time in 1980. The Ghan Preservation Society has repaired sections of the old narrow gauge track and some notable sidings. In October 1980 the new standard gauge line from Tarcoola on the Trans-Australian Railway to Alice Springs was opened. The new line is about west of the old line. This avoids the floodplains where the original line was often damaged by floods. It was also hoped that the new line would improve the train's timekeeping."
"The modern ""Ghan"" was in an episode of Channel 5's series ""Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railways"". In November 1998, one service went from Adelaide to Melbourne while from April 1999, the other went to Sydney."
Connection to Darwin.
"Building the line between Alice Springs and Darwin is said to be the second-largest civil engineering project in Australia, the largest since the Snowy Mountains Scheme was built 1949–1974. Work began in July 2001, with the first passenger train reaching Darwin on 4 February 2004, after 126 years of planning and waiting. The cost was A$1.3 billion."
"""The Ghan's"" arrival in Darwin started a new era of tourism in the Northern Territory. Travel to the area was easier, with better access to and for Aboriginal communities. The rail link will allow for more freight to travel through the region, leading to a hope that Darwin will serve as another trade link with Asia."
One of the locomotives was named after Steve Irwin to help promote the new service and tourism to the region.
Itanium
"Itanium ( ) is a type of Intel microprocessors with 64-bit chip architecture (not related to the by now mainstream 64-bit CPUs made by Intel and others). Itanium processors are sometimes used today for servers. Itanium processors where originally designed by HP and Intel with Intel making producing them, and several manufacturers of systems used them; nowhere as many systems used as originally hoped for. By now mostly HP still supports systems using these chips."
"Intel officially announced the end of life and product discontinuance of the Itanium CPU family on January 30, 2019."
Market reception.
Powerful-type server market.
"When first released in 2001, Itanium's speed was disappointing compared to other processor types. Using existing x86 applications and operating systems was especially bad, with one test in 2001 showing that it was as fast as a 100 MHz Pentium (1.1 GHz Pentiums were on the market at that time)."
"Itanium did not have success compared to IA-32 or RISC, and was even worse when x86-64 was released, which worked with older x86 applications."
"In an article from 2009 about the history of Itanium — ""How the Itanium Killed the Computer Industry"" — journalist John C. Dvorak reported ""This continues to be one of the great fiascos [bad situations] of the last 50 years"" . Technology writer Ashlee Vance wrote that slowness in speed and release ""turned the product into a joke in the chip industry."" In an interview, Donald Knuth said ""The Itanium approach...was supposed to be so terrific—until it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write."""
"Both Red Hat and Microsoft said that they would stop allowing Itanium to be used with their operating systems. However, other Linux distributions such as Gentoo and Debian are still available for Itanium. On March 22, 2011, Oracle said they would no longer support Itanium, but support for their existing products would continue. In October 2013, Oracle said they would release Oracle Database 12.1.0.1.0 on HP-UX Itanium 11.31 by early 2014."
"A past Intel company official said that Itanium had become profitable (Able to make a lot of money) for Intel in late 2009. In 2009 and later, Itanium was mostly used on servers by HP, which made 95% of Itanium servers, so the primary operating system for Itanium was HP-UX. On March 22, 2011, Intel said they will keep supporting Itanium entirely with many new Itanium chips being created and on-time."
Other markets.
"Although Itanium did do well with high-end computing, Intel wanted it to have more usage compared to the original x86 architecture."
"AMD decided on an easier idea, creating x86-64, a 64-bit addition to the x86 architecture, which Microsoft soon supported in Microsoft Windows, so Intel had to include the same type of 64-bit addition in Intel's x86 processors. x86-64 can use existing 32-bit applications at full hardware speed, but has 64-bit memory addressing and other additions to new applications. This architecture has now become the most used 64-bit architecture in the desktop and laptop market, with the 64-bit ARMv8 architecture powering many mobile devices, used in today's iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, and now many Android phones and tablets such as the Nexus 6P and Nexus 9. Ssome Itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as SGI, but they are no longer available. Because AMD made the first x86-64 chip, the architecture is commonly referred to as ""amd64"" inside of operating systems."
History.
History.
"The Cure began in 1976 as 'Easy Cure'. It was formed by Robert Smith (vocals, guitar) together with schoolmates Michael Dempsey (bass), Lol Tolhurst (drums), and local guitarist Porl Thompson."
"They began writing and demoing their own songs almost immediately, playing throughout 1977 in Northern England to an ever growing army of fans. In May 1978 the 'Easy' was dropped, along with Porl, and an eager trio now known simply as The Cure were quickly signed to Tony Wilson's Factory label."
First album.
"In May 1979 their debut album ""Three Imaginary Boys"" was released to great acclaim, and as the band toured extensively around the UK, the singles “Boys Don't Cry” and “Jumping Someone Else's Train” were released. They supporting Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias and The Smirks in June and July and again with Siouxsie and the Banshees in August to October 1979. Michael left the band at the late of the year, and Simon Gallup (bass) and Matthieu Hartley (keyboards) joined. In March 1980 the 4-piece Cure embarked on an exploration of the darker side of Robert's songwriting, and emerged with the minimalist classic Seventeen Seconds, along with their first real 'hit single' “A Forest.”"
Results and second album.
"After an intense world tour Matthieu left the group, and in early 1981 the trio recorded an album of mournful atmospheric soundscapes entitled ""Faith"", which included another successful single in “Primary.”"
Third album.
"The band then set out on a second trip around the world, named “The Picture Tour,” and they put out the single “Charlotte Sometimes.” In 1982 The Cure went back into the studio to record the album “Pornography” which had a dark mood. The trip was difficult for the band members, and the single “The Hanging Garden” came out just as Simon left the band."
First dance single.
"Robert Smith and Lol Tolhurst were now the only band members. To feel better, the band chose to change the dark mood of the band into a more fun “pop” mood. So they recorded a dance single called “Let's Go To Bed,” and became good friends with the song's film-clip director, Tim Pope. The band continued into 1983 with two more fun singles: “The Walk” and “The Lovecats.”"
Fourth album.
"In 1984 ""The Top"" was released, a strange hallucinogenic mix, which contained the infectiously psychedelic single “The Caterpillar.”"
Expansion of the band.
"The world ‘Top Tour’ saw the band expand to a 5-piece, with the addition of Andy Anderson (drums) and Phil Thornalley (bass), and the return of Porl Thompson (guitar)."
"The new Cure sound was captured live for the album ""Concert"". Andy and Phil left soon after the end of the tour, and were replaced by Boris Williams (drums) and further returnee Simon Gallup (bass). This new incarnation started work on 1985's The Head On The Door with a very real sense of 'something happening'... The vibrant hit single “Inbetween Days” was followed up by “Close To Me,” and the ensuing world tour paved the way for the massive success of the singles collection ""Standing On A Beach"" in 1986. That summer saw the band headline the Glastonbury Festival for the first time, and a year of extensive gigs and festivals was crowned by Tim Pope's live concert film The Cure In Orange."
First double album.
"In 1987 The Cure brought out ""Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me"", an immense double album of extreme and extraordinary stylistic range, and with the arrival of Roger O'Donnell on keyboards the 6-piece Cure traveled the world with the 'Kissing Tour', enjoying four more hit singles along the way. The wonderfully atmospheric ""Disintegration"" was demoed in 1988 and released in 1989, and despite being a work of powerful brooding grandeur, it too gave rise to four hit singles. The 'Prayer Tour' followed, with the band back down to a five-piece following the departure of Lol Tolhurst. It was captured live for the album ""Entreat""."
Replacing Roger O'Donnell.
"In early 1990 Roger O'Donnell left the group, and was replaced by long-time band friend Perry Bamonte, just in time for a series of headlining European festival shows that included the band's second Glastonbury headline slot. The album ""Mixed Up"" was released, supported by the re-mixed singles “Never Enough,” “Close To Me” and “A Forest,” and in 1991 The Cure at last won some long overdue “home” recognition with a Brit Award for “Best British Group.”"
Sixth album.
"In 1992 they recorded ""Wish"", a richly diverse multi-faceted guitar driven album hailed by some as their best work to date. It spawned 3 fabulous hit singles, and the glorious ‘Wish Tour' that followed was a worldwide sell out. The sheer power of the shows inspired the release of two live works in 1993, Paris and Show. Immediately after the tour ended, guitarist Porl Thompson left the band again (this time with a smile!), and The Cure headlined the XFM 'Great Xpectations Show' in London's Finsbury Park as a 4-piece. The band also contributed ”Burn” to the film “The Crow” and covered “Purple Haze” for the Hendrix tribute album 'Stone Free'."
Seventh album.
"In 1994 Boris Williams decided to move on, and in early 1995 Jason Cooper took up residency behind the drum kit, with Roger O'Donnell rejoining once more on keyboards. Work on the next album was interspersed with recording “Dredd Song” for the film “Judge Dredd,” a cover of Bowie's “Young Americans” for an XFM album, and headlining several major European festivals, including the 25th Glastonbury. ""Wild Mood Swings"" was released in 1996, and went straight into almost every top ten around the world. The Cure hit the road once more with 'The Swing Tour', their longest to date, and released 4 more singles."
Eighth album.
"Galore, the follow up singles and video compilation to"" Standing On A Beach"", was released in 1997, after which work took place in 1998 on a variety of projects, including “More than This” for the “X Files” album, and a memorable appearance by Robert in “South Park” In 1999 the band completed the recording and mixing of what many regard as their best studio album so far, the Grammy Nominated"" Bloodflowers"". With its release in 2000 the band set off on the massive world-wide 'Dreamtour' - playing to more than a million people in 9 months."
Ninth album.
"2001 saw the long-awaited release of the Cure's “Greatest Hits” album, which featured all the band's biggest selling singles along with 2 new songs, the elegiac “Cut Here” and the ebullient “Just Say Yes,” a duet with Saffron. This year also saw the end of the group's relationship with Fiction Records, the label they had been instrumental in starting 23 years before."
Festivals in Europe.
"In 2002 the band spent the summer headlining a number of European festivals before going into rehearsals for two very special nights in November at the Tempodrom Berlin, where they performed all the tracks from ""Pornography, Disintegration"" and ""Bloodflowers"" plus encores. Both performances were shot in Hi-Def video on 12 cameras, and Trilogy DVD was released in 2003 as another chapter of The Cure story opened, the band signing a 3 album global deal with the Geffen label."
Tenth album.
"2004 saw the release of 'Join the Dots', a 4cd Boxset of all the B-sides and Rarities, followed by the widely acclaimed new album ‘The Cure’, and another hugely successful world tour."
"Though Belmont lobbied hard for it, Buchanan denied him the ambassadorship to Spain after his election in 1856, thanks to the Ostend Manifesto. As a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention, Belmont supported Stephen A. Douglas, who subsequently named Belmont chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Belmont energetically supported the Union cause during the Civil War as a War Democrat, helping Missouri congressman Francis P. Blair raise and equip the Union army's first mainly German-American regiment. Belmont also used his influence with European business and political leaders to support the Union cause in the American civil war, stopping the Rothschilds and other bankers from lending to the Confederacy and meeting personally with the British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, and members of Napoleon III’s government."
Postwar political career.
"Belmont stayed as chairman of the Democratic National Committee after the war, but he thought it was the worst ever time for the party. As early as 1862, Belmont and Samuel Tilden bought stock in the ""New York World"" in order to make it publish stories supporting the Democrats, with the help of Manton M. Marble, its editor-in-chief."
"The Republican party was divided at the war’s end, so Belmont organized new party gatherings and tried to get Salmon Chase elected president in 1868. He thought Chase was least vulnerable to charges of disloyalty to the party during the Republican Lincoln-Johnson administrations."
"Horatio Seymour’s became the democratic candidate instead, and lost to Ulysses S. Grant by a lot of Electoral College votes, although the popular vote was much closer. In 1872 the Democrats supported liberal Republican Horace Greeley's disastrous presidential campaign. The election of 1872 prompted Belmont to resign as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, but he stayed interested in politics as a champion of US Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware for the presidency, and as a fierce critic of the process granting Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in 1877, and as an advocate of “hard money.”"
Death.
"Belmont died in New York in 1890. The ""Letters, Speeches and Addresses of August Belmont"" was published at New York in 1890. Belmont left an estate valued at more than ten million dollars. He is buried in Newport, Rhode Island."
"Belmont's sons were Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont, Perry Belmont, and August Belmont, Jr.."
August Belmont in culture.
"August Belmont threw lavish balls and dinner parties, receiving from New York's high society mixed reviews."
"He was an avid sportsman, and the famed Belmont Stakes thoroughbred horse race is named in his honour. It debuted at Jerome Park Racetrack, owned by Belmont's friend, Leonard Jerome. Today The Belmont Stakes is part of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown and takes place at Belmont Racetrack in New York."
"Also named in Belmont's honor is the town of Belmont, New Hampshire, an honor Mr. Belmont never acknowledged. Edith Wharton reputedly modeled the character of Julius Beaufort in ""The Age of Innocence"" on Belmont."
Ham mousseline à la Belmont was created in his honour by Charles Ranhofer at Delmonico's.
Parmigiana
"Parmigiana is a Southern Italian dish made with a shallow-fried sliced filling, with cheese and tomato sauce on top, then baked. Eggplant parmigiana is the earliest version. Other kinds made with breaded meat cutlets, such as veal and chicken parmigiana, are popular in other countries, usually in areas with a lot of Italian immigrants."
History.
"The dish is claimed by both Campania and Sicily. While ""parmigiana"" means ""from Parma"" (in Northern Italy), the dish is not part of Parma food. It is based on melanzane alla parmigiana (alt. parmigiana di melanzane) or eggplant parmigiana (or eggplant Parmesan), a classic Southern Italian dish."
"Along with the many Italian versions, different kinds of Parmigiana have been developed across the world, most often in countries where large numbers of Italians immigrated. Examples of dishes developed outside of Italy from the early parmigianas include veal (Veal Parmigiana) or chicken breast (Chicken Parmigiana) dipped in beaten eggs, breaded, shallow-fried and topped with a marinara sauce (red Sicilian tomato sauce) and mozzarella. It is then usually baked until the cheese is bubbly and brown. The veal dish is known in Italian as ""Cotolette alla Bolognese""."
"""Parmigiana"" is also used as an adjective in the names of other unrelated dishes from Parma food, such as ""Trippa alla Parmigiana"" (Parma-style tripe)."
Cooking.
"The dish consists of a sliced filling pan fried in oil, layered with tomato sauce and cheese, and baked in an oven. In some kinds, the sliced filling is first dipped in beaten eggs and covered in flour or breadcrumbs before frying. Some recipes use hard grated cheeses such as Parmesan or Pecorino Romano, while others use softer melting cheeses like Mozzarella or Caciocavallo, or a combination of these."
International variations.
"In the United States and Canada, veal parmigiana or chicken parmigiana is commonly served as a grinder or a submarine sandwich. It is also popular with a side of or on top of pasta. Diced onions or green bell peppers, sautéed or raw, are sometimes added."
"Chicken or veal parmigiana has become very popular in Australia as a pub dish, often served with chips and salad. It may also contain a lot of toppings, including sliced ham or fried eggplant slices. This dish is often referred to as a ""parma"" or ""parmi"", a simple shortening of the name. However, as Italian pronunciations are phonetic and do not use long vowel sounds, ""parma"" is incorrect."
"A similar dish, the Parmo, which uses either pork or chicken, has been made within the country of England."
Name.
"There are several theories for the origin of the name ""parmigiana""."
One common theory says the name is from Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese).
"Another theory says the name is an alteration of the Sicilian word ""parmiciana"":"
"This is an ancient Sicilian dish which, in all cookbooks, is erroneously stated as obtaining its name from Parmesan cheese, which is one of the ingredients. Nothing could be further from the truth. The name ""parmigiana"" does not derive from that of the cheese but is the Italianization of the Sicilian dialectal word ""parmiciana"", which refers to the slats of wood which compose the central part of a shutter and overlap in the same manner as the slices of eggplant in the dish."""
"As with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, the word ""Parmigiana"" is often rendered as ""Parmesan"" in English-speaking countries, from the French word for ""from Parma."""
Sino-Vietnamese characters
"Sino-Vietnamese characters () are Chinese-style characters read as either Vietnamese or as Sino-Vietnamese. When they are used to write Vietnamese, they are called Nôm. The same characters may be used to write Chinese. In this case, the character is given a Sino-Vietnamese, or Han-Viet, reading. Han-Viet is a system that allows Vietnamese to read Chinese. It is equivalent to pinyin in English."
"Some of these characters are also used in China; others are used only in Vietnam. Chinese characters were introduced to Vietnam when the Han Empire invaded the country in 111 BC. Even after Vietnam became independent in AD 939, the country continued to use Classical Chinese () for official purposes. In the 1920s, Vietnam shifted from traditional characters to the Latin alphabet. The Han-Nom Institute was founded in Hanoi in 1970 to collect and study documents written in the traditional script. The institute has submitted a list of 19,981 Sino-Vietnamese characters to Unicode for electronic encoding. This includes a core set of 9,299 characters called the Nôm Ideographs."
History.
"Chinese characters were introduced to Vietnam after the Han Empire conquered the country in 111 BC. Independence was achieved in 939, but the Chinese writing system was adopted for official purposes in 1010. Soon after the country achieved independence, Vietnamese began to use Chinese characters to write their own language. The Van Ban bell, engraved in 1076, is the earliest known example of a Nôm inscription. Nguyen Thuyen composed Nôm poetry in the 13th century. However, none of his work has survived. The oldest surviving Nôm text is the collected poetry of King Tran Nhan Tong, written in the 13th century."
"Classical Chinese was used by the royal court and for other official purposes. The Temple of Literature in Hanoi was the best-known school for the study of Chinese. The civil service examination tested knowledge of Chinese. It was given once every three years. Students who passed the exam could go on to become magistrates. Confucian scholars saw Chinese as the language of education and looked down on Nôm. Popular opinion favored Nôm. Some kings thought that all writing should be done in Chinese. They suppressed Nôm. Other kings promoted Nôm. In 1867, King Tu Duc issued a decree encouraging the use of Nôm. Only a small percentage of the population was literate in any language. But nearly every village had at least one person who could read Nôm aloud for the other villagers. Jean-Louis Taberd wrote the first Nôm dictionary in 1838."
"In 1910, the colonial school system adopted a ""Franco-Vietnamese curriculum"", which emphasized French and alphabetic Vietnamese. The Vietnamese alphabet is a form of the Latin alphabet that includes tone marks. On December 28, 1918, King Khai Dinh declared that the traditional writing system no longer had official status. The civil service exam was given for the last time at the imperial capital of Hue on January 4, 1919. The examination system, and the education system based on it, had been in effect for almost 900 years. China itself stop using Classical Chinese soon afterward as part of the May Fourth Movement."
Language issues.
"Chinese characters are used to write various languages in China and elsewhere, including Mandarin, the most widely spoken language in China, Cantonese, spoken in Hong Kong and southern China, and Classical Chinese, traditionally used for formal writing. The characters were formerly used in Korea and in Vietnam. Japan uses a mix of Chinese characters and two native phonetic writing systems. Even characters that retain their original meaning in all languages may be read in various ways. The character 十 is pronounced as ""shí"" in Chinese romanization (pinyin), ""jū"" in Japanese romanization (Hepburn), ""sip"" in Korean romanization (Revised Romanization), and ""thập"" in the Han-Viet system used in Vietnam. In all these languages, the meaning of the character is “ten.”"
"The majority of the characters used in Nôm are of Chinese origin, chosen because they have an appropriate pronunciation or meaning. For example, the character used to write the word ""Nôm"" 喃 is pronounced ""nán"" in Chinese and means “chattering.” The fit between the Chinese character and the Vietnamese word is not always exact. The word ""Nôm"" does not have any negative connotation in Vietnamese, but rather suggests plain talk, something easy to understand."
"Nôm includes thousands of characters not found in Chinese. In contrast, Japan developed only a few hundred kokuji, most of them describing plants and animals found only in Japan. Korea had just a small number of rarely used gukja. These characters were created by writers who combined pre-existing elements. One element, called the radical, indicates the character's meaning, or at least a semantic category. The other element, called the remainder, gives pronunciation. This is similar to how most Chinese characters are written. Like Chinese, Vietnamese is a tonal language. In contrast, Japanese and Korean can be written in phonetic scripts that do not indicate tone."
Readings.
"When a character is read as Vietnamese, it is romanized according to its Nôm reading. When it is read as Chinese, it can be romanized into Vietnamese as Han-Viet, or into English as pinyin. The chart below uses a darker background to display the Nôm Ideographs (V0 to V3), considered to be the core Nôm character set."
Encoding.
"In 1994, the Ideographic Rapporteur Group agreed to include Sino-Vietnamese characters in Unicode. In 1993-2001, the Han-Nom Institute assembled a collection of 9,299 “Nôm Ideographs"" in four sets. These are the V0, V1, V2, and V3 characters shown below. A Sino-Vietnamese character is first assigned a V Source code, and later a codepoint. These codes are used to transmit and store the character electronically. An appropriate font must be installed to render them."
"The Nôm Ideographs were extracted from two dictionaries published in the 1970s, one in Saigon and the other in Hanoi. V Source annotations were added to the glyphs that were already encoded. The rest were assigned codepoints in Extension B. ""The Hán Nôm Coded Character Repertoire"" (2008) integrates the work of the Han-Nom Institute with that of the U.S.-based Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation. This book presents a comprehensive list of 19,981 Sino-Vietnamese characters, including the Nôm Ideographs, manuscript variants, characters formerly used by the Tay people of northern Vietnam, as well as numerous Chinese characters with Han-Viet readings."

Dead Rising 2
Dead Rising 2 is a survival horror video game developed by Blue Castle Games and published by Capcom.
"It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on August 8, 2006 in North America, September 8, 2006 in Europe, September 14, 2006 in Australia, and on September 28, 2006 in Japan. It was also released on Microsoft Windows on September 28, 2010 in North America, September 30, 2010 in Australia, October 1, 2010 in Europe, and on October 28, 2010 in Japan."
The game was the second in the Dead Rising video game series and is the sequel to Dead Rising which was released in 2006.
Reception.
"IGN rated the game a 8 out of 10 and said it was ""It’s not the smoothest game and it can feel like the last one, however that doesn’t mean a thing when the game’s this much fun."""
"GameSpot gave the game a 8.5 out of 10 and stated ""The Dead Rising formula proves to be as addictive as ever, and a new cooperative mode and weapon crafting system are great additions to the franchise."""
Abraham Maslow
"Abraham Maslow (April 1, 1908 – June 8, 1970) was an American psychologist. He is considered by other psychologists to be one of the most important psychologists of the 20th century. He was ranked 10th among psychologists nominated for being well-known or influential. He is known for creating Maslow's hierarchy of needs."
Maslow died of a heart attack.
Dead Rising 3
"In the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Cold War alliances were broken in an important way for the first time with the Soviet Union and United States favoring one side and Britain and France the other. The Western Allies also decided to let Soviet troops suppress the Hungarian Revolution of 1956."
"US vice-president Richard Nixon engaged in several talks with Khrushchev during the 1950s. One of these was the 1959 ""Kitchen Debate"" in a model kitchen in Moscow. The debates highlighted the political and economic differences between the Americans and the Soviets. The following year, the United States U-2 spy plane crashed in the Soviet Union. Tensions between the two countries increased."
Cuban Missile Crisis (1962).
"After the United States had invaded Cuba and failed in the Bay of Pigs, the Soviet Union attempted to supply Cuba with nuclear missiles. The missiles in Cuba would have allowed the Soviet Union to target almost the entire United States effectively. In response the United States sent a large number of ships to blockade Cuba to prevent the Soviet Union from sharing the weapons. The United States and Soviet Union agreed that the Soviet Union would no longer give nuclear weapons to Cuba if the United States didn't invade Cuba again. That was the highest period of tension during the Cold War and was the closest the world came to a nuclear war, with possible global conflict to follow."
Détente (1962–1981).
"After the agreement that ended the Cuban Missile Crisis, relations between both sides eased up. Several treaties, designed to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, were signed. In 1964, the US under President Lyndon Johnson invaded North Vietnam, which resulted in a humiliating defeat for the Americans and South Vietnam in 1975. During this period of détente, the United States began building a good relationship with the People's Republic of China, which had once been an ally of the Soviet Union."
End.
"The policy of détente ended in 1981, when US President Ronald Reagan ordered a massive military build-up to challenge Soviet influence around the world. The United States began to support anti-communists all over the world with money and weapons. The idea was to help them overthrow their communist governments."
"The Soviets had a slow economy during this decade because military spending was at an all-time high. They tried to keep up with the United States in military spending but could not do so. In the Soviet war in Afghanistan, which started in 1979, the Soviets had a difficult time fighting resistance groups, with some of them armed and trained by the United States. The Soviets' failed invasion of Afghanistan is often compared to the American failure during the Vietnam War."
"In the late 1980s, the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, made an effort to make an ally of the United States to fix world problems caused by the war, with the ultimate aim of eliminating nuclear weapons. However, that did not take place because Reagan insisted on having a nuclear missile defence system. The people of the Soviet Union were divided. Some wanted Gorbachev to fight harder to eliminate nuclear weapons, but others did not want him to be talking to the United States at all. The mixed feelings created an atmosphere of political infighting, and the people were no longer united behind one goal. Also, the Communist Party started to crumble."
"After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and without communist rule holding together the countries that comprised the Soviet Union, it was divided into smaller countries in 1991 like Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Georgia. Eastern Europe got very poor and broken and returned to capitalism. The Cold War was over."
"Not all historians agree on when the Cold War ended. Some think it ended when the Berlin Wall fell, but others think it ended when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991."
Mainland China
"Mainland China, also called the Chinese Mainland, is the part of China not including the Republic of China controlling Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and the Pescadores. The term also excludes Hong Kong and Macau."
"In the Qing Dynasty (Manchu Dynasty), all of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, the Pescadores, and Mongolia were part of the Manchu Empire. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau were colonized by foreigners for some years (Taiwan to the Japanese, Hong Kong to the British, and Macau to the Portuguese)."
"By the end the Qing Empire, China became Nationalist China (the Republic of China) and it got Taiwan back in 1945. After the Communists (the People's Republic of China) took over most of China, the Nationalists kept only Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and the Pescadores. Mongolia became an independent state later."
"Since then, Communist China only includes the part on the continent (mainland) and some small islands that are very near (the largest communist island is Hainan). This region is Mainland China."
"Later Hong Kong and Macau were returned to the government of China, but because the government calls them ""special administrative regions"" under a ""one country, two systems"" idea, they are still not thought of as part of Mainland China."
Capital city
"A capital city, or capital town or capital, is a city or town, specified by law or constitution, by the government of a country, or part of a country, such as a state, province, or county. It usually serves as the location of the government's central meeting place and offices. Most of the country's leaders, embassy and officials work in the capital city. This doesn't have to be the case though: Monaco, Nauru, Switzerland and Vatican City are examples of countries that do not have a capital city. Israel said Jerusalem was its capital: Most countries don't recognise this, and most embassies are in Tel Aviv. In Japan, the city of Tokyo, which was the capital, was disbanded in 1943. Today, the 23 city districts (called wards) have the role of capital city. Each district is a city of its own, though. ""Capital city"" can also mean a city most famous for something, in this case, Capital of the World is a nickname."
Size.
"Capitals are usually among the largest cities in their regions and often are the biggest. For example, Montevideo is Uruguay's capital and its biggest city. The capital may also be the most important center of commerce, as in London or Bangkok."
"However, a capital is not always the largest city in a country. For example, the capital of India is New Delhi, which is smaller than Mumbai."
"In countries with subdivisions like the United States, the capitals of the federated states are often not the biggest cities. For example, New York City is the biggest city in the United States and in New York State, but is not the capital of either. The capital the country is Washington, DC, and the capital of the state is Albany."
"An unusual case exists in Canada since the federal capital, Ottawa, is not the largest city in its province, Ontario, which is Toronto. However, Toronto is the capital of Ontario, so Toronto is a provincial capital but not a federal one."
Number.
"Some countries have more than one capital for different purposes. For example, Bolivia has two (Sucre and La Paz) and South Africa has three (Pretoria, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein). In a city-state like Singapore, Monaco, and the Vatican City, the capital is the country."
"Not all countries have capitals. Nauru is a country that does not officially have a capital, but the district of Yaren, which is where the government is, can be called the ""de facto"" capital. Also, although many people consider the city of Bern in Switzerland to be the capital of the country, it is by law not the capital but the ""."""
Location.
"Capitals can be in cities that are already there like Athens or Rome, or a new town can be built and made the capital like Canberra and Alexandria. Countries can change capitals from time to time. Several cities have been the capital of China. The United States once had its capital in Philadelphia and later in New York City but moved to the new city of Washington, D.C. in 1800. Rio de Janeiro was the capital of Brazil until the new city of Brasilia was built between 1956 and 1960."
"Other tourist attractions include a drive-in volcano, Sulphur Springs, the Botanical Gardens, the Majestic twin Peaks ""The Pitons"", a world heritage site, the rain forests, and Pigeon Island National Park."
"Most tourists visit Saint Lucia as part of a cruise. Most of their time tends to be spent in Castries, although Soufriere, Marigot Bay and Gros Islet are popular locations to visit."
Yuri Gagarin
"Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin (; March 9, 1934 – March 27, 1968) was a Soviet and Russian cosmonaut (astronaut)."
Early life.
"Yuri Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino near Gzhatsk (now in Smolensk Oblast, Russia), on 9 March 1934. Gzhatsk was renamed Gagarin in 1968 in his honour. His parents, Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina, worked on a collective farm. While manual workers are thought as ""peasants,"" this may be too-simple if applied to his parents — his mother was said to love reading, and his father was a skilled carpenter. Yuri was the third of four children, and his elder sister helped raise him while his parents worked. Like millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during the Nazi invasion in World War II. His two elder siblings were sent out to Nazi Germany for slave work in 1943, and did not return until after the war. While a youth, Yuri became interested in space and planets, and began to dream about his space tour which would one day become a reality. Yuri was thought by his teachers, as smart and hard-working, sometimes mischievous. His mathematics and science teacher had flown in the Soviet Air Forces during the war, which was said to make some impression on young Gagarin."
"After starting an apprenticeship in a metalworks as a foundryman, Gagarin was selected for further training at a technical high school in Saratov. While there, he joined the flight club, and learned to fly a light aircraft. In 1955, after finishing his technical schooling, he entered military flight training at the Orenburg Pilot's School. While there he met Valentina Goryacheva. Yuri married her in 1957, after gaining his pilot's wings in a MiG-15. Post-graduation, he was told to go to Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where bad weather made flying risky. As a full-grown man, Gagarin was tall, which was an advantage in the small Vostok cockpit. He became a lieutenant of the Soviet Air Force on November 5, 1957 and on November 6, 1959 he got the rank of senior lieutenant."
Sports.
"Gagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a good sportsman. As the space explorer Valery Bykovsky wrote:"
"As well as being a good ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being an umpire/referee."
Career in the Soviet space program.
Selection and training.
"In 1960, after the search and selection process, Yuri Gagarin was selected with 19 other space explorers for the ""Soviet space program"". Along with the other soon to be space explorers, he was tested by experiments made to test his physical and psychological score; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty originally selected, the final choice for the first launch was between Gagarin and Gherman Titov because of their performance in training, as well as their physical fitness."
Spaceflight.
"On 12 April 1961, Gagarin became the first man to travel into space, launching to orbit aboard the ""Vostok 3KA-3"" (Vostok 1). His call sign in this flight was Kedr (Cedar; ). During his flight, Gagarin famously whistled the song ""The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows"" (). The first two lines of the song are: ""The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky"". This song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky."
"Around the same time, some Western people claimed that Gagarin, during his space flight, had made the comment, """"I don't see any God up here""."" However, no such words appear in the direct record of Gagarin's talk with the Earth during the spaceflight. In a 2006 interview a close friend of Gagarin, Colonel Valentin Petrov, said that Gagarin never said such words, and that the phrase came from Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the fullness of the Central Committee of the CPSU, where the anti-religious propaganda was talked about. In a certain context Khrushchev said, """"Gagarin flew into space, but didn't see any God there""."""
Fame and later life.
"After the flight, Gagarin became a world famous celebrity. He toured in many places like in Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Japan. He did this to promote the Soviet Union achievements."
"In 1962, he began serving as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He later came back to Star City. While there, he worked on designs for a reusable spacecraft. Gagarin worked on these designs in Star City for seven years. He became Lieutenant Colonel (or Podpolkovnik) of the Soviet Air Force on 12 June 1962. Then on 6 November 1963 he got the rank of Colonel (Polkovnik) of the Soviet Air Force. Soviet people tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight. As Komarov's flight ended in a deadly crash, Gagarin was banned from training for and helping out in further spaceflight/s."
Death.
"Gagarin then became deputy training director of the Star City cosmonaut training base. At the same time, he began to re-join as a fighter pilot. On 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. Gagarin and Seryogin were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square."
"People are not sure what caused the crash, but a 1986 investigation thinks that the turbulence from a Su-11 'Fishpot-C' interceptor using its afterburners may have caused Gagarin's plane to go out of control."
"Russian documents opened to the public in March 2003 showed that the KGB had changed their own investigation of the accident. In addition to this, one government and two military investigations. The KGB's report removed many conspiracy thoughts, instead of showing the actions of air base personnel added to the crash. The report says that an air traffic controller made Gagarin have old weather information. But by that time of his flight, conditions had become very bad. Ground crew also left fuel tanks on the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight needed good weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation ended, saying that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either because of a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the old weather report, the crew thought their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not properly react to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin."
"In his 2004 book ""Two Sides of the Moon"", Alexey Leonov tells that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard ""two loud booms in the distance."" His thought was that the Sukhoi jet was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and ""without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin's plane while breaking the sound barrier."" The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov thinks the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin's plane crashing."
Yangtze River
"The Yangtze River, or Yangzi (Simple Chinese: 扬子江 / Traditional Chinese: 揚子江), or Chang Jiang (Simple Chinese: 长江 / Traditional Chinese: 長江), is the longest River in China and Asia, as well as the world's third longest river (after the Amazon and the Nile). It is honored as one of the two main cradles of Chinese civilization. (another is Yellow River)"
"The river is about 3,900 kilometers long and is one of the busiest waterways in the world. It goes from the western part of China (Plateau of Tibet) into the East China Sea, which is part of the Pacific Ocean. It has been thought of as a dividing point between northern and southern China. It helped start the Chinese civilization."
"On the river is a big dam called the Three Gorges Dam, which is the biggest in the world. It forms a man-made lake that stretches almost upstream."
The Yangtze River is home to many species. The Finless porpoise is endangered and the Lipotes vexillifer (Chinese river dolphin) which died in 2002.
"Top tourist attractions for the Yangtze river cruise are Chongqing Dazu Carvings, Three Gorges, lesser Three Gorges, Bai Di City, Fengdu Ghost City and so on."

Disney's Animal Kingdom
"Disney's Animal Kingdom is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Florida, United States. It was the fourth park built there, and it opened on April 22, 1998. It is the largest Disney theme park in the world, covering more than . It is also the first Disney theme park to be themed around animal conservation, a philosophy once pioneered by Walt Disney himself. Disney's Animal Kingdom is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, meaning they have met or exceeded the standards in Education, Conservation and Research."
"Soon after the park opened, Disney advertised the park using the fictional word ""nahtazu"". It is pronounced ""not a zoo"". It was meant to state that the park is more than just a city zoo. Disney stopped using the word in January 2006."
"The symbol of Disney's Animal Kingdom is The Tree of Life, a sculpted 14-story (145-foot-tall []), tree. The tree is man-made. The leaves are made out of resin. Tourists can walk around the whole park to see all 325 animals carved in the bark of the tree."
"In 2009, the park had around 9.59 million guests, ranking it the fifth-most visited amusement park in the United States and eighth-most visited in the world."
Themed areas.
The park has eight themed areas.
Oasis.
"The Oasis is the park's main entrance. It has the guest services center and some animal habitats. Guests can see muntjacs, spoonbills, ducks, wallabies and giant anteaters, among others. The main paths lead into the park, and onto Discovery Island."
"A Rainforest Cafe is also at the entrance of the Oasis, but it is outside the park boundaries. Guests can eat at the restaurant without entering Disney's Animal Kingdom, while guests entering the restaurant from within the theme park are actually exiting the park and must show their tickets to go back into the park."
Discovery Island.
"Discovery Island is near the center of the park, in the middle of the Discovery River waterway. It was originally called Safari Village, as Discovery Island was the name for the small zoological park in Walt Disney World's Bay Lake. After it closed in 1999, Safari Village was renamed Discovery Island."
"This is the ""central hub"" of Disney's Animal Kingdom, connecting almost all of the other sections of the park, except Rafiki's Planet Watch. The Tree of Life, the park's icon, is here, surrounded by animal enclosures with kangaroos, black crowned cranes, lemurs and others. The park's largest gift shops and two of its major restaurants are on Discovery Island, each with a different design theme, such as decorations based on nocturnal animals, insects and so forth. The island's other major draw is ""It's Tough to be a Bug!"", a 4-D film starring Flik and Hopper from Disney·Pixar's ""A Bug's Life""."
Camp Minnie-Mickey.
"Camp Minnie-Mickey is themed as a summer camp. Here guests can meet the Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Goofy and others. In the area's main theatre is ""Festival of the Lion King"", a live stage show featuring acrobatics and musical performances inspired by ""The Lion King""."
Africa.
"Set in the fictional east African village of Harambe, this area has many animal exhibits. Disney's story about Harambe is that it was once part of a Dutch colony, but a peaceful revolution made Harambe independent in 1963. Today, Harambe is the starting point for tourists and students who want to see Africa's animals in their natural habitats."
"The village is the namesake of the Harambe Wildlife Preserve, the fictional home of Africa's main attraction, Kilimanjaro Safaris. Guests board an open-sided safari vehicle for a trip to see African animals freely roam through acres of savanna, rivers and rocky hills, including giraffes, hippos, African elephants and lions. On the nearby Pangani Forest Exploration Trail, visitors go into the forest in search of gorillas. Along the way, guests go on a nature walk through an African valley filled with Nile hippos, birds and fish."
Rafiki's Planet Watch.
"The one section of the park not connected to Discovery Island, Rafiki's Planet Watch is instead connected to Africa. Guests board the Wildlife Express Train for the short trip to and from Planet Watch, which has three distinct areas. Guests first see ""Habitat Habit!"", where they can see cottontop tamarins and learn about the efforts to protect these endangered primates in their natural homes. Along the way, guests can also learn how to provide animal habitats in and around their own homes."
"""Conservation Station"" shares the conservation efforts supported by the Walt Disney Company. It also gives a behind-the-scenes look into Disney's Animal Kingdom's animal care facilities, including a veterinary examination room complete with a two-way communications system so the veterinary staff can answer guest questions. Outside, ""Affection Section"" is a petting zoo with goats, sheep and other domesticated animals."
Asia.
"Asia was the first area added to Disney's Animal Kingdom after the park opened. The Asia area opened in 1999. Like Africa, the section's attractions are part of a fictional place, the kingdom of Anandapur (which means ""Place of many delights""). Anandapur is made up of two villages: the riverside village of Anandapur and Serka Zong, which is in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains. Portraits of Anandapur's royal family, the Maharajah and his wife, can be found in most of the businesses within the two villages, and a map of the kingdom, featuring both villages and their location relative to the mountains and river can be found on the wall of the Disney Vacation Club kiosk located there. Much like Harambe, Disney legend states that Anandapur is now a center of animal research and tourism. At the Caravan Stage, these two ""worlds"" meet in ""Flights of Wonder"", a live bird show where one of Anandapur's bird researchers educates a tour guide with a fear of birds about natural bird behaviors and the effects of habitat loss and conservation efforts on bird species, such as the Black Crowned Crane and American Bald Eagle."
"The Maharajah Jungle Trek leads guests through the forests and ruins outside the village, which are home to many animal species, such as Komodo dragons, fruit bats, tapirs, and tigers. Nearby, Kali River Rapids is a river rapids ride along the fictional Chakranadi River through a rainforest, past an illegal logging operation and down a waterfall. Behind Anandapur is the Forbidden Mountain, the home of Expedition Everest, a roller coaster ride through the Himalayas."
DinoLand U.S.A..
"DinoLand U.S.A. is inspired by the public's general interest in dinosaurs. The fictitious Dino Institute attracts those with a scientific interest in the long-extinct animals, while Chester and Hester's Dino-Rama recalls the many roadside attractions that were once scattered throughout the United States. Like the other areas of Disney's Animal Kingdom, there are animals on display."
"These animals, such as the American Crocodile and Asian brown tortoise, have evolutionary links to the age of the dinosaurs. Other plant and animal species that have survived since the dinosaur era can be found along the Cretaceous Trail. At the edge of DinoLand U.S.A. is the ""Theater in the Wild,"" which has ""Finding Nemo - The Musical"", a live-action musical stage show based on the story of the Disney·Pixar feature film."
"The Dino Institute is the home of DINOSAUR, a thrill ride trip through time to the Late Cretaceous Period. Just outside the Institute is ""Dino-Sue"", a casting of a ""Tyrannosaurus rex"" fossil that is the most complete dinosaur skeleton found so far. At the nearby Boneyard, children can play in a multi-leveled playground area with a mammoth fossil to be uncovered."
"Chester and Hester's Dino-Rama, on the other hand, is about dinosaurs as fun. The TriceraTop Spin is a colorful ride for families, while Primeval Whirl is a spinning roller coaster for thrill-seekers. Throughout the area are carnival games and gift shops, as well as chances to meet Disney characters."
The area was sponsored by McDonald's until 2009 when the contract ran out.

Disneyland Resort
"Disneyland Resort is a recreational resort in Anaheim, California. The resort is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks and Resorts division and is home to two theme parks, three hotels and a shopping, dining, and entertainment area."
"The area now known as the Disneyland Resort was developed by Walt Disney in the 1950s and for over 40 years was known simply as ""Disneyland"". When it opened to guests in 1955, the property consisted of Disneyland, its parking lot, and a hotel known as the Disneyland Hotel, owned and operated by Disney's business partner Jack Wrather."
"After doing well with the multi-park, multi-hotel business model at Walt Disney World in Florida, Disney decided to do the same thing in Anaheim and bought a lot of land next to Disneyland. This included buying the Disneyland Hotel from the Wrather company as well as the Pan Pacific Hotel from its Japanese owners. Disney renamed the Pan Pacific Hotel to the ""Disneyland Pacific Hotel"". After its first publicly known proposal for a second theme park in Anaheim was scrapped, construction began in 1998 on a theme park called Disney's California Adventure Park; a hotel called Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, a renovation, renaming, and re-theming of the Disneyland Pacific Hotel; and an admission-free shopping and dining area called Downtown Disney. During the expansion, the name ""Disneyland Resort"" was coined to refer to the entire Disney complex, while ""Disneyland Park"" was coined to refer to the original theme park."
Location.
"The Disneyland Resort is located several miles south of downtown Anaheim, near the border of neighboring Garden Grove. The resort is bordered by Harbor Boulevard to the east, Katella Avenue to the south, Walnut Street to the west and Ball Road to the north. Interstate 5 borders the resort at an angle on the northeastern corner."
"Not all land bordered by these streets is part of the Disneyland Resort, particularly near the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Katella Avenue, and along Ball Road between Disneyland Drive and Walnut Street. Disneyland Drive cuts through the resort on a north-south route and provides access to the Mickey &amp; Friends Parking Structure, Downtown Disney, and the three hotels. Magic Way connects Walnut Street to Disneyland Drive just south of the Mickey &amp; Friends Parking Structure and provides access to the parking structure, Disneyland Hotel, and Downtown Disney."
Special offramps from Interstate 5 combined with a reversible flyover over the intersection of Ball Road and Disneyland Drive permit easy access into and out of the Mickey &amp; Friends parking garage during peak morning and evening traffic times. The official address of the resort is 1313 South Harbor Boulevard.
Tablet computer
"A tablet computer (sometimes called a tablet) is a type of computer that can be carried easily. Unlike a laptop it has no physical keyboard or trackpad, though users sometimes add those things. Users control a tablet mostly by using its touchscreen with multi-touch technology similar to a smartphone. The screen can be anywhere from (sometimes called a phablet) to in size, but many have a screen size of about diagonal."
"Almost all tablet computers can access the Internet using Wi-Fi, and many can use mobile phone networks like 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. Like smartphones, many tablets have sensors such as a camera and a microphone. Other features tablets have are high definition, anti-glare (with less reflection) displays, a Bluetooth radio (to connect to printers and other devices), flash memory, and cloud storage services to back up information on the tablet and synchronize data."
"Science fiction started putting tablets in stories after the middle 20th century. Some companies started making real tablets late in the century. The release of the Apple iPad in 2010 got much attention, and other companies made and sold more."
Advantages and disadvantages.
"Compared to laptop computers, tablets are lighter, more portable, have longer battery life, make less heat, and do not need a mouse or keyboard to be connected. Typing is usually done on the touch screen with a ""virtual"" keyboard which appears on the screen. Many tablets let the user to get reminders even when the tablet is powered off or on standby"
"One bad thing is that the ""virtual"" keyboards are sometimes slow and easy to make typos on. Some tablets can connect to computer keyboards and computer mice to let the user use them in ways similar to a PC. Tablets often have limited storage compared to a laptop."
"The majority run a mobile operating system and may not support as many file formats and different types of software as laptops, but they may work with the same kinds of mobile apps that smartphones use. These weaknesses sometimes result in a tablet being used mainly to consume media made by someone else who used a full-service computer."
Spanish Data Protection Agency
"The Spanish Data Protection Agency (, AEPD) is the national data protection authority from the Kingdom of Spain. It is an agency dependant of the Spanish Ministry of Justice that was created in 1993. It is tasked with protecting Spanish people's privacy."
"This agency ensures compliance of the Organic Law 3/2018 as of December regarding the protection of personal data and digital rights () and the General Data Protection Regulation. It is located in Madrid and it has the power to act in all the Kingdom. Currently the director of the agency is ""Mar España Martín"", and previously ""José Luis Rodríguez Álvarez"" and ""Artemi Rallo Lombarte""."
The Spanish Data Protection Agency is a public law entity with legal personality. It has full public and private capacity to act independently of public administration in the exercise of their functions. It ensures that the titulars of the files that contains personal information strictly follows the data protection legislation.
Moe Howard
"Moe Howard (June 19, 1897 –- May 4, 1975) was an American actor and comedian."
Career.
"Born in New York, U.S., he began his acting career in theater with Ted Healy. The filmed his first short film with Ted Healy Soup to Nuts (1930). Ted Healy and his Stooges, was a comedy group featuring Ted and Moe more Moe's brother Shemp Howard, Larry Fine and Fred Sanborn. Shemp leaving the group was replaced by the younger brother of Moe Curly Howard. After shooting several shorts for MGM, the group disbanded in 1934."
"The beginning of The Three Stooges debut was in 1934 with the short film for Columbia Woman Haters (1934). The Three Stooges, 190 short films shot between 1934 and 1958"
"In the late 50's and early 60s, The Three Stooges began making films as Have Rocket — Will Travel (1959), The Three Stooges in Orbit 1962."
His government was able to raise more money because they stopped paying money to the Roman Catholic Church and because they closed down the monasteries. But he also spent far more money on his own enjoyment and on wars with France and Scotland. These wars did not achieve much. He made the Royal Navy much bigger and made other improvements to the armed forces.
"Early in his reign he was seen as a very handsome young man who had studied a lot and enjoyed sports, music and writing. Later in his reign he became weak, ill and hugely obese. He also became unpredictable, bad-tempered and unable to admit to making mistakes. He died at the age of 55 in 1547. The next king was his son Edward VI."
Early life.
"Henry was born at Greenwich Palace on 28 June 1491, and was the son of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York. He was one of their seven children. Four of them survived infancy  – Arthur, Prince of Wales; Margaret; Henry; and Mary ."
"He had his own servants and minstrels, including a fool named John Goose. He even had a whipping boy who was punished for Henry when he did something wrong. Prince Henry enjoyed music and jousting was very good at both of them. At the age of 10, he could play many instruments, including the fife, harp, viola and drums. Henry was a scholar, linguist, musician and athlete at his early age. He could speak fluent Latin, French and Spanish. He had the best tutors and he also had to learn jousting, archery, hunting and other military arts. Henry was very religious."
"Henry's older brother Arthur was the heir to the throne. This means he would have become the king when Henry VII died. Arthur married a Spanish princess, Catherine of Aragon (her name in Spanish was Catalina de Aragon). Prince Arthur died a few months later. He was 15 years old, and Henry was 10 years old. After his brother died, Henry was the heir to the throne."
"While his father was alive he was watched closely, because the King feared for the safety of his only remaining male heir. Henry could go out only through a private door, and then he was watched by specially appointed people. No one could speak to Henry. He spent most of his time in his room, which could only be entered through his father’s bedroom. Henry never spoke in public, unless it was to answer a question from his father. He kept his enthusiastic personality under control on public occasions because he feared his father's temper. He was given little training for his future role as King by his father and relied heavily on his counselors in the early years of his reign. In 1509, Henry VII died of tuberculosis as well and his son became King Henry VIII. He was 17 years old."
Reign.
Early years.
"Three months after becoming king, Henry married Catherine of Aragon. They tried to have children, as Henry wanted a son who could be the next king. In 1511, she gave birth to a son who they named Henry, but he died seven weeks later. She later gave birth to a girl, the future Queen Mary I. All her other children were stillborn (died before birth). He did have one son (Henry Fitzroy) through a woman he was not married to. This son could not become king."
"Early on, Henry had two of his father's advisors executed. They were not popular and Henry claimed they had been stealing from the money they had been looking after. Henry would often execute anyone he did not like during the rest of his reign. From 1514, Thomas Wolsey became an important advisor to Henry. Wolsey helped Henry change the government to give the king more power. Wolsey later became a cardinal, making him an important figure in the church."
"At first, Henry wanted to be friends with the King of France. But soon, he instead joined with Spain, the Pope and the Holy Roman Empire to weaken France. He dreamed of gaining more lands in France. The results were mixed: England won some battles against France in 1513. The alliance weakened France`s power over the Pope. Scotland invaded England in 1514 but lost badly at the Battle of the Flodden. But Henry spent a lot of money and did not gain much land."
"In 1520, an event named; 'The Field of the Cloth of Gold', took place in Calais (at the time, the city was part of England rather than France). It was held to celebrate peace between France and England because they had been at war for a long time. Loads of money was spent on it. People enjoyed music, dancing, food, wine and culture for two-and-a-half weeks. Henry famously wrestled King Francis I of France and lost. Despite this, England and France were soon fighting again. After they signed a treaty in 1525, there was less fighting."
Split with Rome.
"The most important event that happened in England when Henry was the king was the country's change in religion. At first, there was no sign that Henry would do this. Eight years into Henry's reign, the Protestant Reformation began in Germany. Until then, all of Western Europe had been part of the Roman Catholic Church. When the Reformation began, some countries broke away from the Roman Catholic Church to form Protestant churches. At first, Henry was against this. The Reformation did not spread to England straight away. But by the 1530s, there were many powerful people in England who liked the idea of the Reformation."
"Henry became desperate to have a son. By 1527, Henry was wanting to divorce Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn. The Roman Catholic Church said he could not divorce without asking the Pope. Henry asked the Pope, but the Pope would not do this. The Pope said it went against the teachings of the church. Henry blamed Wolsey for failing to change the Pope's mind. He sacked Wolsey and ordered him to be put on trial, though Wolsey died before the trial could happen. After that, Thomas More became his main advisor. But More opposed the divorce, so he was replaced a few years later by Thomas Cromwell. Henry also chose a man called Thomas Cranmer to be the Archbishop of Canterbury. Henry knew that Cranmer would do what he wanted, and Cranmer agreed that Henry could have a divorce from Catherine. The Pope did not know this, so he let Cranmer become the archbishop."
"A powerful ruler might have forced the Pope to change his mind, but the most powerful rulers would have opposed the divorce. Catherine's nephew was Charles V, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and Catherine came from Spain, the largest Catholic country. In 1534, attempts to reach an agreement over the divorce failed."
"Henry asked Parliament to pass the Act of Supremacy, which meant that the king, not the pope, was the head of the church in England. This created the new Church of England. The Pope was so angry that he excommunicated Henry, meaning Henry was thrown out of the church. Henry then forced all priests and bishops to accept him as the new leader. Anyone who refused was punished. Among those killed were Thomas More and his old teacher John Fisher."
"Henry was not a true Protestant. He wanted the Church of England to be similar to the Roman Catholic Church but under his control. Some Protestants were even executed, including Anne Askew. However, Henry was easily led by people like Thomas Crownell, Thomas Cranmer and Anne Bolyen, who secretly wanted the country to become Protestant. It was not until the reigns of Edward VI and Elizabeth I that the Church of England became fully Protestant."
"Henry and Cromwell thought that monasteries, in which Roman Catholic monks and nuns lived, had more money and land than the monks and nuns needed. Henry forced the monks and nuns to move out of the monasteries. Then Henry gave their money and land to men who supported him. Most of the men who received money and land from the closed monasteries were Protestants. This event was called the dissolution of the monasteries."
Later marriages.
"After his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII married Anne Boleyn, who was younger than Catherine and still able to have children. Henry soon became unhappy with the marriage. He and Anne did not get on well as they had before they married. Anne had many enemies in the government, including Henry's most loyal minister, Thomas Cromwell. Henry was also unhappy that Anne, just like Catherine, only had a daughter and no sons. Henry started looking for another wife."
"In January 1536, Henry fell off a horse while jousting and was badly injured. He took a long time to wake up and his leg was wounded. The wound never properly healed, and he had painful ulcers on his leg for the rest of the his life. This meant it was hard for him to do exercise, so after this he started to become obese. The head injury may have also caused him to become more bad-tempered."
"Later that year, Cromwell helped Henry to find a way to get rid of Anne, by finding people who said that she had been the lover of several other men. Anne was put on trial and found guilty, and she was executed by having her head chopped off by a French swordsman."
"Henry's third wife was Jane Seymour. She soon gave birth to a son called Edward. Although this made Henry very happy, a few days later Jane died. Henry had loved her very much and he never got over his sadness at her death. He lost interest in everything, and became bigger in size. He became angry with Thomas Cromwell when Cromwell suggested that he should get married again after Jane's death."
"After a while, Henry changed his mind. As he still only had one son, he realised that it might be a good idea to marry again, and he agreed to marry Anne of Cleves, a German princess. When Anne arrived, Henry did not think she was as pretty as she looked in the pictures he had seen, and he was not satisfied with her. Anne was also unhappy and agreed to be divorced from Henry after only a few months. Cromwell had helped arrange the marriage. Henry was angry with Cromwell and had him executed."
"In the meantime, Henry had noticed a young lady at court, called Catherine Howard, and thought that she might make a good wife. Catherine Howard was a cousin of Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn. Henry and Catherine got married in 1540, but Catherine was much younger than Henry and she soon got tired of him and started to flirt with other men. After they had been married for just over a year, Henry found out that Catherine had been having an affair with someone else. She was found guilty of treason and was executed, just like Anne Boleyn had been a few years before."
"Henry's sixth and last wife was called Catherine Parr. She was a woman in her thirties who had already been married twice. Her first two husbands had been much older than she was, and both had died. Henry thought that she would be more sensible and faithful than his other wives, and he turned out to be right. Catherine Parr stayed married to Henry for over three years until he died, but they did not have any children."
"After divorcing Catherine of Aragon, Henry began to suffer many different ailments, he never again regained health. He died on 28 January 1547 at the age of 55 and was buried in Windsor Castle. Henry was the father of two queens and one king. They were Mary I of England, Elizabeth I of England, and Edward VI of England. None of them had any children of their own."
"In 1536, the Act of Union was passed under Henry's rule which had a long-lasting effect on Wales as a nation. The Act of Union meant that Welsh people were forced to speak English and things such as road signs were translated into English. The royal family, who were based in London, were now officially in charge of Wales. However, the Act also meant that Welsh citizens were given the same legal rights as the English so there was an upside to this new law."
Personality.
Henry often liked to be captured in his portraits with either food or pets. He had many pets. Henry was often seen with his dog. He owned a white pug and was very aware of how much his dog represented him as a wealthy man.
"Starčević's racism was further fully elaborated by Ivo Pilar [under pseudonym L. von Südland] The book was translated into Croatian language in the year of 1943, by Pavelić's regime, as one of the tenets of his Ustaše and his Independent State of Croatia. This racist work was reprinted in 1990. In the preface to this reprint edition, Dr. Vladimir Veselica, a Zagreb University professor, expresses his enthusiasm that the author had given ""relevant answers"" at the highest intellectual level. What thrilled him so was the consistently expressed racist hatred against the Serbs. It is sufficient to submit one quotation that explains the sense and content of this book, which far outdoes the current demonization of the Serbs: "" it was not without reason that I tried to show how the Serbs today are dangerous for their ideas and their racial composition, how a bent for conspiracies, revolutions and coups is in their blood."""
Oligosaccharide
"An oligosaccharide is a polymer of a few different simple sugars. Oligosacchardides are carbohydrates. When they are hydrolized, oligosaccharides give 3 to 10 monosaccharides."
"Oligosacharides are formed when 3 to 10 monosaccharide units combine with each other by the loss of water molecules, resulting in the formation of a glycosidic linkage. Conversely hydrolysis of an oligosaccharide in water in the presence of an acid or enzyme yields 3 to 10 monosaccharide units. Oligosaccharides which consist of two monosaccharides units are called as disaccharide. Oligosaccharides containing 3 monosaccharides are called trisaccharides."
Think tank
"A think tank is a special organization which helps other organizations and groups with problems they do not know how to solve. They do this by providing data or knowledge, and by discussing the options in detail. They get their information by doing research, and by collecting ideas and data from a wide range of sources."
Origins.
"The first think tank was the British Royal United Services Institute (1831), though of course the term ""think tank"" is much later, post World War II. Non-government institutions in the United States started early in the 20th century. The Arthur D. Little consultancy, incorporated in 1909, pioneered the idea of contracted professional services. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace was founded in 1910. The Institute for Government Research, which later merged into the Brookings Institution, was formed in 1916. Other early twentieth century organizations now classified as think tanks include the Hoover Institution (1919), and Chatham House in London (1920). The Great Depression and its aftermath spawned several economic policy organizations, such as the National Planning Association (1934) and the Committee for Economic Development (1943)."
The cold war era.
"Think tanks of the modern kind started after the Second World War, in the cold war era. The RAND Corporation was started in 1946 inside the Douglas Aircraft Company, and was set up as an independent corporation in 1948. The name was taken from R&amp;D (research and development), though in fact it did no development. The RAND used the same operations research (O.R.) methods which scientists had developed during the war. This was the application of knowledge, scientific methods and thinking to solve the new problems posed by the war. After the war, the RAND used very similar techniques, mostly based on the hard sciences like maths, physics and economics. It was and still is funded mainly by the American government."
"The cold war period raised the question of how the American government might handle nuclear weapons in bargaining and negotiating with the Soviet Union. This was the speciality of Herman Kahn, a RAND staff member who set up his own think tank in 1961, called the Hudson Institute. His publications on how to think about these issues, and those of Thomas Schelling, were landmarks in the post-war history of negotiating strategy."
Modern period.
"More recently, think tanks have specialised into particular areas of interest, such as foreign policy. Many have become advocates for political interests, doing research which can be used by public relations and lobbying groups."
Solar calendar
"A solar calendar shows the earth's position compared to the sun. There are tropical solar calendars, sidereal solar calendars, non-solar calendars (like lunar - moon - calendars), and lunisolar calendars."
Major League Baseball on FOX
"Fox Major League Baseball (shortened as Fox MLB and MLB on FS1) is FOX Sports's broadcast of Major League Baseball. It began on June 1, 1996 and continue through at least 2021."
Early Years: 1996-2000.
"Major League Baseball made a deal with FOX and NBC on November 7, 1995. FOX televised regular season games (about 16 weekly telecasts normally beginning on Memorial Day weekend) on Saturday afternoons, selected Division Series games, and alternated the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and the World Series with NBC each year. To better state this, FOX aired the All-Star Game aired American League Championship Series in odd-numbered years while airing the National League Championship Series and World Series in even-numbered years."
Exclusivity: 2001-2006.
"In September 2000, Major League Baseball and FOX signed a 6-year contract to air Saturday baseball, the All-Star Game, selected Division Series games, and exclusive coverage of the League Championship Series and the World Series."
New Contract: 2007-2021.
"Rumors about the end of ""Major League Baseball on FOX"" were laid to rest on July 11, 2006 when the network announced they would still air the World Series through the 2013 season. It was announced on October 17, 2006 that FOX would retain the All-Star Game and World Series, except they would air the regular season beginning with the first Saturday of the regular season, and postseason coverage beyond the World Series was limited to one League Championship Series a year, alternating one for the other with TBS each year, airing the other LCS."
National League Championship Series
"In Major League Baseball, the National League Championship Series (NLCS), played in October, is a playoff round that decides the winner of the National League pennant. The winner of the series moves on to play the winner of the American League Championship Series in baseball's championship, the World Series."
History.
"In 1969, the LCS began play as the leagues were expanded to two divisions. Initially, it was a best-of-five series. In 1985, it became best-of-seven. Since 1995, the two winners from the National League Division Series advance to the NLCS."
"Lillian Lee McKim, nicknamed Lilly, was born on November 10, 1931 in Roslyn, New York. Her father was Robert V. McKim and her mother was Lillian McKim (maiden name Bostwick). She was the middle child, with an older sister named Mary Maude and younger sister named Florence Fitch. Her mother, Lillian, was an heir to the Standard Oil fortune. Lillian divorced Robert and married Ogden Phipps in 1937."
"Lilly went to the Chapin School in New York City, along with Bouvier sister Jacqueline. In 1949, she graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut. She attended the college-finishing school Finch College in New York City, but left after one semester to work as a midwife's assistant in West Virginia and later as a volunteer at the Veterans Hospital in The Bronx."
"In 1950, she married Peter Pulitzer, the grandson of publisher Joseph Pulitzer. They moved to Palm Beach, where Lilly started her clothing company, Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. In 1969, Lilly and Peter were divorced. She married Enrique Rousseau soon after. She legally changed her name to Lillian Rousseau, but her clothing company kept the ""Lilly Pulitzer"" label. Lilly continued to live in Palm Beach. Enrique died from cancer in 1993."
"Lilly has three children from her marriage to Peter: Peter, Minnie, and Liza. Peter lives in Bridgehampton, New York, with his wife, Elise, and five children: Fiona, Caleb, Stefan, Aaron, and Daniella. Liza currently lives in West Palm Beach, Florida, with her husband, Henry, and three children: Waverly, Hattie and Rayna. Liza is currently helping out in Florida with the Lilly Pulitzer Brand."
Death.
"Pulitzer died on April 7, 2013 in her home in Palm Beach, California from natural causes, at age 81."
Business.
"Lilly and Peter settled in Palm Beach, Florida, shortly after their marriage. Peter owned several Florida citrus groves, and with fruit from the groves Lilly opened a juice stand on Via Mizner, just off Worth Avenue in Palm Beach."
"In the course of working at the juice stand, Lilly found that squeezing juice made a mess of her clothes. Seeking to hide the juice stains, she designed a sleeveless shift dress made of bright, colorful printed cotton. Lilly found that customers loved her dress, so she made more to sell at her juice stand. Eventually, she was selling more dresses than juice, and decided to focus on making and selling what had become known as her ""Lillys""."
"In 1959, Lilly became president of her own company, Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. The company's main factory was located in Miami, Florida and the fabrics were produced by the Key West Hand Print Fabrics company in Key West."
"From the 1960s to the early 1980s, Lilly's bright, colorful clothes were very popular, worn by rich people such as First Lady Jackie Kennedy, and members of the Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney families. However, by 1984, Lilly felt she was not having as much fun as she used to and retired, closing down her entire clothing business."
Revival of the brand.
"In 1993, the rights to the Lilly Pulitzer brand were bought by Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. They contacted Lilly with the hopes of bringing back the brand because, ""they just loved Lilly, their mothers and sisters loved Lilly, and they wanted to bring the line back,"" according to Lilly herself. Lilly is not involved in the day-to-day running of the company, but she continues to do things like approve new designs, fabrics, and collections."
"Today, the company has 75 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores (also known as Via Stores), several company-owned retail stores, sells to independently owned stores and is in major department stores such as Bloomingdales, Lord and Taylor, Nordstrom, and Neiman Marcus. On December 21, 2010, Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. was bought by Oxford Industries, Inc."
Products.
"Along with women's clothing, the company also makes men's clothing, children's clothing, maternity clothes, shoes, jewelry, accessories, bedding (revived in 2010), and stationery. The company started a bridal collection in 2010."
"Lilly Pulitzer has made special collections with sorority prints on them, among them Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta Delta Delta, and Delta Zeta. She has held contests on her Facebook page to vote on which sororities will get their own prints."
Cultural impact.
"Lisa Birnbach's humorous ""guides"", ""The Official Preppy Handbook"" and its sequel ""True Prep: It’s a Whole New Old World"", say Lilly Pulitzer clothing is a must-have item for ""preppy"" women."
"The Museum of Lifestyle &amp; Fashion History in Boynton Beach, Florida, ran an exhibit from August 2010 through May 2011 about the clothing and designs of Lilly Pulitzer. Museum director Lori Durante stated ""Lilly Pulitzer fashion is relative to the American experience ... It is relevant to Palm Beach County, to Florida."""
Space Shuttle Columbia disaster
"The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred when broke up when it was reentering the atmosphere on February 1, 2003. The cause of the disaster was that a piece of foam broke from the external fuel tank. This made a hole in the shuttle's wing. During its entry, hot gases entered the wing, causing it to break up. All of the people on board died when it broke up."
"Parts of ""Columbia"" were found across the state of Texas. The cockpit window is now inside the Pavilion at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida."
Launch &amp; response.
"""Columbia"" launched on its final mission on January 16, 2003. It was ""Columbia""'s 28th flight and the 113th of any Shuttle."
"81 seconds into flight, a briefcase-sized part of the external fuel tank's foam insulation, which stops ice from forming while the very cold liquid fuel is in the tank, broke away and hit ""Columbia"". Such debris strikes had happened before - in particular on STS-27 in which a piece of a booster's forward heat shield broke and hit ""Atlantis""' bottom-side heat shield - and were seen as an acceptable risk. However, this debris strike hit ""Columbia""'s left wing head on, punching a hole through the panels on the wing's forward edge."
"Once high-quality video of the launch was ready, NASA reviewed it and concluded that everything was fine, and stopped engineers from using Department of Defense images from orbit to get a closer look. NASA management thought that even if something were wrong, it would be better for the crew not to know since rescue or repair would be nearly impossible. One flight director contacted ""Columbia"" about the concerns, but stressed ""we have seen this same phenomenon on other flights and there is absolutely no concern for [re-]entry."""
Failed re-entry.
"On February 1, ""Columbia"" prepared to return to Earth on a path that would take it over the USA from west to east. At 8:15 EST, about an hour before ""Columbia"" was due to land, it lit its engines and changed its course so that it would re-enter the atmosphere. A 13-minute video recorded in the cabin, ending eleven minutes before the loss of signal from ""Columbia"", shows the astronauts in good spirits and unaware of the danger. As ""Columbia"" entered the atmosphere, the air heated up around it due to the Shuttle moving at extreme speeds, over twenty times the speed of sound. This air was able to enter the wing through the hole made during launch, melting through it and causing the Shuttle to lose lift on that side. This loss of lift caused the Shuttle to turn away from its re-entry path, tumble, and break up from the drag of the air."
"""Columbia"" passed over California at 8:53. Video shows flashes happening and an unusual trail left behind ""Columbia"", which even hobbyist watchers saw as out of the ordinary. At this point, the temperature of the damaged part of the wing was around 3,000°F (1,650°C). By 8:58 ""Columbia"", still moving at incredible speeds, crossed from New Mexico into Texas, at which point it began shedding debris. By this point several temperature sensors in the damaged left wing had stopped working, and one of the flight controllers reported that the tyre pressure sensors on that side were reporting ""off scale low""- meaning that it is a reading that falls below the minimum capability of the sensor, and it usually indicates that the sensor has stopped functioning, due to internal or external factors, not that the quantity it measures is actually below the sensor's minimum response value."
"The last communication with commander Rick Husband was ""Roger, uh bu-"" at 8:59. 45 seconds later, video from the ground shows ""Columbia"" breaking apart. Mission Control began its disaster procedures at 9:12."
Pomarkku
"Pomarkku () is a municipality in Satakunta in Finland. It's nearby Pori and Kankaanpää. The municipality has a population of 2,196 (31 August 2017)."
"In the civil war, Pomarkku had a big battle with several deads."
Chotti Bahu 2
"Choti Bahu 2 () is the second season of an Indian television drama series. The series premiered on February 15, 2011. It currently airs every Mon-Fri 7:30 pm on Zee TV channel. It is about the lives of Radhika and Dev. It is a different story than the first season. It has a different storyline and even some characters except for Dev and Radhika which are played by Avinash Sachdev and Rubina Dilaik respectively. The show is very popular and gains good TRP with an average of 2–3."
Plot.
"Radhika, a Brahmin by birth, was adopted and brought up by a family of weavers in a small town. Dev visited the town with his family, met Radhika and became good friends. One day, while Radhika and Dev playing in a temple, they reached a place where 50 couples were getting married. Dev rubbed sindoor on Radhika's forehead, which she had gotten on her head by accident. This caused them to get married without their knowledge. When a priest who witnessed Dev and Radhika's ""wedding"" comes to Radhika's home and tells her parents that Radhika is married, Radhika tries to tell Dev this but is unable to meet him again."
After 12 years.
"One night after college, Radhika meets Dev. They spend time together but Radhika feels bad that she is attracted to someone else. Later on, she finds out that Dev is the one she had married as a child and tells him the truth. Under obligations, he tells her to marry Rohan. She tries to make him accept many times, but he refuses."
"Radhika is unable to get married to Rohan after all. A fire starts and Rohan gets badly burned, though Radhika is saved. Dev meets Radhika in the hospital and asks her what caused the fire. She tells him that Rohan knows that she loves someone else; Dev gets angry at this and tells her he hates her. Radhika decides to get into their house as the ""choti bahu"" and wife of Dev without telling anyone so she can gain Dev's trust back."
"After all the misunderstandings are cleared, the family accepts Dev and Radhika's relationship and Dev and Radhika are soon to be wed. However, because of social norms, everyone calls Radhikha an unchaste woman. To end this problem, Dadaji calls off Dev's marriage with Radikha and fixes it with Barkha. On the eve of Barkha and Dev's wedding, Barkha, wishing to help Radhika, lies to Radikha that she has told Dadaji about what happened 12 years ago and Dadaji has accepted her and will let her become Dev's wife. Radhika therefore dresses up in Barkha's wedding dress and takes the wedding vows with Dev."
"After Dadaji realizes that Dev married Radikha instead of Barkha, he suffers a fatal heart attack. The Purohit family decides that Dev will pretend to be married to Barkha in the public eye, and Radhika will perform all of the normal tasks at home."
"Radhika obediently performs all the duties of a ""choti bahu"". Barkha puts sleeping powder in Dev's juice, causing him to become unconscious. Barkha then reveals that she loves Dev and Radhika overhears everything. Barkha realizes this and decides to kill Radhika to get Dev's love. Barkha murders Radhika by driving into her with a car twice. In a twist, Radhika returns after a month, but this time is different — she has become confident and fearless. This is because Kanha, the god Radhika is devoted to, has disguised himself as Radhika to put an end to Barkha's crimes, as Dev is made only for Radhika."
"The rest of the story tells how Kanha teaches Barkha her lesson. One day, when Kanha is at home as Radhika, Dev asks her if she's alright. Radhikha asks why, and Dev tells her he saw her outside the temple begging for help. This is actually the real Radhika, who was reborn after Barkha tried to suffocate her. Dev is later poisoned by a juice that Barkha got originally for Radhika, and the family believes Radhika did it. Barkha repeatedly tries to get Radhika out of the house."
"Then the real Radhika comes in the house. However, Kahna helps Radhika throughout everything. Barkha tries to murder Radhika again, but Dev stops her. The entire family then appears and disgraces Barkha, finally knowing her true nature. However, as Radhika faints, Barkha flees and successfully escapes. Later in the day, while Radhika and Dev go into the forest, Barkha tries to kill both of them, thinking that if she can't have Dev, no one can. However, everyone thinks she dies instead. The monastery was being taken by the bharawaj family which was however Radhikas real family. Ruby wants to kill Radhika even though she is her twin sister and that is the reason why she wants to kill her. Radhika and Dev both go to mumbai to radhika's house but Dev feels uncomfortable when they get a unwelcoming welcome from Ruby. Ruby and Jolly (Rubys brother who loves her so much) try to make a plan to throw Dev and radhika out of the house. When everyone comes to the party and Radhika finds out that everyone was using her to get the"
"monastery land and humiliate her husband she severs all ties with them and try to find krishnas idol and leave but Khana comes and tell Radhika she has to stay back alone because of the battle against right and wrong. Radika stays back but Dev and her in laws get mad at her and Radhika s family think that she did that for money and she became greedy. In the morning Radikha was doing a puja without an idol and ruby comes but she is not her self but an evil spirit comes and possessed her body and ""Ruby"" strangles Radhika but doesn't succeed. Radhika thinks that there is a bad omen when the mirror shatters and the curtains flow when the windows are closed. In the middle of the night Ruby suddenly enters the purohit house in Dev and Radhika s room. The spirit ruby faints after seeing khanas photo. Dev is confused and the family.the next morning Ruby s family come to pick her up but the spirit comes in her and she says that she wants to stay and says that the monastery will stay with her. Then after a few incidents Radhika and Dev find out that Ruby is possessed by an evil spirit and the priest says that either Ruby or Radhika have to live but to take away the evil spirit radhika must go to a cave that leads to the world of death. she has to get an antidote that will take the evil spirit out of ruby's body. Radhika faces snakes and poisonous plants. She survives by praying to Kanha . At home sonia (Radhika's step-mother aunt), Rb (Radhika and Ruby s father), and Jolly think Dev is talking rubbish when he tells them that ruby is possessed by an evil spirit and she cant get out of the house. Sonia thinks that this is an opportunity to get the bharadwaj property and ruby would die. Jolly tells Ruby who is suffering that Dev is talking rubbish and takes off Kanha's locket to protect ruby then the spirit comes in ruby and kicks Jolly out. Jolly is shocked and so is the family. Radhika gets the antidote and tries to give it to ruby but the spirit flies and Tries to kill ruby radhika saves her and ruby says sorry to everyone for being to rude. Then she dies. Everyone agrees that she is dead but radhika does not. She goes to the temple and tells Kanha to bring her to life but she kills herself instead and dies and talks to Kanha. Kanha says that this is her destiny but radhika changed it and she isn't supposed to die. Radhika tells kanha to bring her to life and kanha listens and ruby comes to life. Ruby is sad and begs to khana to bring her to life and promises him she will never be bad to radhika. She tells radhika she will change and Jolly also says to khana and puts his gun before kanha and promises he will never do anything illegal but just let his sister come to life. Radhika comes to life and ruby and Jolly thank khana. Sonia and the others cant believe it. Sonia is mad then she wont get the property. Rb says that his first wife who is radhika's mother savatri died when radhika and ruby were babies and took radhika to mansaraam. Rb admits that Kanha exists and everyone bow down and thank kanha. SO far everyone has changed except Sonia."

Itanium is or was supported (i.e. Windows version can no longer be bought) by the following operating systems:
"Microsoft announced that Windows Server 2008 R2 would be the last version of Windows Server to support the Itanium (support started with XP), and that it would also discontinue development of the Itanium versions of Visual Studio and SQL Server."
"Likewise, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (first released in March 2007) was the last Itanium edition of Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
"and Debian no longer supports Itanium officially (last release with official support was Debian 7 / Wheezy, and was not covered by Long Term Support (LTS), but unofficial support for newer Debian is still available in limited form via Debian Ports; last available kernel in wheezy-backports is Linux 3.14.0, which was released on March 30, 2014, but it is possible to manually update to latest 3.14.x version, or more recent kernel versions, like 4.17.17 as of September 2018) and in addition Canonical Ltd. chose to not support Itanium for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (released in April 2010, now discontinued)."
HP will not be supporting or certifying Linux on Itanium 9300 (Tukwila) servers.
"In late September 2012, NEC announced a return from IA-64 to the previous NOAH line of proprietary mainframe processors, now produced in a quad-core variant on 40 nm, called NOAH-6."
HP sells a virtualization technology for Itanium called Integrity Virtual Machines.
"To allow more software to run on the Itanium, Intel supported the development of compilers optimized for the platform, especially its own suite of compilers."
"Starting in November 2010, with the introduction of new product suites, the Intel Itanium Compilers were no longer bundled with the Intel x86 compilers in a single product. Intel offers Itanium tools and Intel x86 tools, including compilers, independently in different product bundles."
"GCC,"
Open64 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (and later)
"are also able to produce machine code for Itanium. According to the Itanium Solutions Alliance over 13,000 applications were available for Itanium-based systems in early 2008,"
though Sun has contested Itanium application counts in the past.
"The ISA also supported Gelato, an Itanium HPC user group and developer community that ported and supported open-source software for Itanium."
Emulation.
"Emulation is a technique that allows a computer to execute binary code that was compiled for a different type of computer. Before IBM's acquisition of QuickTransit in 2009, application binary software for IRIX/MIPS and Solaris/SPARC could run via type of emulation called ""dynamic binary translation"" on Linux/Itanium. Similarly, HP implemented a method to execute PA-RISC/HP-UX on the Itanium/HP-UX via emulation, to simplify migration of its PA-RISC customers to the radically different Itanium instruction set. Itanium processors can also run the mainframe environment GCOS from Groupe Bull and several x86 operating systems via instruction set simulators."
Competition.
"Itanium is aimed at the enterprise server and high-performance computing (HPC) markets. Other enterprise- and HPC-focused processor lines include Oracle Corporation's SPARC M7, Fujitsu's SPARC64 X+ and IBM's POWER8. Measured by quantity sold, Itanium's most serious competition comes from x86-64 processors including Intel's own Xeon line and AMD's Opteron line. Since 2009, most servers were being shipped with x86-64 processors."
"In 2005, Itanium systems accounted for about 14% of HPC systems revenue, but the percentage has declined as the industry shifts to x86-64 clusters for this application."
"An October 2008 paper by Gartner, on the Tukwila processor stated that ""...the future roadmap for Itanium looks as strong as that of any RISC peer like Power or SPARC."""
Supercomputers and high-performance computing.
"An Itanium-based computer first appeared on the list of the TOP500 supercomputers in November 2001. The best position ever achieved by an ""Itanium 2"" based system in the list was #2, achieved in June 2004, when Thunder (LLNL) entered the list with an Rmax of 19.94 Teraflops. In November 2004, Columbia entered the list at #2 with 51.8 Teraflops, and there was at least one Itanium-based computer in the top 10 from then until June 2007. The peak number of Itanium-based machines on the list occurred in the November 2004 list, at 84 systems (16.8%); by June 2012, this had dropped to one system (0.2%), and no Itanium system remained on the list in November 2012."
Processors.
Released processors.
"The Itanium processors show a progression in capability. Merced was a proof of concept. McKinley dramatically improved the memory hierarchy and allowed Itanium to become reasonably competitive. Madison, with the shift to a 130 nm process, allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottlenecks. Montecito, with a 90 nm process, allowed for a dual-core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt. Montvale added three new features: core-level lockstep, demand-based switching and front-side bus frequency of up to 667 MHz."
Future processors.
"During the HP vs. Oracle support lawsuit, court documents unsealed by Santa Clara County Court judge revealed in 2008, Hewlett-Packard had paid Intel Corp. around $440 million to keep producing and updating Itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014. In 2010, the two companies signed another $250 million deal, which obliged Intel to continue making Itanium central processing units for HP's machines until 2017. Under the terms of the agreements, HP has to pay for chips it gets from Intel, while Intel launches Tukwila, Poulson, Kittson and Kittson+ chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of the platform."
Kittson.
"""Kittson"" is planned to follow Poulson in 2015. Kittson, like Poulson, will be manufactured using Intel's 32 nm process. Few other details are known beyond the existence of the codename and the binary and socket compatibility with Poulson and Tukwila, though moving to a common socket with x86 Xeon ""will be evaluated for future implementation opportunities"" after Kittson."
E. L. James
"Erika Mitchell (born 7 March 1963), known by her pen name as E. L. James is an English author. James was born in London. She was raised in Buckinghamshire. She studied History at the University of Kent. James wrote: ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", """", ""Fifty Shades Freed"", and ""Fifty Shades Darker""."
"In most ancient Hindu texts, Kurukshetra is not a city but a region (""kshetra"" meaning ""region"" in Sanskrit). The boundaries of Kurukshetra lies to the central and western parts of state of Haryana and southern Punjab. Thus according to the Taittiriya Aranyaka 5.1.1., the Kurukshetra region is south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh in Sirhind, Punjab), north of Khandava (Delhi and Mewat region), east of Maru (desert) and west of Parin."
History.
"It is written in Puranas that Kurukshetra is named after King Kuru of the Bharata Dynasty, ancestor of Pandavas and Kauravas."
"The Vamana Purana tells how King Kuru came to settle here. He chose this land at the banks of Sarasvati River which dried up before 1900 BCE for embedding spirituality with eight virtues: austerity (Tapas (Sanskrit)), truth (Satya), forgiveness (Kshama), kindness (daya), purity (Shuddha), charity (Daana), Yajna and Brahmacharya. Lord Vishnu was impressed with the act of King Kuru and blessed him. God gave him two boons: one that this land forever will be known as a Holy Land and the other that anyone dying on this land will go to heaven. The land of Kurukshetra was between two rivers — the Sarasvati and the Drishadvati."
"This land has been known as Uttarvedi, Brahmavedi, Dharamkshetra and Kurukshetra at different periods. When King Kuru came on this land it was called Uttarvedi. Over the period this land has been ruled by many empires. The Bharata Dynasty came and settled here."
"By the archaeological grounds it has been proved that Ashoka the Great made Kurukshetra a centre of learning for people from all over the world. It reached the peak of its progress during the reign of King Harsha, during which Chinese scholar Xuanzang visited Thanesar."
48 Kos Parikrama.
Kurukshetra has great importance as a Hindu pilgrimage. There are several pilgrimages around the city of kurukshetra and a complete parikrama means to visit all these pilgrimages. 48 kos parikrama is a Hindi phrase meaning 48 miles circle around the holy city of Kurukshetra.
Sykes–Picot Agreement
"The Sykes–Picot Agreement /ˈsaɪks piˈkoʊ/, officially known as the Asia Minor Agreement, was a secret agreement concluded between the United Kingdom and France in 1916. The main aim of the British and French was to agree on who should get which sphere of influence in Ottoman territories in Southwest Asia. In this way, they wanted to limit competition between each other after the First World War and secure strategically important territories for themselves. The line separating their respective zones of influence was called the Sykes-Picot line. The Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy consented to the agreement, receiving a territorial advantage in return. The agreement was named after the two diplomats who negotiated it: the British diplomat Mark Sykes and the French diplomat François Georges-Picot. They negotiated for five weeks, from the 23rd of November 1915 to the 3rd of January 1916, before agreeing on a memorandum. The agreement itself was concluded on the 9th and 16th of May 1916, when the British and French governments accepted and signed (ratified) the memorandum."
"When the Russian revolutionaries made the agreement public in 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution, which caused embarassment among the British and French and growing distrust among the Arabs. More than hundred years later, this agreement is still mentioned in the current conflicts and disputes in the respective regions of the Middle East."
Historical context.
"The Ottoman Empire, under the lead of the CUP, entered the war in autumn 1914 on the side of the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and initially also Italy) and was therefore opposed to the Triple Entente (United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire). The Sykes–Picot Agreement was concluded with the British and French expecting victory against the Central Powers and thus the demise of the Ottoman Empire."
British and French interests in the Middle East.
"As scholars have argued, the Sykes-Picot agreement was signed with the aim to further the colonial and strategic interests of the British and French in the region and settle their rivalry, rather than to create viable states after the war."
"The main interest of the British was to secure their access to the Mediterranean Sea and thus the route to India, as well as access to the Iraqi oil fields. At the beginning of the twentieth century, oil replaced coal as the most important resource, being the lighter raw material. This lead to an increasing dependence on oil that was inaccessible on British soil."
The French were interested in securing access to the Mediterranean through the port of Tyre in Lebanon as well as getting their longstanding claims to Mount Lebanon and Damascus validated.
Russian and Italian agreement.
"For the Sykes-Picot agreement to pass, Britain and France needed to satisfy the Russians. In exchange for the Russian Empire’s approval of the treaty, the Russian Foreign minister Serkey Saznov and the French ambassador Maurice Paléologue concluded the Saznov-Paléologue Agreement in May 1916. They mutually agreed that the Russian Empire would get Western Armenia in addition to the already earlier attributed Constantinople and the Turkish Straits. The Kingdom of Italy also knew about the agreement and was convinced by being promised Southern Anatolia in the St-Jean-de-Maurienne agreement in 1917."
"The Saznov-Paléologue agreement, the St-Jean-de-Maurienne agreement, the Balfour Declaration (between the British and the Zionists) and the Sykes-Picot agreement (with a handful of others concerning the expected partition of the Ottoman Empire) are often referred to as ""The Secret Treaties""."
The Hussein-McMahon correspondence.
"Prior to starting negotiations with the French, the British had already discussed the future of Greater Syria with Sharif Hussein, the Emir of Mecca, in 1915. In what is known as the Hussein-McMahon correspondence, the British promised the Arabs an independent state in the area of Greater Syria. In return, Sharif Hussein would incite an Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire."
Regional division.
"Geographically, the agreement primarily focused on the provinces outside of the Arabian Peninsula. A line separated a zone A (under indirect French rule) from a zone B (under indirect British rule). Zone A included the major inland cities of Syria as well as the Iraqi city of Mosul, zone B stretched from Iraq to the Sinai borders of Egypt. A blue zone along the Eastern Mediterranean coastline (and parts of what is today Turkey) was supposed to be placed under direct French rule. The United Kingdom was supposed to have direct control over the Iraqi provinces of Basra and Baghdad (the red zone), as well as parts of what is Israel today, ensuring British access to the Mediterranean Sea. Palestine was supposed to be placed under international administration."
"The Arab state that McMahon had promised to Sharif Hussein was now supposed to be under indirect British and French control. This has led historians to call the Sykes-Picot agreement ""a startling piece of double-dealing"" by the British and an ""outrageous example of imperial perfidy""."
Conflicting promises and consequences.
"Following the October Revolution of 1917, the Russian revolutionaries (Bolsheviks) released a series of secret documents. Among these publications was the Sykes–Picot Agreement. The publication of the Sykes-Picot agreement made visible the conflicting promises the British had made concerning the Ottoman territory to the French, Sharif Hussein and the Arabs and the Zionists (in the Balfour Declaration)."
The Sykes-Picot line after the War.
"The agreement is often accused of having ""drawn lines in the sand"", i.e. artificially dividing the Middle East without regard to ethnic or cultural factors. In fact the agreement was never (fully) implemented. It was in the San Remo Conference (1920) and Treaty of Lausanne (1923) that the lines were definitely drawn and decided who was going to govern (directly and indirectly) which parts of the partitioned Ottoman Empire, with Turkey wanting to rule areas that the French had initially hoped to govern. Although the agreement was indeed not implemented in its original form, the British and French were able to secure strategically important lands. The Arabs on the other hand did not see the establishment of an independent Arab kingdom as promised and felt betrayed."
Modern politics.
"The year 2016 marked the 100th anniversary of the Sykes–Picot Agreement, which was heavily debated given its frequent mention by ISIS (ISIS released a video entitled ""The End of Sykes-Picot"" in 2014). ISIS claimed that in order to create a unified Islamic State, it intended to reverse the effects of the Sykes–Picot Agreement."
"The discovery of oil and minerals in Somalia, as well as the power and money associated with politics and business, has created more opportunities for families to get ahead, and has also created more reasons for families to have disputes."
"Because Somalia does not have a working legal system, the only help a family in Somalia has to solve a dispute with another family is to get their clan involved. The only solution to the clan wars in Somalia is a working legal system, but the only group who has succeeded in creating one is the Islamic Courts Union. Unfortunately the Islamic Courts Union was accused of being terrorists and Ethiopia invaded Somalia to topple their government and put the government they created in power instead."
History.
"In ancient times, Somalia was a place where people from Egypt and Arabia went to buy Gum Arabic, Myrrh and Ebony Wood. The Ancient Egyptians used to call it Punt, which meant ""God's Land"". Somalis started herding camel and goats about 4,000 years ago, and they remain mostly herders today."
"Visitors from as far away as China visited Somalia, such as Zheng He."
Medieval history.
"400 more years later, the king of Ethiopia told his subjects that God hated Ifat, and he invaded Ifat with his army, destroying everything he came across and driving the king of Ifat to an island off the coast of Zeila, where he died. The king of Ethiopia then took part of Ifat and added it to his kingdom, and made Ifat pay him lots of money once a year. The remains of Ifat put their kingdom back together again and renamed it Adal."
"About a hundred years later, the King of Adal was deposed by an influential warlord by the name of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, who had lots of influence with Somali clans across the north. He declared a Jihad against Ethiopia, brought together a huge army that included Turkish musketeers and Somali cavalry. The Somali cavalry were especially deadly because they could shoot arrows while riding their horses, something that the Mongol hordes and Japanese Samurai are also famous for."
"Ahmad chose a bad time, however, because the Portuguese Empire was muscling into East Africa. They had taken over the whole east African coast up to Baraawe, and were trying to take over Mogadishu. The Portuguese decided to help out the Ethiopians because the Ethiopians were Christians and the Portuguese did not like Muslims. Ahmad had taken over more than half of Ethiopia when a troop of Portuguese musketeers showed up to help the Ethiopians out. One Portuguese musketeer managed to shoot Ahmad himself, killing him."
"A lot of the Somali cavalry was only there because of Ahmad, so the Jihad ended and Ethiopia wound up invading Adal. The Turks had to send an army to stop them from taking over Zeila, and Adal ended up becoming part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. On those days we do not find the exact people dwell in zeila, but the history ascribed the black people, without tracing their origin and their tribes."
"However, some historians attributed Zeila inhabitant were called semaale without farther lucid explanation."
Daraawiish State.
"The Turks and Portuguese fought over East Africa for the next 200 years, but the Turks eventually won about 270 years ago. Northern Somalia stayed under Turkish protection after Ahmad died, and the east coast including Mogadishu ended up under the protection of the King of Oman. When Egypt declared independence from the Turks a hundred years later, Northern Somalia became part of Egypt. Egypt came under British protection shortly after that, and northern Somalia basically became a British protectorate as well. This became official about 130 years ago, and northern Somalia officially became British Somaliland."
"The Kingdom of Italy had just come together as one country around this time, and wanted the same things that the other big countries had, like colonies. Italy offered to buy the rights to the east Africa coast from Oman, who was in charge of protecting the cities and small kingdoms there, and Oman agreed. Italy made deals with some of the larger kingdoms/sultanates (like the Sultanate of Nugaal) for them to be under Italian protection, but the smaller ones Italy just invaded. This became Italian Somalia in 1905, with capital Mogadishu."
"Ethiopia, which had fallen apart again after Ahmad's Jihad, had recently put itself back together again as well, and started invading small Somali kingdoms as well, and by 1890 there were not many left. The French got in on this too, but they just took over a small area which today is Djibouti."
"Lots of Somalis did not like what was going on, so a Muslim religious leader named Mohammed Abdullah Hassan started a group called the Darwiish to fight the British, Italians and Ethiopians. The British called him the ""Mad Mullah"" and spent about 30 years fighting him, eventually using fighter planes against his cavalry. At their height the Darwiish controlled almost a third of Somalia."
"Italy created a colony around Mogadishu and enlarged the territory of Italian Somalia after WW1 with the areas south of the Juba river. In the next 20 years the Italian colony grew in importance, having at Hafun the biggest salt production in the world and in the Scebeli river a huge production of bananas exported to Europe. In 1928 was created the first airport in Somalia's capital and later in 1939 was started the longest air route in Africa with the Linea dell'impero, a flight between Rome and Mogadishu."
World War 2 history.
"When Benito Mussolini took power in Italy, he ended the deals he made with the bigger Somali sultanates and invaded them conquering all the area that was to be the colony of Italian Somalia. Then he invaded and took over Ethiopia, using poison gas on the Ethiopians. Shortly afterwards, World War 2 broke out and he invaded British Somaliland, but two years later the British returned and liberated British Somaliland and Ethiopia as well as taking over Italian Somaliland."
"After the war, Britain wanted to put all of the places Somalis lived in one country, which would be a British protectorate. The Ethiopians complained that they should be able to keep the areas they conquered, and the Italians also complained the same thing, so in the end the Ethiopians got to keep their bit, and the Italians did too. However, Italian Somaliland was put under a United Nations mandate, so the Italians could not make it a colony."
Cold War history.
"In 1960 both British and Italian Somaliland declared independence together as the ""Somali Republic"". It was chosen the Latin alphabet for the Somali language. Many areas where Somalis lived were still part of Britain, Ethiopia and France. Somalia wanted to get back all the areas that had been colonized by the French, Ethiopians and British. Somalia and Ethiopia had a short war in 1964 over the Ethiopian part of Somalia, and it was obvious that more fighting was to come."
"In 1969, the President of Somalia was killed by a man whose clan had been hurt by his policies, and General Mohammed Siad Barre took over the country. Siad Barre built a huge army with help from the Soviet Union and when Ethiopia fell for the fourth time (this time because of a Communist takeover) he invaded. The Soviet Union decided that Ethiopia was more important than Somalia and double-crossed Siad Barre, supplying huge amounts of weapons to Ethiopia. Other countries like Cuba and Israel also sent help to Ethiopia, so in the end Siad Barre lost the war."
"Ethiopia's new government then began helping Somali rebel groups, who did not like how Siad Barre took over the country, and these rebel groups toppled Siad Barre' government in 1991 and forced him out of the country. After this, however, all of the rebel groups started fighting amongst themselves over who would be in charge now that Siad Barre was gone."
"Eventually, some of the rebel groups decided to make their own governments in the land that they controlled. One, called Somaliland, declared independence from Somalia entirely, while another called Puntland declared independence ""for now"" until a new Somali national government can be put together. Dozens of attempts to create a new national government failed."
Modern history.
"Because there was no government in most of Somalia (except where one had been built from scratch, like Puntland and Somaliland) Somalia's only legal system, beyond the law of the gun, was traditional custom and Islamic Sharia law. Because of this, Sharia legal scholars in the lawless south of Somalia gained quite a bit of influence. Around the same time, the people fighting for Somali lands in Ethiopia to be part of Somalia turned to the example of the Afgani Mujahideen, and created their own group called al-Ittihad al-Islamiyya or the Islamic Union. During the 1990s Ethiopia invaded Somalia several times to attack the Islamic Union, who were helping Somali rebels in Ethiopia."
"After 2001, the United States of America became very suspicious of both the Sharia courts and the Islamic Union of being terrorists. Warlords made a group called the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism. The Sharia courts banded together to protect themselves and created the Islamic Courts Union. People liked the Sharia courts and hated the gangsters, so everyone helped the Islamic Courts Union, who defeated the gangsters and drove them out of Mogadishu in 2006. The Islamic Courts Union then formed an army and took over most of southern Somalia."
"The United States of America and Ethiopia was alarmed by this takeover, so Ethiopia invaded southern Somalia in 2007 and put a new government in power that was made up of the rebel groups that Ethiopia had funded 15 years earlier. Almost everyone disagreed with this decision, and that same year a rebellion against this new government broke out in Mogadishu and spread across the whole country by 2008. At around the same time, Somali pirates kidnapped westerners from big ships for ransom."
Mel Blanc
"Melvin Jerome Blanc (May 30, 1908 – July 10, 1989) was an American voice actor, radio personality and comedian. Nicknamed The Man of a Thousand Voices, he was best known for his voice roles such as in ""Looney Tunes"", Hanna-Barbera cartoons, and others."
1858 expedition.
"Stuart learned from his trip with Sturt that large groups were not able to move quickly through the dry Australian lands. He believed that a small group would have more success. Finke paid him to find out if the land north of Lake Torrens would be suitable for sheep. On this first trip he went with two men, Forster and an unnamed Aboriginal youth. They took six horses, enough food for six weeks, a watch and a compass. In May 1858 they went through settled areas until they reached Oratunga Station, one of the most remote farms in South Australia. It is near the present day town of Blinman, in the north of the Flinders Ranges. From here they went northwest and found a permanent water hole, Andamooka Waterhole, on a creek Stuart named Chambers Creek. It has since been renamed Stuart Creek. The country was very dry, and they could only find water in Aboriginal wells. The stony ground hurt the horses feet. At the end of July they reached the site of the present day town of Coober Pedy. Their horses were in poor condition and they were running out of food. Stuart decided to change direction to the south west and try and reach the coast near Fowlers Bay. The Aboriginal youth would not go any further and went back. He was scared of other Aborigines in the area they were going into. Stuart said the land was ""...dreary, dismal, dreadful desert."" Stuart and Forster reached the coast at Denial Bay in August 1858, and were back in settled farm lands by 11 September. They had completed a journey of in four months. He gave his diary and maps to the South Australian government. As a reward, Stuart was given the lease to 1,000 square miles of land at Chambers Creek."
Stuart's second expedition 1859.
"The official South Australian government explorer Benjamin Herschel Babbage followed Stuart's maps and went to Chambers Creek. He reported that the map showed the creek was marked too far to the north. Stuart went back to Chambers Creek to survey the area again. This expedition was paid for by James Chambers and William Finke who realized the value of reliable water supplies on the other side of the salt lakes. Stuart left Oratunga Station on 2 April 1859, with a small group, three men and 14 horses. The men he took with him included a Bavarian naturalist and artist, David Herrgott, and Louis Müller, a stockman and botanist. Both Herrgott and Müller had been gold miners in Victoria, and would know how to look for gold in the country around Chambers Creek. They did not carry much equipment, only a blanket to sleep with, but no tents. The only food they took was flour, dried beef (jerky), tea, sugar and tobacco. He took more equipment than just his watch and compass on this trip; a sextant, a copy of the Astronomical Almanac and a telescope."
"Stuart went a different way to Chambers Creek, going through a gap in between the salt lakes that had been explored by Major Peter Warburton earlier in the year. Herrgott found a group of 12 artesian springs, which Stuart named after him. This name later became the settlement of Herggott Springs. The name was changed again during World War One because of strong anti-German feelings in Australia. The town is now called Marree after the Aboriginal word for possum. These springs were mound springs; over thousands of years the salt in the water had formed small hills, and the water came out of them like water out of a volcano. Some of the mounds were over high. They were valuable because they provided reliable water for people and animals moving north to Chambers Creek."
"After surveying Chambers Creek again, Stuart explored the area to the north west of Chambers Creek. They found more mound springs which Stuart named Elizabeth Springs after one of Chamber's daughters. They continued north west and searched for gold in the Davenport Range. They found more springs which they named the Spring of Hope. They were able to continue and found more springs, which Stuart named Freeling Springs, after Major Freeling, a South Australian politician. By the time they had passed the current site of Oodnadatta, both the men and the horses were suffering from the lack of water and proper food. The horses' shoes had worn out in the rocks around the Davenport Range. On 12 June 1859, Stuart turned around and went back. They rode south back to Port Augusta and then took a boat back to Adelaide."
Third expedition 1859.
"The South Australian government offered a prize of £2,000 to the first person to cross Australia from the south to the north. They hoped this would be a route for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line that would connect Australia to the line that came from Europe. Stuart and Chambers plans for the trip were not accepted by the government. The government sent Alexander Tolmer to lead the trip. His expedition did not make it out of the settled areas. In August 1859, one month after his last trip, Stuart went back to do more surveying for Chambers at Chambers Creek. With William Darton Kekwick and two other men, they took 12 horses and explored the west side of Lake Eyre. Chambers and Stuart believed that the lake might hold water. Instead Stuart found mud after he walked several kilometres into the dry salt lake. He found another artesian mound spring, more than in height, which he named William Springs, after one of Chamber's sons. He then set off for the Spring of Hope. He saw grasslands and eventually made a base at Freeling Springs. He explored much of the surrounding area hoping to find gold. On 6 January 1860, with his food supplies getting low, and two of the men refusing to go any further, Stuart once again returned home."
Fourth expedition September 1860.
"There was a lot of support for an expedition to cross Australia. In Melbourne, the biggest exploring expedition in Australian history, the Victorian Exploring Expedition, was being organized for the crossing. This became known as the Burke and Wills expedition, named after its two leaders, Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills. Stuart knew that he would be able to travel further and faster by only going with a small group. In March 1860, with Kekwick, Benjamin Head and 13 horses, Stuart left Chambers Creek and headed north. They were the first Europeans to enter central Australia. They reached the Finke River, the MacDonnell Ranges, and the strange rock formation Stuart called Chambers Pillar. On 23 April, Stuart worked out that they were at the very centre of Australia. He named a small hill near the spot Mount Sturt, after Charles Sturt. Stuart and Kekwick climbed the hill and raised the British flag. Stuart wrote that the flag would be a sign to the Aborigines ""...that the dawn of liberty, civilization, and Christianity is about to break upon them."" The name was later changed to Central Mount Stuart. From here Stuart tried to go northwest to reach the Victoria River. This took them into the Tanami Desert, but they could not find water and were forced to go back."
"They continued to travel north, beyond the site of the town of Tennant Creek. On 26 June they reached a creek, now called Attack Creek, about north of Adelaide. A large group of Aborigines from a group called the Warramunga, attacked the explorers. The Warrumunga threw boomerangs at the explorers, and then set fire to the grass. Stuart and his men fired their guns at the Warrumunga, but Stuart does not say in his diary if any were killed or injured. The men quickly left the creek and went south."
"Stuart decided they could not get any further north because they were running out of food, water was scarce and the horses were in poor condition. He wrote ""...I think it would be madness and folly to attempt more."" The return journey was very difficult. Stuart could only ride for a few hours a day; on one day he just dug a hole in the sand and curled up in it. Head was so hungry he stole food, which left them with even less. Their clothes were only torn rags and their bodies were covered in bruises caused by scurvy. Stuart wrote in his diary that ""My men have now lost all their former energy...and move about as if they were a hundred years old. It is sad to see them..."" Stuart wrote in his diary that sores on his hands had made them to painful to be used and he could only just sit in the saddle. He gums had become so sore and his teeth so loose that he could only eat flour boiled in water. He wrote on 16 May that ""...I almost wished that death would come and relieve me from my fearful torture..."" The medicines he had with him did not help."
The explorers made their way back to Adelaide as Burke and Wills were starting their journey north from Melbourne. Stuart was treated as a hero when he arrived in Adelaide. In 1859 the Royal Geographical Society in London presented him with gold watch. This was given to the explorer Count Paul Strzelecki to take back to Australia.
"The cost of Stuart's exploring had been paid for by Chambers. Because of this, Stuart would not make his journals and maps available to the public. This led to claims that Stuart had not really travelled that far north and that he was lying about his discoveries. In Victoria it was even said that Stuart had not really gone north, but had been hiding in a cellar in Adelaide."
Fifth expedition 1861.
"The public and the newspapers began to talk about a race across the continent of Australia. Could Stuart, experienced and used to moving quickly, beat the better equipped, but very slow moving Burke and Wills expedition. After their failures with Babbage and Tolmer's expeditions, the South Australian government now believed that Stuart would succeed if he had enough support. They gave £2,500 to set up another expedition and provided ten armed men to protect Stuart from any more attacks by the Aborigines. Chambers agreed to supply more horses and to pay Stuart and Kekwick's wages. In Victoria, a policeman was sent off to tell Burke to get going to the Gulf of Carpentaria as fast as possible, but Burke had already heard about Stuart's planned trip. Burke divided his group in two, and leaving most of his supplies behind at Menindee on the Darling River, he headed north to Cooper Creek."
"On 1 January 1861, Stuart with a group of 12 men and 49 horses set off from Chambers Creek. The hot weather made it hard to find water and many waterholes from his earlier trips were dry. In February Stuart sent back two men with five horses. They reached the northern border of South Australia at about the same time that Burke and Wills reached the Gulf of Carpentaria. He was able to travel 240 km north of Attack Creek, where he found a large waterhole he called Glandfield Lagoon, after the mayor of Adelaide. Chambers later changed the name on Stuart's maps to Newcastle Waters, after the Duke of Newcastle, a British politician. From here Stuart again looked for a way to go north west to the Victoria River, but he was unable to find water. With the food running out, the men becoming sick, and horses in poor condition, Stuart again decided to return to Adelaide. Burke and Wills had not returned to Cooper Creek and were missing."
Stuart was presented with the Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Medal for 1861.
Sixth expedition 1861–62.
"Stuart set out on his third attempt to cross Australia on 25 October 1861. This expedition was called the Great Northern Exploring Expedition. The group was: John McDouall Stuart, William Darton Kekwick, Francis William Thring, William Patrick Auld, Stephen King Jnr., John William Billiatt, James Frew Jnr., Heath Nash, John Woodforde, John McGorrery and Frederick George Waterhouse."
"McGorrey was a blacksmith who would be able to fix the shoes on the group's 78 horses. Waterhouse was a naturalist who would be able to keep a scientific notes of their discoveries. Stuart was injured when a horse stood on his right hand, and remained behind for a month to recover. He learned about the deaths of Burke and Wills at Cooper Creek."
"The group left Chambers Creek on 8 January 1862 moving fast, covering between 30 and 50 kilometres a day. The fast pace meant that in the first three weeks eight horses died and Woodforde left and went back. Stuart left some of the supplies behind and cut the amount each man was allowed to eat. At Mount Hay in central Australia, they were again attacked by Aboriginal warriors, but they were no match for the group's guns and several may have been killed."
"They reached Newcastle Waters in three months, and then took a week to rest. Stuart spent the next five weeks searching for water. He finally found a series of waterholes, creeks and rivers which meant the whole group were able to continue to the north. He gave up trying to reach the Victoria River. When they got to the Roper River, which had been explored by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1845, he knew he could easily go west to the Gulf of Carpentaria, but instead chose to continue north. Auld later said that ""...the mosquitos and flies were terrible. Our hands, feet and necks were blistered with their bites."" They crossed Arnhem Land, and made the way along the edge of what is now Kakadu National Park. He followed the Adelaide River, but when the ground became too soft and muddy, they went further north to the Mary River and eventually reached the sea."
"They arrived at Van Diemen's Gulf on 24 July 1862. On a tall tree branch they raised a Union Jack flag with Stuart's name embroided on it which had been made by Chamber's daughter, Elizabeth. Wood from the tree, which has since been destroyed, is in the collection of the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia's collection. The group then had to travel back to Adelaide. Food was becoming scarce, and the hot weather meant there was little water. Many horses died, and Stuart was again forced to leave behind equipment. Waterhouse had to leave all his carefully collected plants and animals. The men were very hungry and even shot and ate dingos. Stuart was in poor health and became blind. He was unable to speak for several days and the men thought he was going to die. He was unable to ride his horse, and they made a bed with long poles and blankets that could be carried between two horses. Stuart was carried by this method. after crossing the MacDonnell Ranges, they discovered that rain had fallen and there was lots of grass. On reaching the settled areas, Stuart learned that his friend and partner, James Chambers had died. He left Kekwick in charge of the group, and went ahead with Auld. They got on the train at Kapunda and arrived in Adelaide on 17 December 1862."
Stuart and his group were given a special welcome in Adelaide on 16 January 1863. They dressed in their old clothes and rode into the city as heroes. This was also the day that Burke and Wills were buried in Melbourne after the failure of their expedition.
Later life.
"Stuart was in poor health, almost blind, and had a crippled right hand after the sixth trip. With Chambers dead, he no longer had a job. The government tried not to pay him the £2,000 reward, saying that they had paid for the cost of the expedition. After public pressure, they gave in, but invested the money and only gave Stuart a small amount each year. He was drinking a lot of alcohol and none of his friends would give him any help. The government then wanted £500 for the lease of the land they had given him at Chambers Creek. Stuart sold it to James Chambers' brother, John Chambers, for only £200, losing money on the deal."
"He decided to return to Great Britain in April 1864. He lived with his sister Mary in Glasgow, Scotland. The Royal Geographical Society asked the South Australian government for a pension for Stuart, but they said he had been rewarded enough with grants of land. During the debate over the pension it was said that it was not the exploring that had ruined his health, but his drinking habits. He suffered from dementia, and it is possible he also had tuberculosis. He died in London on 5 June 1866 from a stroke and was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery. Only seven people went to the funeral, four relatives, two members of the Royal Geographical Society, and Alexander Hay, a South Australian farmer who was in London at the time. The grave was damaged in World War II, but was repaired in 2011 by the Stuart Society and the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia."
"The Australian Overland Telegraph Line was built along the route taken by Stuart. Using his notes they were easily able to find water supplies and trees to make the poles. The accuracy of his maps made building the line much easier. His journey is remembered in the Stuart Highway, one of Australia's major roads which joins Port Augusta to Darwin. It follows much of the same route discovered by Stuart. In June 1904, a statue of Stuart was put up in Adelaide. The Royal Geographical Society of South Australia has a wooden chair and table made by Stuart in 1854."
"Benjamin Head later said about Stuart ""...that he was a born leader of men: the sharpest little fellow you would find in a year's march."""
Conclusion.
"Stuart and A.C. Gregory were arguably Australia’s greatest inland explorers. The latter was certainly financed and equipped much better than Stuart who had to rely on Chambers and Finke’s support rather than the State Government. It may very well have been possible for Stuart to reach the north coast earlier if he had the Government support that Gregory, Babbage and Tolmer were granted. That said, he didn’t and was totally driven to reach the north coast despite illness and afflictions that arguably he had since arriving in South Australia and were to see him die at such an early age in England in 1866. The key attributes that made Stuart one, if not the best inland explorer, include:"
"With the battle of Lissa, part of Third Italian War of Independence, in 1866 began a period of open hostility against the Dalmatian Italians by the Austrians, who favored the Croatian part because on their side."
"The historian Matteo Bartoli in his book ""The language of the Italian Venezia Giulia and Dalmatia"", wrote that:"
"The most renowned Dalmatian Italian in those years was Antonio Bajamonti, the last Italian mayor of Spalato. He spent his entire life and his own activity for this city, but his economic expenses were never reimbursed by the Austrians despite repeated promises. He was a moderate irredentist who was the propeller of important public works in his city, including the introduction of lighting gas, building the aqueduct and the hospital, creating technical schools, and doing the foundation of the Dalmatian Bank. For his initiative Split was also given a square surrounded by galleries. His most famous work was the construction of the big fountain that was named later after him. Three months later after the second opening of the fountain, Antonio Bajamonti died (the fountain was destroyed in 1947 by Yugoslav authorities who considered it as a symbol of fascism and Italian domination of the city). He created the Società Politica Dalmata in 1886 in order to defend the Italian characteristics of Spalato but died at age 69 in 1891 with debt up to his neck."
"Another famous Dalmatian irredentist was Arturo Colautti. He was a writer and journalist who -from his native Zara- relocated to Spalato in 1876, where he founded the magazine of culture and literature, ""Rivista Dalmatica"". The magazine did not last long, because strongly pro-Italian and related to Antonio Bajamonti. In the same year, he was asked to direct ""L'Avvenire"" and, from 1876 al 1880, he developed it as an irredentist newspaper. Following the publication of an anti-Austrian article on his newspaper, in September 1880, Colautti was attacked by a group of Croatian soldiers who rendered him impaired for a few months. Shortly after, also because of the threat of a lawsuit for crimes against the stringent Austrian press laws and for his support of Italian irredentism, Colautti chose the path of exile and took refuge in the Kingdom of Italy (where he strongly supported the intervention of Italy in World War I)."
"In 1885 a group of young Dalmatian Italians created a sort of secret pact that pledged to fight on a united front against the government of Vienna. They chose to use all legal means available. They were: John Marino Bonda Avoscan (from Ragusa), Stefano Smerchinich (from Curzola) and Ercolano Salvi Pezzoli Leonardo (from Premuda), John Lubin (from Trau), Emanuele Fenzi and Louise Pini (from Sebenico), Christmas Krekich, Luigi and Roberto Ziliotto Ghiglianovich (from Zara), all representatives of the Italian irredentistm with the most sincere patriotism. The same (precisely Ghiglianovich, Krekich, Lubin, Pini, Salvi, Ziliotto, Smerchinich) in 1919, during the crisis in the city of Fiume (Rijeka), wrote the articles ""Application of the Dalmatians"" and ""Cry of Sebenico"" published on 2 October by the national newspaper ""The national responsibility"" (according to one of the few Italian newspapers promoting the union of Dalmatia to Italy)."
"In the late nineteenth century were created in Dalmatia some Italian cultural associations, as the irredentist ""Philological circle"" in Ragusa and the ""National Union Committee,"" the ""Diadora"" and ""Iuventus Iadertina"" in Zara. Also active in these years was the ""National Association"" in Spalato, based on the Bajamonti theater, which was set on fire (officially by unknown people) in 1893. In Spalato, the city of Emperor Diocletian, in the year 1910 there were 1,046 Italians officially counted when in the same year more than 3,000 were enrolled in the cultural and patriotic public association ""Dante Alighieri."" In Zara a group, under the leadership of irredentists Desanti and Boxich (dissatisfied followers of the ""Dalmatian Autonomist Party"" of Luigi Ziliotto), founded the newspaper ""Il Risorgimento"" in 1908, promoting openly the unification to Italy of Dalmatia, but was closed in 1914."
"About 3,500 Italians in Dalmatia during World War I took refuge as exiles in Italy. They were led by Antonio Cippico, Alessandro, and Roberto Dudan Ghiglianovich: more than 250 volunteers enrolled in the Italian army and risked the gallows, as when the Austrians killed Francesco Rismondo (executed in Gorizia in 1915 and active member of the irredentist organization ""Pro Patria"" in Spalato). To Francesco Rismondo the Kingdom of Italy awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor."
"The number of volunteers from the remote ports of Montenegro (as Cattaro, Castelnuovo di Cattaro, and Perasto) appears very high in proportion to the total number of enrolled in the Italian Army. In fact, these volunteers in Spalato, Cattaro, Ragusa, Perasto, Castelnuovo di Cattaro, Trau, and Macarsca (not less than 90 in total, almost half of all volunteers in Dalmatia) fought in Italy despite the ""Treaty of London"", which categorically excluded the possible ""Redemption"" and annexation to Italy of their cities."
"Dalmatia ""Redenta""."
"Dalmatian Italians obtained their ""Redenzione"" (meaning redemption or union to Italy) in the years following the Italian victory in World War I. In the peace treaty, the territory of Zara and some Dalmatian islands (Cherso, Lussino and Lagosta) was united to the Kingdom of Italy. But the full agreements reached in 1915 in the Treaty of London were not respected by the Allies, because of the opposition from US president Woodrow Wilson. This created huge resentment, that was pinpointed in the phrase ""Vittoria mutilata"" (mutilated victory) created by the nationalist D'Annunzio."
"As a direct consequence in 1920 Gabriele D'Annunzio made his famous Occupation of Fiume. The so-called ""Poeta imaginífico"" did a dramatic attack with paramilitaries and a group of ""Legionnaires"" from the Italian city of Monfalcone and occupied the city of Fiume, which the Allied powers had assigned to Italy as the winner of the war. With this gesture D'Annunzio reached the pinnacle of the process of building their own personal and political myth. D'Annunzio personally entered Fiume with a column of Dalmatian Italian volunteers (mostly irredentist)."
"On 12 November 1920 was signed the Treaty of Rapallo: Fiume became a free city (Free State of Fiume), while Zara was given to Italy. But D'Annunzio did not accept the agreement and the Italian Government, on 26 December 1920, evicted from Fiume the Legionaries by force. Fiume and the more northern islands of Dalmatia were incorporated in 1924 to the Kingdom of Italy, thanks to the large contribution of the Italian irredentists in town."
"Even in Trau the irredentists attempted to repeat what D'Annunzio did in Fiume: the local Count Farfogna in September 1919 occupied Trau with some Italian troops, but the Us intervention blocked him. Other problems arose in Spalato in 1920, in the so-called Incidents of Spalato."
"The irredentist aspiration of the Dalmatian Italians was fully met when Yugoslavia in April 1941 was conquered and occupied by Italy and Germany. At the end of that month almost all of the Dalmatian coast, with the major cities of Spalato, Sebenico, and Cattaro was annexed to Italy with the name Governatorate of Dalmatia. The coastal area between Fiume and Segna was not incorporated in the Governorate and went to the fascist Croatia of Ante Pavelić (although it was controlled militarily by the Italian army). Even the area around Ragusa was theoretically Croatian, but the Italians ruled everything in the city, opening even Italian schools."
"The Governorate was divided between the three provinces of Zara, Spalato, and Cattaro. Many families of Dalmatian Italians were forced to move to Italy after World War in these provinces (mainly in order to administer it)."
"Though Italy had initially larger territorial aims that extended from the Velebit mountains to the Albanian Alps, Mussolini decided against annexing further territories due to a number of factors. One was that Dalmatian irredentists like Antonio Tacconi complained that a larger annexation would have included hundreds of thousands of Slavs, who were partially hostile to Italy within the enlarged national borders."
"But this ""Redemption"" (as was called by the Dalmatian Italians) lasted only a few years: with the defeat of Italy in World War II the Italians of Istria and Dalmatia were expelled 'en masse' during the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus (while Zara was fully destroyed by Allies bombings promoted by Tito and later nicknamed the ""Italian Dresden"" by Enzo Bettiza)."
Romans in Sub-Saharan Africa
"Roman expeditions to Lake Chad and western Africa were a group of military and commercial expeditions by the Romans across the Sahara Desert, into the interior of Africa and its coast. They were made by the Roman Empire between the first and the fourth century AD. One of the main reasons of the explorations, according to academics like Jonathan Roth, was to procure gold and spices"
Characteristics.
The Romans organized expeditions to cross the Sahara desert with five different routes:
All these expeditions were supported by legionaries and had mainly a commercial purpose. Only the one done by emperor Nero seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of Ethiopia or Nubia: in 62 AD two legionaries explored the sources of the Nile river.
One of the main reasons for the explorations was to get gold using the camel to transport it.
The explorations near the African western and eastern coasts were supported by Roman ships and deeply related to the naval commerce (mainly toward the Indian Ocean).
History.
"The first Roman expedition was done by Lucius Cornelius Balbus, following Augustus' wish to expand his Empire. In 19 BC he conquered the Garamantes (who lived in the Fezzan of Libya) and sent an expedition under Septimus Flaccus south across the Tibesti mountains, reaching the River Niger."
Gaius Suetonius Paulinus did another expedition to what is now Western Sahara and Mauretania in 41 AD. He reached the northern area of the Senegal river and probably the western Niger river's affluents.
"In the year 41 AD Suetonius Paullinus, afterwards Consul, was the first of the Romans who led an army across the Atlas Mountains. At the end of a ten days' march he reached the summit,—which even in summer was covered with snow,—and from thence, after passing a desert of black sand and burnt rocks, he arrived at a river called Gerj...he then penetrated into the country of the Canarii and Perorsi, the former of whom inhabited a woody region abounding in elephants and serpents, and the latter were Ethiopians, not far distant from the Pharusii and the river Daras (modern river Senegal). From the first century of the common era there is evidence (coins, fibulas) of Roman commerce and contacts in Akjoujt and Tamkartkart near Tichit in actual Mauritania."
"The third was done a few years before by Julius Maternus, a Roman explorer who reached the Lake Chad area and described the abundance of animals like hippopotamus and rhinoceros in that northern Nigerian region. His travel lasted four months."
"In the eastern Sahara was done the Nero expedition to Ethiopia: it was an exploratory expedition promoted by the Roman emperor Nero to discover the sources of the Nile River. Seneca wrote that around 62 AD Nero sent some legionaries to the city of Meroe in Nubia in order to explore all the Nile southward from that capital. Another expedition was recorded by Plinius the Elder in 68 AD. This expedition was the first in history from Europe to the interior of equatorial Africa. It probably lasted several months and bypassed the Sudanese swamps called Sudd during the dry season, possibly reaching the northern portion of present-day Uganda."
"The western coast of Africa was explored by the Romans after the conquest of northern Morocco (then called ""Mauretania Tingitana""): the Roman vassal king Juba II organized a successful trade from the area of Volubilis. Pliny the Elder, a 1st century Roman author and military officer, drawing upon the accounts of Juba II, king of Mauretania, stated that a Roman expedition from Mauritania visited the islands of the archipelago of the Canaries and Madeira around 10 AD and found great ruins but no population, only dogs (from those animals he called the islands, using the latin word ""canarius"" or ""canis"" for dog)."
I know .
"I mean, jeez if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances  whose to say."
Yeah.
"It,"
there would be much more of that
Yeah
no doubt.
Are you involved in the legal system at all?
No.
"But I .  I tend to follow it just to, just to know what's going on."
Okay.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
I've got some friends that are lawyers
so.
"Yeah,"
I do too
so.
One of them just got his law degree.
"But, uh, to tell you the truth, I'm not real familiar with, uh, the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now."
No.
I really haven't studied it in depth.
Yeah.
"I know a little more about civil cases when, than criminal cases. Which is,"
Yeah.
"it's more in how you present it versus, you know, who's right."
I'm sure of it.
"Because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better."
Yep.
"Uh, it's kind of weird."
"I don't know,"
you I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get.
"And, uh, until next time."
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.
"Uh, no"
"I think that maybe the, the automation people that are very discrete. Or not discrete, electronic devices."
"Oh, okay."
Oh.
"So, and, did he, is he the one that got you connected with us?"
Uh-huh.
Okay.
It's a lot of fun.
Yeah.
You want to punch the button and go?
"Sure,"
you ready?
Yip
Okay.
"Well, are you going to buy a car soon?"
"Well, it won't be too much longer because my husband and I are both going to retire."
"And when we retire we're going to buy us, a, you know, a new one and, and get rid of the two that we have right now."
And what are you going to buy?
"I I don't know,"
"we're either going to buy a pick up,"
or we're going to buy a van.
"Or we're going to buy an economy car,"
how do you like that
"Well, have you been listening to Iacocca's arguments that, uh, that Chrysler products are the only ones that, that all have air bags?"
"Uh, yeah."
Does that make a difference to you?
Yeah.
It sure does.
"Uh, they, they don't get repealed as easily as they do."
"Like the guy in California got you know, twice before he went to the gas chamber"
"and then they said okay, no,"
you don't have to go.
And then they took him back.
"I mean, it just seems,  Yeah, it just seemed a little inconsistent."
"Jeez,"
that's a lot of repeals.
"And then you have like two,"
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I don't know.
"I, I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it."
"Uh, I guess,"
"what is it, what's the policy now with treason?"
"Do they, uh, do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence?"
"No,"
"I don't, I don't think, uh, the military doesn't execute anymore"
so.
Yeah.
Or death before the firing squad or whatever.
Yeah.
"So, I think about the only one is, uh, rape,"
"Okay,"
I'm here.
How do you feel about public schools?
"Well, our public schools are, are really poor, I feel."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation"
"but, uh, we're toward the bottom."
Yeah.
you could probably do that.
"Or is it,"
I've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on.
Yeah
"I would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms,"
that's tough.
"Do you not, like, have a half bath."
Not even a half bath.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's rough.
The house that I used to live in had one bath and a half.
And that was even just with two people.
That was a pain.
"The only thing that saves it, with the schedule I work and the schedule my wife works, we're getting ready to go to work at totally different times. So that. It's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning."
That's good.
Really.
That could account for a lot of marital problems I think
You get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom
It doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on
"and,  you're both fighting over the mirror."
No.
That's right.
It does not make for a happy situation.
That's true.
"Well, do you have any children?"
I've got one.
One child.
And they enjoy where they're living?
"We'll,"
he's nine months old.
"Oh, so he doesn't know, right."
"It's almost, you know, identical kind of country."
Uh-huh.
Beautiful.
Been that this year for the trees for the leaves.
Yeah.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
"I was up, I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend,"
so.
Um.
"Little, little oak tree that was dead, and cut it up and split it ."
"Yeah,"
"that's because it, it can't tolerate a freeze this early."
Is that right?
Well.
If it would came later it would be all right?
"Uh, it, there's some trees"
"like the oaks, like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy."
"There's,"
nothing bothers them.
"Their leaves are still green,"
and some of the other oaks. There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves.
"Um, what I notice mostly is the red maples, that the leaves are just dead, the dogwoods still look, still look, you know, they got, uh, bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit,"
but they still look pretty good.
Um.
"It just depends on the, on the, uh, on the tree."
Okay.
"Well, it's not often you get, uh, many women interested in football"
Oh well
Do you follow football very much?
"I'm sorry, what?"
Do you follow football very much?
"now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off,"
"but I get my kids to do that,"
"so,"
Oh
"I, I don't have to do that."
"And, um, and it really,"
and you mix it all up with
"there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up,"
but it's so simple
and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime.
"Oh, yeah."
You serve it cold?
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah,"
that sounds good.
"Yeah,"
"it has to sit in the fridge over night,"
"but, but it's really good."
Um.
And I like that one.
Yeah.
"Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company, and not be scurrying around in the kitchen,"
Yeah.
"so, a lot of times, we'll barbecue"
Exactly.
"like, uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over"
"and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate, and put it on the smoker and cooked it."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, that sounds good."
And it was real good.
You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way
and then people think they're eating steak or something
Yeah.
"yeah,"
seven yards of sand.
"I got to shovel it all, lots of fun."
"Yeah,"
"I have to do that,"
"I want to make some flower beds,"
and I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil.
Uh-huh.
"And I'm going to,"
my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a planter
Sure.
"but I don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something, you know, if I want to grow a tomato or something in there"
Right.
"Well, it seems,"
"I mean, I guess it'd go with my flowers."
"I've seen a lot of people use them, you know, for flower beds,"
"but I don't know what, whether they'd have creosote would do anything,"
"I mean,"
"Yeah,"
"I don't, I don't, I just don't think you,"
I always thought I'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird
Uh-huh.
but I don't think I could really eat the fruit off it without wondering.
And I don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated.
"Well, you can get, um, you can get pressurized lumber,"
"Yeah,"
"but they put, some kind of chemicals in there too."
"Oh, that's right."
"there's even, there's bad chemicals in those too."
Yeah.
"Well, I'm not really worried about it,"
Yeah
"And we ended up with these, these, like things on the cantaloupe vines that, I mean, were looked like round big huge round cucumbers."
"Oh, that's really weird."
"Yeah,"
"I mean, there, these were like some mutant."
I've put my cucumbers down at one end of the garden
and like I'll make an L shape I've put my cantaloupe.
So they've been pretty close together.
Huh.
But I don't think the vines.
"They don't they don't have to be touching or anything,"
"like you say, they cross pollinate just by bees,"
"No,"
"it's just the, like the bees and insects will do it."
"Um,"
Either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something.
Something weird.
Yeah.
"This year, this last season it was too wet up here"
Uh-huh.
"we lost a lot of our root things, our squash and our potatoes,"
and we got half our yield.
"Oh, well."
It was really bad because of the water.
"Yeah,"
"when I,"
"my family used to live in Littleton, Massachusetts,"
"and when we moved in there we had a, a really wet backyard,"
"and, uh, my mom wanted a vegetable garden."
"So we trucked in, uh,"
"I think it was seven, what was it, cubic, seven yards, cubic yards,"
I think that's how they measure dirt
"Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess,"
so
"Um. The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is, doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it"
Yeah.
"the, one country and western song sounds like every other, country and western"
"a lot of them, sound, uh, really similar,"
yeah.
"and so the, the musicians don't get to really get into their music."
They just play a certain number of chords
Yeah.
"the drummer plays a certain beat,"
and you have a country and western song
Um.
"and,"
"Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess."
"They don't really,"
"has kind of the same sound over and over,"
and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are
Um. Right.
"you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too."
Yeah.
"And I can't say that I like a lot of the modern, the very, very modern, uh, rock and roll,"
Yeah.
"but I, I definitely, I really enjoy the fifties, the sixties and a lot, some of the seventies rock and roll"
Yeah
earlier things.
"and, uh, I really enjoy, especially the sixties ..."
Hello?
Hi.
"Hi,"
my name is Leslie.
"Hi,"
"and, uh, of course, the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing, the more you can trust their, their judgment and their insight."
Right.
Right.
Uh-huh.
"But the media insight, as you said,"
I just kind of read and kind of be aware
Yeah.
"and then, uh, I don't like to make a whole lot of, uh, judgment myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that, uh,"
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
That's a real different topic.
"I'm not sure I'm familiar with, with what they mean of invasion of privacy."
I know.
"I guess that, I guess you consider just things that every day that would, you would think of about."
"See, I'm a college student,"
"so I can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know, that I think's like is an invasion of my privacy, stuff like that."
Yeah.
"But I think it'd be, it is kind of a tough topic."
Yeah.
"I think, personally, you know,"
"I'm, I used to be a college student ten years ago"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but uh, now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says, Mrs Miller, have we got a deal for you."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, golly."
"You're like, No, you don't, no."
"It's like, how do you know my name,"
"where did you get my phone number,"
and why do you think it's a deal for me?
Uh-huh.
"but if you look on all interest things, not just credit cards, but on your cars and, you know, any kind of interest that you're paying, from a personal point of view, that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers."
Sure.
"So that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go, you know, tax things that they don't, you know, to a degree, well, like booze, you know,"
"example, they keep raising the taxes on booze,"
"it gets to the point, you know, it makes drunks sober, you know"
They quit buying it.
"Well, what, what about the taxes on cigarettes?"
"Well, tell me about your home."
Okay.
"Uh, right now we're living in,"
"well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys."
"And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it."
Uh-huh.
"So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,"
"but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us."
So it was enough.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half."
"Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom."
Yeah.
"So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house"
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
Huh.
"And, uh, it's about a five year old house now."
It sounds nice.
"It's, uh, pretty nice."
"Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already"
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
"It was a,"
Landmark is the one who built it.
Yeah.
yes.
Oh
And I don't know that's true or not.
"I mean, I just heard it in passing,"
"but so what does that,"
Right.
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
"And how is it really transmitted, et cetera."
Yeah.
"Which is, I think, what they also don't know."
"I mean that's,"
"I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know."
Uh-huh.
"It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway,"
"but, but that isn't how it was in Africa."
No.
"In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that,"
and it's huge over there.
"So I, I, you know,"
"and it's beginning, other countries"
that's what's his point.
"This was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this."
Uh-huh.
"And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?"
Oh.
I mean I don't know.
All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know.
"Uh, or maybe they understand but,"
I think maybe more information should be given out about it.
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, and then the people that have it,"
"it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back."
"I really would like to have something like that,"
"and I'm hoping that by you know,"
"that's like, right now,"
my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now.
"But I keep saying lets put it off, lets put it off, because I'm hoping they'll get so many better features."
"Yeah,"
like what?
"Well, just like that air bag."
I think that thing is fantastic.
"Because I've seen some of the, you know, like the head on collision type things, when they had it and people walk away from it."
Yeah.
"We had one here,"
"I guess it was about three weeks ago,"
"and the people walked away from the, wreck, with no scratches nothing. You know, a few bruises."
That's .
"did you see the, uh,"
"I don't know if it was TWENTY-TWENTY, last Thursday or Friday night on, on seat belts?"
Uh-huh.
Did that scare you a little bit? With the lady being thrown out and run over.
Uh-huh.
You got it.
"I, I, tell you what,"
"I would not, I would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door."
that really
"I, I guess, I,"
"that, that a little more than scared me,"
"that irritated me, uh,"
"that,"
"because it, it, it surely didn't come as a surprise that, that if the door came open the lady would fall out,"
"I mean, and,"
"Well, you know what the average person,"
would you ever have thought of that?
"and they cut each others throats until they're, they reach the point where they're cutting their own throat."
"And, uh, well, of course, that's getting away from taxes isn't it,"
that's government controlled.
"But, uh,"
"Well, I, I think another thing too that, um, I've had a little contacted with, uh,"
"in regard to taxes let's say that, uh, you have something that the I R S disagrees with or, you know, says, hey, we're not going to allow that."
"Well, I think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you, you will not only payback that that you wrote off"
but you will at least double that amount
"and,"
"Oh, by the time you get through with the, uh the penalties."
Yes.
"And that's, to me there's something wrong there, you know."
Yeah.
"I mean, I can see paying the interest and some small penalty"
but they really stick it to you big time.
"Uh, I agree."
"I think the I R S is, uh, just too powerful."
There should be some sort of a control on it.
And they should be a little more humane.
Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
"Uh, the, uh, typical bureaucratic, I guess. That's, that's one of my pet peeves."
"I came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the, the budget."
Uh-huh.
Very simple.
"Give, uh, uh, uh, government employees the average number of, uh, holidays as the, uh, private industry."
Yeah.
"I mean, you think about it now,"
"they, they get about sixteen holidays a year."
That's a lot.
It sure is.
"And I think here at TI we get, what is it nine or ten?"
uh-huh.
"Well, it, it's, it's a really, day care programs are really neat, you know"
"and if the, if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that, that is one of the best things to do,"
but I think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them
Uh-huh ery faint.
Right.
"and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, programs have left off"
Uh-huh.
because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those.
Right
"to, uh, get there and to participate in the activities."
Right.
"Cause I know, there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas."
"Uh, and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work and sports."
Right.
Right.
"But if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly,"
That's true.
You can't play those things.
"Yeah,"
you can't do it.
"But you can sing songs and, uh and tell stories about the old times."
"Well, that's true."
"I guess, you know, you were talking about your,"
"was it your grand mother that was having Alzheimer uh, being able to tell old stories."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way.
And they love to recollect.
"I mean they just, you know,"
and they will just go on and on with these stories
and they have such a memory.
"it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather <laughter>."
"Oh absolutely,"
"yeah,"
just muggy.
"So, yes"
"I think,"
"yeah,"
I think you're right.
Our most pollute substance down here is just water.
"But I I, I, I think, you know, the biggest causes even then a lot of times are, uh, uh, like when I was up in Boston just all the cars. You know, just all over the place."
Yeah
"it,"
"You just got a lot of, you know, a lot of pollution from those"
"and, uh, you know, if you don't have a wind, it sticks around."
"Oh, yeah."
"I, you know, I was in Boston once"
"and I remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour, even with the Tee."
"Uh, just this, it looked like billions of cars massing"
Absolutely.
and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go.
"I mean, yeah, that's what's in, you know, Los Angeles is,"
I think that's biggest problem
"because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city."
Right.
"And there's really, there's nowhere for this to be absorbed, really."
"Uh, tree planting sometimes can handle, you know, stopping some of the air pollution and that and help"
but if you have nowhere to do anything.
"That's, that's very true."
"Uh, you know, of course then when, when you're not recycling, you've got these incendiary plants and stuff, that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere."
"But I, you know, you've got, you've got the industry,"
"you've got that,"
and you got the cars.
Right.
"Do you know, I saw in Tom Thumb yesterday, I saw the return to the, uh, the small Coke bottles."
Yeah.
And I don't know if there's a deposit on those or not.
"I,"
"well that's interesting because,"
"they're back to glass, you're saying?"
"They were glass, they were the glass, uh,"
"well, let's see,"
"they'd be, I don't know, maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce. Sort of a small size, sort of a small size and, and we, anyway we just, we didn't stop and look them, look at them a long time"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"but, and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down, you know, uh sort of, sort of a basket type thing."
Uh-huh.
The carton. The paper carton.
"Right,"
"right,"
"so, I hadn't seen that in a long time."
Yeah.
"Well, I mean the,"
"you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do, we were doing"
"and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons, the wood uh, racks which now, basically, you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold, uh, twenty-four bottles."
"And, and, uh, uh, I'm not really say going back to good old days,"
but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"well,"
"Well, it will be interesting to see how, over the next year, this all works out because, like on the, uh, grass, I'm, I know your husband, uh, doesn't really like the paper sacks."
"No,"
he doesn't like the paper sacks
"and, uh, but he, but, you know, he likes to pick the grass up, too."
"He doesn't, Doesn't,"
"but they are, they'll take any T I non-credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
One of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through G M A C or something.
Uh-huh.
And she's doing it.
"I mean, it's not like, it's like."
Does she have to pay to have it refinanced?
I think they even cover that because they want you as a they want the T I to be part of the credit union.
Uh-huh.
"T I to,"
"See,"
we got ripped off buying our new car.
"We both come out of, uh, drugs and stuff,"
and we became Christians about five years ago.
"Right when he got home from Terrell. Right before he got hired for T I, he had gotten saved and stuff,"
"and so, I mean, when you get come out of drugs and stuff, you have nothing,"
"I mean, you know, you don't have anything."
"You have the clothes on your back,"
"and you might have a car, and that kind of thing."
"And so, when he, when he started working at T I, we, uh, you know, we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas."
"But we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years,"
and we were young
and we'd look about nineteen.
"People still think we're about,"
"they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff, both of us."
"And so, it's just kind of strange, you know,"
"so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs, you know."
Yeah.
"So we went in, and the financed the car for five,"
"I'm not with you so far,"
"Oh, shoot, I'm going to hit myself after I hang up."
I'll remember the name.
"But, uh, anyway, that was a French movie"
Uh-huh.
"it was, um, that was the last one I saw downtown,"
"but I live in D C well, actually Falls Church, Virginia, outside the city"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, so a lot of times they have the, the, the, international films downtown"
"Oh, yeah."
"but, uh, so this, uh, French I guess are into the"
"I guess they would like Jerry Lewis, too."
"They have, they have a"
Yes they like your Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated of sophisticated American everywhere.
Right.
"But they have this one guy who does slapstick comedy,"
"and there's something about it that's so innovative, you know,"
"he'll have trouble picking up his hat, or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind, or something,"
"but there's something about it that just, it isn't just slapstick,"
there's something about the human character in it
"Oh, uh-huh."
"and that's what I find lacking in a lot of, you know, like HOME ALONE."
There was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying
Right.
"and there was a lot of human character there,"
"but when it was, the real slapstick moments, him versus the criminals kind of thing, it just sort of lost the human element and became purely a caricature"
Uh-huh.
Right.
does that make since to you?
"Yeah,"
"uh-huh,"
"Well, I sort of,"
"one of the reasons it's taken so long is I've been working all, you know, sort of half student, half working and source of income and stuff,"
Uh-huh.
so I'm actually managing to do this with zero debt.
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, I couldn't, you couldn't do it otherwise."
"Oh, I mean I know people that graduated, or that I went to high school with that went to civilian colleges"
"and they, they've got twenty, thirty thousand dollar debts,"
"I mean you could have, uh,"
"Yeah,"
"I think if there's any major piece of advice I'd give, is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt."
Yeah.
"It's not,"
"I mean, I remember seeing an article one time about, you know, if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a, a, in an investment fund, they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the job they'd get after college."
Exactly.
"So, it's, it's really kind of crazy."
"It's, it's staggering when you think that, just here in central New York, is, uh,"
"Hamilton College is just a few miles south of, you know, maybe about twenty miles to the south from where I am"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, they're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now."
Really?
A year.
Huh.
"At just a small,"
"I mean they, they, they are it is a select, college."
"Yes,"
"yes,"
I know.
"I was actually, I I was thinking of trying to get a job there"
I heard of it.
"Oh, yeah."
"But, you're talking incredible tuitions now."
"Unfortunately, we are not much into recycling."
Uh-huh.
"We don't, we don't do enough."
I know we don't so
"Uh, although lately I've been, uh,"
a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit
"and it's, it's, it's, uh, interesting to watch some of the things that she does"
"and then she's almost had an impact on me, uh, where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but I can kind of tell it bothers her so, just unconsciously I've, I've stopped buying a lot of, uh, uh, paper plates and paper cups"
and I don't do that anymore.
"I don't know why,"
"I just don't I just, just from socializing with her"
so.
"How do you, how, uh, is recycling done in your community?"
"Is,"
"It really, it, there's not a whole lot,"
there really isn't.
"Uh, I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio, each, each house has,"
"they're, they're given three baskets"
Uh-huh.
and they put them out on a certain day of the week
Right.
"and each, uh, home does participate"
"but we really don't have anything, uh, close in this area that, that do anything."
"And, and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it. Which really doesn't make sense."
Oh.
Right.
"Over here, they, uh, have several private companies that you can take, uh, recycled, materials to."
"But, uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they have, uh, the first Saturday of every month, they have certain places that you can drop them off."
That's what I do.
"Uh, and I, I recycle aluminum, glass, uh, newspapers."
"Yeah,"
that's good.
"I, I'm amazed, at, at that's a lot of them even graduated."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know."
"Well, I, I had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school. Not realizing that the reputation for M I T is because of the, of the doctorate research, and the professors who go there,"
Right.
Right.
and you're not going to see the professors
Nope.
"you know, you're going to see some T A, you know."
"Uh, so they they, they want, you know, they want the best"
"and they don't think, they think what the best is, is, reputation for, for research"
Yeah.
"and that's a one standard,"
"but it's not relevant, to what they need."
No.
"It's interesting that you mention,"
"and I didn't think about that before when you were talking,"
"but the service academies have all, all the faculty, uh, for the most part is, is military with a few exchange, professors from other, schools."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But, uh, having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there, uh, is investing in the Air Force,"
"and it,"
Right.
"or the, the military itself, it's the future officer corps"
"and so, I hear horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors,"
they could never get extra help.
Uh-huh.
For me any time I needed extra help any time of the day I had all my instructors home phone numbers
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I'm the, I'm the same way because otherwise, uh,"
"oh, I'm, I generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal, uh, Neal's a person who says, I like to pick it up"
"but I don't believe in throwing it into the, uh, the landfill,"
"so I have my compost pile,"
"but most of us don't have the, uh, sufficient, lot size to, uh, to do that."
"Right,"
right.
"Uh, so I'm glad the city's willing to take that on."
That's nice.
"I guess they dump it the same place,"
I wonder where they dump that.
"Well, there's someplace, you know,"
"if it's,"
"because really, when I look at what my grass does in, in actually about twenty-four hours, uh, knowing what the farmers do in rural areas, they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally, uh, composts or stores"
"and, uh, so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it"
"and it will naturally decompose uh,"
so you just have to kind of keep in separated
"and then, uh, who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into,"
but it's certainly usable material.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"well they must, they must keep it separate if they have this date in."
Uh-huh.
"They have this day now, that it's, you know, separate from the other trash pick up."
Right
"But, I, the thing I don't understand about that is, like when,"
"it's one thing to send grass there,"
"but I've trimmed trees and other things which, uh, end up being something that, clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly,"
No.
"Okay, well, um,"
What kind of music do you like?
"even the movies that want to show violence as real, they don't really show you what happens with that real violence"
Uh-huh.
and I'm not really sure how I feel about that.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, on the one hand I'd like it to be a warning,"
"on the other hand I wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee, now we want to see the aftermath all the time either."
"You're right,"
"uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
it's true.
But
"yeah,"
"TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was sort of the same way,"

Uh-huh.
"and then they don't, and they, but they could make them better, you know"

"they could try to make,"
"I mean, as far as I was concerned, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES could have been a classic of world theater"
Really.

"it was, it was innovative, uh, a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways,"
"and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable, because the, the story was stupid, and, and then things like that,"
"and they built up,"

= = = Perry (car) = = =
"The Perry was a British car made by the Perry Motor Company based in Tyseley, Birmingham who made cars between 1913 and 1916."
"The company can trace its roots back to 1824 with James and Stephen Perry making pens in a workshop in London, later moving to Birmingham and building bicycles. By the late 1890s they were having financial problems and were bought by James William Bayliss, part owner of the Bayliss-Thomas car making company."
"Their first car, a three-wheeler, was made in 1899 followed by a forecar in 1903. Cecil Bayliss, the son of the new owner, built a cyclecar in 1911 with 800 cc engine, and this was developed into the first Perry car to reach production."
"The Perry cyclecar was described as 'just placed on the market' when exhibited at the November 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show at Olympia. It was described as 'an exact replica of a full-sized model, but is of exceptionally light weight - less than 7cwt'."
"The engine for the car was built in-house and was a twin-cylinder vertical water cooled unit, with 72mm bore and 108mm stroke, unusual in that both pistons rose and fell at the same time. Drive was to the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox with reverse and worm-driven axle and spur differential. The rear springing was unusual in that the long semi-elliptic leaf springs were supplemented by coil springs. It was fitted with Sankey detachable wheels and Dunlop tyres."
"The basic body was an open two-seater, but a long-wheelbase version allowing a dickey seat was also available."
About 800 were made.
A full-sized car was introduced in 1914 with four-cylinder 1795 cc engine. The larger car allowed four seat bodies to be offered as well as two seaters and these were mainly made by Mulliners of Birmingham.
"About 300 were made before World War I curtailed car-building activities. A very few were made in 1919 when the design, jigs, patterns and tools were sold to Bean Cars for £15,000, who reintroduced it as the Bean 11.9."
= = = Worst Week = = =
"Worst Week is an American sitcom television series which originally aired on CBS from September 22, 2008 to June 6, 2009. The series was based on the British sitcom ""The Worst Week of My Life"". The show was adapted for American audiences by Fox under the title ""Worst Week of My Life"", but a series failed to materialize after the pilot was filmed."
"The series aired on CBS Mondays at 9:30pm ET/PT, following ""Two and a Half Men"". The premiere attracted 11 million viewers but lost a third of its lead-in audience. Ratings dropped to a low of 8.4 million viewers with the sixth episode, then began to climb steadily. They reached a high of 12.12 million viewers with the eleventh episode but declined afterwards. The season finale titled ""The Epidural"" aired on February 16, 2009."
"On May 20, 2009, CBS announced its new season schedule and canceled ""Worst Week"". A previously unaired episode entitled ""The Party"" aired on June 6, 2009. ""Worst Week"" is set in Manassas, Virginia."
"Verne Gay of ""Newsday"" graded it A and said it ""may be the best new comedy on network TV this season."""
"Less enthusiastic was Tim Goodman of the ""San Francisco Chronicle"", who said, ""Though there are plenty of hard-earned (some might say forced) laughs here and Bornheimer is a real find, you can't help but wonder how they'll keep up the pace. After all, the British series ran for only two seasons and had a mere seven episodes each season...So how is CBS going to stretch this into 22 episodes without stretching it too thin?...In many ways, ""Worst Week"" seems incapable of being made into an American version (there were previous attempts that failed), because not only does the title not make sense, but not having a payoff for all the freaky, not-so-karmic woes Sam endures will be frustrating to the viewing audience . . . [It] is a series that may end up being on a short leash."""
"Linda Stasi of the ""New York Post"" called it ""one of the worst new shows of the week"" and added, ""Only a man (or a couple of them) could get paid big bucks in Hollywood to come up with such a lame-o rip-off and perpetuate the fantasy that gorgeous women can't help but to love out-of-shape guys who do everything wrong."""

"Irregular Records is a British independent record label specialising in folk music, which was established in 1985 by the singer Robb Johnson. In addition to Johnson's own recordings the label has also issued albums by artists such as Barb Jungr, Des de Moor, Maggie Holland and Russell Churney."
In the label's history there have been over a hundred releases to date.
"Mitsubishi MCA stands for Mitsubishi Clean Air, a moniker used in Japan to identify vehicles built with emission control technology. The term was first introduced in Japan, with later introductions internationally. The technology first appeared in January 1973 on the Mitsubishi 4G32A gasoline-powered inline four cylinder engine installed in all Mitsubishi vehicles using the 4G32 engine, and the Saturn-6 6G34 six-cylinder gasoline-powered engine installed in the Mitsubishi Debonair. The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968."
"Emission reducing technology began with the installation of a positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve (MCA-I), followed by the addition of a thermo reactor air pump and catalytic converter in addition to an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve (MCA-II) and a solenoid controlled automatic choke installed on the carburetor."
"The MCA-Jet system has a small third valve separate from the intake and exhaust valves. Separate passages in the intake manifold feed each MCA-Jet valve. Since these passages are smaller than the main intake manifold passages, the air/fuel mixture must move faster. When the faster moving air/fuel mixture from the MCA-Jet valve hits the slower moving air/fuel mixture from the intake valve, a strong air swirling effect occurs that promotes more complete combustion. With MCA-Jet it was found that stable combustion could be obtained even with large amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), NOx could be reduced, and combustion improved. Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small pre-combustion chamber near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to carbon build-up, causing the MCA-Jet valve(s) to stick open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980s."

= = = Vicia villosa = = =
"Vicia villosa, known as the hairy vetch, fodder vetch or winter vetch, is a plant native to some of Europe and western Asia. It is a legume, grown as a forage crop, fodder crop, cover crop, and green manure. Although non-native, it occurs in all US states and is considered invasive by some states, such as Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington state — as well as in Japan and some parts of Europe where it is not native. It is also found in most Canadian provinces."
"Hairy vetch is very similar to tufted vetch (""Vicia cracca""), the most noticeable difference being that tufted vetch has a smooth stem."
Several subspecies are recognized:
"The species ""Vicia hirsuta"" is also called hairy vetch."
"Hairy vetch is widely used by organic growers in the United States as a winter cover crop and in no-till farming, as it is both winter hardy and can fix as much as 200 lb/acre of atmospheric nitrogen. Disadvantages of hairy vetch in production agriculture are related to the crop having a portion of hard seed and its tendency to shatter seed early in the season, leading to it remaining in the field as a weed later in the season. This can be a particular problem in wheat production."
"Organic gardeners often plant hairy vetch (a nitrogen-fixing legume) as a companion plant to tomatoes, as an alternative to rotating crops in small growing areas. When it is time to plant tomatoes in the spring, the hairy vetch is cut to the ground and the tomato seedlings are planted in holes dug through the matted residue and stubble. The vetch vegetation provides both nitrogen and an instant mulch that preserves moisture and keeps weeds from sprouting."
"It is regulated in the state of Florida. Some sources consider it generally invasive in areas with suitable climate for it to out-compete native species, in a manner similar to how cow vetch, ""Vicia cracca"", is regarded. With both vetches, their agricultural usefulness is typically given precedence over concerns regarding potential ecological degradation. Despite being native to part of Europe it is considered an alien or invasive species in some European countries, such as Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Spain."

"Born to a Jewish family in the Pittsburgh suburb of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, Rupe grew up in the nearby suburb of McKeesport. As a boy, he listened to music sung at a local black Baptist church. He attended college at Virginia Tech, Miami University, and UCLA. During World War II, he worked for a shipbuilding company in Los Angeles. Along the way, he changed his surname from Goldberg to Rupe, which was an ancestral name."
"In Hungarian mythology, Csaba, the mythical son of Attila the Hun and ancestor of the Hungarians, is supposed to ride down the Milky Way when the Székelys (ethnic Hungarians living in Transylvania) are threatened. Thus the Milky Way is called ""The Road of the Warriors"" (lit. ""Road of Armies"") . The stars are sparks from their horseshoes."
"To the Māori the Milky Way is the waka (canoe) of Tama-rereti. The front and back of the canoe are Orion and Scorpius, while the Southern Cross and the Pointers are the anchor and rope. According to legend, when Tama-rereti took his canoe out onto a lake, he found himself far from home as night was falling. There were no stars at this time and in the darkness the Taniwha would attack and eat people. So Tama-rereti sailed his canoe along the river that emptied into the heavens (to cause rain) and scattered shiny pebbles from the lakeshore into the sky. The sky god, Ranginui, was pleased by this action and placed the canoe into the sky as well as a reminder of how the stars were made."
"The Kaurna Aboriginal people of the Adelaide Plains in South Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river in the sky world. They called it Wodliparri (wodli = hut, house, parri = river) and believe that positioned along the river are a number of dwellings. In addition, the dark patches mark the dwelling place of a dangerous creature known as a ""yura""; the Kaurna call these patches Yurakauwe, which literally means ""monster water""."
Aboriginal groups from the Cape York region of Queensland see the band of light as termites that had been blown into the sky by the ancestral hero Burbuk Boon.
"Further south, the band of stars that comprise the Milky Way are seen as thousands of flying foxes carrying away a dancer known as Purupriggie."
The Aranda who come from central Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river or creek in the sky world. This stellar river separates the two great camps of the Aranda and Luritja People. The stars to the east of this river represent the camps of the Aranda and the stars to the west represent Luritja encampments and some stars closer to the band represent a mixture of both.
"In the Kimberley area, Aborigines called the Milky Way ""Iowara"" and see in it the presence of a giant emu elongated."
= = = Dynkin system = = =
"A Dynkin system, named after Eugene Dynkin, is a collection of subsets of another universal set formula_1 satisfying a set of axioms weaker than those of σ-algebra. Dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as λ-systems (Dynkin himself used this term) or d-system. These set families have applications in measure theory and probability."
"A major application of λ-systems is the π-λ theorem, see below."
"Let Ω be a nonempty set, and let formula_2 be a collection of subsets of Ω (i.e., formula_2 is a subset of the power set of Ω). Then formula_2 is a Dynkin system if"
"Equivalently, formula_2 is a Dynkin system if"
The second definition is generally preferred as it usually is easier to check.
"An important fact is that a Dynkin system which is also a π-system (i.e., closed under finite intersections) is a σ-algebra. This can be verified by noting that conditions 2 and 3 together with closure under finite intersections imply closure under countable unions."
"Given any collection formula_16 of subsets of formula_1, there exists a unique Dynkin system denoted formula_18 which is minimal with respect to containing formula_19. That is, if formula_20 is any Dynkin system containing formula_19, then formula_22. formula_18 is called the Dynkin system generated by formula_16. Note formula_25. For another example, let formula_26 and formula_27; then formula_28."
"If formula_29 is a π-system and formula_2 is a Dynkin system with formula_31, then formula_32. In other words, the σ-algebra generated by formula_29 is contained in formula_2."
One application of Dynkin's π-λ theorem is the uniqueness of a measure that evaluates the length of an interval (known as the Lebesgue measure):
"Let (Ω, ""B"", ""λ"") be the unit interval [0,1] with the Lebesgue measure on Borel sets. Let μ be another measure on Ω satisfying μ[(""a"",""b"")] = ""b"" − ""a"", and let ""D"" be the family of sets ""S"" such that μ[S] = λ[S]. Let ""I"" = { (""a"",""b""),[""a"",""b""),(""a"",""b""],[""a"",""b""] : 0 < ""a"" ≤ ""b"" < 1 }, and observe that ""I"" is closed under finite intersections, that ""I"" ⊂ ""D"", and that ""B"" is the σ-algebra generated by ""I"". It may be shown that ""D"" satisfies the above conditions for a Dynkin-system. From Dynkin's π-λ Theorem it follows that ""D"" in fact includes all of ""B"", which is equivalent to showing that the Lebesgue measure is unique on ""B""."

"In the core of the larger spiral structure of NGC 1300, the nucleus shows a ""grand-design"" spiral structure that is about 3,300 light-years long. Only galaxies with large-scale bars appear to have these grand-design inner disks — a spiral within a spiral. Models suggest that the gas in a bar can be funneled inwards, and then spiral into the center through the grand-design disk, where it can potentially fuel a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). NGC 1300 is not known to have an active nucleus, indicating that its central black hole is not accreting matter. The SMBH has a mass of ."
= = = Anita C. Hill = = =
Anita Carol Hill (born 1951) is a LGBT American minister in the Lutheran Church. She is one of the first ordained lesbian women in the church and became a pastor before the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) changed its policy on LGBT ministers.
"Hill was born in 1951 and was raised in the Roman Catholic faith in Shreveport, Louisiana. As a young adult, she lived in Crystal Springs, Mississippi, and became involved in the United Methodist Church. Hill attended Mississippi State University where she earned a bachelor's degree in science. Hill went on to gain a master's degree in religious studies and a master of divinity degree from United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and studied at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota."
"In the 1980s, Hill started out as a lay minister in the Saint Paul-Reformation Lutheran Church. By the 1990s, her congregation wanted her to be ordained despite rules against lesbian pastors in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) at the time. The church's head pastor, Paul Tidemann, created the goal for his church that it would have a non-celibate, openly gay minister by 1993. Hill was an open lesbian in a committed relationship. She was ordained on April 28, 2001, within the Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries but was later censured for her ordainment as an LGBT person. On September 18, 2010, she was formally inducted into the ELCA Clergy Roster. She left working at the church in 2012 and went on to fight a state constitutional amendment in her state which banned gay marriage."
In 2012 Hill joined ReconcilingWorks as regional director for the St. Paul area and later became its deputy director.

"After a karting career, he raced in Formula BMW and Formula Three, where he finished 12th in 2000."
"In 2001 he moved up to the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters. In 2000 his best result was a fourth place on the Nürburgring where he also took the fastest of the race. He took his first pole position in Hockenheim 2002 but he retired from the race. In 2004 he took his first podium in Estoril. During 2004 he also finished second in Zandvoort, Oschersleben and Hockenheim on his way to finish fifth in the championship. Tomczyk took his first win in Catalunya 2006 where he also took pole. In 2007 he took two wins to finish third that season."
"Eleven years after his DTM debut, he won the championship in 2011, driving for Team Phoenix, after nine races with three wins and a third-place finish in Valencia. In 2012, Tomczyk was signed as a BMW Team RBM driver, moving to Team RMG in 2013."

"On July 25 to 29, 1913 a survey began by a man named David Townsend from Calgary, Alberta plotting out the new community. Residents of the community decided that the name of their community should be named after ""Crichton"" a Scottish poet and scholar, James Crichton born in Perthshire in 1560."
"During its day as an incorporated settlement, Crichton had three grain elevators all have been torn down, a school that has been moved to a nearby bible camp, a café and pool hall, a garage that still stand on main street, boarding house, a blacksmith shop, lumberyard, post office, livery barn, water tower torn down in the 1960s, and a large warehouse attached to the general store. There was even a golf course and tennis courts built for the community, as well as a baseball diamond near the school site. Today Crichton has one resident, and a few scattered buildings sitting abandoned."
= = = Ziamet = = =
"Ziamet was a form of land tenure in Ottoman Empire, consisting in grant of lands or revenues by the Ottoman Sultan to an individual in compensation for his services, especially military services. The ziamet system was introduced by Osman I who granted land tenure to his troops. Later this system was expanded by Murad I for his Sipahi."
"The Saljuq state, prior to the rise of the Ottoman State in the 14th century, utilized ziamets in an effort to implement provincial governors, who were also made subordinate chiefs in the military regime. In this pre-Ottoman period, timars were used with other tactics, such as building caravansaries, in an effort to sedentarize nomadic groups. The Ottoman state later took on this ""timar system"" after conquering Anatolia, and it represented just one of several institutions apparent in the Ottoman Empire derived from the Saljuq state."
"The Ottoman Empire came into disarray due to problems asserting ""central government control"" during the 16th and 17th centuries. They needed a way to reassert their military might. Ziamets of Ottoman cavalry were enlarged and turned over to a smaller number of owners, with a longer tenure. Thus, authority in provincial areas turned to police authority as local administrations dissolved, and ziamets were converted into tax-farms or iqta. This conversion of ziamets into tax-farms proved to be the first step to growing provincial control in the Ottoman Empire, as economic decline in the empire gave these stronger provincial governors the chance to assert power.[3]"
"The ziamet-holder acted as an agent of the central Ottoman government in supervising the possession, transfer, and rental of lands within his territory and collecting tax revenue, in return for military service. A timar was not necessarily made up of contiguous property, but could consist of property scattered among different villages."
A timar-holder is a zaim.

"It shares the same vertex arrangement with the icosidodecahedron, its convex hull. Unlike the great icosahedron and great dodecahedron, the great icosidodecahedron is not a stellation of the icosidodecahedron, but a faceting of it instead."
"It also shares its edge arrangement with the great icosihemidodecahedron (having the triangular faces in common), and with the great dodecahemidodecahedron (having the pentagrammic faces in common)."
This polyhedron can be considered a rectified great icosahedron:
"The truncated ""great stellated dodecahedron"" is a degenerate polyhedron, with 20 triangular faces from the truncated vertices, and 12 (hidden) pentagonal faces as truncations of the original pentagram faces, the latter forming a great dodecahedron inscribed within and sharing the edges of the icosahedron."
"The dual of the great icosidodecahedron is the great rhombic triacontahedron; it is nonconvex, isohedral and isotoxal. It has 30 intersecting rhombic faces. It can also be called the great stellated triacontahedron."

"Rolling Thunder was a racing wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, NJ. Rolling Thunder was the park's first wooden coaster, and debuted in 1979 during the park's fifth anniversary season. It closed in 2013."
"Rolling Thunder opened in 1979. To mark the 100th anniversary of roller coasters in the USA, Rolling Thunder's Coaster 2 side was renamed ""Rednuht Gnillor,"" the backwards spelling of ""Rolling Thunder,"" in 1984. The trains were turned around so riders would view the ride while riding backwards. During this season, Rednuht Gnillor's warning signs were placed in the back of the station and on the back of the lift hill so riders could see them."
Rolling Thunder was standing but not operating in September and October 2005 and through most of the Spring of 2006 due to the construction of the Plaza del Carnival section and El Toro.
"Rolling Thunder closed on September 8, 2013, to make room for . Soon after Rolling Thunder closed, it was demolished, except for one part of the track which is still standing."
"The line for the ride began at an adjoining entrance and had separate queues for each track. The queue to the right of the entrance lead to the Coaster 1 track and Coaster 2 was reached by the queue on the left. Guests who were not tall enough for coasters with 54-inch (137 cm) minimum height would ride Rolling Thunder, which had a 44-inch (112 cm) height requirement."
"Unlike most racing coasters, Rolling Thunder's tracks were not always next to each other, they separated at several points in the ride. After the first drop, the left track traveled over a big hill, followed by a small hill, whereas the second track reversed that. On the turnaround at the back, the left track traveled up and made a level turn, while the right track traveled up and dropped while turning. The hills on the return segment were also staggered. The trains were not always raced."
"The structure and track was mostly built from 850,000 feet (259,080 m) of Douglas Fir. In the past, the Douglas Fir had been treated with pesticides which were not considered environmentally friendly and the track and supports were slowly being replaced with southern yellow pine."
"The track was made by bolting seven layers of wood. In most places on the ride, there were two layers of southern yellow pine, which sat atop five layers of Douglas-Fir. Older sections of track still had seven layers of Douglas-Fir (mostly on the lift) and there were refurbished sections of track with seven layers of southern pine. A strip of steel was bolted onto the top layer of wood track and three-inch-wide pieces of steel were bolted onto the sides."
"Set in 18th-century South Africa, the film dramatizes the true story of Claas Blank (Rouxnet Brown) and Rijkhaart Jacobsz (Neil Sandilands)."
"Herder Claas Blank was serving 10 years for ""insulting a Dutch citizen"" and Rijkhaart, was a Dutch sailor convicted of committing ""unnatural acts"" with another man. The two men initially hostile form a secret relationship, using trips to a private water-tank to bond. The two prisoners on Robben Island who were later executed for sodomy in 1735 by drowning, after jealousy of other inmates caused problems. Their relationship also had a racial component, as Jacobsz was a white Dutchman, while Blank was a black Khoi. The film also stars Shaun Smyth as Virgil Niven, a Scottish botanist who befriends Blank for his knowledge of South African flora, including the Protea but may in fact have his own sexual interest in Blank."

= = = Soybean oil = = =
"Soybean oil is a vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of the soybean (""Glycine max""). It is one of the most widely consumed cooking oils. As a drying oil, processed soybean oil is also used as a base for printing inks (soy ink) and oil paints."
Chinese records dating prior to 2000 B.C. mention use of cultivated soybeans to produce edible soy oil. Ancient Chinese literature reveals that soybeans were extensively cultivated and highly valued as a use for the soybean oil production process before written records were kept.
"To produce soybean oil, the soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture content, heated to between 60 and 88 °C (140–190 °F), rolled into flakes, and solvent-extracted with hexanes. The oil is then refined, blended for different applications, and sometimes hydrogenated. Soybean oils, both liquid and partially hydrogenated are sold as ""vegetable oil,"" or are ingredients in a wide variety of processed foods. Most of the remaining residue (soybean meal) is used as animal feed."
"In the 2002–2003 growing season, 30.6 million tons (MT) of soybean oil were produced worldwide, constituting about half of worldwide edible vegetable oil production, and thirty percent of all fats and oils produced, including animal fats and oils derived from tropical plants."
"In 2018-2019, world production was at 57.4 MT with the leading producers including China (16.6 MT), US (10.9 MT), Argentina (8.4 MT), Brazil (8.2 MT), and EU (3.2 MT)."
"Per 100 g, soybean oil has 16 g of saturated fat, 23 g of monounsaturated fat, and 58 g of polyunsaturated fat. The major unsaturated fatty acids in soybean oil triglycerides are the polyunsaturates alpha-linolenic acid (C-18:3), 7-10%, and linoleic acid (C-18:2), 51%; and the monounsaturate oleic acid (C-18:1), 23%. It also contains the saturated fatty acids stearic acid (C-18:0), 4%, and palmitic acid (C-16:0), 10%."
"The high-proportion of oxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acid is undesirable for some uses, such as cooking oils. Three companies, Monsanto Company, DuPont/Bunge, and Asoyia in 2004 introduced low linolenic Roundup Ready soybeans. Hydrogenation may be used to reduce the unsaturation in linolenic acid. The resulting oil is called hydrogenated soybean oil. If the hydrogenation is only partially complete, the oil may contain small amounts of trans fat."
Soybean oil is mostly used for frying and baking. It is also used as a condiment for salads.
"Soybean oil is one of many drying oils, which means that it will slowly harden (due to free-radical based polymerization) upon exposure to air, forming a flexible, transparent, and waterproof solid. Because of this property, it is used in some printing ink and oil paint formulations. However, other oils (such as linseed oil) may be superior for some drying oil applications."

"The Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q) was established in the 1850s to rival the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (C&GU). The new railroad was constructed due to growing concern that the cities of Batavia and Aurora would have an economic downfall since the C&GU bypassed both settlements. The railroad station in Batavia was the first constructed by the CB&Q, and as such, the company took extra care to make it stand out architecturally."
"The wood structure stands two stories tall with red, vertical panels. Originally , a four-room extension was added to the ground floor in 1868. The main structure has a gable roof with Gothic brackets while the extension has a flat roof. The station was later abandoned by the CB&Q, who preferred to maintain only a direct route through Aurora. The station was moved to its current location in 1973 in an effort to preserve it. Renovations were made to restore the building to its 1919 appearance (which was likely very similar to the original). The building was placed on a new cinder block foundation. The new lot also had a basement for a furnace to keep the building open during the winter. The Fox River now lies to the building's east.

"The London Underground mosquito is a form of mosquito in the genus ""Culex"". It is found in the London Underground railway system as its name suggests, but has a worldwide distribution and long predates the existence of the London Underground. It was first described as a distinct species from Egyptian specimens by the biologist Peter Forsskål (1732–1763). He named this mosquito ""Culex molestus"" due to its voracious biting, but later biologists renamed it ""Culex pipiens"" f. ""molestus"" because there were no morphological differences between it and ""Culex pipiens"". Notably, this mosquito assaulted Londoners sleeping in the Underground during the Blitz, although similar populations were long known."
"A study from 2004 analyzing DNA microsatellites suggested that ""Culex molestus"" is likely a distinct species from ""Culex pipiens"". However, a more recent paper from 2012 argues that it is more accurately 'a physiological and ecological variant of ""Cx. pipiens"" ' and should not be considered a distinct species."
"This mosquito, although first discovered in Egypt in the late 18th century, has been found in underground systems around the world. Some authors suggested that it adapted to human-made underground systems since the last century from local above-ground ""Culex pipiens"", but the more recent evidence suggests it is a southern mosquito variety related to ""C. pipiens"" that has adapted to the warm underground spaces of northern cities."
"Behavioral evidence for this mosquito being a different species from ""C. pipiens"" comes from research by Kate Byrne and Richard Nichols. The species have very different behaviours, are extremely difficult to mate, and with different allele frequencies consistent with genetic drift during a founder event. More specifically, this mosquito, ""C. molestus"", breeds all-year round, is cold intolerant, and bites rats, mice, and humans, in contrast to the above-ground species, which is cold tolerant, hibernates in the winter, and is considered to mostly feed on bird hosts. When the two varieties were crossbred, the eggs were infertile, suggesting reproductive isolation."

"The ileocecal valve (ileal papilla, ileocaecal valve, Tulp's valve, Tulpius valve, Bauhin's valve, ileocecal eminence, valve of Varolius or colic valve) is a sphincter muscle valve that separates the small intestine and the large intestine. Its critical function is to limit the reflux of colonic contents into the ileum. Approximately two liters of fluid enters the colon daily through the ileocecal valve."
The ileocecal valve is distinctive because it is the only site in the gastrointestinal tract that is used for vitamin B12 and bile acid absorption.
"The histology of the ileocecal valve shows an abrupt change from a villous mucosa pattern of the ileum to a more colonic mucosa. A thickening of the muscularis mucosa, which is the smooth muscle tissue found beneath the mucosal layer of the digestive tract. A thickening of the muscularis externa is also noted."
There is also a variable amount of lymphatic tissue found at the valve.
The ileocecal valve has a papillose structure.
"During colonoscopy, the ileocecal valve is used, along with the appendiceal orifice, in the identification of the cecum. This is important as it indicates that a complete colonoscopy has been performed. The ileocecal valve is typically located on the last fold before entry into the cecum, and can be located from the direction of curvature of the appendiceal orifice, in what is known as the bow and arrow sign."
"Intubation of the ileocecal valve is typically performed in colonoscopy to evaluate the distal, or lowest part of the ileum. Small bowel endoscopy can also be performed by double-balloon enteroscopy through intubation of the ileocecal valve."
"Tumors of the ileocecal valve are rare, but have been reported in the literature."
"It was described by the Dutch physician Nicolaes Tulp (1593–1674), and thus it is sometimes known as Tulp's valve."
"The valve was also described in 1588 by Gaspard Bauhin—hence the name Bauhin's Valve or Valve of Bauhin—in the preface of his first writing, ""De corporis humani partibus externis tractatus, hactenus non editus."""
= = = Dino Alfieri = = =
Edoardo Alfieri (first name usually shortened to Dino; 8 December 1886 – 12 December 1966) was an Italian fascist politician and diplomat.
"Alfieri was born in Bologna. In 1911 he finished law studies and soon after joined the nationalist group formed by Enrico Corradini. A volunteer in World War I, he was critical of the merger between Corradini's group and Benito Mussolini's Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF). Nonetheless, he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies on the PNF list in 1924."
"Under Mussolini's government, Alfieri was assigned several tasks: between 1929 and 1934, he was co-director of the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution, deputy secretary of the ""Corporazioni"", and deputy secretary for Press and Propaganda from 1935, assuming the duties of Minister Galeazzo Ciano during the latter's mission in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. When Ciano moved on to become Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dino Alfieri found himself appointed Minister of People's Culture in 1937, and declared himself to the Antisemitical racial segregation laws passed in 1938."
"He was Italy's envoy to the Holy See starting 7 November 1939, and five months later to Nazi Germany (where he often met Adolf Hitler). While there, he was constantly helping out Italian workers and consulate staff. As the war progressed and Italy needed help, he attempted to solicit material aid from Germany but despite assurances little came of it. When the war began to deteriorate for the Axis, he wrote communiques and expressed verbally to Mussolini that the Germans simply saw Italy as a buffer state from the encroaching allies and urged the Duce to seek peace with the allies while simultaneously assuring the Germans that Italy was not betraying them. He was urgently called to Rome in 1943 by members of the Grand Council in order to participate in a meeting. It is unclear as to whether he truly realized what was being proposed at the meeting. A member of the Grand Council of Fascism, he supposedly supported Dino Grandi's coup d'état in July 1943, that led to the fall from power of the Italian Fascist government after 21 years and the arrest of Mussolini. When the Wehrmacht occupied Italy (see Operation Achse), Alfieri fled to Switzerland to save his life."
"In January 1944, he was sentenced to death ""in absentia"" by a kangaroo court during the Verona trial. The Swiss government did not give him political asylum, but tolerated his attendance in Switzerland."
"On 12 November 1946, an Italian court stated his innocence; on 6 February 1947, an inquiry of the Italian Foreign Ministry ended. Then, he was officially pensioned off."
"There is no official Triple Crown for these Melbourne races, but racing fans consider these three Group 1 races to be the major interconnected component of the spring carnival package, while also acknowledging that only a superhorse could win them all in the same season to complete a . Only one horse has ever managed this feat, the great New Zealand galloper Rising Fast, in 1954. More recently, popular Might and Power won all three races, though not in the same year."
"The ""Spring Grand Slam"" in Melbourne is considered by some in the racing industry to be more difficult to win than the famous Triple Crown in the United States because the Australian races contain many more variables."
"The Triple Crown — involving the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes — is contested only by three-year-olds who race over distances between 1910 metres (Preakness) and 2400 metres (Belmont). The horses all carry the same weight (fillies a little less than colts and geldings), and none of the horses are being asked to race around the track in an unaccustomed direction."
"In Melbourne, the races are open to all horses aged three and over, and they race between 2,040 metres (Cox Plate) and 3,200 metres (Melbourne Cup)."
"The weight carried by horses can vary immensely, both in each race and from race to race, because three different handicapping systems are employed. The Caulfield Cup is a handicap race, the Cox Plate is a weight-for-age race, and the Melbourne Cup is a combination of both, a weight-for-age-handicap."
"Furthermore, in the U.S., horses race counter-clockwise on all tracks, but in Australia and New Zealand, there are both clockwise and counter-clockwise tracks. All ""Spring Grand Slam"" races in Melbourne are raced counter-clockwise, so horses domiciled in areas with predominantly clockwise tracks can be disoriented and not perform to potential."

= = = Rule of 78s = = =
"Also known as the sum-of-the-digits method, the Rule of 78s is a term used in lending that refers to a method of yearly interest calculation. The name comes from the total number of months' interest that is being calculated in a year (the first month is 1 month's interest, whereas the second month contains 2 months' interest, etc.). This is an accurate interest model only based on the assumption that the borrower pays only the amount due each month. If the borrower pays off the loan early, this method maximizes the amount paid (interest paid) by applying funds to interest before principal. In other words, in comparison to a simple interest loan, a rule of 78s loan will charge more interest if the loan is paid early."
"A simple fraction (as with 12/78) consists of a numerator (the top number, 12 in the example) and a denominator (the bottom number, 78 in the example). The denominator of a Rule of 78 loan is the sum of the digits, the sum of the number of monthly payments in the loan. For a twelve-month loan, the sum of numbers from 1 to 12 is 78 (1 + 2 + 3 + . . . +12 = 78). For a 24-month loan, the denominator is 300. The sum of the numbers from 1 to n is given by the equation n * (n+1) / 2. If n were 24, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 24 is 24 * (24+1) / 2 = 12 x 25 = 300, which is the loan's denominator, D."
"For a 12-month loan, 12/78s of the finance charge is assessed as the first month's portion of the finance charge, 11/78s of the finance charge is assessed as the second month's portion of the finance charge and so on until the 12th month at which time 1/78s of the finance charge is assessed as that month's portion of the finance charge. Following the same pattern, 24/300 of the finance charge is assessed as the first month's portion of a 24-month precomputed loan."
Formula for calculating the unearned interest:
formula_1
"where formula_2 is the unearned interest, formula_3 is the total agreed finance charges, formula_4 is the number of months paying off early, formula_5 is the total term of loan in months"
"The earliest official use of the Rule of 78s to calculate the unearned portion of a loan's finance charge was in Indiana in 1935. Most loans in 1935 were for small amounts at low interest rates for short periods of time. It reduced the cost of loan calculations in a pre-computer era and was well suited for the small, short, and low interest rate loans of the era."
"In the United States, the use of the Rule of 78s is prohibited in connection with mortgage refinancings and other consumer loans having a term exceeding 61 months."
"On March 15, 2001, in the U.S. 107th Congress, U.S. Rep. John LaFalce (D-NY 29), introduced H.R. 1054, a bill to eliminate the use of the Rule of 78s in credit transactions. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services on the same day. On April 10, 2001, the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, where it died with no further action taken."
"In the UK, as part of the Consumer Credit Act of 2005, the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1483) which does away with the Rule of 78 in consumer credit lending was issued and brought into effect on 31 May 2005."
"The Rule of 78s deals with precomputed loans, which are loans whose finance charge is calculated before the loan is made. Finance charge, carrying charges, interest costs, or whatever the cost of the loan may be called, can be calculated with simple interest equations, add-on interest, an agreed upon fee, or any disclosed method. Once the finance charge has been identified, the Rule of 78s is used to calculate the amount of the finance charge to be rebated (forgiven) in the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon number of payments. It should be understood that with precomputed loans, a borrower not only owes the lender the principal amount borrowed, but the borrower owes the finance charge as well. If $10,000 is lent and the precomputed finance charge is $3,000, the borrower owes the lender $13,000 at the time the loan is made, whereas a simple interest borrower owes the lender only the $10,000 principal and monthly interest on the unpaid principal."
"A simple explanation would be as follows: suppose that the total finance charge for a 12-month loan was $78.00. That figure is representative of the sum of digits by adding the numbers together, i.e., 12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 = 78. If a person repaid a consumer loan after 3 months, the financial institution would refund the sum of the ""remaining"" digits...(i.e. 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 or $45.00. In essence, they would retain the first three (3) numbers...12,11,10 or $33.00. Thus the consumer would not receive as much of a refund if it were divided equally by 12 months ($6.50 per month). Under this scenario they would have received a refund of $58.50, which is more beneficial than the $45.00 refund."

"Of course, there is no truth in any of these stories. The bridge was constructed as planned; von Rieppel’s complex calculations, (all carried out without the aid of computers or arithmetic aids), were correct – he died about 30 years later after an unrelated illness."
"What might be true are rumours about Emperor Wilhelm II's boycott of the inauguration ceremony. According to legend, the Emperor was annoyed that such a state-of-art structure was named after his grandfather, Wilhelm I, not after himself. He therefore decided not to attend the celebrations in person."

"= = = Eldol, Consul of Gloucester = = ="
"Eldol was Consul or Count of Gloucester in Geoffrey of Monmouth's circa 1136 work ""Historia Regum Britanniae"" (""The History of the Kings of Britain""). In this pseudohistory he was the sole British leader to escape from the massacre of Salisbury, to which Hengist had invited all of the British Leaders to a peace treaty. When all of the leaders were there, about 460 in number, Hengest ordered his men to draw their long knives and kill every leader. Vortigern was spared, but every other ruler was slain, save Eldol, who grabbed a stick up off the ground and killed 70 men in his escape."
"After the massacre, Eldol was a key supporter of Aurelius Ambrosius and helped him defeat the Saxons. Eldol defeated Hengist in hand-to-hand combat at the battle at Kaerconan/Cunungeburc, which may be the town of Conisbrough, and beheaded him. He was also at the siege of Vortigern's tower. Eldad, Bishop of Gloucester, was his brother."
"Thomas Rudge gives an account in his 1811 ""The History and Antiquities of Gloucester"":"
"Eldol, or Edel, a Briton, is said to have been Earl of Gloucester in 461; he was, according to the account of Robert of Gloucester, and other historians, a knight of great prowess. He attended King Vortigern at the treaty of Ambresbury in Wiltshire, to which they were invited by Hengist, the Saxon, with the express stipulation that neither party should go thither armed; but the Saxons having, contrary to their engagement, concealed long knives under their clothes, murdered great numbers of the Britons. Eldol is said at this time to have exerted himself so powerfully with a stake he happened to find, as to slay no less than seventy of the Saxons, and after having disabled many more, he escaped to Gloucester, his own city. He is also said to have behaved with uncommon courage, in a subsequent battle between Ambrosius, King of the Britons, and Hengist, when ... he rushed through the Pagan army, took Hengist prisoner, and cut off his head."
"It is not stated whether Morvid, Consul of Gloucester during King Arthur's reign in the ""Historia Regum Britanniae"", is related to Eldol."
"In later Welsh legend, Eldol became Eidol or Eidiol 'Gadarn' ('Mighty'), recorded as one of the three strong men of Britain, having, at the meeting on Salisbury plain, slain 660 Saxons with a billet of wood."
"There was a Welsh hero Eidiol mentioned in ""The Gododdin"" who may have inspired the use of the name in Geoffrey's work."
He should not be confused with King Eldol who lives generations earlier in Geoffrey's work.
"Eldol and Eldad have minor roles in the 1970 novel ""The Crystal Cave"" by Mary Stewart. After the battle with Hengist, one of Ambrosius's men says to Merlin, ""... old Eldad laid about him [i.e., fought well] with the best of them. Did you see him?"" Merlin replies wryly, ""I heard him."""

"Yidl Mitn Fidl (, ""Yiddle With His Fiddle"", ), is a 1936 musical Yiddish film."
"Arye and his daughter Itke are musicians, or ""klezmorim"", who became impoverished and were evicted from their home in Kazimierz Dolny. Arie sees no choice but to embark on a career of a travelling band, but fears for the safety of his daughter on the dangerous roads. Itke solves the problem by disguising herself as a boy and adopts the persona of ""Yidl"", ostensibly Arie's son."
"During their voyages, they meet another pair of merrymakers, the father-and-son duo Isaac and Ephraim Kalamutker, with whom they form a quartet and roam through the Polish countryside seeking engagements. ""Yidl"" falls in love with Ephraim, who is utterly oblivious to the true sex of his companion. The four are hired to perform in the wedding of young Teibele to the old, rich man Zalman Gold. The bride had to cancel her prior engagement with her true love, Yosl Fedlman, for her late father left many unpaid debts. Yidl takes pity on Teibele and the quartet smuggle her out of the party and have her join them as vocalist. To Yidl's dismay, Ephraim is enamored with the young woman. Itke reveals her true self to Isaac, who determines to assist her and leaves to locate Yosl."
"When arriving in Warsaw, the group become a success and are hired to perform in a concert. However, personal tensions between the members run high. Efraim signs a contract with a local orchestra. Teibele's lost match finally arrives, and they run off together before the show. Yidl, quite by accident, takes her place and recounts her entire story and love for Efraim in song form. She is applauded and signed on a contract for a career in the United States. Having learned the truth, Efraim abandons his commitments and joins her on the ship to New York."
"After the success of ""Joseph in the Land of Egypt"", a silent film dubbed into the Yiddish language by Joseph Green, met with success, he decided to create an entirely Yiddish film, and returned to his native Poland to do so. ""Yidl Mitn Fidl"" was the most successful Yiddish film of all time and the most popular of Green's films as well."
"The film was shot on location in Kazimierz Dolny, Poland, with local inhabitants as extras. Based on a novella by Konrad Tom, the screenplay was written by Green. Its score was composed by Abraham Ellstein, and the lyrics to the songs were written by Itzik Manger. Jakob Jonilowicz was the photo director of the film."
"It was filmed in Poland to minimize costs: the total budget was $50,000. Picon was contemplating entering English-language entertainment and had to be paid an astronomical fee in terms of Yiddish cinema, $10,000 or a fifth of the entire expenditure, to star in the main role. Besides her, all actors were Polish. The film turned into a resounding commercial success and covered the producers' expenses even before opening in the United States. When it premiered in the Ambassador movie theatre, Frank S. Nugent wrote in the ""New York Times"": ""It must be set down to her credit that, despite the fact that there is not a single new thing in the whole bag of tricks emptied on the screen, Miss Picon puts so much infectious gayety, not forgetting the proper modicum of sadness, into the action that the result is genuine entertainment."" It was exported to most of Western Europe, Australia and South Africa, and was screened in the British Mandate of Palestine with Hebrew dubbing. In Britain, it opened at Academy Cinema, Oxford Street, on 21 July 1937. The picture was exported outside of London and was quite a success; In a review for ""Night and Day"" from 29 July 1937, Graham Greene wrote of ""Yiddle"": ""a story in which even the music seems to have the dignity and patina of age and race. An odd feeling of freedom pervades the film full of ugly people in bowler-hats strumming in courtyards... Freedom even from the closer tyranny of a well-made script, as if the whole picture were an impromptu performance, like the stories in the Decameron."" Several copies were sent to Nazi Germany, where Jews were not allowed to attend regular cinemas, and viewing was restricted to ""members of the Jewish Race."" Premiere in the hall of the Jüdischer Kulturbund took place on 2 May 1938, and it then ran in communities across Germany."

"Diabolique is a 1996 American psychological thriller film directed by Jeremiah Chechik, written by Henri-Georges Clouzot and Don Roos, and starring Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, Chazz Palminteri, and Kathy Bates. The plot follows the wife and mistress of an abusive schoolmaster who find themselves stalked by an unknown assailant after murdering him and disposing of his body."

"Mia Baran is a devout Catholic schoolteacher at a boys' school outside Pittsburgh where her husband, Guy, is schoolmaster. Guy is abusive to the weak Mia, a former nun who suffers from cardiomyopathy; his mistress, Nicole Horner, a fellow teacher at the school, is protective of Mia. When both women grow tired of his abuses, they collaborate to murder him in an apartment owned by a family friend of Nicole's. The women lure him there, and Mia drugs him before they successfully drown him in a bathtub. They wrap his body in a shower curtain and place it in a wicker box."
"While en route to the school, Nicole crashes Guy's car in a pileup on the interstate, but the wicker box goes unnoticed by authorities. The women arrive at the school in the middle of the night, and dump Guy's corpse in the unkempt swimming pool on the property, staging his death as an accidental drowning. When his body fails to rise to the surface after several days, Nicole has the pool drained, but Guy's body is nowhere to be found. The women subsequently discover photos taken of them on the day of Guy's murder, and believe someone is blackmailing them."
"After reading about the discovery of a John Doe in a nearby river, Mia goes to view the body at the sheriff's station, but finds it is not Guy. There, she attracts the attention of Shirley Vogel, a retired police officer-turned-private investigator who offers to look into Guy's disappearance. Nicole is resistant, and Shirley quickly becomes suspicious of the women. Their fears of a blackmailer are confirmed when Mia discovers the shower curtain used to conceal Guy's body hanging in her bathroom window."
"Shirley confronts Mia with the accident report from Guy's car, and surmises that Guy was en route to see her in Pittsburgh on the day he disappeared. Mia grows increasingly paranoid, believing Guy is alive and stalking the women. This fear increases when two videographers filming an event at the school capture an image of Guy standing in one of the building's windows. Later, while investigating the school's basement, Shirley is attacked and knocked unconscious."
"That night, Mia finds Guy floating in her bathtub, and witnesses him rise from the water. Terrified, she loses consciousness and collapses, apparently suffering a heart attack. Nicole arrives, and it is revealed that she and Guy had planned the series of events to scare Mia to the point of heart failure. Nicole laments, however, and tells Guy she had wanted to call it off. While overlooking Mia's body, Nicole realizes she is in fact not dead; when Guy realizes she is alive, he attacks both women, knocking Nicole unconscious."
"Mia flees downstairs, and Guy tackles her to the ground in front of the pool and attempts to drown her. Nicole manages to stop him by driving a garden rake into his head, and he falls into the pool. As Nicole attempts to revive Mia, Guy pulls her into the pool and tries to drown her. Mia enters the pool, and together, both women successfully drown him. They exit the pool and are confronted by Shirley, who punches Mia in the face; willing to cover for the women, she explains it will help prove self-defense in Guy's murder. Mia walks away from the pool, distraught, and Shirley smokes a cigarette while watching Guy's body sink to the bottom."
"Filming took place in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The St. Philomena School was used as the primarily filming location."
"The movie was compared unfavorably to the original movie, and received overall negative reviews. It currently holds a 'rotten' 18% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews. Stone was nominated for a Razzie Award for ""Worst New Star"" (as the new ""serious"" Sharon Stone) for this film and ""Last Dance"", where she lost to Pamela Anderson for ""Barb Wire""."

The second single, ""A Mind of Its Own"" was released on 11 February 2002. A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised, following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved."
"The album was a success, reached number ten in the United Kingdom and number twenty on the Australian Hitseekers Albums Chart."
"Initially, the album was to be titled ""Innocent Girl"" and set to be released on 27 August 2001, but was released on 1 October. Beckham revealed that she felt she had ""a lot to prove"" with the album's release: ""When I started recording this album, I had a lot to prove. I want to prove I can sing and dance and have a vision. I'm really baring my soul on this. I hope people like it. When I was with the other girls I never did a lot of the singing, so this is the first time that people are going to see me and what I am capable of"". She added that she hoped the album would do well ""and I can have a successful solo career""."

The video culminates into a ""dance-off"" and motorcycle race between the two Victorias. The complex video was shot almost entirely on a green set with a great deal of post-production, making it one of the most complex solo Spice Girl videos to date."
"""A Mind of Its Own"" was released on 11 February 2002 as the second single from her debut self-titled solo album (2001). It peaked and debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart and sold 56,570 becoming the 173rd best seller of 2002. There is a French version of the song called ""Mon Coeur N'en Fait Qu'a Sa Tete"" (an adaptation of the title into French, or ""my heart does what it wants to do"")."
"A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on ""Friday Night's All Wright"". Following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved.

Both singers had previously faced a battle in the singles' chart, when their singles were released on the same day. However, Beckham's album debuted at number ten on the UK Albums Chart on 13 October 2001, whilst Minogue's album topped the charts. ""Victoria Beckham"" charted for three weeks on the chart. However, the album has only sold 50,000 copies overall in the United Kingdom, while costing £5 million to produce. After ""Being Victoria Beckham"", an official documentary that aired in March 2002, the album re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number sixty-seven."

All three species are small for bats and ""M. cineracea"" is small for a ""Murina"" bat. These three new tube-nosed bats were discovered by a team from the Hungarian Natural History Museum (HNHM) and Fauna and Flora International (FFI). All three of these bats live in tropical forests, making them endangered by deforestation."
"The name ""ashy-gray"" comes from the color of their dorsal fur, while the ventral fur is dark gray, and there is some white fur on the breast area. In some areas the tips of the hair are dark. It lacks the golden guard hairs so common in other members of the genus ""Murina"". This bat is small enough to fit in a person's hand, weighing . As of 2013, there are still few details known about them and their ecology and it is suspected there are many more species of bats yet to be discovered in the region."
"Vespertilionid bats have many cryptic species. As an example, the members of the ashy-gray bat were formerly classified as Scully's tube-nosed bat (""Murina tubinaris""). Eight new species were found in Southeast Asia between 2005-2009. The use of DNA technology has proved very useful in differentiating between the various species of ""Murina""."
"= = = Friedenberg, Missouri = = ="
"Friedenberg is an unincorporated community located in Central Township in Perry County, Missouri, United States."
"The Bavarians who settled just outside Perryville, Missouri in the 1830s felt so strongly about the importance of peace that they named their town “Friedenberg” (German: Hill of Peace). An old nickname for Friedenberg is “Raccoon Ridge”."
"Unlike the communities of Altenburg, Frohna and Uniontown that were settled by Saxon Lutherans from Germany, Friedenberg was founded in 1838 by Lutheran immigrants from Bavaria, Germany. These Bavarians came from the Upper Franconian region, some from the city of Langenstadt near present-day Kulmbach. These immigrants worshiped in members’ homes until a log church was built in 1846 north of Cinque Hommes Creek. From 1852 until 1885 the congregation worshiped at their church on Frankenberg overlooking the Cinque Hommes Bottoms. In 1885 the congregation moved to its present site in Friedenberg and built a brick church. Peace Lutheran church disbanded in 1980."
= = = CBD and South East Light Rail = = =
"The CBD and South East Light Rail is a partly-opened Australian light rail line in Sydney, New South Wales, running from Circular Quay at the northern end of the central business district to the south-eastern suburbs of Randwick and Kingsford. It is part of Sydney's light rail network. Major construction commenced in October 2015. The project is being managed by Transport for NSW. Construction, operation and maintenance of the line is contracted to the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium."
"Passenger services between Circular Quay and Randwick, known as the L2 Randwick Line, commenced on 14 December 2019, while services between Circular Quay and Juniors Kingsford, known as the L3 Kingsford Line, are expected to commence in March 2020."
"Since the light rail network's original line opened in 1997, a line through the Sydney central business district had been suggested numerous times but failed to achieve State Government support. This changed in February 2010 when the Keneally Government announced a new line from Haymarket to Circular Quay via Barangaroo. The final route was not decided, with the three options being to send the line north via George Street, Sussex Street or a loop using both."
"When the O'Farrell Government took office in March 2011, it committed to building a line through the CBD to Barangaroo, with a preferred route along George Street. It also committed to conducting feasibility studies into the construction of lines from the City to Sydney University and the City to the University of New South Wales. On 8 December 2011, the government announced shortlisted potential routes for these extensions. In 2012, Transport for NSW (TfNSW) decided the routes to Sydney University and Barangaroo via The Rocks provided fewer customer benefits and were considered a lower priority. A route from Circular Quay to the University of New South Wales via Central station was seen as the best option."
"On 13 December 2012, the government announced a commitment to build a $1.6 billion line from Circular Quay down George Street to Central station, then across to Moore Park and down Anzac Parade with branches to Kingsford and Randwick. Construction was expected to begin in 2014 and to take five to six years."
The line services areas that were previously served by Sydney's former tram network. Some of the new route follows tram lines of the former network.
The route is mostly on-street but includes an off-street section through Moore Park. The only major engineering works on the line were a new bridge over the Eastern Distributor and a tunnel under Moore Park and Anzac Parade. There will be between eight and ten new traffic light controlled intersections created along the route.
"Several changes to the design were announced in December 2014. The major changes involve revising platform lengths at all stops to support an increase in the length of the trams from 45 metres to 67 metres, redesigning several stops, switching technologies for the delivery of the wire-free section and the removal of a proposed stop at World Square. It was also announced that the projected cost had increased from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion. The government claimed the increase was due to the design modifications, but a 2016 report produced by the Audit Office of New South Wales found that the increase was largely due to TfNSW underestimating the cost of the project."
"A pedestrian zone was established along approximately 40% of George Street, between Bathurst and Hunter Streets."
"The section between Bathurst Street and Circular Quay is wire-free, with trams using Alstom's proprietary ground-level power supply technology to run instead. This was originally to have been achieved by equipping the trams with batteries and providing recharging facilities at stops."
"The line is designed to handle special events in the Moore Park precinct and at Randwick Racecourse. Events at Moore Park were initially planned to be served using two coupled trams long, with double length platforms at the Central Station and Moore Park stops. Following the decision to make all tram vehicles operate in coupled pairs with a total length of , the plans to build double length platforms at Central and Moore Park were abandoned, and platforms of all stops will be long."
"A depot for the trams was built at the north-western corner of Randwick Racecourse, providing stabling facilities and allowing light maintenance. Heavy maintenance will be conducted at the Lilyfield Maintenance Depot at the site of the former Rozelle Yard. The maintenance depot will be accessed via the Inner West Light Rail."
"The line was built as a public-private partnership (PPP), with the contract covering detailed design, major construction, operation and maintenance of the line as well as the provision of rolling stock. A contract for early construction works was awarded to Laing O'Rourke in July 2014."
"In February 2014, three consortia were short listed for the main contract – covering the construction and operation of the line:"
The iLinQ consortium withdrew after Balfour Beatty pulled out. Balfour Beatty was reportedly concerned about cost overruns for the project and falling profitability of the company as a whole.
"The #19 engine, also known as the ""Lew Brown"", features a propane-fired boiler and has a total weight of 25 tons (engine and tender). Like its older brother engine, the #12, it is a scale replica of The General. The engine is painted green and was originally named Simon Kenton, after a famous Ohio frontiersman."
"Kings Island maintains a total of 12 open air passenger cars, arranged as 6 cars on each engine. 6 of the cars are painted green, and are typically matched with the No. 19 engine. The other 6 cars are painted red, and are matched with the No. 12 engine. Capacity per completed train (6 cars) is 465 park guests. Each passenger car has a series of seals depicting Native American Tecumseh and frontiersman Simon Kenton (after whom the engines were originally named) with the railroad name."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad features two train stations. Losantiville station is considered the line's main station, and is located in the Rivertown section of the park, next to the entrance of White Water Canyon and Mystic Timbers. It is a covered station and platform. There is also a station located at the entrance to Soak City Water park, which is an uncovered concrete pad station that, unlike the Losantiville station, is a curved station."
"Each train is manned by a total of four associates; an Engineer, Fireman, Front Conductor, and Back Conductor (position of back conductor may be eliminated with the operation of a scaled down train of three passenger cars, rather than the regular six). The Engineer is in charge of the operation of the locomotive, while the Fireman watches over the boiler pressure levels, and maintains the fire and water levels in the boiler. The Front Conductor is in the charge of the movement of the train, as well as the entertainment and wellbeing of the passengers aboard. Additionally, each station must be manned by a Station Master who is responsible for the safety of passengers in the station, helping passengers load and unload, as well as keeping capacity."
"Each morning, the train crew (Engineer and Fireman) prepare the engines for operation at the engine house, located near the Losantiville station. Once the first train of the morning reaches the Losantiville station, the front conductor and back conductor board the train. Once the train is staffed completely, the train must do a full test cycle around the track before passengers can be loaded. During the morning hours, only one engine is in service. Midway through the day, the second train is brought into operation. Opening procedures for the train brought out second differ slightly, in that the front and back conductors board the train in the engine house, rather than at the Losantiville station."
"The Front Conductor is in charge of the movement of the train. During a normal passenger loading procedure, the station master must clear the station platform with a thumbs up signal, at which point the Back Conductor must clear the Front Conductor for movement with a hand signal known as a ""Highball"". Once the Front Conductor verifies the Highball from the Back Conductor and the clear from the Station Master, the Front Conductor will ""Highball"" the Engineer, who then proceeds with operation of the locomotive. ""Highball"" hand signals are also given at two locations along the train route, between the Front and Back Conductor, to signal that everything is clear on all six passenger cars."
"After the water park closes, the park resumes one-train operation for the rest of the night. The last train leaves at park closing and backs the train into the locomotive garage (engine house). After the last cycle has completed for the night, the Engineer and Fireman proceed to back the other train into the engine house from the Losantiville station."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad has some private grade crossings for the private roads where the workers go on. The private grade crossings have one or two crossbucks. There is also a public grade crossing that has four railroad crossing signals, two gated signals with bells and lights for the public path and two gateless signals with just lights for the private road. This crossing is right next to the Soak City station."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad operates during the entire season. Throughout most of the season, it entertains guests and serves as transportation to and from Soak City. During the park's annual Halloween Haunt event, which occurs on weekend nights in September and October, it was transformed into a haunted maze known as ""Tombstone Terror-Tory"". The attraction had a western-theme and utilized the exit path of White Water Canyon. When Kings Island began construction of Mystic Timbers in 2016, the exit path was shortened significantly, and Tombstone Terror-Tory was removed from the Halloween Haunt lineup."

"The Galwan River flows from the disputed Aksai Chin region in southern Hotan County, Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang of China to Ladakh of India. It originates in the area of Samzungling on the eastern side of the Karakoram range and flows west to join the Shyok River at . It is one of the upstream tributaries of the Indus River."
"The river is named after Ghulam Rasool Galwan, a Ladakhi explorer from Leh, who first explored the course of the river. In 1899, he was part of a British expedition team that was exploring the areas to the north of the Chang Chenmo valley, when ran into this previously unknown river valley. Harish Kapadia states that this is one of the rare instances where a major geographical feature is named after a native explorer."
"The river's length is about 80 kilometers, and it is fast-flowing."
"The Galwan river is to the west of China's 1956 claim line in Aksai Chin. However, in 1960 China advanced its claim line to the west of the river along the mountain ridge adjoining the Shyok river valley. Meanwhile, India continued to claim the entire Aksai Chin plateau."
"These claims and counterclaims led to a military standoff in the Galwan River valley in 1962. On 4 July, a platoon of Indian Gorkha troops set up a post in the upper reaches of the valley. The post ended up cutting the lines of communication to a Chinese post at Samzungling. The Chinese interpreted it as a premeditated attack on their post, and surrounded the Indian post, coming within 100 yards of the post. The Indian government warned China of ""grave consequences"" and informed them that India was determined to hold the post at all costs. The post remained surrounded for four months and was supplied by helicopters. According to scholar Taylor Fravel, the standoff marked the ""apogee of tension"" for China's leaders."
"By the time the Sino-Indian War started on the 20 October 1962, the Indian post had been reinforced by a company of troops. The Chinese PLA bombarded it with heavy shelling and employed a battalion to attack the post. The Indians suffered 33 killed and several wounded, and the company commander and several others were taken prisoner. By the end of the war, China reached its 1960 claim line."
"Rolling Vengeance, also known as Monster Truck, is a 1987 exploitation film directed by Steven Hilliard Stern and starring Don Michael Paul and Ned Beatty. The movie follows a truck driver that builds a special, eight-ton truck to help get revenge against the rednecks who killed his family and raped his girlfriend. The film script's initial premise centered on a young boy that created special monster trucks in order to eliminate drunk drivers."
"The five drunken sons of influential local business owner Tiny Doyle have been terrorizing the streets of their small town in their pick-up truck. Local trucker Big Joe Rosso has a wife named Kathy, a son named Joey, and two young daughters named Allison and Kristin. Big Joe and Joey do business with Tiny, delivering liquor to his bar, but that doesn't stop Tiny's son Vic from driving drunk and running Kathy off the road, killing Kathy, Allison, and Kristin. Thanks to Tiny's influence, the local judge sets Vic free after ordering Vic to pay a $300 fine. Lieutenant Sly, one of the local cops, is sympathetic toward the Rosso family, but Sly is about to retire, and Tiny has a lot of clout in this town. Enraged and bereaved, Big Joe goes after Vic, but the Doyles kill Big Joe. After that, they rape Joey's girlfriend Misty. Enraged and frustrated, Joey builds a monster truck out of junked car and truck parts, with seven-foot tall tires, a flame thrower, and a giant retractable combination drill and metal cutter mounted on it. Joey is out to do what the local authorities cannot or will not do...put an end to the Doyles once and for all."
"Reception for the film has been mixed, with most reviews upon its initial release being negative. Twitch Film gave a mostly positive review for ""Rolling Vengeance"", stating that although the film didn't go against any genre conventions, it does ""play all the right notes to their hilt"". Dread Central also praised the film, commenting that it was ""a cult film just waiting to be rediscovered"". The San Jose Mercury News panned the film, calling it ""predictable""."

"My Worst Nightmare (original title: Mon pire cauchemar) is a 2011 French-Belgian comedy-drama film written and directed by Anne Fontaine, starring Isabelle Huppert, Benoît Poelvoorde and André Dussollier."
"Agathe is a successful art dealer who lives with her husband François and their son Adrien in a wealthy quarter of Paris. Adrien is an underachiever at his school and Agathe fights any disadvantages that this can bring for him in parent-teacher conferences. François is more of a reserved person and procrastinates on a construction project. The situation gets stirred up when Adrien's friend Patrick, who is Tony's father, enters the picture. Tony is brilliant in his studies irrespective of his poor access to amenities, so Agathe has a soft spot for the child. And, Adrien's test results seem to be getting better. But Patrick has a rather dubious social background. He lacks both tact in social situations and a proper home or job for supporting a family. Agathe is distressed by Patrick's unpolished behavior and his intrusion into their life. Her husband François hires him to take care of the overdue construction project and they become friends. Then François cajoles a woman Patrick had wanted for himself and leaves Agathe. Patrick and Agathe are left back with the children. Agathe develops a sense of attachment for this unruly man who, ""au contraire"" to her husband, empathizes with her and is dedicated to ensuring his son can attend a respected school. But Patrick fails continuously to become responsible and they break up. Some time later they reconnect because each seems to complete the other."
"""My worst nightmare"" was evaluated as an ""utterly conventional French bourgeois comedy"". Still it was also considered ""watchable"" just because of its cast."
"Isabelle Huppert was in particular praised for making Agathe's transformation believable. Benoît Poelvoorde's performance was recognised a ""often irritable and hilarious"". Diego Costa wrote for Slant Magazine ""My worst nightmare"" was coined by a very Frenchkind of humor which could ""go right over American audience's heads""."
"= = = St. John's Episcopal Church (Jersey City, New Jersey) = = ="
"Saint John's Episcopal Church in Jersey City, New Jersey is located on Summit Avenue in Bergen Hill. Owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Newark, it is considered a masterwork of 19th-century ecclesiastical architecture. The building, which has fallen into disrepair, became a municipal landmark in 2013."
"Erected in 1870, the Gothic Revival-influenced building was designed by John Remson Onderdonk, a local architect and practitioner of the ecclesiological philosophy, and is considered to be a masterpiece of 19th-century ecclesiastical architecture by the city's landmarks conservancy. Its façade replicates a portion of the Chartres Cathedral in Southern France. Once housing the largest Episcopal church congregation in New Jersey, among its members were many of the leading citizens of Jersey City. It was called the ""Millionaire's Church"". In 1914, much of the church was damaged by fire, but was elaborately restored. By the mid-twentieth century, reflecting the demographic change in the city, its congregation became more working class. From 1960 to 1968 the church was a center of the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements during the rectorship of the Reverend Robert W. Castle who preached a social gospel and drew attention to the plight of the city's poor. The church has not housed an Episcopal congregation since 1994."
"The Bergen Hill Historic District, of which the church is a contributing property, was established as a municipal historic district in 1986 and identified in New Jersey's state historic preservation office (SHPO) in 1989/1991 (ID#1481). In 2008, the SHPO issued a certificate of eligibility (ID#4986) for listing individually on both the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places. Attempts made in 2007/2008 to have the church designated a local landmark were unsuccessful, the motion having been tabled by the Jersey City City Council. When it appeared that the diocese was moving to demolish the building, a campaign was begun to convince the city council to re-visit the issue which it did in June 2013 and adopted a measure granting landmark status."
St. John's has not been in regular use since 1994. In 2004 Preservation New Jersey named St. John's one of the most endangered historic sites in the state.
"There is concern that if the building continues to deteriorate it will be necessary for it is to be demolished. The Jersey Landmarks Conservancy, a preservation group, believes that the Episcopal Diocese of Newark has intentionally neglected the building in order to demolish it. The stained glass windows, altar, and other items were removed in 1997. In January 2012, the church's altar was offered for sale on e-bay. The diocese maintains that the preservation of the building is too costly and that no serious offers to purchase it have been forthcoming. In March 2013 the City of Jersey City served the diocese a Notice of Unsafe Structure, after which it contracted an asbestos abatement work and applied for a permit for demolition. Its designation as a local landmark requires that special approval be given before the building can be razed. The diocese disagrees with the landmarking. In 2015 it was decided to convert the property to residental spaces, including consruction of new buildings and conversion of the church."

= = = Strict father model = = =
"The strict father model of parenting is one which values strict discipline, particularly by the father, in parenting."
Ideas involved in this model include:
"This model of child-rearing would involve, for example, allowing children to cry themselves to sleep on the grounds that picking up a child when it should be sleeping on its own improperly fosters dependence on the parents. In his book ""Dare to Discipline"", James Dobson advocates the strict father model. However, some researchers have linked authoritarian childrearing with children who withdraw, lack spontaneity, and have lesser evidence of conscience."
"The strict father model is discussed by George Lakoff in his books, including ""Moral Politics,"" ""Don't Think of an Elephant,"" ""The Political Mind,"" and ""Whose Freedom?"". In these books, the strict father model is contrasted with the nurturant parent model. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then conservative politics correspond to the strict father model. For example, conservatives think that adults should refrain from looking to the government for assistance lest they become dependent."

"Mark Alan Stuart (born April 14, 1968) is a Christian rock musician, singer and songwriter best known as the lead vocalist for the Christian rock band Audio Adrenaline during their original run from 1987 to 2007."
"Mark Stuart met the original guitarist and bassist for Audio Adrenaline, Barry Blair and Will McGinniss, while attending Kentucky Christian College (now known as Kentucky Christian University). Barry Blair was Mark's roommate for three years. They founded the band in 1986 under the name of A-180. However, they temporarily disbanded the next year when Mark went to Haiti for a semester. When he returned to Kentucky, the band reformed and recruited Bob Herdman, who brought them two songs to record. After they did, they changed their name to Audio Adrenaline and signed a deal with Forefront Records. After more than twenty years of success with the band and eight studio albums, Stuart and the band decided to retire on January 2006. The primary reason cited was Stuart's ""ongoing vocal challenges"" stemming from vocal cord damage caused by a disorder known as spasmodic dysphonia, not by overuse."
Mark Stuart and Will McGinniss have started a project called Know Hope Collective. The project features a changing group of musicians that will sing worship songs and present testimonies.

= = = FS Class E.424 = = =
The FS E.424 is a class of Italian railways electric locomotives. They were built in 1943-1951 and have been decommissioned in 2008.
"A design for a small multi-service Bo-Bo locomotive, with speed up to , had been devised by Giuseppe Bianchi as early as in the 1930s, but the project had been halted by the introduction of the E.326 and E.428. After the realization of the 6-axle E.636, it was however decided to revamp the project by adapting to it some solutions already in use on the E.636 (engines, bogies, suspension etc.)."
"Breda SpA workshop provided the three prototypes of E.424 in 1943-1944. Mass production, however, could begin only after the end of World War II, part of the funds provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration program."
The locomotives have been built in four series starting from year 1943:
"Class E.424, having DC type motors like all the Italian locomotives of the time, is a rheostatic-type locomotive; on start, a rheostat is connected in series to the motors and is gradually excluded as speed builds up allowing more current to flow to the motors; unlike other rheostatic locomotives of that time, this is not achieved via the characteristic lever (""Maniglione""), but through an automatic system, called ""Avviatore Automatico"", derived from contemporary first-generation ALe 790/880/883 EMUs."
"The driver simply selects the combination (series or parallel), and the relative rheostat contactors are automatically and gradually closed by this system; in case of failure, the driver can manually rotate an apposite wheel (that also usually rotates automatically as the system advances) to proceed with the exclusion."
"When the rheostat is completely excluded for the series combination, field shunts can be inserted, or the driver can proceed to parallel combination, making a transition, which is handled by a device called ""CEM"" that automatically combines the motors (closing various contacts) accordingly."
"Originally more than one unit could be coupled and be controlled remotely by the first locomotive using a system called ""Comando Multiplo""; on the central part of the cab there also was a door that enabled the crew to pass from one locomotive to another in case of problems. However, because of safety issues and the imperfect reliability of this system (there were no instruments indicating the status of the slave locomotive, so it was not certain if it correctly made a transition or not, for example), it was abandoned and then disassembled."
"Eleven units received compound-type motors, enabling a very fine speed control, in a range included between in series combination, and in parallel."

The Mustang Aeronautics Mustang II is a two-seat aerobatic sports airplane developed and marketed in the United States for homebuilding.
"Robert Bushby acquired the rights to the Long Midget Mustang in 1959 and four years later began development of a two-seat, side-by-side version. This eventually flew in 1966 and plans were made available soon thereafter. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992."
"A single engine in tractor configuration airplane, the Mustang II features cantilever low-wing, two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed conventional landing gear, or, optionally, tricycle landing gear."
"The aircraft is made from riveted sheet aluminum with a rounded turtle deck and flat sides and bottom skins. Its span wing employs a NACA 64A212 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a NACA 64A210 at the wingtip. Standard engines used include the Lycoming O-320, the Lycoming O-360 and the fuel-injected Lycoming IO-360 four-stroke powerplants. Standard fuel capacity is 25 US gallons, but optional wet wings increase the fuel capacity to 61 US gallons. Several other fuel tank options are available. A folding wing option may be installed."

"Symptoms of NNN are similar to those of nicotine poisoning and include irritation at the point of absorption (for example, the gums when dipping tobacco is used), nausea and vomiting, sleep disturbances, headache, and chest pain. The substance is also a known carcinogen, meaning that any exposure to the substance can lead to cancer and is proven to cause esophageal and nasal cancer in animals. There is no known ""safe"" levels of NNN ingestion in humans due to its carcinogenic activity. However, in mice, the median lethal dose (LD) is 1g/kg."

= = = Supercilium = = =
"The supercilium is a plumage feature found on the heads of some bird species. It is a stripe which runs from the base of the bird's beak above its eye, finishing somewhere towards the rear of the bird's head. Also known as an ""eyebrow"", it is distinct from the eyestripe, which is a line which runs across the lores, and continues behind the eye. Where a stripe is present only above the lores, and does not continue behind the eye, it is called a supraloral stripe or simply supraloral. On most species which display a supercilium, it is paler than the adjacent feather tracts."
"The colour, shape or other features of the supercilium can be useful in bird identification. For example, the supercilium of the dusky warbler, an Old World warbler species, can be used to distinguish it from the very similar Radde's warbler. The dusky warbler's supercilium is sharply demarcated, whitish and narrow in front of the eye, becoming broader and more buffy towards the rear, whereas that of the Radde's warbler is diffusely defined, yellowish and broadest in front of the eye, becoming narrower and more whitish toward the rear. The supercilium of the northern waterthrush, a New World warbler, differs subtly from that of the closely related (and similarly plumaged) Louisiana waterthrush. The Louisiana has a bicoloured supercilium which widens significantly behind the eye, while the northern has an evenly buffy eyebrow which is either the same width throughout or slightly narrower behind the eye."
"A split supercilium divides above the lores. In some species, such as the jack snipe, the divided stripes reconnect again behind the eye. In others, such as the broad-billed sandpiper, the divided stripes remain separate."
"A supercilium drop is a feature found on some pipits; it is a pale spot on the rear of the which, although separated from the supercilium by an eyestripe, can appear at some angles to be a downward continuation of the supercilium."
= = = Adolf of Altena = = =
"Adolf of Altena, Adolf of Berg or Adolf of Cologne, (c. 1157 – 15 April 1220 in Neuss) was Archbishop of Cologne from 1193 to 1205."
Adolf was born about 1157 as the second son of Count Eberhard of Berg-Altena and his wife Adelheid von Arnsberg.
"About 1177 he became a canon in Cologne. Later, in 1183, he became Dean of the Cathedral, and in the year 1191 Cathedral Provost. After the abdication of his uncle Bruno III of Berg he became Archbishop of Cologne in 1193, as ""Adolf I"", or ""Adolf I von Altena""."
"In March 1194 he received his episcopal consecration by Hermann II of Katzenelnbogen, Prince-Bishop of Münster. In the same year Adolf was instrumental in arranging the release of King Richard I of England, whom he received with considerable solemnity in Cologne shortly afterwards, at the beginning of February 1194. He was a declared opponent of the plans for a hereditary empire of Emperor Henry VI and at Christmas 1195 refused Henry's wish for the election of his son Frederick Roger. He gave up his opposition in August 1197 for the secondary election of the candidate chosen in the meantime by the other Electors in Boppard. However, after the death of Henry VI, Adolf declared the election invalid, as the candidate was not baptised and the Emperor had put the Electors under pressure."
"In the ensuing dynastic struggle for the throne between the Hohenstaufen and the Welfs, he crowned on 12 July 1198 the Welf Otto of Brunswick in Aachen as King of the Romans (or German king). Shortly afterwards, Pope Innocent III, who had an interest in weakening the Hohenstaufen and in breaking their power (particularly in Italy), confirmed the election of Otto. On 6 January 1205 however Adolf then crowned the Staufen competitor for the crown, Philip of Swabia, as German king. Philip had already been crowned in 1198, although only in Mainz Cathedral, but he had nevertheless been crowned with the genuine Imperial Regalia and especially the Imperial crown."
"The Pope, who had reserved himself the king's question himself, was irritated by the rumor of the page change and asked Adolf himself for a report. Since Adolf did not want to sacrifice his just hard-won right of the decisive vote in the royal election, a papal presentation, he did not respond to the papal request. However, he overestimated its importance by far."
"On 19 July 1205 Adolf was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III and declared deposed. Already in July, a new archbishop was elected in Cologne. Since one was still in the Rhineland but still in the Hohenstaufen line, his successor could barely prevail against him, so that it came to a schism in the archbishopric of Cologne."
"In 1207 Adolf von Altena was in Rome, where he tried against his successor and fought for his reinstatement as archbishop - without success. Only the murder of Philip of Swabia (21 June 1208) and the changed political situation led to a submission to the pope and a recognition of his successor for himself and his followers, for which he received an annual pension of 250 marks. Adolf, from then until his death, was active in the archdiocese of Cologne as an auxiliary bishop. However his see was not returned to him."
"Dietrich I von Hengebach was deposed by the papal legate, and in March 1212 he was appointed to head the diocese. While initially holding this to be reinstated, he soon realized that it was just a provisional lead. In fact, the Archdiocese was again in the schism, especially since Adolf now argued with Dietrich von Hengebach before the Pope for reinstatement. The verdict was in 1216 and in Cologne it came again to the election of the bishop. The new archbishop became his successor as cathedral provost, Engelbert II of Berg. He was one of his relatives and had always supported him during the time of the schism, including by handing over goods from the cathedral chapter."
"Until his death, in 1220, Adolf was again active as auxiliary bishop in the archbishopric of Cologne. He died on 15 April 1220 in Neuss."

"Eric and Amy Bowen are a married couple looking to buy a house for themselves and their three children: 16-year-old daughter Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), 9-year-old son Griffin (Kyle Catlett), and 6-year-old daughter Madison (Kennedi Clements). Eric was recently laid off, but they are shown a house that has recently come on the market that fits their price range, so they purchase it and move in."
"The first night, they hear strange noises in the walls and Griffin finds a box containing clown dolls that were left at the house. In the middle of the night, lights and electronic devices start turning on and off, as some unseen force appears to move through the home. The commotion wakes Griffin, and he goes downstairs and finds Maddie talking to an unknown presence inside the television. She tells Griffin someone is coming, and he attempts to unplug the TV, causing the lights to go out of control. Maddie then tells the family: ""They're here"" while touching their TV screen."
"The following evening, Eric and Amy go to dinner with their friends, leaving the three children at home. They learn that their house was built on an old cemetery, although the property developer was supposed to have relocated the human remains. Kendra wakes up to a strange sound in the laundry room. While investigating the noise, the floor cracks and a corpse's hand emerges. It begins pulling at her foot, but she manages to pull herself up. Meanwhile, Griffin notices the clown dolls seem to be moving by themselves. One clown doll attacks him, but he destroys it and runs from his bedroom. He finds Maddie in her room, scared, crouching in a corner, and tells her to stay while he goes to find Kendra. Maddie is then lured into her closet and becomes lost in an unending void. As she sees her bedroom drifting away further, she is dragged into the darkness by ghosts. Griffin is grabbed through a window by the branches of the old tree outside their house, which pulls him outside. Amy and Eric arrive home to see Griffin being tossed around in the tree branches, which releases its grip when they come close, while Kendra tells them she can't find Maddie."
"The family hears Maddie's voice emanating from the television. Amy places her hand on the television screen while Maddie's static hand is seen to be touching Amy's hand from the other side of the screen. Amy and Griffin visit the Paranormal Research department for help. The staff set up equipment in the house and install GPS devices on everyone in the house. While trying to contact Maddie, Eric is ambushed in the closet by a ghost resembling her. Angered, he breaks down the closet wall, throwing a chair into the darkness inside the closet; the chair falls back into the living room of the house, revealing a possible portal Maddie can escape through. The investigators realize that the haunting is a poltergeist. The lead investigator, Dr. Brooke Powell, decides to call occult specialist and television personality Carrigan Burke (revealed, much later, to be Powell's ex)."
"Carrigan explains that Maddie is a possible psychic, able to communicate with spirits. He reveals that the ghosts are trapped and are angry because only the headstones were moved to the new cemetery, but the bodies remain; they plan on using Maddie ""to free them from their purgatory"". Carrigan comes up with a plan to get Maddie back. He anchors a rope in Maddie's room and tosses it into the vortex. They attempt to use Griffin's toy drone to guide Maddie out, but it is immediately destroyed by the ghosts when inside the portal. Griffin, guilt-ridden over leaving Maddie alone in the first place, goes through the portal himself. When he finds Maddie, the ghosts attempt to destroy the rope to trap them, but Griffin and Maddie grab onto the rope and are brought back through the portal."
"The family get in their car and begin to leave the house, but the ghosts drag them back into the house and attempt to abduct Maddie again. The family saves her from being sucked into the portal, and Carrigan decides that as the only other psychic, he must go into the vortex and lead the spirits into the light. The Bowens flee as the house is destroyed by the spirits soaring into the sky as a beacon of light. The investigative team run to their equipment, looking for a sign that Carrigan managed to get back."
"As the Bowens look for a new house, the realtor shows them a house with lots of closet space and an old tree in the backyard; the Bowens drive away laughing. During the end credits, it's revealed that Carrigan survived the incident and is back filming his ghost program, now hosting the show with Dr. Powell."

"The film's first trailer was released on February 5, 2015. Forrest Wickman of ""Slate Magazine""'s opinion was that the trailer made the film appear to be too similar to the original film. James Hibberd of ""Entertainment Weekly"" said that the trailer ""retains and amplifies several elements from the original"", and praised that ""the modernizing doesn’t result in, say, the family’s daughter being kidnapped by ghosts in Snapchat"". Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting stated that ""while every fiber of my being wants to reject it, [the film] actually looks pretty insane"", and praised the trailer's final shot.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""C+"" on an A+ to F scale."
"Writing for ""Variety"", Andrew Barker called it ""generally entertaining yet fundamentally unnecessary"" and concluded: ""Even when one is inclined to admire the cleverness with which the remake revisits and reincorporates ""Poltergeist""s themes, it’s hard to pinpoint a single moment where it improves on them, and the aura of inessentiality hangs thick over the proceedings"". Neil Genzlinger gave the film a mostly positive review in ""The New York Times"", writing: ""The new ""Poltergeist"" might well be the scariest movie 13-or-unders have yet seen, just as the original was for their parents back in 1982. Those parents might find it an enjoyable trip down memory lane, even if they do now recognize it as largely a well-served collection of horror-movie tropes"". Eddie Goldberger echoed that sentiment in The New York Daily News, writing ""It doesn't approach the original--really, how could it? But the new ""Poltergeist"" is a fun, worthy horror entry."" Tirdad Derakhshani wrote in ""The Philadelphia Inquirer"": ""It's not exactly a scary film, but it does provide an enjoyable ride. It's good fun. But it left me befuddled"", adding: ""Why would anyone want to remake ""Poltergeist"" in the first place?"". Writing in ""The Daily Telegraph"", Mike McCahill called the film ""an efficient scare-machine"". Bilge Ebiri wrote in ""New York"" magazine: ""This new ""Poltergeist"" isn't anything special... But it's not a travesty, and that feels like cause for brief celebration""."
"Other critics took a more skeptical view of the film. Writing a review for ""The Village Voice"", Alan Scherstuhl stated, """"Poltergeist 2015"" is to ""Poltergeist '82"" what today's shipped-frozen-to-the-store Pizza Hut dough is to the kneaded-on-site pies the chain's stoned cooks tossed in the Reagan era. It's the same kind of thing, with the same shape and some shared ingredients, but the texture's gone limp, and there's no sense of occasion about it, and there's some unpalatable goop stuffed in the crust.

"As there are no known structures surviving from that period in the Scatterville vicinity, the Scatterville Cemetery is locally significant as the best surviving link to this important early Clay County settlement which faded from view in the post-railroad era. The Scatterville Cemetery comprises roughly two acres and is set in an impressive stand of largely oak and hickory trees. The cemetery is surrounded on three sides by a barbed-wire fence of indeterminate age, and is further designated by a large cast-iron marker erected at the entrance by the Arkansas History Commission in 1973."
"Most of the markers are small, narrow marble slabs, many of which have fallen and/or possibly moved.

"The Khoisan people of the Kalahari desert in southern Africa say that long ago there were no stars and the night was pitch black. A girl, who was lonely and wanted to visit other people, threw the embers from a fire into the sky and created the Milky Way."
"A Cherokee folktale tells of a dog who stole some cornmeal and was chased away. He ran away to the north, spilling the cornmeal along the way. The Milky Way is thus called ᎩᎵ ᎤᎵᏒᏍᏓᏅᏱ (""Gili Ulisvsdanvyi"") ""Where the dog ran""."
"Peoples in Eastern Asia believed that the hazy band of stars was the ""Silvery River"" of Heaven (, and ). In one story, the stars Altair and Vega were said to be two lovers who were allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month, when a flock of magpies and crows formed a bridge over the galactic river. That day is celebrated as Qi Xi, the ""Seventh Night"" (, and )."
"In Egyptian mythology, the Milky Way was considered a pool of cow's milk. The Milky Way was deified as a fertility cow-goddess by the name of Bat (later on syncretized with the sky goddess Hathor)."
"Among the Finns, Estonians and related peoples, the Milky Way was and is called ""The Pathway of the Birds"" (, ). The Finns observed that migratory birds used the galaxy as a guideline to travel south, where they believed ""Lintukoto"" (bird home) was."
"In Estonian folklore it is believed that the birds are led by a white bird with the head of a maiden who chases birds of prey away. The maiden, the goddess Lindu, was the Queen of the Birds and the daughter of Ukko, the King of the Sky. After refusing the suits of the Sun and Moon for being too predictable in their routes and the Pole Star for being fixed, she fell in love with the Light of North for its beauty. They became engaged, but the inconstant Light of North left her soon afterward. The tears of the broken-hearted Lindu fell on her wedding veil, which became the Milky Way when her father brought her to heaven so she could reign by his side and guide the migrating birds, who followed the trail of stars in her veil. Only later did scientists indeed confirm this observation; the migratory birds use the Milky Way as a guide to travel to warmer, southern lands during the winter."
"The name in the Indo-European Baltic languages has the same meaning (, )."
"In the Babylonian epic poem ""Enûma Eliš"", the Milky Way is created from the severed tail of the primeval salt water dragoness Tiamat, set in the sky by Marduk, the Babylonian national god, after slaying her. This story was once thought to have been based on an older Sumerian version in which Tiamat is instead slain by Enlil of Nippur, but is now though to be purely an invention of Babylonian propagandists with the intention to show Marduk as superior to the Sumerian deities. Another myth about Labbu is similarly interpreted."
"The Greek name for the Milky Way (Γαλαξίας ""Galaxias"") is derived from the Greek word for milk (γάλα, ""gala""). One legend explains how the Milky Way was created by Heracles when he was a baby. His father, Zeus, was fond of his son, who was born of the mortal woman Alcmene. He decided to let the infant Heracles suckle on his divine wife Hera's milk when she was asleep, an act which would endow the baby with godlike qualities. When Hera woke and realized that she was breastfeeding an unknown infant, she pushed him away and the spurting milk became the Milky Way."
"Another version of the myth is that Heracles (Roman Hercules) was abandoned in the woods by his mortal parents, Amphitryon and Alcmene. Heracles, son of Zeus and Alcmene, was naturally favored by his father, who sent Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom, to retrieve him. Athena, not being so motherly, decided to take him to Hera to suckle. Hera agreed to suckle Heracles As Heracles drinks the milk, he bites down, and Hera pushes him away in pain. The milk that squirts out forms the Milky Way."
"A story told by the Roman Hyginus in the ""Poeticon astronomicon"" (ultimately based on Greek myth) says that the milk came from the goddess Ops (Greek Rhea), or Opis, the wife of Saturn (Greek Cronus). Saturn swallowed his children to ensure his position as head of the Pantheon and sky god, and so Ops conceived a plan to save her newborn son Jupiter (Greek Zeus): She wrapped a stone in infant's clothes and gave it to Saturn to swallow. Saturn asked her to nurse the child once more before he swallowed it, and the milk that spurted when she pressed her nipple against the rock eventually became the Milky Way."
"In the Hindu collection of stories called Bhagavata Purana, all the visible stars and planets moving through space are likened to a dolphin that swims through the water, and the heavens are called ""śiśumãra cakra"", the dolphin disc. The Milky Way forms the abdomen of the dolphin and is called ""Akasaganga"" which means ""The Ganges River of the Sky""."
"According to Hindu mythology, Vishnu lies meditating on Shesha with his consort Lakshmi, in the Kshira Sagara (Sea of Milk)."
"In Irish mythology, the main name of the Milky Way was ""Bealach na Bó Finne"" — Way of the White Cow. It was regarded as a heavenly reflection of the sacred River Boyne, which is described as ""the Great Silver Yoke"" and the ""White Marrow of Fedlimid,"" names which could equally apply to the Milky Way. (""Mór-Chuing Argait"", ""Smir Find Fedlimthi"")."

"Attara Kacheri, built in 1864 A.D during British rule, is a stone structure in an intense red hue, a two storied building with Corinthian columns in Gothic Style of architecture and is located at the entrance to the Park. The Public offices (Secretariat of the Government of Karnataka) were located here from 1868 AD to 1956 AD, which were later moved to the Vidhana Soudha, opposite to it. The building now accommodates the Karnataka High Court. In the Central Hall a portrait of Sir Mark Cubbon decorates the ceiling. An equestrian statue of Cubbon by Baron Marochetti is located at the back of the building."
"The State Archeological Museum, one of the oldest in India, built in 1876 by Colonel Sankey, located within the Park, is similar in design to the Attara Kacheri in its architectural style and hue. While the original collection in the museum belonged to Benjamin L. Rice of the Mysore Gazetteer, antiquities from Mohenjodaro period are on display in the Museum. Exhibits in the Museum include specimens of Vijaynagara and Halebid architecture, ancient coins and stone inscriptions as old as 5000 years."
"Seshadri Iyer Memorial Hall, built in 1915 in a classic European style with Tuscan and Corinthian columns, in honour of Sir K.Seshadri Iyer who was Dewan of Mysore State from 1883 to 1901, is an impressive red building with gables. It houses the Seshadri Memorial library. The memorial building is ensconced in the middle of the park, framed by the greenery of the park and fronted by the rose garden. The Library has an area of 300 km and functions as the Apex of the Karnataka Public Libraries system, which is governed by State Library Authority. In the year 2000, the Library was awarded the Raja Rammohan Roy Library Foundation Award for the best state central library in India in recognition of its outstanding contribution to meritorious services rendered in the spread of knowledge and gearing up of library movement in the city of Bengaluru in particular and in the state of Karnataka in general. The library has presently a collection of 2.65 lakh books and also a Braille section."
"The Preservation Act, 1979 passed by the Government of Karnataka to preserve the uniqueness of the park is under the provision of Karnataka Government Park (Preservation) Act, 1975, which states:"
"""Accordingly, it is directed that neither any land should be granted to nor any further constructions be permitted whether temporary or permanent by any organization or individuals in the Cubbon Park and Lalbagh areas except the constructions taken up by the Horticulture Department in furtherance of the objectives of the department."""
"The Centre for Environment Education (CEE), India, in the year 2006, embarked on a project to develop a brochure on the Park and involve the youth in several activities to help them to explore the park and through it, learn more about the wider environment. The brochure brought out as a joint effort of CEE, Department of Horticulture, AGRICULTURE PURPOSE That has been the most unique in the whole world that been a impressive area or the garden in the world"
"After being largely ignored since Indian Independence in 1947, a large number of people have slowly started to acknowledge the pioneering work done by Mark Cubbon and other British administrators. On 23 August 2013, the statue of Mark Cubbon was garlanded for the first time since 1947, by Advocate S Umesh of the Cubbon Park Walkers’ Association. The occasion was to mark the 238th birth anniversary of Sir Mark Cubbon. Special permission was obtained from the Karnataka High Court, and Police protection was provided. The group credited Mark for being one of the chief architects of Bengaluru and Mysuru. The move was however opposed by Vatal Nagaraj, infamous for vandalizing the Cenotaph Memorial near the Hudson Memorial Church. However, the association defended their move of honoring Mark Cubbon, as his contribution to Bengaluru was undeniable. Cubbon Park was renamed as Sri Chamarajendra Park way back in 1927, but the name was never popular, and people continued to call it Cubbon Park. Further, according to historians, it would be foolish to erase history, by trying to remove all symbols of British rule, and mere symbolism cannot lead to development."

"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, the ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

= = = Modibo Adama = = =
"Adama ɓii Ardo Hassana (1786 – 1847), more commonly known as Modibbo Adama, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior, who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fombina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adama's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in Northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region."
"Adama studied in Hausaland and earned the title ""Modibbo"" (""Lettered One"") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adama to extend his jihad east as ""Lamido Fombina"" (Ruler of the Southlands)."
"Adama raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town."
"Though he fought many more campaigns, Adama now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adama ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as lamibe (singular: lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government."
"Upon Adama's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of Southern Cameroon."
"Adama came from a respected but humble family; his father, Hassana, was a well regarded scholar of Islam and minor nobleman from Ba'ajo. Adama travelled to Bornu for his education, where he stayed for some time under the tutelage of Mallam Kiari. He continued his studies in Hausaland (modern Northern Nigeria), where legend says his teacher was the Fulani Shehu Usman dan Fodio in Degel. Adama proved a bright scholar and a pious Muslim, and he earned the title ""Modibo"", ""Lettered One"". After several years away, he returned home to Guringa around 1804. There, the news was grim. Adama's father had died in 1803 fighting the Bata."
Talk in Gurina also concerned events in Hausaland. Word had arrived that Usman dan Fodio had declared a militant jihad on the Hausa leaders. He had installed himself at Gudu and subsequently defeated non-Fulani leaders at Gobir and Kébbi. Usman had now turned his attention to Bornu and to the vast southlands of Fumbina (modern-day Northern Cameroon).
"Still, the picture seemed unclear to leaders farther from the fighting. Was Usman a ""Mujaddid"" (reformer), or was he the ""Mahdi"", a saviour figure who would create an ideal Muslim society? In 1805 or 1806, the Fulani leaders at Guringa assembled a delegation to visit Usman and find out. Adama's pious reputation and familiarity with Hausaland made him a natural fit for the mission."
"The party met Usman in 1806, probably in Gwandu. There, they learned that his intention was to extend his jihad eastward, into Fumbina. The goal was ostensibly to convert various Kirdi (pagan) peoples to Islam and to protect Muslims who already lived in the area. The jihadists were also supposed to educate the region's current Muslim population, many of whom merged Islam with paganism."
"Though not the oldest member, Adama was one of the more zealous about Usman's ideas. Usman thus presented him with a command that would change his life dramatically. The Shehu gave Adama his blessing and presented him with a flag, the symbol of command in Usman's army. The Shehu then charged Adama to carry the jihad into Fumbina and from the Nile to the Bight of Biafra. Adama also received the power to distribute flags of command to others, thus establishing more centres of Fulani Islam and spreading the war to farther reaches."
"Adama immediately began recruiting Fulani and Hausa volunteers and mercenaries. These were mainly mounted cavalrymen fighting with sword, bow, and poisoned arrow. Adama forbade them to pillage or to kill indiscriminately, but enemy nations were given two choices: convert to Islam or become a tributary state. Those ethnic groups that lacked a centralised government had but one: become slaves to the Fulani and convert to their faith."
"The non-Fulani Muslims of the Adamawa largely rejected Adama's jihad; they viewed it as little more than an excuse to spread Fulani hegemony. However, it was primarily the Fulani leaders (""ardo'en"", singular: ""ardo"") of Fumbina with whom Adama was concerned. Some of them rejected his primacy for various reasons: He was from a fairly humble background, he owned little wealth, his army was still small, and he lacked charisma. The majority, however, welcomed Adama as a military commander or religious leader at the very least. Adama's son-in-law, Jauro Dembo, had already settled in Fumbina at Malabu and became one of his lieutenants."
"The makeshift army made headquarters at Gurin, a fort at the junction of the Faro and Benue Rivers where Fulani warriors had regrouped after fighting the Bata in 1803. Adama then led his forces in a series of strikes on Bata settlements such as Pema, Tepa, and Turuwa. The victories elated Adama's men, who took numerous Bata slaves."
"The early successes convinced more local Fulani leaders to come to Adama's side. Even those ardo'en who opposed his political rule recognised the jihad as an opportunity to expand their territories. Njobdi of the Wollarbe clan is one notable example, and his major rival, Hammam Sambo, perhaps the first ardo to have settled in Fumbina, proved the major holdout. Bitter relations between Njobdi and Hammam would prove a major obstacle in Adama's quest to maintain a cohesive empire."
"He has played important roles in some of Marvel's major storylines, such as """" (1992), ""Maximum Security"" (2001), and ""War of Kings"" (2009). During the ""Heroes Reborn"" era (1997), he starred in the three-issue ""Imperial Guard"" miniseries."

"Kallark is a member of the Strontian race, and was born under Shi'ar rule. All Strontians are born with the capacity for great strength and various superpowers, but can only use them when they are completely devoted to a purpose. Fearing a Strontian rebellion, the Shi'ar emperor ordered Kallark, among other Strontians, to kill the Strontian elders. Only Kallark was devoted enough to carry out the order, and the others were killed when their wavering commitment rendered them weak. As a reward for his actions, Kallark was named the Praetor (leader) of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard."
"When the X-Men come into conflict with the Shi'ar empire regarding the Phoenix entity, Gladiator battles them first at the command of Emperor D'Ken, and then at the behest of his successor, Empress Lilandra Neramani.

"Queen Charlotte Sound was named by James Strange on August 5, 1786, in honour of Queen Charlotte, the consort of King George III. Strange was the leader of a fur trading expedition of two vessels, the ""Captain Cook"", under Captain Henry Lawrie, and the ""Experiment"", under Captain John Guise. During a boat excursion up Goletas Channel, Strange saw an opening ahead and named it Queen Charlotte Sound. The body of water he named was what is today known as Queen Charlotte Strait. For some time Queen Charlotte Strait was also called Queen Charlotte Sound, until 1920 when the BCGNIS and Hydrographic Service distinguished between Queen Charlotte Sound and Queen Charlotte Strait. George Vancouver, who used the name in his maps and writings, wrote that the sound was named by Mr. S. Wedgeborough, in command of the ""Experiment"" under James Strange, but this is probably a mistake."
"The strait lies between the Mainland and Vancouver Island portions of the Mount Waddington Regional District, a form of regional municipal governance with power over zoning, building and sewer permits and inter-municipal integration. Most communities in the region, however, are Indian reserve communities of the Kwakwaka'wakw peoples which are outside the jurisdiction of regional district governance.

= = = Richmond River cod = = =
"The Richmond River cod was a form of ""Maccullochella"" cod, now believed to have been eastern freshwater cod, ""Maccullochella ikei"", that occurred naturally in the Richmond River system, an east coast river system in north-east New South Wales, Australia."
"Eastern freshwater cod in turn are a species of ""Maccullochella"" cod found in east coast drainages and originating from Murray cod, ""Maccullochella peelii"", that crossed the Great Dividing Range and entered east coast drainages from a river capture event between 0.62 and 1.62 million years ago (mean estimate 1.1 million years ago)."
"Richmond River cod are extinct, from overfishing, habitat destruction including gross siltation, and whole-of-catchment scale bushfires and fish kills in the 1930s."
"The Richmond River system has now been restocked with small numbers of eastern freshwater cod from the Clarence River system, but these appear to have been insufficient to re-establish populations; there is no evidence of these stocked fish reproducing as yet."
= = = Delta Force: Black Hawk Down = = =
"Delta Force: Black Hawk Down is a first-person shooter video game developed by NovaLogic. It was released for Microsoft Windows on March 23, 2003; for Mac OS X in July 2004; and for PlayStation 2 and Xbox on July 26, 2005. It is the 6th game of the ""Delta Force"" series. It is set in the early 1990s during the Unified Task Force peacekeeping operation in Somalia. The missions take place primarily in the southern Jubba Valley and the capital Mogadishu. The game also features a mission editor with which players can make custom missions."
"The gameplay in ""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" differs heavily from earlier installments in the series. While all earlier ""Delta Force"" games focus on long distance outdoor combat and have open ended mission design, ""Black Hawk Down"" focuses on close quarters combat in urban environments with heavily scripted missions more similar to the then-recent . Many of the series' trademark features, such as bullet ballistics and later weapon sway, were abandoned in favour of simpler action-focused gameplay. The player is usually accompanied by a squad of three AI-controlled soldiers, whom the player is able to give simple commands such as the order to hold fire, hold position or throw a grenade."
"Like in earlier ""Delta Force"" games the campaign in ""Black Hawk Down"" is divided into distinct missions. While the campaign is linear, most of the time three missions are available at the same time, allowing the player to complete them in any order. Completing a mission saves the campaign progress and usually unlocks a new one. Already completed missions can be accessed from an ""instant action"" list."
"In addition to the singleplayer campaign, ""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" features LAN and online multiplayer with support for up to 50 players in a single match, breaking the record for the largest console multiplayer battles at the time."
"The online multiplayer is powered by NovaWorld which tracks players' statistics, gives them increasing ranks and has a matchmaking system. Various gameplay modes are available including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and King of the Hill as well as objective-based ones. Like in the previous two ""Delta Force"" games players can choose one out of several character classes with individual characteristics."
"The player begins the game as a soldier with Task Force Ranger, commanding 3 team members: Huck, Mother, and Preacher. They take part in the Unified Task Force peacekeeping operation during the Somali Civil War. Following the third mission, the player assumes the role of the same soldier. He/she is assigned to 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, taking part in Operation Gothic Serpent, a military operation conducted during the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. During the latter section of the game, the player will still play as that soldier, but is now sent to the 3rd Ranger Battalion and the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, commonly known as Delta Force."
The final mission features an alternate history in which the player and a team of operators carry out the assassination of Mohammad Farrah Aidid.
"""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" uses an engine based on ""Comanche 4"" which allows for more detail and advanced visual effects thanks to shader support. Also vehicle movement is not restricted to specific pre-defined paths anymore and the AI drivers are able to avoid obstacles. It is the first engine used by the series to support platforms other than PC."
"In 2004 an expansion pack titled """" was released for the PC and PlayStation 2 versions of the game, adding two campaigns which take place in Colombia and Iran respectively."
"""Black Hawk Down""s computer version received a ""Silver"" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom."
"St. Raymond Academy for Girls began as a small, parish-based high school with an enrollment of 95 students. Msgr. John Corrigan, the pastor at the time, appointed Sr. Regina Angela, a Sister of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of New York, as the first principal. The school occupied the third floor of the school building built in 1952 and through the years has prided itself on serving a relatively small school population. In order to better meet its educational goals, the school was recognized with a NYS Board of Regents Charter in 1965 and with an additional accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 2003, which was recently renewed."
"The Sisters of Charity were joined through the years by the Sisters of St. Dominic Blauvelt and Sparkill, the Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of the Holy Child, and lay women and men."
"The school's program of studies is primarily college-oriented, with business, computer and science electives included in upper years. In addition to preparing students for a New York State Regents Diploma with four-year programs in English, Social Studies, Mathematics, Spanish and Science, the school also offers Advanced Placement courses in English Literature and Composition, United States History and Government, and Spanish Literature and Language."

"The ""Isku"" class motor torpedo boat () was a Thornycroft type motor torpedo boat of the Finnish Navy. The vessel was constructed in 1926 by the ""Borgå varv"", in Porvoo, Finland, and she saw service in World War II. ""Isku"" differed from the original Thornycraft design through its torpedo launching method (they were released from the sides of the hull, in contrast to dropping them from the aft). However, she was not a successful design and she only participated in the Winter War and during the first months of the Continuation War. She was stricken from the navy lists in 1942, due to extensive wear damage on the hull. She was moored at Suomenlinna and was scrapped after the war."
= = = Entheogenic drugs and the archaeological record = = =
Entheogenic drugs have been used by various groups for thousands of years. There are numerous
"historical reports as well as modern, contemporary reports of indigenous groups using entheogens, chemical substances used in a religious, shamanic, or spiritual context."
"A Finnish study assayed psilocybin concentrations in old herbarium specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old."
"The Maya, Olmecs, and Aztecs have well-documented entheogenic complexes. North American cultures also have a tradition of entheogens. In South America, especially in Peru, the archaeological study of cultures like Chavin, Cupisnique, Nasca and Moche, have demonstrated the use of entheogens through archaeobotanical, iconographic and paraphernalia."
"The Olmec (1200 BCE to 400 BCE) lived in Central America and are largely viewed by many as the mother culture of Aztecs and Maya. The Olmecs left no written works on their belief structures, so many interpretations on Olmec beliefs are largely based on interpretations of murals and artifacts. Archaeologists state three reasons for believing that the Olmecs used entheogens:"
"The Maya (250 BCE to 900 CE) flourished in Central America and were prevalent even until the arrival of the Spanish. The Maya religious tradition was complex and well-developed. Unlike the Olmec, the Maya had religious texts that survived to this day. The Maya religion displayed characteristic Mesoamerican mythology, with a strong emphasis on an individual being a communicator between the physical world and the spiritual world. Mushroom stone effigies, dated to 1000 BCE, give evidence that mushrooms were at least revered in a religious way."
"The late Maya archaeologist, Dr Stephan F. de Borhegyi, published the first of several articles in which he proposed the existence of a Mesoamerican mushroom cult in the Guatemalan highlands as early as 1000 B.C This cult, which was associated from its beginnings with ritual human decapitation, a trophy head cult, warfare and the Mesoamerican ballgame, appears to have had its origins along the Pacific coastal piedmont. Borhegyi developed this proposition after finding a significant number of small, mushroom-shaped sculptures in the collections of the Guatemala National Museum and in numerous private collections in and around Guatemala City. While the majority of these small stone sculptures were of indeterminate provenance, a sufficient number had been found during the course of archaeological investigations as to permit him to determine approximate dates and to catalog them stylistically (Borhegyi de, S.F., 1957b, ""Mushroom Stones of Middle America,"" in Mushrooms, Russia and History by Valentina P. Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson, eds. N.T.)"
Quoting archaeologist Stephan F. de Borhegyi:
"""My assignment for the so-called mushroom cult, earliest 1,000 B.C., is based on the excavations of Kidder and Shook at the Verbena cemetery at Kaminaljuyu. The mushroom stone found in this Pre-Classic grave, discovered in Mound E-III-3, has a circular groove on the cap. There are also a number of yet unpublished mushroom stone specimens in the Guatemalan Museum from Highland Guatemala where the pottery association would indicate that they are Pre-Classic. In each case the mushroom stone fragments has a circular groove on the top. Mushroom stones found during the Classic and Post-Classic periods do not have circular grooves. This was the basis on which I prepared the chart on mushroom stones which was then subsequently published by the Wassons. Based on Carbon 14 dates and stratigraphy, some of these Pre-Classic finds can be dated as early as 1,000 B.C. The reference is in the following""...(see Shook, E.M. & Kidder, A.V., 1952. Mound E-III-3, Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala; Contributions to American Anthropology & History No. 53 from Publ. 596, Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. (letter from de Borhegyi to Dr. Robert Ravicz, MPM archives December 1st 1960 )"
The most direct evidence of Maya entheogen use comes from modern descendants of the Maya who use entheogenic drugs today.
"The Aztec entheogenic complex is extremely well documented. Through historical evidence, there is proof that the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs. These drugs include Ololiuqui (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Teonanácatl (translated as “mushroom of the gods,"" a psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The Xochipilli statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogenic use of the Aztecs comes from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the Aztec culture and society, including the use of entheogenic drugs."
"There are several contemporary indigenous groups who use entheogens, most notably Native Americans of the southwest United States. Various tribes from California have been known to use strong alcoholic drinks as well as peyote to achieve visions and religious experiences."
"During the Paleolithic, there is ample evidence of drug use as seen by preserved botanical remains and coprolites. Some scholars had suggested that the ""Flower Burial"" in Shanidar Cave, a Paleolithic site in Iraq, was evidence of a shamanic death ritual, but more recent evidence and analysis has contradicted that claim. The most direct evidence we have from the Paleolithic in terms of art comes from Tassili, Algeria cave paintings depicting ""Psilocybe mairei"" mushrooms dated 7000 to 9000 years before present. From this region, there are several therianthropic images portraying the painter and the animals around him as one (an often cited effect of many psychedelic drugs, Ego death or unity). One image, in particular, shows a man who has formed into one common form with a mushroom."
"There are several Paleolithic sites that display therianthropic imagery. However, there is some debate as to whether or not sites like Lascaux or Chauvet were entheogenically inspired."
"A cave painting in Spain has been interpreted as depicting ""Psilocybe hispanica""."
= = = Santa Anita Golf Course = = =
"The Santa Anita Golf Course, located in the city of Arcadia, California, was operated by Santa Anita Associates for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation from 1986-2016. New operators will take over beginning September 2016."
"The upon which the golf course was built has always been devoted to recreation in some form or another. The original architect was James Harrison Smith. Originally part of the ""Lucky"" Baldwin Ranch, Santa Anita's history dates back to the days when its broad oaks sheltered places where Indians camped. Across its broad acres traveled Mission Fathers from San Gabriel on their way up Little Santa Anita Canyon for lumber needed to build the Mission."
"From 1907 through 1909 horse racing was a feature on Lucky Baldwin's famed track. The clubhouse turn was right where No. 16 is now and when you're on the hill on the backside of No. 14, that's the turn where the horses turned for home."
"During World War I, Ross Field, Named after Lt. Cleo J. Ross of the U.S. Army Air Service, housed a United States Army balloon school. Ross was an observer with the 8th Balloon Company and was killed in action in France on September 26, 1918, the only U.S. Army balloonist to die in combat. The balloon school closed in the spring on 1919."
= = = Dot book = = =
"A dot book (also dotbook or dot-book or drill book) is a small notebook utilized by marching bands (especially high school show bands and drum corps) in order to aid the learning of formations on a field. The dot book was invented by Leslie Allard, a prominent high school band instructor and all-star percussionist. The name is derived from the use of dots on drill sheets which symbolize players on the field: a dot book focuses on the owner's particular dots and other marchers the player may have to guide (use to determine an adjusted location)."
"The general layout of a dot book contains the ""longitudes"" and ""latitudes"" of an American football field. However, a cartesian coordinate system (x/y) is rarely used, rather an alternative system of plotting players as dots on a grid and some jargon is used. For instance, a player may write: ""3 inside 45R and 5 in front BH."" This would mean that the player is 3 steps inside (towards the 50 yard line) from the 45th yard line from the right side (facing the press box) and is five steps in front of the back hash (see Field and players of American football for an explanation of terms)."
"Many times, however, a person's own dot book will contain their own specialized shorthand to represent their location on the field. Dot books can vary from simple (providing only the location of the marcher) to complex (also providing the location of nearby marchers whom you are guiding). This poses problems when players are switched between positions on the field: switching dot books is often difficult and many times players end up rewriting their dot books."
"Dot books are considered essential by many high school band instructors to the progress of drill. Severe penalties can be incurred for forgetting or losing one's dot book. Dot books also become irreplaceable as a season moves on: whenever drill is changed or a visual is added, the dot book becomes the sole record of this change. Loss of a dot book can result in the need for the band to readjust something that had been handled several months prior."
"This is a sample page of a pack of drill sheets. The owner of this page is AS10, and their dot on the field has been circled accordingly. After looking at this page, AS10 wrote in their page on the dot book at the top of this article. Several notable features:"
"An alternative to the dot book is the coordinate sheet. Like dot books, coordinate sheets are small and meant to be worn around the neck on a lanyard. Coordinate sheets are set up as a list of the member's places on the field, given in coordinates (such as 5 steps inside the right 45 yard line and 2.25 steps in front of the Home hash), each ""set"" numbered. Also on the sheet is the number of steps it takes to go from one set to another, but this isn't written plainly. Set 1 always has a ""0"" by it. If it should take sixteen counts to move to the next set, a ""16"" will be placed next to Set 2's coordinates. If it should take eight counts to move to the third set, a ""24"" is next to Set 3's coordinates."
= = = Paul DePodesta = = =
"Paul DePodesta (born December 16, 1972) is an American football executive and former baseball executive who is the chief strategy officer for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as a front-office assistant for the Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, and New York Mets. DePodesta was also general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The year after leading the Dodgers to their first playoff win in 16 years, he was fired after the 2005 club finished with its worst record in 11 years. He was the ninth general manager in the club's history since its move to Los Angeles. He is also known for his appearance in the book and movie ""Moneyball"" about his time with the Athletics."
"DePodesta is a native of Alexandria, Virginia, where he grew up with Thad Levine. He attended Episcopal High School ('91) and then Harvard University, where he played baseball and football and graduated in 1995 with a degree in economics. He has worked for the Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League and the Baltimore Bandits of the American Hockey League."
"In 1996, DePodesta got his first baseball job with the Cleveland Indians, where he spent three seasons. He served as an advance scout for two years and in his final month with the club was appointed special assistant to general manager John Hart."
"In 1999, he joined the Oakland Athletics organization as an assistant to general manager Billy Beane. DePodesta was a key figure in Michael Lewis's book ""Moneyball"". The book thrust the analytical principles of sabermetrics into the mainstream."
"At the age of 31, DePodesta was named general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers on February 16, 2004, making him the fifth-youngest general manager in baseball history, behind Jon Daniels (28) of the Texas Rangers, Theo Epstein (28) of the Boston Red Sox, Andrew Friedman (28) of the Tampa Bay Rays, and Randy Smith (29) of the San Diego Padres."
"DePodesta's reliance on sabermetric principles has been somewhat controversial. He is often considered part of a new breed of front-office executives whose personnel decisions depend heavily on analysis of performance data, often at the perceived expense of more traditional methods of scouting and observation."
"One of DePodesta's most notable moves was made at the 2004 trading deadline. He traded catcher Paul Lo Duca, relief pitcher Guillermo Mota and outfielder Juan Encarnación to the Florida Marlins in exchange for pitcher Brad Penny, first baseman Hee Seop Choi and pitcher Bill Murphy, in what was reportedly an attempt to pick up pieces to acquire pitcher Randy Johnson from the Arizona Diamondbacks. DePodesta was heavily criticized in the local and national baseball media for this trade, because Lo Duca was thought to be the ""heart and soul"" of the team. The Dodgers made the playoffs anyway, with Penny developing into one of the better pitchers in the National League during his stint with the Dodgers, which lasted until the end of the 2008 season. Choi, however, was a disappointment, batting just .161 in 2004 and .253 in 2005, and striking out 80 times in 320 at bats. Bill Murphy was traded that year to acquire Steve Finley, who hit 13 homers in 58 games, including a memorable grand slam that clinched the division title. Lo Duca played through 2005 with the Marlins and then went to the New York Mets, the Washington Nationals and back to the Marlins, making his final Major League appearance in September 2008."
"During the 2004 off-season, Adrián Beltré, who had hit 48 home runs in 2004, signed with Seattle as a free agent, spurning DePodesta's offer of 3 years for $30 million for Seattle's offer of 5 years for $64 million. DePodesta signed J. D. Drew, Jeff Kent, and Derek Lowe. Drew enjoyed two productive seasons as a Dodger and then used an opt-out clause in his contract to sign a new 5-year deal with the Boston Red Sox. Both Kent and Lowe put in four productive seasons for the Dodgers and cut ties with the franchise at the end of the 2008 season with Kent retiring and Lowe signing a contract with the Atlanta Braves."
"Coming off the successes of 2004, the 2005 season saw the Dodgers lose a number of players to significant stints on the disabled list. Many of the players lost to injury were expected to produce heavily for the team, including J. D. Drew, Milton Bradley, Éric Gagné, Jayson Werth, César Izturis and Odalis Pérez. The 2005 season resulted in the team's worst record since 1992 and second worst since moving to Los Angeles in 1958. On October 29, 2005, Dodgers owner Frank McCourt fired DePodesta, citing his desire to see the club win and that DePodesta had not met those expectations. Reports surfaced that the real reason McCourt had fired DePodesta was his inability to find satisfactory managerial candidates to replace Jim Tracy. He was later replaced by Ned Colletti, who hired Grady Little as manager. Some have speculated that McCourt fired DePodesta in response to media criticism from ""Los Angeles Times"" sports columnists T.J. Simers and Bill Plaschke, who were vehemently ""anti-Moneyball"" and referred to DePodesta pejoratively as ""Google Boy."""
"On June 30, 2006, DePodesta was hired as the Special Assistant for Baseball Operations for the San Diego Padres and was promoted to Executive Vice President on November 10, 2008."
"On November 8, 2010, DePodesta was hired as the vice president of player development and scouting for the New York Mets by general manager Sandy Alderson, with whom DePodesta worked when Alderson was CEO of the Padres."
"On January 5, 2016, DePodesta was hired by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) as their chief strategy officer."
"In 2003, author Michael Lewis was interested in how Oakland Athletics general manager (GM) Billy Beane tried to find quality players to improve the team while struggling with one of the smallest payrolls in Major League Baseball. He first wanted to write an article on the subject, but the idea eventually blossomed into a book named """". Lewis's interests included how Beane hired DePodesta as his assistant to incorporate sabermetrics, an approach that consists of more sophisticated analyses of baseball statistics, which is at least partially credited for their 2002 20-game winning streak which set an American League record."
"Lewis's book examines the lives and careers of various baseball personalities and explains the art of sabermetrics. Bill James, who coined the term sabermetrics for the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), is also a major focus. James published ""The Bill James Baseball Abstract"" from 1977 to 1988 and wrote several sabermetrics books. Beane and DePodesta had studied James's work and were inspired by his knowledge of baseball analysis."
"DePodesta did not feel comfortable in the spotlight after the book's release, nor did he care for the secrets revealed about his scouting methods. The book earned DePodesta a reputation as a cold calculator, choosing players based only on their numbers. In addition, he was thought of as a guy who knew nothing of ""real baseball."""
"In reality, DePodesta played football in college and wanted to be a football coach, seen in a photo wearing number 17. After graduating from Harvard with a degree in economics, he became an intern for the Canadian Football League's Baltimore Stallions in 1995. In early 1996, he got his first baseball job with the Cleveland Indians, where he worked as a scout. In October 1996, at age 24, he was promoted to the position of advance scout. In October 1998, he became assistant to the General Manager for the team. Those experiences led to him being hired by Beane as his assistant with the Oakland A's in November 1998."
"When the movie ""Moneyball"" was adapted from the book, DePodesta did not approve of the way his character was portrayed. ""There were a handful of things. Some were factual, others were more ephemeral."" He had no objection to Jonah Hill's performance. ""Jonah was awesome. He was so respectful of me and my time. It would have been flattering to be portrayed by someone of his expertise. It had nothing to do with the casting,"" DePodesta said in 2010. ""I just could never get comfortable with the idea of somebody else portraying me to the rest of the world. Like any movie, to make it interesting, there has to be some conflict there. In some respects, a lot of the conflict is going to revolve around my character, and that was never really the case in reality,"" he said in 2011. He also talked about the caricatural focus it brought on him, first in 2003 and again in 2011. ""The other problem was I wasn't all that interested in the attention. It had already happened from the book. And I didn't necessarily need to relive it."""
"The role was originally going to be given DePodesta's name and portrayed by Demetri Martin, but DePodesta did not want his name or likeness to be used in the movie, so the character was named Peter Brand. Brand is a composite of Beane's assistants in Oakland, not an accurate representation of any specific person. But ""Moneyball""s director, Bennett Miller, has credited DePodesta for being generous and helpful in the making of the film. Hill was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance."
"DePodesta is married to artist and philanthropist Karen Deicas and has three sons and a daughter. In 2016, Deicas launched the Sports Mind Institute, which seeks to connect lessons learned from figures in professional sports, athletes, team executives, and coaches, to help others apply them to life and the business sector. The family resides in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California."
"On December 13, 2012, DePodesta was elected to the Board of Directors of Sears Holdings Corporation. He has also served as a keynote speaker at numerous business conventions and been recognized by several publications, including ""Baseball Prospectus"" and ""Fortune Magazine"", which named him one of the Top 10 innovators under the age of 40."

= = = Manchester Square = = =
"Manchester Square is an 18th-century garden square in Marylebone, London. Centred north of Oxford Street it measures internally north-to-south, and across. It is a small Georgian predominantly 1770s-designed instance in central London; construction began around 1776. The north side has a central mansion, Hertford House, flanked by approach ways; its first name was Manchester House — its use is since 1897 as the Wallace Collection (gallery/museum) of fine and decorative arts sits alongside the Madame Tussauds museum and Wigmore Hall concert rooms as single-greatest tourist attractions of Marylebone. The square forms part of west Marylebone, most of which sees minor but overarching property interests held by one owner (through lease reversions managed as the Portman Estate) among which many buildings have been recognised by statutory protection (as listed buildings)."
Among residents figured:
"This six-house long approach fronts the east side of Hertford House (or its small public front lawn with steps, benches and paths). The first five buildings of Spanish Place are those listed, in the mainstream, initial category of Grade II. They were built c.1780-90, associated with the Duke of Manchester's development of the square, on Portman land. Their materials are brown brick, recessed slate roofs above five varying-prominence storeys with 3-window wide fronts. They have semicircular arched doorways to right; panelled doors with sidelights and fanlights; one a stuccoed Doric porch. Their windows are recessed sashes, in stuccoed reveals, under flat gauged arches. Reaching out below the first floor is a stucco plat band, painted stone or stucco cornice over the next, then a stucco cornice and blocking course marking the attic storey. Original, cast iron, geometric patterned balconies adorn the first floor. Cast iron area railings with urn finials enclose the front. №3 has a blue plaque as the home of Captain Marryat and George Grossmith."
"In 1814 and 1815 the square was the chosen setting for cheaper newspapers and, above all, their inner page articles to perpetuate a fresh round of the urban myth of a pig-faced woman."
"The cover photograph for ""Please Please Me"", the first LP by The Beatles, was taken by Angus McBean in 1963. It showed the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI House here, EMI's London headquarters (now demolished). A repeat photo was taken in 1969 for the cover of their then-intended ""Get Back"" album; it was not used when the project saw release as ""Let It Be"", but was eventually used on the retrospective albums ""1962–1966"" and ""1967–1970""."
"In the early 20th century, the chemical company ICI moved into a new headquarters in the north-west corner of the square, which was designed in a modern style with classical elements. Around the rest of the square stand tall brick Georgian terraced houses, many of which are inside converted to offices."

"The BBC National Programme was a UK radio broadcasting service which was on the air from 9 March 1930 – when it replaced the earlier BBC radio station 5XX – until 1 September 1939, when it was subsumed into the BBC Home Service, two days before the outbreak of World War II."
"When the British Broadcasting Company (later to be nationalized as the British Broadcasting Corporation) began transmissions on 14 November 1922, the technology for both national coverage and joint programming between transmitters did not exist – transmitter powers were generally in the region of 1 kilowatt (kW)."
"From 9 July 1924, however, the company began experimenting with higher power longwave transmissions from the Marconi company's site near Chelmsford in Essex, using the call sign 5XX. The experiments proved successful and on 27 July 1925 the Chelmsford longwave transmitter was relocated to a more central site at Borough Hill near Daventry in Northamptonshire. This provided a ""national service"" of programmes originating in London, although it remained somewhat experimental and was supplementary to the BBC's locally based services, including its main London station, 2LO."
"Initially the national programme was transmitted on 187.5 kHz longwave but this was later changed, with the opening in 1934 of a new high-power longwave transmitter site at Droitwich, to 200 kHz, which was to remain the BBC's longwave frequency until 1978, when it was moved slightly to 198 kHz. Mediumwave transmitters were used to augment coverage."
"On 21 August 1927, the BBC opened a high power mediumwave transmitter at the Daventry 5GB site, to replace the existing local stations in the English Midlands. That allowed the experimental longwave transmitter 5XX to provide a service programmed from London for the majority of the population. This came to be called the BBC National Programme."
"By combining the resources of the local stations into one regional station in each area, with a basic sustaining service from London, the BBC hoped to increase programme quality whilst also centralising the management of the radio service. This was known as ""The Regional Scheme"", and eventually resulted in the gradual extension throughout the 1930s of a separate BBC Regional Programme."
"The local stations were gradually either converted to regional relays or closed entirely and replaced by high-power Regional Programme transmitters. Some local studios were retained to provide for programming from specific areas within each region. Most transmitters also carried the BBC National Programme on a local frequency to supplement the longwave broadcasts from 5XX, initially these were on three separate frequencies in order to minimise interference, but by 1939, as the Regional Programme network expanded, the National Programme's three remaining mediumwave transmitters – at Brookmans Park (for London and the South East), Moorside Edge (for The North), and Westerglen (for Central Scotland) – were all using 1149 kHz."
"The National Programme's broadcasting hours were from 10.15am until Midnight Mondays to Saturdays, with Sundays commencing broadcasting at 3.00pm, however by the mid 1930s broadcasting on a Sunday was extended to commence at around 10.30am."
"BBC News on the National Programme would not air until at least 6.00pm each day. This was in agreement with the newspapers, so to ensure people would buy a morning newspaper. The national programme did not have a dedicated news department until 1934, and only then was it used to edit and broadcast news material from other wire agencies in the country and around the world. The start of the second world war in September 1939 would see the start of a proper news service on the new BBC Home Service with morning news bulletins commencing at 7.00am each day."
"Upon the outbreak of World War II, the BBC closed the Regional and National Programmes and replaced them with a single channel known as the BBC Home Service. The main transmitter network was synchronized between just two groups, using 668 and 767 kHz, each of which could be turned off during air raids to prevent its signals being used as navigational beacons (with listeners required to retune in such an event to a low-powered single-frequency network on 1474 kHz)."
"On 29 July 1945, within 12 weeks of VE Day, the BBC reactivated the Regional Programme, but retained the name ""BBC Home Service"". On the same date, the BBC Light Programme was launched, taking over the style and much of the function, as an entertainment channel, of the BBC Forces Programme (which had begun broadcasting in 1940), as well as the Droitwich 200 kHz longwave frequency which had been used by the pre-war National Programme."
"Both the National Programme and the Regional Programme provided a mixed mainstream radio service. Whilst the two services provided different programming, allowing listeners a choice, they were not streamed to appeal to different audiences, rather, they were intended to offer a choice of programming to a single audience. While using the same transmitters, the National Programme broadcast significantly more speech and classical music than its successor, the Light Programme. Similarly, the Regional Programme broadcast much more light music than its successor, the Home Service."

= = = Hypoblast = = =
The hypoblast is a tissue type that forms from the inner cell mass. It lies beneath the epiblast and consists of small cuboidal cells.
"Extraembryonic endoderm (including Yolk sac) is derived from hypoblast cells. The absence of hypoblast results in multiple primitive streaks in chicken embryos. The formation of the primitive streak, through which gastrulation occurs, is induced by Koller's sickle."
"In mouse embryo, the visceral endoderm develop from the primitive endoderm of the blastocyst during the implantation stage covering the epiblast cells and elongates to become an egg cylinder. A distinct morphological domain has been identified by Martin and colleagues, at the distal tip of the mouse egg cylinder, thus this domain was called distal visceral domain (DVE). The DVE cells will move unilaterally to the future anterior until reaching the embryonic/ extra embryonic boundary and at this point, the DVE cells are also named as anterior visceral endoderm (AVE). This migration has been proved to be essential for establishing anteroposterior axis. Besides the AVE, another cell population appears to be separated at the posterior edge of the embryonic egg cylinder, referred to as posterior visceral endoderm (PVE). However, the function of this cell population was not as well studied as AVE."
"Although the hypoblast does not contribute to the embryo, it has great influences on the orientation of the embryonic axis. For example, the AVE in hypoblast plays an important role in positioning the primitive streak at the midland of the amniote embryos. In chick, people had observed that removal of the hypoblast caused multiple, ectopic primitive streaks formation. Similarly, in mice embryo, the AVE expresses secreted molecules, including two antagonists of nodal signaling, Cerberus-like (Cerl) and a TGFβ superfamily molecule, Lefty1. It was shown that Cerberus−/−;Lefty1−/− compound mutants mice developed a primitive streak ectopically in the embryo. There is also finding suggested that the hypoblast also inhibit primitive streak formation by depositing extracellular matrix components to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Besides the role of positioning the site of gastrulation, AVE also showed other function including continued protection against caudalization of the early nervous system. Also primitive endoderm derived yolk sac has major function in guaranteeing the proper organogenesis of the fetus and efficient exchange of nutrients, gases and wastes."
"In mammals, the existence of primitive endoderm had been observed as early as the end of the 19th century as first recognized by Duval and Sobotta. However, it took long time before people realized that the primitive endoderm will be replaced by definitive endoderm which will further develop into the gut tube. The first convincing experiment was conducted by Bellairs in chick embryo with the careful observation under electron and light microscopy. In his experiment, Bellairs demonstrated that there is a transitory endoderm cell layer in the chick embryo at its ventral surface before the formation of primitive streak. This layer of cell was replaced by definitive endoderm migration from the primitive streak through ingression and de-epithelialization. Later on, more insights on primitive endoderm and definitive endoderm origin and formation have been provided in different species including rat and mouse, rhesus monkey, baboon et al."
"Offit grew up in Baltimore, the son of a shirtmaker. He went to his father's sales meetings and reacted negatively to the tall tales told by salespeople, instead preferring the clean and straightforward practice of science. When he was five years old, he was sent to a polio ward to recover from clubfoot surgery; this experience caused him to see children as vulnerable and helpless, and motivated him through the 25 years of the development of the rotavirus vaccine."
"Offit decided to become a doctor, the first in his family. Offit earned his bachelor's degree from Tufts University and his M.D. from the University of Maryland, Baltimore. One of his mentors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was Maurice Hilleman, who developed several of the major vaccines in use today."
"By 2008 Offit had become a leading advocate of childhood immunizations. He was opposed by vaccine critics, many of whom believe vaccines cause autism, a belief that has been rejected by major medical journals and professional societies. He received a death threat and received protection by an armed guard during meetings at the CDC. His 2008 book ""Autism's False Prophets"" catalyzed a backlash against the antivaccine movement in the U.S. He donated the royalties from the book to the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Offit serves on the board of the American Council on Science and Health. In 2015, Dr. Offit appeared in a vaccine awareness video created by Robert Till in which he advocated for teenage vaccinations."
"Offit worked for 25 years on the development of a safe and effective vaccine against rotavirus, which is a cause of diarrhea, and which kills almost 600,000 children a year worldwide, about half as many as malaria kills; most deaths are outside the West. His interest in the disease stemmed from the death of a 9-month-old infant from rotavirus-caused dehydration while under his care as a pediatric resident in 1979."
"Along with his colleagues Fred Clark and Stanley Plotkin, Offit invented RotaTeq, a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co. Since 2006, RotaTeq has been one of two vaccines currently used against rotavirus."
"In February 2006, RotaTeq was approved for inclusion in the recommended U.S. vaccination schedule, following its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Premarketing studies found that RotaTeq was effective and safe, with an incidence of adverse events comparable to placebo. RotaTeq has been credited (by Peter Hotez) with saving hundreds of lives a day. Offit received an unspecified sum of money for his interest in RotaTeq. Offit was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, in 2015."
"In 2002, during a period of fears about bioterrorism, Offit was the only member of the CDC's advisory panel to vote against a program to give smallpox vaccine to tens of thousands of Americans. He later argued on ""60 Minutes II"" and ""The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer"" that the risk of harm for people getting the vaccine outweighed the risk of getting smallpox in the U.S. at the time."
"In December 2013, Sarah Erush and Offit declared the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has a moratorium on the use of dietary supplements without certain manufacturers' guarantee for quality."
"Offit defines alternative medicine as quackery when it involves unappreciated harm and replacement of conventional therapies that work, with alternative therapies that don't. His books and articles warn against expense and risk to health for recipients of alternative therapies. In 2013 Offit wrote the book ""Do you believe in Magic? – The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine."" Offit states that the purpose of the book ""is to take a critical look at the field of Alternative Medicine – to separate fact from myth."" and that ""There's only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't.""(p. 6) One of Offit's concerns is the scare tactics he says proponents of Alternative Medicine will often use, in a 2010 podcast with the ""Point of Inquiry"" Offit stated ""it is very difficult to unscare people when you scare them."""
Offit has said that the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 should be overturned to provide proper oversight and action against supplement providers.
Offit has blamed Rachel Carson for millions of deaths from malaria because of her campaign against DDT.
"Offit is a recipient of numerous awards, including the J. Edmund Bradley Prize for Excellence in Pediatrics from the University of Maryland Medical School, the Young Investigator Award in Vaccine Development from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the 2013 Maxwell Finland Award for Scientific Achievement and a Research Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health. In 2018, Offit was awarded the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal from the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, DC for his work on the oral rotavirus vaccine and his leadership in promoting immunization."
"In 2011 Offit was honored by the Biotechnology Industry Organization with the 2011 Biotech Humanitarian Award. Offit donated the award’s $10,000 prize to the Vaccine Education Center at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Also in 2011, Offit was elected to the Institute of Medicine at the group's annual meeting. In 2013 Offit was presented with the Robert B. Balles Prize in Critical Thinking by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) for ""Do You Believe in Magic? The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine"". ""Offit is a literal lifesaver... educates the public about the dangers of alternative medicine, may save many, many more."""
"Michael Specter wrote that Offit ""has become a figure of hatred to the many vaccine denialists and conspiracy theorists."" Specter reported that Offit had often been threatened with violence by anti-vaccine advocates, necessitating precautions such as screening Offit's packages for mail bombs and providing guards when Offit attends federal health advisory committee meetings. At a 2008 vaccine activism rally in Washington, D.C., environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. criticized Offit's ties to drug companies, calling him a ""poster child for the term 'biostitute'."""
"Also in 2008, Sharyl Attkisson published an article for CBS News questioning Offit's independence, citing his financial ties to vaccine manufacturers. Offit said he is upfront about the money and that it doesn't affect his decisions. Curt Linderman Sr., the editor of the Autism File blog, wrote online that it would ""be nice"" if Offit ""was dead""."
"Such criticism has provoked statements in Offit's defense. Peter Hotez, a professor and vaccine researcher at George Washington University, has been quoted in a ""Newsweek"" article:"
"Offit has written or co-written several books on vaccines, vaccination and the public, and antibiotics, as well as dozens of scholarly articles on the topic. Isabelle Rapin, a neurology professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, wrote in ""Neurology Today"" about ""Autism's False Prophets"":"
"In ""The Cutter Incident"" (""see"" Cutter Laboratories incident), Offit describes fallout relating to an early poliovirus vaccine tragedy that had the effect of deterring production of already licensed vaccines and discouraging the development of new ones. Offit advocates for the repeal of religious exemptions to vaccine requirements, saying that such exemptions amount to medical neglect."

Orange County Council, 17 Cal.4th 736, 952 P.2d 261, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 453 (1998), was a case before the Supreme Court of California that established that groups such as the Boy Scouts of America are not considered ""business establishments"" as used in the state's Unruh Civil Rights Act and could not be subject to its provisions. Its companion case was ""Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts of America"", 17 Cal.4th 670, 952 P.2d 218, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 410 (1998)."
"Twin brothers Michael and William Randall were Cub Scouts, a membership division of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), in Anaheim Hills with Den 4, Pack 519 of the Orange County Council. They were on their way to earning the Bear Badge which included, in one of its four advancement areas, a religious component that asserted the existence of God and required the practice of one's faith as ""taught in your home, church, synagogue, mosque, or religious fellowship,"" as well as a pledge asserting their duty to God which was included in the opinion of the court:"
"We are lucky the people who wrote and signed our constitution were very wise. They understood the need of Americans to worship God as they choose. A member of your family will be able to talk with you about your duty to God. Remember, this achievement is part of your Cub Scout promise. ""I, ____, promise to do my best to do my duty to God and my country."""
"The Randalls stated at their local Cub Scout den meeting that they had a conflict with the religious requirement. The den leader asserted to the children's mother that the requirement was necessary to proceed through the ranks. The Orange County Council agreed with this position. While initially the Orange County Council allowed the Randalls to continue to participate in Scouting activities, it refused to allow them to advance in the ranks until they asserted their duty to God."
"The mother, as guardian ad litem, filed suit against the Orange County Council, alleging that the Council reversed its initial decision and expelled the Randalls from the Boy Scouts."
"The Superior Court for the County of Orange ruled at the initial trial that the BSA was considered a ""business establishment"" under the terms of California's Unruh Civil Rights Act because of the preponderance of the defendants evidence that illustrated the BSA's extensive real estate holdings, revenue-generating interests, and commercial enterprises. The court ordered statutory damages of $250 awarded to the plaintiffs and a ""permanent injunction against [the BSA], preventing it from excluding [the Randalls] from membership or advancement in the organization or in a den, pack, troop, or post based upon [the BSA's] religious beliefs or lack thereof, their refusal to swear an oath or a duty to God, or to use the word ""God"" in any pledge, oath, or promise or vow, or their failure to participate in any religious activities."""
"The BSA appealed the decision to the California Court of Appeal which upheld the core of the decision (that the BSA was subject to the Unruh Civil Rights Act) based on the court's earlier decision in ""Curran"", 147 Cal.App.3d 712 (1986), but reversed the injunction. The Supreme Court of California granted review."
"In a 7-0 ruling, the Supreme Court overturned the rulings of the lower court based on their decision in ""Curran"", 17 Cal. 4th 670, that the BSA did not qualify under the Unruh Civil Rights Act as the court found it to be a ""charitable organization"" with interests unrelated to the economic benefit of its members, and that it did not have a commercial interest in the activities provided to its members."
"As a sidebar, the Randalls reached the rank of Eagle Scout before being expelled from the BSA as a result of court prohibiting further actions by the BSA regarding their expulsion until the case was resolved."

= = = Lockdown (Stargate SG-1) = = =
"""Lockdown"" is the third episode for season eight of the Canadian-American military science fiction television series ""Stargate SG-1"". The episode was written by Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie, and directed by Will Waring. This was the only episode in the eighth season to receive a syndication rating, but was also one of the lowest rated of the season on the Nielsen household ratings. The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide."
"""Lockdown"" is about the discovery of an outbreak of disease which first occurred in the Russian Federation, but later on infects personnel of Stargate Command. The outbreak is later revealed to be the ethereal remains of Anubis. At the same time, Jack O'Neill stops the recruiting process for SG-1 leaving Samantha Carter as the new leader of SG-1 throughout season 8. Anubis tries to take new hosts but is eventually defeated and forced to a destination chosen by Carter, a frozen, barren planet."
"Several months after the destruction of Anubis' fleet, Stargate Command gets a new member in the form of Russian Air Force Colonel Alexi Vaselov (Russian: Алексей Вaсильев) who promptly asks General O'Neill for a place in SG-1. After the general rejects this request, Daniel talks to Vaselov about it, but the colonel suddenly collapses. When he wakes up again, he doesn't remember anything since he was in Russia, and his body shows signs of extensive viral damage. Gen O'Neill is concerned that there may be a contagion on the base, and orders Daniel to the infirmary just as he is about to leave on a mission with SG-11. Daniel suddenly pulls out his gun and injures several people, yelling for the gate to be opened, before he is stopped by O'Neill and Teal'c. O'Neill orders for no one to enter or leave the base to avoid spreading possible disease."
"Meanwhile, Vaselov begins to remember what happened—that he felt like being trapped in his own body—and he blames himself for what has happened. It is also discovered that a Russian cosmonaut from the International Space Station died a week after returning to Russia, exhibiting the same symptoms as Vaselov, and that Vaselov was with him when he died. Later, Daniel wakes up and quickly remembers that he was taken over by Anubis. It turns out that the former System Lord, thanks to his half-ascended form as a dark specter, can easily travel between hosts. He got into the cosmonaut's body from space debris, and is moving from person to person to get to the stargate. The members of SGC conclude that Anubis plans to leave through the stargate rather than use his ascended powers, since that would draw attention from the Ancients. However, he needs a body in order to get through the stargate. In the meantime, Anubis is easily eluding capture, so the SGC must execute a bold plan to stop him."
"This plan involves splitting the base into three zones. Power to the stargate is shut off, and is only accessible from Zone 1. The gate itself, and its surrounding areas, is in Zone 2. Hallways between the zones and into the gateroom are blocked using drop-down steel doors, and these can only be opened from Zone 3. All staff are restricted to one section only—no movement between sections is allowed."
"However, Anubis takes over Carter (who is in the section controlling the ""lockdown""), and makes her schedule a program to open the doors temporarily. She goes into the new control room and begins dialing the gate. O'Neill tries to stop her. With no other options, Jack and Major Kearney trigger the self-destruct, only for Jack to zat Kearney, revealing that Anubis is now possessing Jack's body. With the Stargate now active, Anubis now controlling Jack attempts to walk through the Stargate but Carter gets to the control room and ends the self-destruct sequence. She doesn't, however, manage to stop the gate from dialing, and it activates. Just as O'Neill is about to step through the gate, Col Vaselov, who has escaped from the infirmary, stops him. He holds O'Neill/Anubis at gunpoint and tells the Goa'uld to take his body instead. Anubis accepts, and steps through the stargate in Vaselov's body."
"Afterwards, Carter reveals that Anubis did not actually escape, as she did manage to override the dialing process to send him to an alternate address. The planet she chose to send him to was extremely cold, so Vaselov's body froze, leaving Anubis unable to dial a new address."
"Aaron Pearl who portrayed Major Kearney in the episode, previously played the younger version of George Hammond in the season two episode ""1969"". ""Lockdown"" was the first shot episode for season eight, but became the third to air so that they could continue the cliffhanger after previous season episode, ""Lost City"". Writer Joseph Mallozzi wanted to have an episode centered around the Jack O'Neill new job in Stargate Command, to ""Test him early"" on ""as the new [...] commander."""
"In the first script draft, Anubis was set to appear in a fiery planet at the end of the episode, but when the script was finished he ended up in a frozen planet. Mallozzi when commenting on the episode, said it was an ""Image I'd been dying to use"". When Samantha Carter told Jack O'Neill in the original draft where she had sent Anubis, O'Neill responded ""Well, I hope he wore his warm socks."" The line was dropped since producers felt it was ""too callous"" for the character. One of the early scenes featuring Alexi Vaselov, where he awakens to find Teal'c in the observation room, was originally scripted to take place in the infirmary. Originally Teal'c was set to appear at Daniel Jackson's bedsite with Vaselov engaging in the conversation."
"""Lockdown"" received 2.0 in Nielsen household rating and 1.7 in syndication ratings becoming the only episode in season eight to receive a syndication rating. The episode debuted on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States on July 23, 2004, with ""Stargate Atlantis"" episode ""Hide and Seek"". It was the top-rated show on the Sci Fi Channel that week. ""Lockdown"" drew close to 2.7 million viewers in the United States, this was down four-tenths from the previous episode ""New Order"". While the viewership was higher than the previous season which averaged a 1.8 in Nielsen household ratings, ""Lockdown"""

"""Zero Hour"" is the fourth episode from Season 8 of the military science fiction television series ""Stargate SG-1"". It was written by producer Robert C. Cooper and directed by Peter Woeste.

The first airing of ""Zero Hour"" on July 30, 2004 on the American Sci Fi Channel was viewed by 3 million people. The episode received mixed reviews."
"""Zero Hour"" takes place shortly after the promotion of main character Jack O'Neill from Colonel to Brigadier General. With O'Neill being the new leader of Stargate Command (SGC), Lt. Col. Samantha Carter has assumed O'Neill's old position as leader of the SG-1 unit. The idea to have the episode focus on General O'Neill solving various problems at his new job came from the writers' wondering what the general of the SGC does while his teams are on missions."
"The episode takes place over the course of five days, counting down to an at first unrevealed event named ""Zero Hour"". Five days to Zero Hour, General O'Neill is introduced to his new administrative aide, Mark Gilmor, who makes a suspicious phone call. Meanwhile, O'Neill's new position as a general is twofold. He needs to decide decorations for an upcoming official visit, and prepare SG-1 for its next offworld trip. A quickly growing alien plant and the arrival of two brawly Amrans, possible trade partners from another world, lead O'Neill to write a letter to General Hammond, his predecessor."
"At four days to Zero Hour, the alien plant has grown to cover many areas of the base. After SG-1 go missing on their off-world mission, a Goa'uld named Ba'al contacts Stargate Command and suggests an exchange of the captured SG-1 against Camulus, another Goa'uld who requested asylum on Earth several episodes before. With the help of Camulus, a potent power source is found and brought back to Stargate Command, only to find it tainted by Camulus (powering it up could result in the destruction of the Solar system). With the SGC suffering from a temporary electricity failure caused by the alien plants, Ba'al's renewed contacting only results in O'Neill's mocking. Exhausted by sleep deprivation two days to Zero Hour, O'Neill finishes his letter to General Hammond to inform him of his resignation."
"Although Camulus leaves Earth, Ba'al does not send back SG-1. When all SG teams announce their trust and support for the general, SG-1 dial the Stargate from offworld, revealing that they were never captured by Ba'al but instead were trapped in a secret base. After their safe return, O'Neill attests new SG-1 leader Samantha Carter's positive leadership skills. It is revealed that the ZPM Camulus was given to supposedly kill Ba'al (which Ba'al would use to destroy Earth) was actually the dead one from Antarctica. Zero Hour makes up the last minutes of the episode. The President is about to arrive, and Gilmor announces that his special assignment, initiated by the President's order, will end the next day. Gilmor expresses his respect, and as they leave to greet the President, the camera zooms in on the resignation letter on O'Neill's desk, with the last words, ""Never mind""."
"Despite being fourth in the airing order, ""Zero Hour"" was filmed as the seventh out of the twenty episodes of Season 8. The limited availability of Richard Dean Anderson (Jack O'Neill), who only worked 3.5 days out of five working days a week during the eighth season, extended the seven-day filming period to four weeks. With ""Zero Hour"" being a bottle episode to save money, director Peter Woeste filmed the majority of the episode on the standing SGC sets at The Bridge Studios, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The labs of Dr. Lee and Carter were filmed in the same room of the standing set, and a storage room for filming equipment was remodeled into the office of Gilmor. Second unit director Andy Mikita was responsible for the off-world scenes of the SG teams, filmed in Tynehead Park, one of the few undeveloped Vancouver locations that still allows filming. O'Neill in his sleeping quarters was the episode's last filmed scene, shot in two takes to allow Anderson to catch his flight home to Los Angeles."
"The inspiration for the episode came from the ""SG-1"" writers wondering for years what George Hammond, the SGC leader from seasons one through seven, does while SG-1 is away on missions. Imagined scenarios ranged from the general dealing with minor decisions like bunting and lunch buffet, to averting major emergencies and threats. The episode's working title was ""A Day in the Life of General O'Neill"", but writer Robert C. Cooper felt ""Zero Hour"" was more appropriate, referring to the President's visit at the end of the episode. The subplot of the SGC being overrun with plant life originates in a Season 4 idea by writer and producer Brad Wright. To not interrupt the shooting process, the set was decorated with various plants and vines overnight. Some plants were plastic, but real plants were used for the torching scenes, sprayed to be flame retardant so as not to burn the whole set. Jim Menard as the director of photography was responsible for the green lighting when the emergency lighting goes off. He achieved depth by using differently-colored lights in the control room and near the gate."
"""Zero Hour"" features several guest stars. Los Angeles actor David Kaufman was brought in to play the part of Mark Gilmor, a red herring to the story. Cliff Simon, flown in from L.A. for a day's work, filmed most of his scenes as Ba'al against green-screen in the gateroom for a ""hologram feel"". Bill Dow (Dr. Lee) was doing theater work in Vancouver during the filming of this episode, necessitating the producers to schedule around his availability. Gary Jones's character, an ""SG-1"" semi-regular technician who sported the name ""Norman Davis"" on his uniform for years, received a new name in this episode: ""Walter Harriman"". After O'Neill had referred to him as ""Walter"" in the Season 4 episode ""2010"", the producers could not get clearance for a renaming into ""Walter Davis"". The new name is based on General Hammond referring to Jones's character as ""Airman"" (sounding like ""Harriman"") in the pilot episode, and ""SG-1"" writer Joseph Mallozzi explained the resulting incongruity as a married-name issue. One scene in ""Zero Hour"" features Pierre Bernard, a graphic designer for the NBC show ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"", as technician O'Brien. The ""SG-1"" producers saw Bernard ranting on ""Late Night"" about ""Stargate SG-1"" being better without Daniel Jackson (actor Michael Shanks was not part of ""SG-1"" during Season 6), and gave him a cameo spot."
"Producer Robert C. Cooper was satisfied with ""Zero Hour"", claiming that Richard Dean Anderson ""is fantastic in this episode. It's new-yet-classic O'Neill and fans of the character will be forever pleased with this."" When ""Zero Hour"" first aired on the Sci Fi Channel on July 30, 2004, it achieved a 2.2 Household rating, equaling approximately 3 million viewers. Tied with ""Icon"", this marked the sixth-highest rating for any Season 8 episode of ""Stargate SG-1""."

= = = Venezuela during World War II = = =
"The history of Venezuela during World War II is marked by dramatic change to the country's economy, military, and society. At the beginning of World War II in 1939, Venezuela was the world's leading oil exporter, and subsequently one of the main beneficiaries of the American Lend-Lease programs. Economic assistance from the United States, as well a booming oil industry, led Venezuela to become one of the few Latin American countries that was able to finance its own modernization in the post-war era. Furthermore, through skillful diplomacy, Venezuela was able to gain territory, increase its share in oil profits, and also reduce its reliance on foreign oil companies."
"Although Venezuela was officially neutral for most of the war, it secretly supported the Allies, and eventually declared war on the Axis powers in February 1945, a few months before the end of the conflict."
"According to author Thomas M. Leonard, Venezuela's oil garnered ""intense interest"" from the Allies and the Axis, both before and during World War II. Thus, Venezuela's main strategic goal from 1939 to 1945 was to protect its oil from being seized by a belligerent nation. Closely related to this goal was the need to market oil, which had become the mainstay of the Venezuelan economy. Leonard says that the war could, ideally, have resulted in an ""economic boom"" if Venezuela could maintain a policy of strict neutrality and sell oil to both sides. However, neither the Axis or the Allies were likely to tolerate such a situation, and in the end, Venezuela sided with the Allies."
"Even though Venezuela was decidedly pro-Allied, the government attempted to increase its hold on the oil market, which was dominated by American-owned petroleum firms. One option was to nationalize the oil industry, like Mexico did in 1938. This option, however, was never seriously considered, because nationalizing the oil industry meant seizing American-owned oil, which would have likely resulted in a military intervention. Although Mexico's nationalization of its oil industry did not result in an American military intervention, just the possibility of one was enough to keep the Venezuelan government content with seeking a mere increase in its share of profits, rather than taking all of it."
"Subsequently, the United States, eager to maintain its access to the oil, agreed to increase oil revenues for Venezuela. Profits were split fifty-fifty between the Venezuelan government and the oil companies, such as Standard Oil and the British-owned Shell Oil. As result, in 1944 Venezuela's oil income was 66% higher than it was in 1941, and by 1947 total income had increased 358%. This ""largesse,"" as Leonard calls it, allowed Venezuela to become one of the few Latin American countries that was able to finance its own modernization in the postwar era, unlike many of the other states in the region, which relied on American economic assistance."
"Nazi efforts to increase their influence in Venezuela, and thus access Venezuelan oil, date back to 1933, when Arnold Margerie formed the Venezuelan Regional Group of the Nazi Party, or ""Grupo Regional de Venezuela del Partido Nazi"". After that, the Germans began ""courting"" the Venezuelan military through its military mission. On the ""cultural front,"" according to Leonard, General Wilhelm von Faupel, head of the Ibero-American Institute, attempted to gain influence by sending his wife, Edith, to Venezuela to ""extol the virtues of fascism."" Germany was also active in countering American economic influence, by expanding its holdings in mining, agriculture, and railroading."
"During the war, there were nearly 4,000 German immigrants residing in Venezuela. As result of which, there was fear among certain Allied leaders of a ""fifth column"" forming to commit sabotage and other acts against the Venezuelan government or oil-related infrastructure. The nearby British, French, and Dutch colonies also presented security concerns: If any were to fall under Axis control, they would certainly become bases for the interdiction of the Caribbean sea lanes, which carried Venezuela's crude oil to be refined in Aruba, and thence to market. They could also be used as staging areas for the invasion of neighboring countries, or for commando operations to interrupt oil production."
"In the 1930s there was a small Italian community in Venezuela with some links to fascist Italy: founded in 1923, the ""Partito Nazionale Fascista"" -with over two hundred members- had organizations in four cities: Caracas, Valencia, Puerto Cabello and Barquisimeto (Duaca). President Eleazar López Contreras (and later, president Isaías Medina Angarita) showed sympathy toward Mussolini and in 1938, the Venezuelan Navy purchased two ""Azio""-class minesweepers from Fascist Italy. Then in September 1939, Contreras declared the country's neutrality: Venezuela continued to trade with Japan and Italy for another year."
"Moreover, trade with Imperial Japan reached an all-time high in 1939. After the war in Europe began in September 1939, and after President Eleazar López Contreras declared the Venezuela's neutrality, he maintained a huge commerce with Japan and Italy, but trade with Germany ceased due to the British blockade. It was because of these circumstances some observers concluded that Venezuela would join the Axis if it were forced to take sides. However, the fear of Venezuela aligning itself with Germany, or any of the other Axis powers, was mostly unwarranted, because the sentiment of your average Venezuelan was ""bitterly anti-German."""
"When World War II began, the Venezuelan military was badly in need of modernization, and the United States was eager to help in return for Venezuela's support in the war. However, the United States was concerned about a possible enemy attack on Venezuela, in order to disrupt oil production, if it did openly join the Allied cause and declare war. As result, the Venezuelan government broke relations with the Axis powers on December 31, 1941, but it did not declare war until February 15, 1945, when the threat of an attack against the oil was gone. Therefore, the Venezuelan military never met the enemy on the battlefield, although under the Operation Neuland a few Venezuelan merchant ships were sunk; the first of which called ""Monagas"" occurred during the German attack on Aruba in February 1942."
"Because Venezuela was officially neutral for most of the war, the task of guarding the Venezuelan coast for enemy activity and escorting Venezuelan ships was left to the Americans. Accordingly, after the attack on Aruba and Curazao where refineries processed venezuelan oil, the United States Navy established the Fourth Fleet, which was responsible for countering enemy naval operations in the Caribbean and in the South Atlantic. The United States Army also sent aircraft and personnel to help protect the oil refineries and bolster the Venezuelan Air Force. To support the mission, Venezuela granted American ships and planes access to the country's ports and airstrips."
Since 1942 the government freezing the assets of German citizens based in Venezuela and the restriction of the economic activities of these groups within the country.
"It was achieved, through investigations to detain at least 800 citizens of German nationality who had activities to support the Nazi party. They were confined in concentration camps in Lara, Mérida and Trujillo. On the other hand, the German School of Caracas was closed after it was proven that it had pro-Nazi activities."
"Operation Bolivar was a German espionage operation in Latin America during World War II. It was under the operational control of Department VID 4 of Germany's Security Service, and was primarily concerned with the collection and transmission of clandestine information from Latin America to Europe. Overall, the Germans were successful in establishing a secret radio communications network from their control station in Argentina, as well as a courier system involving the use of Spanish merchant vessels for the shipment of paper-form intelligence."
"However, Argentine authorities arrested most of the German agents operating in their country in mid-1944, ending all effective ""Bolivar"" activity. Furthermore, the information collected during the operation is believed to have been more useful to the Allies, who intercepted much of the secret transmissions, than to Germany."
"The SS ""Koenigstein"" and the SS ""Caribia"" were a pair of German steamboats that were used to carry about 300 Jewish refugees from Europe to Venezuela between February and March 1939. The ""Koenigstein"", with eighty-six Jews on board, left Germany in January 1939 for the British colony of Trinidad, but when it arrived, the British refused to accept the passengers because of a recent prohibition on the admission of refugees. As result, the ""Koenigstein"" sailed to Honduras, but again the passengers were denied entry. With nowhere else to go, the ""Koenigstein"" then sailed for Venezuela, and arrived on February 17, 1939. The SS ""Caribia"", carrying 165 Jews, went through a very similar ordeal. After sailing to British Guiana, Georgetown authorities refused to allow the passengers to land, and so the ""Caribia"" sailed to Venezuela, arriving on March 16, 1939."
"At first, the Venezuelan government of the General Eleazar Lopez Contreras gave the refugees special permission to stay in the country temporarily, until new homes could be found for them in other Latin American countries, but they were banned from finding employment in any industry other than agriculture. Furthermore, the Venezuelan government made it clear that it would not accept any more refugees, unless they came through the proper channels. Later, President Contreras gave the refugees permission to remain in the country permanently. As result of which, the passengers of the ""Koenigstein"" and the ""Caribia"" became some of the founding members of Venezuela's Jewish community, as most Jewish emigration to Venezuela would occur after the war, in the 1950s and 1960s."

"Aziz Kelmendi (; born 15 January 1967 in Lipljan, SFR Yugoslavia) was a Kosovo Albanian conscript in the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). Yugoslav authorities described him as a ""misfit and loner"". Prior to his military service, he was arrested and imprisoned from 2–17 April 1984 for allegedly attempting to leave Yugoslavia and go to Albania. At his trial hearing he reportedly said ""Albania is my country, not Yugoslavia. I want to go there and live and fight for our goals!"". His conviction included also for nationalistic behaviour at high school and university. He disliked learning Serbo-Croatian. Prior to the killings, he had two arguments with a soldier named Safet Dudaković."
"On 3 September 1987, Kelmendi's mother and father came to Paraćin to visit their son. That morning, Kelmendi broke into a firearm cabinet and stole ten 7.62 mm bullets. He loaded these into his military-issued automatic weapon and went from the living facilities to a guard post. According to the JNA inquiry, Kelmendi threatened to kill the watchman, corporal Riza Alibašić, and took two rounds of ammunition from him. Pointing his weapon at Alibašić, Kelmendi took the corporal back to the living facility and demanded to know where Dudaković slept. When Alibašić refused to answer, Kelmendi told him to step aside and went into the sleeping quarters. There, he shot and killed the sleeping Dudaković before killing Srđan Simić and Goran Begić and wounding two other soldiers. He went into the adjacent sleeping quarters and fired randomly at the soldiers there, killing Hasim Dženanović and wounding two others. Kelmendi then fled the barracks. He was found dead away and his death was later declared a suicide. A total of four soldiers were killed and five were wounded in the shooting. Two of those killed were Bosniaks, one was a Serb, and one was half-Slovene and half-Croat."
"It was claimed that ""Keljmendi was assisted by eight associates, members of a hostile Albanian separatist and irredentist group"". These eight, six ethnic Albanians, a Muslim and a Roma, were later convicted for helping the attack. Yugoslav authorities concluded that Kelmendi had planned the attack shortly before it occurred. They stated that the military unit in which he served had no reason to suspect that he was mentally unstable and that he was ""a loner who had a personal complex because he was ugly and quite nervous"". He apparently socialized only with other Albanians and sometimes acted aggressively."
"The Paraćin massacre shocked Yugoslavia, where mass shootings were very uncommon. Media reported the attack as a ""shot at Yugoslavia"". It prompted Yugoslav authorities to send 400 federal police officers to Kosovo at the end of 1987. Despite those killed having been mostly non-Serbs, the Serbian media presented the shootings as an anti-Serbian attack. An estimated 10,000 people attended the funeral of Srđan Simić, the Serb soldier who was killed. Senior JNA officers and the mayor of Belgrade were in attendance. The crowd followed Simić's casket in silence, with some complaining that neither Ivan Stambolić nor Slobodan Milošević had attended the funeral. Afterwards, crowds began denouncing Yugoslavia and chanting ""Serbia, Serbia!"". They shouted ""better the grave than a slave!"", ""we want freedom"", ""Kosovo is Serbia"", ""we shall not give Kosovo away"" and ""enough of resolutions"". Simić's father repeatedly asked for the crowd to stop chanting, but to no avail. After the funeral, an estimated 20,000 people visited Aleksandar Ranković's grave in the same cemetery and sang ""Hey, Slavs"", the national anthem of Yugoslavia. The crowd shouted ""down with Azem Vllasi"" and ""all Shiptars out of Serbia, Kosovo is ours!""."
"Mobs responded to the killings by destroying Albanian-owned kiosks and shops in Paraćin, Subotica, and Valjevo. Yugoslav authorities arrested Kelmendi's family members and questioned them in a Prizren jail. Kelmendi's sixteen-year-old sister, Melihata, was expelled from her school. The Partisan organization in Kelmendi's birthplace, Dušanovo, demanded that all villagers isolate his family. Kelmendi's high school tutor, Agish Kastrati, was forced from the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and five of his teachers received ""final warnings"" for failing to record Kelmendi's absence from school during his imprisonment three years earlier."
= = = Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo = = =
"The Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo (also known as the GTP ZX-T) was a series of racing cars developed for Nissan Motors by Electramotive Engineering to compete in the IMSA GT Championship. Running from 1985 to 1990, they were known for being the first car to defeat the Porsche 962 which had dominated IMSA's premiere GTP category. This led to Nissan winning the constructor's championship and 12 Hours of Sebring in 1989 and 1990. During 1990, the GTP ZX-Turbo were replaced by the newer NPT-90."
"The GTP ZX-Turbo was named due to its shared engine with the production Nissan 300ZX, the turbocharged VG30ET V6. Although the engine block was similar, the GTP ZX-Turbo's engine was extensively modified to cope with the stress of racing."
"In 1984, Nissan Motors named Electramotive Engineering as their official North American racing development arm in an attempt to establish Nissan in the United States following the use of the Datsun name. Nissan wished to use the IMSA GT Championship as a way of showcasing their technology, similar to what they had done at the 24 Hours of Le Mans beginning in 1983. Electramotive would be tasked with maintaining, modifying, and racing the cars. Nissan would provide the VG30ET motors, although Electramotive would aid in developing the engine for racing. For the chassis, Nissan and Electramotive would turn to Lola Cars International to construct their new car to their specifications."
"The first two chassis, (#1 and #2), termed ""Lola T810"", were completed in early 1985. This initial year of competition was used for development of the new car in preparation for 1986. Electramotive was tasked with modifying elements of the T810 to better adapt to the smaller tracks and shorter sprint races used by IMSA GT. This led to the cars being renamed GTP ZX-Turbos as their design was evolved beyond the initial T810."
"One more T810 chassis, (#3) would be constructed by Lola, sold to Japan but then sent to, and adapted by Electramotive by the end of 1987. Some of these cars actually shared their tub off of an earlier Lola design, the T710, better known as the Chevrolet Corvette GTP. However, modifications to the cars would eventually extend to the point that Electramotive would begin to construct their own chassis to replace the older cars, no longer relying on Lola for the cockpit tubs. A total of five Electramotive-built tubs were completed in 1988. Electramotive later became Nissan Performance Technology Inc. (NPTI) in 1990, finally retiring the GTP ZX-Turbos once the new NPT-90s were completed halfway through the season."
"The first Lola T810 would be completed soon after the 1985 season had begun, with that initial chassis making its competition debut at Laguna Seca. Electramotive founder Don Devendorf and co-driver Tony Adamowicz took the car to eleventh place, seven laps down from the race winner. Following a heavy accident in practice at Charlotte, the car would not return until late in the season. The car had a ninth-place finish at Sears Point before mechanical problems did not allow the car to finish any of the remaining races that season."
"Nissan choose to skip several rounds of the 1986 season in order to concentrate on development, including the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring. The newly named GTP ZX-Turbo made its season debut in the streets of Miami, but this was followed by a string of problems in the future rounds. The car would eventually be able to finish at Mid-Ohio with a career best of seventh, but Electramotive would be able to improve on this with the car showing its first true potential of the season, fighting with the leaders at Portland and eventually coming home in third with Geoff Brabham at the helm. This would be immediately followed at the next round with a fourth-place finish. The success would not last though, as mechanical problems would render the car unable to finish for several rounds. The final race of the season in the streets of Columbus would see a distant fifth place, earning Nissan seventh in the constructor's championship with their points total."
"Once again deciding to skip the longer rounds of the IMSA season, the GTP ZX-Turbo debuted at Miami once again. However, lessons learned from the previous season as well as testing during the winter had allowed Electramotive to greatly improve the car. This earned the GTP ZX-Turbo its maiden win at Miami, defeating a Porsche 962 by eleven seconds after three hours of racing. Nissan's success would be short lived though as the next rounds at Road Atlanta and Riverside would see the car failing to finish due to clutch failure and an accident respectively. Electramotive would be able to overcome these problems at Laguna Seca with a fifth, before problems returned at Mid-Ohio."
"Electramotive would be unable to find much success until the final round of the season at Del Mar, with the GTP ZX-Turbo closing the season with a sixth-place finish. Although Nissan managed to take an improved fifth in the constructor's championship, they still earned only a sixth of the total points that champion Porsche had."
"Following their first ever victory, the Nissan program was expanded greatly in 1988 with plans for a two car team, although this would be delayed due to accidents in practice with the second car. Starting with a disappointing eighth at Miami, the GTP ZX-Turbo would begin its streak of successes that would help the car become a threat to the top teams. Beginning at their next race at Road Atlanta, the car defeated the factory Jaguar team by a mere four seconds. Unlike previous years, this success would continue as another victory was taken at the next round at the streets of Palm Beach, then Lime Rock Park, Mid-Ohio, Watkins Glen, and Road America. This success was mostly due to a technology developed in the turbocharger which allowed it an advantage over the naturally aspirated engines used in other prototypes."
"The second car for the team was finally able to compete at Portland, and in a dominant performance the two cars swept the top spots. Although the next round would see one car finish in eighth, the other team car would manage to yet again take the race win. Only at the street race in San Antonio would the GTP ZX-Turbo's eight race win streak come to an end, with the lone entered car suffering electrical problems. The cars would return to winning form at Columbus, before the final round saw Nissan being defeated once again, with Derek Daly managing to bring one of the team cars home with a best of only fourth."
"Although Nissan managed to win nine of the fourteen rounds that the GTP class competed in that season, the decision by Electramotive to skip the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring hurt Nissan's ability to win the constructor's championship. With only three wins, Porsche's points earned at the races Nissan missed allowed them to win the championship by a mere point. However, as consolation, Nissan's Geoff Brabham would win the drivers championship by a large margin."
"Wishing to overcome their narrow defeat in 1988, Electramotive and Nissan would fight hard to win the elusive championship in 1989. Nissan wisely chose to participate in the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring, even though the reliability of the cars was in question. Indeed, Nissan's fears were realized when neither car managed to finish at Daytona, although one did last the bulk of the race. At the shorter Miami round, the GTP ZX-Turbo would return to its winning form from the previous season, once again defeating Jaguar. However, at the 12 Hours of Sebring, the GTP ZX-Turbo would score a surprise result, with Chip Robinson, Geoff Brabham, and Arie Luyendyk taking the race victory by two laps."
"With the car's endurance proven, the car took victory at Road Atlanta. Although problems took away victory on the streets of Palm Beach, the cars began a winning streak once again, taking victories at Lime Rock, Mid-Ohio, Mosport, and Road America. The team had to settle for second and third at Portland as Jaguar's new car began to show its pace. However the GTP ZX-Turbos were back at Topeka with the top two positions, beginning another short streak through San Antonio and Sears Point. Defeat came once again at Tampa, while the cars would also not be able to win the season finale at Del Mar."
"With ten victories in comparison to Jaguar's three, Nissan was able to easily win the constructor's championship, the first time anyone besides Porsche had won it since the GTP class had been created in 1983. Geoff Brabham edged out Chip Robinson for his second drivers championship."
"As the defending champions, Nissan realized that the aged GTP ZX-Turbo was now the prime target of all other competitors, leading them to begin development on the car's replacement. While this car was being built, Nissan would have to continue to use the older GTP ZX-Turbos into the 1990 season. The newly renamed NPTI team would be aided by privateer Busby Racing who ran a third car that season."
"Following problems once again at Daytona, the GTP ZX-Turbos would take a victory in Miami for the third time, while Busby's new car would take second. The team would also improve on their performance at Sebring by not only taking the race win, but also second for the other team car. The streak would continue through Road Atlanta and Palm Beach before the newcomer Eagle-Toyota would overcome Nissan at Topeka."
"The Topeka race would also see the debut of the GTP ZX-Turbo's replacement, the NPT-90, with the team running one car of each. Lime Rock would also see Nissan defeated, yet Mid-Ohio would have the company back on top. This time though it would be the NPT-90 defeating the GTP ZX-Turbo as the two took the top spots. Following a result of fifth behind the NPT-90's first, the GTP ZX-Turbo would be retired completely. By the next round, the second NPT-90 would be completed and replace the sole remaining GTP ZX-Turbo used by the team."
"With the combined running of the GTP ZX-Turbos and NPT-90s, as well as the performance of privateers Jim Busby and later David Seabroke, Nissan would once again easily take the GTP constructors championship. Geoff Brabham would take his third drivers championship as well. One GTP ZX-Turbo would be entered by John Shapiro at the Miami round in 1991, finishing 13th before the team would fold. This would be the final race by a GTP ZX-Turbo car, although the NPT-90s would continue to carry the GTP ZX-Turbo name on them."
"One of the first three Lola T810s built would be sold to the Le Mans Company in Japan for use in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship. Debuting late in the 1985 season, the car would suffer mechanical failures before finishing eighth at the 1000 km of Fuji to close out the season. The following season, the car would continue to have problems, again only finishing at the 1000 km of Fuji. This time however the car managed sixth place, 13 laps behind the winning Porsche 962. The car would be retired as the team moved on to a Porsche."
"Following the retirement of the GTP ZX-Turbo in 1990, one of the former works chassis would be taken to Europe to participate in the Interserie championship in 1991. Although quick, the car would struggle to complete races. This would lead to it being quickly abandoned."
"Debuting at a time when Nissan was phasing out the Datsun brand in the United States, the GTP ZX-Turbo was used by the company to promote their ability to produce sporty, advanced cars. This led to the GTP ZX-Turbos being used in television and print advertisements for the whole Nissan brand, but also specifically the 300ZX with which it shared its engine."
"The GTP ZX-Turbos were featured as part of a ""Miami Vice"" episode revolving around the IMSA GT Miami Grand Prix, although this was primarily using footage of the race itself."
"The 1990 slotless racing game ""GT Super Screamers"" by Worlds of Wonder uses Nissan GTP ZX-Turbos."
"The fifth part of ""Trinity War"" was given 4 stars out of 5 by Doug Zawiska at Comic Book Resources. He said, ""The pacing of ""Justice League Dark"" #23 is smart and gives readers lots to chew on, but it also leaves what seems like a lot left to be resolved in the approaching final chapter of ""Trinity War""."" He also praised Janin's ability to accurately draw the characters used in the issue. Joshua Yehl of IGN also had similar sentiments, saying ""While ""Trinity War’s"" overall story is wonky, this chapter of ""Justice League Dark"" at least makes it a fun time."" He also enjoyed Janin's art and gave the issue a 7.6 out of 10. Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying, ""Everything about this issue feels like a climax...even if next week’s final chapter proves to be less than definitive."""
"IGN's Jesse Schedeen gave ""Constantine"" #5 a 6.5 out of 10, feeling that ""this issue doesn't seem to have much to add to the larger ""Trinity War"" picture,"" and that ""Ray Fawkes sets up the next storyline for this series, certainly, but there's little tangible impact on ""Trinity War""."" Comic Book Resources' Jennifer Cheng gave the issue 0.5 stars out of 5, stating the issue ""exhibits all the worst flaws of ""tie-ins"" or ""interludes"" for crossover event books [and] adds nothing to the big event and is almost useless to the ongoing title."""
"IGN's Joshua Yehl gave ""Trinity of Sin: Pandora"" #1 a 6.9 out of 10, saying ""Ray Fawkes definitely gets a lot of credit for telling a story that spans all the way from 8000 B.C.E. to the present and making it such a smooth read,"" but failed to ""kicks off the story without first giving a compelling reason to root for Pandora."" Yehl also praised the art, saying it looked ""impressively good"" despite the fact that there were four artists on the book. Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the first issue 2 stars out of 5, saying that the story is a ""protracted version of what readers have already learned in ""Phantom Stranger"" and elsewhere"" and criticizing the fact that Pandora's origin greatly differed from that of her Greek counterpart and the story had little to do with the ""Trinity War"". Like Yehl, Johnson also praised the fluidity of the art from Zircher, Cannon, Sampere and Cifuentes. Newsarama's Aaron Duran gave the title a 5 out of 10, saying the comic is simply okay and would have worked better as a shorter installment within other books or as bonus digital content."
"""Trinity of Sin: Pandora"" #2 was given a 6 out of 10 by Newsarama's Richard Gray. He stated that ""despite the “Trinity War” tie-in banners, [the issue] scarcely essential reading for current DC fans"" adding that ""Pandora’s focus doesn’t appear to be as concerned with this bigger picture"" and the series requires a lot of backstory, only in its second issue. IGN's Jesse Schedeen gave the issue a 7.5 out of 10, commenting that """"Trinity of Sin: Pandora"" #2 improves on the first issue, but the series still lacks a clear, ongoing purpose"" and ""as a ""Trinity War"" tie-in, this is certainly a more compelling read than ""Constantine"" #5."" Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 2 stars out of 5, saying """"Trinity of Sin: Pandora"" #2 is an average comic book all the way around. It doesn't add much to the ""Trinity War"" story despite the logo on the cover and it certainly isn't going to stick with me until the next issue."""
"""Trinity of Sin: Pandora"" #3 was given a 6.0 out of 10 by IGN's Jesse Schedeen. Schedeen said the issue ""is a dull tie-in that still succeeds on an intellectual level at times."""
"Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 3 stars out of 5 saying, the issue ""doesn't do much to advance the agenda or tighten up the plotlines of ""Trinity War"", but there is absolutely no question that the developments in this issue are going to have lasting ramifications for the Phantom Stranger and his quest for redemption."" Newsarama's Richard Gray gave it an 8 out 10 saying ""Some will pick up this issue for the links to the current “Trinity War” arc, but all should be transfixed by the way J.M. DeMatteis views the afterlife."""

The entire storyline is collected in the following volume:
= = = Rosine Guiterman = = =
"Rosine Guiterman (1886–1960) was a Sydney activist, teacher, poet and humanitarian."
"Guiterman was born Rosine Lion in London in 1886 and came to Australia with her family in 1893. She matriculated from high school and enrolled in Arts at Sydney University. She had a great love of Shakespeare's plays, this love having been instilled in her since early childhood by her mother. Her interest in Shakespeare came to the notice of Sir Mungo MacCallum, Sydney University's foundation Professor of Modern Language and Literature, and he inspired her to a lifetime study of Shakespeare. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1908."
"In 1911 she gained her Master of Arts degree in English, having achieved considerable prominence as a poet. Indeed, her poem ""Sic Vos Non Vobis"" (""Thus do ye, but not for yourselves"") won the coveted Sydney University Prize for English verse. She was the first woman to achieve this distinction."
"While at Sydney University she was very active in student activities, particularly in the Dramatic Society which gave her the skills which she would put to good use in her later commitment to theatre in Sydney. She also joined the Sydney University Women's Social Service Society and served on its committee from 1908 to 1910, being secretary from 1908 to 1909. In May 1909 she was instrumental in the Society and helped found the Sydney University Settlement which continues to provide social welfare services in the Chippendale and South Sydney area. This was an early indication of her strong commitment to social causes that was to be such an important part of her later life. It was in this period she became a close friend of the Australian feminist Jessie Street and other early social activists."
"In 1911, Rosine set off for London by boat, and she fell in love with a businessman, David Guiterman, who had boarded the ship in Colombo, Sri Lanka. By the time they reached England they were engaged. David Guiterman was, and always remained, a convinced socialist, with progressive ideas on religion, politics and human morality. Until they met, such explicit political ideas had never come Rosine's way."
"From 1911 to 1912 Rosine Lion with her sister, a trained kindergarten teacher, travelled extensively in France and Germany, teaching as she went. She then returned to Australia and Rosine and David were married at the Great Synagogue, Sydney on 10 September 1913. Their twenty-nine years of married life, in spite of much trouble, were happy. Their married life began with very bright prospects, David having been appointed to represent a German firm doing good business in Australia. However, eleven months later the First World War broke out. There followed a period of increasing social repression in Australia, in which the Australian government destroyed the white multiculturalism and plurality that had characterized pre-World War I Australia. This was to particularly affect those many Australians of German descent and heritage or those, like David Guiterman, who were associated with this large and vibrant component of Australian society."
"In this atmosphere of repression, the Australian Government confiscated the assets of David's firm, including his own money, and things became very difficult indeed for the newlyweds. David was an American of German descent, with a German name. In consequence David found it impossible to get another job. Rosine was ostracised by many former friends and even urged by some to leave her husband ""at least for the duration of the war"". It was strongly suggested that David Guiterman should change his name, but this he proudly refused to do, saying that it was a name that his parents and grandparents had borne with honour. His stand was almost universally condemned. They were both unalterably opposed to war as a method of settling international disputes and did not fear to say so. Rosine proudly stood by him and with unshakable courage had her first experience of taking an unpopular stance. In all likelihood it was this experience that led her to fight for the rest of her life for social inclusion, tolerance and human rights."
"These photographs of Rosine and David, and of Rosine, were probably taken in 1940 or 1941. David Guiterman died in 1942."
"David and Rosine had two children, Gertrude and Pauline. Gertrude inherited her parents’ strong socialist and activist views. She married John Williamson Legge in 1940 and they were both active members of the Australian Communist Party."
"In 1916, due to their straitened family financial circumstances as a result of the seizure of David's assets and his inability to gain employment, Rosine began to teach again - becoming a tutor of English and drama with the Workers' Educational Association. In 1917 after the birth of their two daughters, Rosine began part-time school teaching. Through her teaching career, three generations of school students benefited from her knowledge and love of the theatre. She worked tremendously hard. She may have neglected herself but never her family or her students. Her association with the W.E.A. lasted from 1916 to 1930, during which period she conducted very many classes and lectured at many summer schools."
"Rosine Guiterman engaged in school teaching continuously until 1950, including at SCEGGS Darlinghurst. Her main subjects were English and History and she was always the staff member to teach English and History honours. However, from time to time she also taught French and Latin. During this period she made many school broadcasts which were well received by both teacher and student listeners. In about 1940 Rosine commenced private coaching and continued to be a most successful teacher in this field up to the time of her death in 1960; her last lesson was given ten days before she died."
"Throughout her life, Rosine made a significant contribution to theater in Australia. In 1925 she was a co-founder of the Workers' Education Association Drama League. She was also active in the left-wing New Theatre in Sydney which was founded in 1932 and was where she could combine her theatrical skills with her social commitment. She acted in many plays, and gained early prominence through playing the leading role in Chekhov's ""The Schoolmistress"". Rosine also gained a significant reputation through her innovative Shakespearean productions. By 1938 she was sufficiently prominent in Sydney society to be the subject of an Archibald Competition painting by Joseph Wolinski."
"In 1933 Hitler came to power in Germany and there was a growing awareness among social activists in Australia of the growth in fascism in Germany. Rosine combined her commitment to the theatre with her concern at the growing menace of Nazism. On 21 November 1936 the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" reported:"
"""Mrs. Rosine Guiterman is producing Lessing's play, ""Nathan the Wise,"" this evening at the Maccabean Hall. A prologue will be spoken by Miss Amalia Lessing, a lineal descendant of the author, and by Mr. Arthur Mendelssohn, a descendant of Lessing's dearest friend, Moses Mendelssohn, whose character and ideas are expressed in the play. Miss Grace Barrow has designed the costumes and settings after a beautiful production she saw in Zurich. The proceeds of the performance will benefit the German-Jewish Relief Fund""."
"During the latter part of the 1930s, any German Jews who could possibly do so, escaped to any country where they could gain admittance, and many came to Australia. During this period the Guiterman home was ever open to newcomers in trouble, just as David Guiterman's office door was also always open. These two once calculated that approximately 600 to 700 refugees had come to their home with some type of problem."
"Many German children were coached in English by Rosine and subsequently shepherded through all ramifications of the Education Department, to ensure that they were graded according to ability and not held back through imperfect English. Many refugees, still with very little English, were assisted to obtain necessary medical or hospital attention. Education and medical assistance were just two of the host of problems which confronted the Jewish refugees, all of whom faced the trauma of being strangers in a strange land."
"Immediately after World War II, the Peace Council came into being with the object of working for the replacement of war by international co-operation. From its very inception, Rosine Guiterman identified herself with this movement, assisting to the maximum of her capacity in every way possible. She was also very active in many progressive causes including the Australia-China Association and the Union of Australian Women."
"She was an active member of the Australian-Aboriginal Fellowship and took part in the movement that brought about the successful 1967 referendum that changed the Constitution to allow the Federal Government to make laws relating to Aboriginal Australians. In this struggle, she played a particularly strong role in challenging the official government policy of ""assimilation"". She urged the adoption of the term ""integration"" to signal support of Aborigines' retaining a sense of group identity."
"In 1949, despite her full-time work as a teacher and social activist, she found time to write a book, ""Harriet Newcomb and Margaret Hodge: A Short Account of Two Pioneers in Education"", in order to help to keep alive the memory of two early feminists and educators."
"In 1949 she also published an article [“Emma Lazarus Centenary”, Unity: A Magazine of Jewish Affairs, (Vol. 2 No. 4.; Nov-Dec 1949; pp. 8–9) ] celebrating the centenary of the birth of the American poet Emma Lazarus and travelled to England where she became good friends with the poet Robert Browning who, Rosine reported, was delighted with her poems of indignation concerning abuses in the social system, or aiming at righting some wrong."
"Her strong and public commitment to social justice, despite the censure then being levelled at activists during the Cold War by the conservative government of R.G. Menzies, was well illustrated in 1953. When the impending execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg on charges of espionage galvanized liberal reaction around the world, she drew on her poetic skills, for which she had been awarded the Sydney University medal in 1911, to write an impassioned attack on the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" in reaction to the paper's headline: ""The execution of the Rosenbergs will end a two years' legal battle""."
"The Chicago Cubs selected Berg in the sixth round, with the 173rd overall selection, of the 2015 MLB Draft. Berg signed and spent 2015 with both the Eugene Emeralds and the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, where he posted a 2–1 record with a 1.40 ERA. In 2016, Berg started the season with Myrtle Beach and was later promoted to the Tennessee Smokies; in 43 total games between both clubs, 4–4 record and a 5.17 ERA. He spent 2017 with Tennessee, Myrtle Beach, and the Iowa Cubs, pitching to a combined 4-4 record and 5.16 ERA with a 1.38 WHIP in a career high 61 innings pitched between the three teams."
"On March 27, 2018, the Cubs released Berg."
"In 2019, Berg returned to UCLA as a pitching coach."

"""Trinity War"" is an 11-issue comic book story arc first published in 2013 by DC Comics, featuring the fictional superhero teams the Justice League, Justice League of America, and Justice League Dark. The arc spans several titles, including ""Justice League"", ""Justice League of America"", ""Justice League Dark"", ""Constantine"", """" and ""Trinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger"". The story is an action-mystery that sees the Justice League, Justice League of America, and Justice League Dark clash, in order to solve the mystery of Pandora's Box. The event also introduces the Crime Syndicate and the reveal of Earth-3 to The New 52."
"The main storyline received generally positive reviews, though was criticized for not having a true conclusion, instead leading directly into the ""Forever Evil"" storyline; the tie-in titles received mixed reviews. Every title involved in the story was collected into a trade paperback entitled ""Justice League: Trinity War""."
"Pandora appeared in all first issues of the First and Second Wave titles of The New 52. Many of the stories since The New 52 was created at the end of ""Flashpoint"" lead up to ""Trinity War"".<ref name=""Johns/Lemire IGN""></ref> Some of these stories and events include:"
"In the year 8000 BC, Pandora finds the box and inadvertently opens it, unleashing the Seven Sins on the world. As a result, she is punished by the Council of Wizards with immortality. Pandora begins her travels, training and trying to destroy the Seven Sins. In the present, she receives information from the Wizard informing her that the box can only be opened by either the purest or darkest of heart. Pandora approaches Superman to open her box, believing he is 'without sin', but when he touches the box he appears to become possessed. Pandora manages to escape with the box, after which Superman seems to return to normal."
"Shazam, having defeated his arch-enemy Black Adam, journeys to Kahndaq to bury him, inadvertently risking a diplomatic incident. Superman and the Justice League attempt to stop Shazam, which escalates into a fight. Amanda Waller decides it is the perfect opportunity for the Justice League of America to confront the Justice League, and dispatches them. During the conflict, it appears as though Superman murders the JLA's newest recruit, Doctor Light. Seeming to have lost control of his powers, Superman surrenders himself to A.R.G.U.S."
"Wonder Woman, believing that Pandora's box is responsible for Superman's actions, meets with Hephaestus, for answers about the box. She learns that he did not forge it and that Zeus and the other gods used Pandora to open the box because it contained something that the Gods of Olympus could not control. She meets with the Justice League Dark in order to recruit them to track down Pandora. At A.R.G.U.S. headquarters, the Question enters Superman's cell and releases him."
"The Question explains that he has evidence that indicates Doctor Psycho was in Kahndaq when Doctor Light was killed. Superman is physically ill and struggles to control his powers as he and the Question break out of the base to track down Doctor Psycho, with several other heroes in tow. When they confront Doctor Psycho, they determine that although he was present, he was not responsible for what happened in Kahndaq. Meanwhile, Pandora attempts to convince Vandal Savage to open the box, but he is also unable to do so."
"While Batman examines Doctor Light's body, the Phantom Stranger arrives to warn him that should Wonder Woman locate Pandora and the box, it will be the death of all. They confront Wonder Woman and the Justice League Dark at Constantine's House of Mystery, but when Wonder Woman questions the Phantom Stranger about Superman's ailment, the Stranger admits he does not know what caused Superman's condition."
"Batman convinces the Phantom Stranger to bring him to the afterlife so he can question Doctor Light. When Batman questions Doctor Light, the group learns that he does not remember anything about his death. Doctor Light gives a piece of his soul to the Stranger in hopes that he can give it to his family as a final gift. As the group is ready to leave, Zauriel appears, dismisses Batman and Deadman, and follows through on his promise to erase the Phantom Stranger from existence. Wonder Woman and her team track Pandora to the prison where Lex Luthor is held. Pandora approaches Luthor, hoping that he can open the box. Before she can give it to him, Wonder Woman and her group arrive to retrieve the box. Upon touching the box, Wonder Woman is apparently possessed just as Superman was."
"The other superheroes around her attempt to get the box from her and free her from its power; one by one it begins to corrupt them all. Pandora can see the sins above the Justice League members fighting over the box. As the battle continues, Pandora is finally able to attack the Sins, by killing Envy. Constantine takes Shazam out of the area and tricks him into switching off his powers. Constantine then uses a ritual artifact to steal Billy's powers. When he is attacked by an agent of the Cold Flame, Constantine uses the Shazam power, but is unable to control it. Billy Batson distracts the agent, giving Constantine time to kill it, and Billy regains his power. Constantine pleads with Billy not to touch Pandora's box, afraid of the power it may possess, but Shazam leaves Constantine and returns to the group, where he sees the effect the box has had on Wonder Woman. He knocks the box aside and picks it up; the resulting contact corrupts him also, giving him an appearance similar to Black Adam and causing a huge ripple through the magical planes."
"During the conflict, Constantine arrives, takes the box, and transports himself and Zatanna to the Temple of Hephaestus. There they find that Madame Xanadu had been kidnapped and locked away in a secret bunker. Madame Xanadu tells everyone that Pandora had it wrong, that the box is actually a doorway. Superman, Wonder Woman and their respective groups arrive at the temple. Constantine, still in possession of the box, realizes that the box is allowing evil thoughts to go through everyone's mind, and a massive fight breaks out as the heroes struggle to get possession of the box."
"Firestorm tells everyone that Superman is emitting Kryptonite. Element Woman goes inside Superman's blood stream and finds a small sliver in his brain. Atom then tells everyone that she put it there in Kahndaq, and that it was this that has been causing Superman's illness and loss of control of his powers. The Outsider comes out of the shadows to pick up the box. He tells the heroes that the box is not magic, but science, that was created on his world and can only be opened by someone from his world. He explains that the box opens a gateway to his homeworld, and that he and Atom arrived following the weakening of the barriers between the universes resulting from the Justice League's battle with Darkseid."
"The Outsider uses Pandora's box to open a portal to his home world, Earth-3, breaking the box in the process. The Earth-3 incarnation of the Justice League emerge — Ultraman, Superwoman, Owlman, Johnny Quick, Power Ring, and Deathstorm. Sea King does not survive the journey and collapses dead. Atom joins the group, answering to the name Atomica, revealing that she had arrived on Prime Earth along with the Outsider, who is revealed to be the Alfred Pennyworth of Earth-3. Cyborg's Apokoliptical mechanical prosthetics proceed to tear themselves from his body, ripping free from his biological form and coalescing into a robot named Grid, a sentient computer virus. Trailing behind the Crime Syndicate is a prisoner from Earth-3 whose identity is not revealed. The Crime Syndicate claim the planet as their own, and attack the three weakened Justice Leagues."
"The outcome of ""Trinity War"" leads directly into DC's ""Forever Evil"" miniseries and ""Villains Month"" event, as well as the creation of new ""New 52"" titles. ""Trinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger"" #11 had major repercussions for Phantom Stranger and planted the seeds for a new story arc in ""Trinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger"" #14, later revealed to be the """" storyline. At San Diego Comic-Con 2013, Johns and Lemire said the events of ""Trinity War"" would affect many of the DC titles, not just the Justice League books."
"The name of the crossover had brought speculation to what the ""Trinity"" stood for. In the 2012 FCBD special, Pandora, the Phantom Stranger and the Question were dubbed the Trinity of Sin. In regards to the name, Geoff Johns stated there was ""a bit of a mystery"" around it saying, ""Is it about the Trinity of Sin? The trinity of Leagues? Is it about Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman? What does ""trinity"" mean? What is it all about? That's something that the story explores."" In ""Justice League"" #23, it is revealed that the ""Trinity"" refers to the true number of evil, three, referencing Earth-3."
"The review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup reported a 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before the release of the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, """"Trinity War"" itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, or any of the other elements the crossover was initially predicated upon."" After ""Justice League"" #23 was released, Schedeen added,""Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to savor the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. ""Trinity War"" may well emerge as the new poster child for everything wrong with that approach. In the end, ""Trinity War"" becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that ""Justice League"" #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling ""finale"" issue."" Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event ""cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles."" However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that ""the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It's a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore."" Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt ""there are no true conclusions of any sort"" after the whole event, ""just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions"" added at the end of ""Justice League"" #23. As with Gray, Zawisza ""was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case."""
"Newsarama's Richard Gray gave ""Justice League"" #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray stated that ""Johns does a terrific job of pulling together what has been essentially four or five separate stories, incorporating not only the three main titles that this will span over the coming months, but introducing several new players into the mix as well."" He also praised that the story advanced and showed similar promise that the reboot to the New 52 did in 2011. Joshua Yehl of IGN gave the first chapter of the Trinity War a 7.8 out of 10. He felt the issue set the stage for the event and praised the character work. However, he thought that the conflict was not presented clearly yet and criticized the lack of the Justice League Dark in the first issue. Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, saying ""Johns manages to balance personality expositions with story breaks, giving readers a sense of who the opposing sides are, if nothing else. Johns brings lots of big moments to the pages, but the emotions he wrings from those moments really help sell this book."" Zawisza was surprised by the amount of time that was spent on Madame Xanadu, feeling as though it was only there for reason to include the Justice League Dark, and was wary that the characters are in danger of being absorbed by the plot. All three praised the art in the issue, especially Ivan Reis' pencils."
"The conclusion to ""Trinity War"" received an 8 out of 10 from Richard Gray of Newsarama. He said, ""It was clear from the start of “Trinity War” that this would only ever be a bridge between one phase and the next. By the final page of ""Justice League"" #23, that bridge is not so much burned as left a bit smokey from the waves of revelations that come to light in the issue's final pages. It's a fitting conclusion, but one that will require additional reading when the dust has settled."" Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources was critical of the final issue, giving it 3.5 stars out of 5. He felt that while """"Justice League"" #23 is a loud, clanging final chapter to the crossover between Justice League books"", there ""was way too much is left hanging out to be completed elsewhere."" Jesse Schedeen of IGN was highly critical of ""Justice League"" #23, giving it a 6.0 out of 10. Schedeen felt that the Trinity of Sin ""are practically non-entities in the story"" at the end, after being teased as the center of the event back in 2012. He also felt the splash pages were overused and did not like lack of conclusion. Finally, he felt it was ""refreshing to see that Johns has been executing a long-term plan for the past two years"" and ""the highlight of this issue, and probably the crossover as a whole, is the reveal of the Justice League traitor."" Ivan Reis' art was a standout in the issue, and praised by all."
"Newsarama's Richard Gray gave the second part of ""Trinity War"", ""Justice League of America"" #6, a 7 out of 10. Gray felt this issue was ""the difficult middle chapter of the first half of this crossover"" and that ""the issue works successfully in building up the pieces of the broader puzzle, but it may leave readers attached to the core members of the team out in the cold."" He noted that the issue was more reflective in tone, opposed to pitched battles on every page. Gray criticized that the issue felt more like a ""Justice League"" issue, with the Justice League of America members all taking a back seat to the issue's events. He added that Doug Mahnke's pencils grounded the story in Geoff John's universe, but felt the battle sequences were not as good as Ivan Reis' in ""Justice League"" 22. Jesse Schedeen of IGN, who gave the issue an 8.1 out of 10, was wary that the ""heavy emphasis on The Outsider and his schemes made ""Trinity War"" feel less like the big event DC has been building towards since the start of the New 52 and more like another stepping stone on the road to Forever Evil,"" but was surprised at Johns' ability to not dwell on The Outsider that much in this issue, and give each member a moral ambiguity, questioning their role in the conflict. Schedeen, however, was disappointed at how little the Trinity of Sin appeared in the issue. He also felt that the ""Justice League of America"" series got its strongest contender for art in Mahnke, but noted that it was not his best effort. Comic Book Resources gave the issue 3.5 stars out of 5, with Doug Zawisza saying he was not impressed with the issue, with a lot going on, and nothing really moving forward. He felt that Mahnke's art excelled in certain characters, especially Hawkman, Martian Manhunter and Frankenstein."
"IGN's Joshua Yehl gave the fourth part of ""Trinity War"", ""Justice League of America"" #7, a 6.5 out of 10. Yehl said, ""With nearly two dozen heroes filling up every ounce of panel space, the reading experience becomes stretched thin as writers Geoff Johns and Jeff Lemire try to find something for everyone to say or do. The result is an event comic that has two more issues to go yet still hasn’t decided exactly what this story is really about."" He however, enjoyed Lex Luthor's appearance in the issue. Conversely, Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying ""For all the false starts and misdirection of the New 52, the first major crossover in “Trinity War” has come together nicely. While there is still the pervading sense that this is merely a set-up for the next major event, the “Forever Evil” villains month, there's no denying that it has been a hell of a ride so far,"" adding ""all of the previously disparate elements from the various series begin to coalesce into something major."" Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, feeling it was ""loads of fanboy fun"" and the issue actually progressed the series storyline, not just the event's storyline."
"Newsarama's Richard Gray gave ""Justice League Dark"" #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray stated: ""While many events that run across multiple titles often slap a logo on an existing series and call it a tie-in...Lemire ensures that his team are an integral part, [making] the team finally feel as though they are part of a wider DC universe. Indeed, in many ways, this appears to be the primary goal of “Trinity War”, in that it unites the often disparate strands of the New 52."" Joshua Yehl of IGN gave the issue a 7.0 out of 10, saying ""While the art and characters are done well, the overall plot of Trinity War leaves much to be desired."" However, he praised Jeff Lemire's character work, and felt that Mikel Janin's art was the ""cleanest and most consistent looking chapter of ""Trinity War"" thus far."" Comic Book Resources' Kelly Thompson gave the issue 2.5 stars out of 5, saying the issue ""gets devoured by the massive ""Trinity War"" and buckles under the weight"" adding that the debate seems more plot driven than character driven. Despite the criticism of the story, Thompson praised Janin's art saying, ""he does nearly the impossible and draws just about every single major character in the DCU perfectly."""

The South Gippsland railway line was opened from Dandenong to Cranbourne in 1888 and extended to Koo Wee Rup, Nyora and Loch in 1890, Korumburra and Leongatha in 1891 and Welshpool, Alberton and Port Albert in 1892. The section from Alberton to Port Albert was closed in the 1940s. A branch line was built from Alberton to Yarram and Woodside in 1921."
"The line was well known for its sharp curves and spectacular scenery and was also one of the last lines to offer a 'Mixed Passenger and Goods' service in Victoria. The section from Yarram to Woodside was closed on 26 May 1953, with the section from Welshpool to Yarram closed on 26 October 1987 when the superphosphate freight services ceased. From this point until 30 June 1992, the track beyond Agnes, referred to as Barry Beach Junction received minimal usage, although a short branch leading from Agnes to Barry Beach was used extensively for goods traffic to serve the oil platforms in Bass Strait. After the withdrawal of this freight service the railway line beyond Leongatha was booked out of use for all rail traffic. This section of track was then dismantled in 1994, in which required the strengthening of the line's derelict trestle bridges in order to allow the track removal machine to dismantle the tracks."
"On 24 July 1993, the last regular V/Line passenger train operated to Leongatha with P Class diesel locomotive number 18 hauling the return passenger train with a set of 4 H-Set carriages. Following the withdrawal of all rail service beyond Koala Siding, the section of track from Nyora to Leongatha was transferred to the South Gippsland Railway in 1994, The South Gippsland Railway was founded in 1990 as the ""Great Southern Railway Society"", based at Nyora, with the intention of preserving the line in case of closure. On 15 January 1998, all regular V/Line services ceased on the line after the withdrawal of the Australian Glass Manufacturing sand train, that operated between the sand mine at Koala Siding, situated between Lang Lang and Nyora railway stations, and the AGM siding at Spotswood. Since April 1998, no trains have operated beyond Cranbourne."
A 5 km-long narrow-gauge horse-drawn tramway was opened from Welshpool to Welshpool Jetty in 1905. It was closed in 1941.
"The mountainous Strzelecki branch line, which opened in 1922, was built from Koo Wee Rup to Strzelecki. The line was closed in stages throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s."
"The Wonthaggi branch line was built from Nyora to Wonthaggi, opening in 1910, to serve the State Coal Mine, a small extension to the line was opened in 1917. The Wonthaggi line was closed in 1978."
"The Outtrim branch line was built from Korumburra to the coal mine at Outtrim in two stages: the initial stage to Jumbunna was opened in 1894, with the final section to Outtrim opening in 1896. The line was closed in two stages: the first from Jumbunna to Outtrim on 4 September 1951 and then from Jumbunna to Korumburra on 1 October 1953."
"Passenger services operated on the line from its opening. Services from Melbourne to Leongatha and Yarram were withdrawn on 6 June 1981, with replacement buses starting three days later. The Yarram train was a loco hauled train, while the Leongatha train was a DRC railcar hauling MTH carriages. To fill the gaps between those services, local trains were introduced on a three-month trial from Dandenong to Lang Lang, but were withdrawn on 3 October 1981, due to insufficient patronage. Services to Leongatha were restored on 9 December 1984, and free train shuttles to Korumburra were provided to mark the occasion. The 1984 timetable included two round trips per day from Monday to Saturday, and one round trip on Sundays. However, the services were again withdrawn on 24 July 1993. With the withdrawal of freight services from Koala siding in January 1998, the line became unused beyond Cranbourne. The exception was a tourist operation, which commenced operation between Nyora and Leongatha. It later became known as South Gippsland Railway. In 1995 the section between Dandenong and Cranbourne was electrified and a station added at Merinda Park, as part of a $27 million Federal Government-funded project."
"The Barry Beach freight service ceased in 1992. The line beyond Leongatha was booked out of service on 30 June 1992, effectively ending all traffic on the line beyond Leongatha. V/Line passenger services ceased to Leongatha on 24 July 1993, after last train to Melbourne. By the mid-1990s only T, Y and P class diesel locomotives were used on the line, due to their low axle loads, with a 15 km/h speed limit applying to parts of the track. This continued until 15 January 1998, when the Koala Siding (near Nyora) to Spotswood sand train ceased operation. On average, it took a passenger train 2 hours and 15 minutes to travel from Spencer Street station to Leongatha during the final 10 years of service, with the replacement bus service completing the journey in an average time of 2 hours and 30 minutes."
"A number of special railway enthusiast services were operated along the line during the 1980s and 1990s, given that the line was near closure. Notable special journeys included K.153 hauling the last steam special to Yarram on 24 October 1987, as well as an earlier Vintage Train journey to Foster and return on 6 September 1987. The last steam hauled train to run beyond Leongatha was on 13 November 1988, when steam locomotives D3.639 and K.153 travelled to Foster. That was the last time the locomotive turntable at Foster would be available for usage prior to its relocation to Korumburra railway station for the South Gippsland Tourist Railway in 1994. Local Melbourne community groups continued to organise chartered special diesel and railcar-hauled trains beyond Leongatha until 1991. A steam and diesel special to Barry Beach and Welshpool on 11 November 1989, which was organised to celebrate the 100th anniversary since the Dandenong to Nyora section of the Great Southern Railway Line opened. Heritage steam locomotive J515 hauled the special to Leongatha and return later one in the day while then V/Line diesel locomotive T368 took over for the section of track beyond Leongatha due to the turntable at Foster not being available for operation. D.E.R.M. 58 ran the last advertised special train available to the public beyond Leongatha to Welshpool and Barry Beach on May the 12th 1990."
"During the 1990s, steam tours only operated as far as Leongatha, with the first being run on 9 September 1990, again hauled by steam locomotive K.153, which coincided with the steam locomotive's 50th anniversary since being introduced into service. In 1993 there were two notable steam -hauled trips to Leongatha. Both specials were operated by Steamrail Victoria, and hauled 11-car consists of Victorian Railways E-Type and W-Type wooden carriages, which ran numerous shuttles between Korumburra and Leongatha stations. The first one was on 2 May, which was supposed to be a triple header of K Class steam locomotives. However, one of the scheduled locomotives, K190, suffered a defective main internal steampipe failure at Caulfield, leaving locomotives K153 and K183 to double-head the train. On 25 July 1993, the apparent ""Last Lament to Leongatha"" was run, operated by K190 and K183."
"After the withdrawal of passenger services to Leongatha, a few more steam-hauled trips were organised before the line was booked out of regular use between Cranbourne and Nyora. On 17 April 1994, K190 and K183 again travelled to Leongatha with the ""South Gippsland Rambler"", with a consist of seven wooden carriages. Steam locomotive J515 journeyed to Leongatha on 14 October 1995, for the first time since November 1989, organised by the Seymour Railway Heritage Centre and the ARHS. During the tour, J515 derailed due to a missing guide rail on the locomotive turntable at Korumburra that had been recently relocated from Foster."
"The last locomotive to traverse the South Gippsland main line before its closure was steam locomotive K190 operated by Steamrail Victoria. It returned to Steamrail Victoria's base at Newport on 29 April 1998, after it was leased to the South Gippsland Tourist Railway (SGTR) in December 1996. The South Gippsland Tourist Railway had first loaned the locomotive during the summer of 1995-1996. The locomotive again returned for the summer of 1996-1997. K190 was leased to the South Gippsland Tourist Railway on 7 December 1996, when Steamrail Victoria operated another steam special to Leongatha. Diesel loco T345 was also loaned to the tourist railway at the time, and was part of the train from Newport workshops. K183 double-headed with K190 to Nyora, with T345 attached to the special. K190 and T345 were detached at Nyora station. Shortly afterwards K183 journeyed solo to Leongatha. K190 followed to Leongatha with a consist of the tourist railway's carriages. T342, T345 and the DERM RM55 combined for a Saturday tourist railway service. Later, K183 returned to Newport Workshops with the Steamrail Victoria train. However, steam locomotives D3639 and K183 combined for the last steam excursion to traverse the South Gippsland rail line on 25 September 1997. During this time D3.639, along with K190, were both on loan to the South Gippsland Tourist Railway."
"The track beyond Leongatha, to Yarram and the Barry Beach branch line, was dismantled in 1994, but removal of other infrastructure, such as level crossing signals, took place around mid to late 1992, soon after the last train ran to Barry Beach. The section between Leongatha and Foster was turned into the Great Southern Rail Trail in 1998. In 2011, the Tarra Rail Trail from Alberton to Yarram was completed. , the section between Foster and Toora had been complete, leaving the final section from there to Alberton being converted into the Great Southern Rail Trail."
"The section from Dandenong to Cranbourne was electrified in 1995 and, as the Cranbourne Line, is now part of the Melbourne suburban rail network. The first level crossing on the closed section of the line, the South Gippsland Highway crossing in Cranbourne has since been paved over. The Victorian Transport Plan of 2009 stated that the Cranbourne line would be extended two kilometres to a new station at Cranbourne East by 2015. The new Cranbourne East station would be built near Renyard Street and the Casey Fields complex. The line from Nyora to Leongatha was used by the South Gippsland Tourist Railway until 2016. The branch line from Nyora to Wonthaggi was closed in 1978 and dismantled by 1990. It is now the Bass Coast Rail Trail. Since its closure, a significant section of the former Wonthaggi Line has been leased or sold to farmers, while other sections have been cut away to widen highways and main roads in the coastal South Gippsland region. The former branch lines to both Outtrim and Strezlecki have become a distant memory."
"The remaining section of track from Cranbourne to Nyora is disused but mostly still intact. A length of track was pulled up at Koo Wee Rup in 2009 to allow the construction of toilets for the bus and coach stop. Construction of the pipeline for Wonthaggi Desalination Plant made it necessary to remove three sections of the line. The first is about 100 metres on the down side of Monomeith Road, where about 50 metres of track were removed. The second is on the up side of Caldermeade Road, where about thirty metres of track were removed, and the third is about halfway between Caldermeade and Lang Lang stations."
"Much of the operational and safeworking infrastructure remains in place in this section, including signalling equipment, level crossings, and easements. Station platforms are also in place, but mostly without station buildings, for example at Lang Lang, Koo-Wee-Rup, and Tooradin. Parts of the track have warped due to erosion, ground movement or the displacement of sleepers. This is especially evident near Lang Lang, Tooradin, and north of Koo-Wee-Rup. There are also questions about the integrity of some bridges and culverts along the route."
"Prior to the 1999 Victorian election, the state Labor Party promised to return passenger services to Leongatha. In 2008, a report commissioned by the Victorian Department of Transport found the cost of returning passenger services to Leongatha to be unjustifiably high, estimating the cost at $72 million. The report stated that only 20 per cent of respondents surveyed about their transport needs considered restoring train services to be the main priority. Instead $14.7 million was allocated to road coach service upgrades. The then Minister for Public Transport Lynne Kosky said that the State Government had provided funding for development of a rail trail between Cranbourne East and Nyora to support tourism in South Gippsland in May 2008."
"On February 24, 2016 South Gippsland Shire Council unanimously carried motions to support the return of rail services to Leongatha on the back of a petition initiated by the South & West Gippsland Transport Group, which attracted 2,420 supporters. The successful motion means that the data gathered from the petition and documents prepared by South Gippsland Shire Council investigating the returning rail to South Gippsland have now been passed onto Public Transport Victoria with a call to provide for South Gippsland rail services in the forthcoming Regional Network Development Plan. After the disbandment of the South Gippsland Tourist Railway on January 16, 2016 it had also been announced that VicTrack will continue to leave the disused rail line between Cranbourne and Leongatha intact and available for future use by freight and passenger trains."
"Reopening the South Gippsland railway line as far as Leongatha continues to be a prominent issue in the region. A South Gippsland Shire Council Priority Projects document, released in June 2013, acknowledged that the return of a rail service was a major community priority, with funding and support sought from all levels of government. In early 2014, a report into possible extensions of the Melbourne metropolitan rail system identified the population growth corridor from Cranbourne to Koo-Wee-Rup, along the disused Leongatha line, as a key planning priority. The South and West Gippsland Transport Group, a public transport and rail lobby group, established in April 2011, which is closely associated with the South Gippsland Shire Council and other local government bodies, has campaigned for an integrated transport plan in the region, which includes rail at the forefront of the proposal. The group had been known as the South Gippsland Transport Users Group and had amalgamated with numerous rail lobby groups in 1994 shortly after the rail passenger service to Leongatha was withdrawn in July 1993. One notable milestone for the group was running a successful campaign that saw passenger rail services reinstated to Leongatha on December 9, 1984. Despite the promise to revive the railway line for freight and passenger services by the Bracks Labor government in 1999 being abandoned by his successor John Brumby in 2008, a community campaign involving the South and West Gippsland Transport Group continued to lobby, in collaboration with key stakeholders and governments, to achieve the reinstatement of rail services, and the improvement of transport accessibility in the region."

"Round-tripping, also known as round-trip transactions or ""Lazy Susans"", is defined by ""The Wall Street Journal"" as a form of barter that involves a company selling ""an unused asset to another company, while at the same time agreeing to buy back the same or similar assets at about the same price."" Swapping assets on a round-trip produces no net economic substance, but may be fraudulently reported as a series of productive sales and beneficial purchases on the books of the companies involved, violating the substance over form accounting principle. The companies appear to be growing and very ""busy"", but the round-tripping ""business"" does not generate profits. Growth is an attractive factor to speculative investors, even if profits are lacking; such investment benefits companies and motivates them to undertake the illusory growth of round-tripping."
"""Shakugan no Shana"" details an age-old conflict between those who inhabit the , a parallel universe to the human world. The Crimson Realm is populated by who are able to manipulate the , a fundamental power within any biological entity and functions as ""fuel"" for one's existence. Denizens whose power stands out among their peers are known as , and Lords that are even more powerful are known as . Denizens who do not care about the balance between the Crimson Realm and the human world collect Power of Existence from humans to use for their own purposes. It is the duty of , humans who have formed contracts with a Crimson Lord, to maintain the two worlds' balance by killing any Denizens disrupting it. Denizens and Flame Haze fight with the use of powerful magic spells called , which are also known as Unrestricted Spells or Unrestricted Methods. One such spell is the , which creates a space where the Crimson Realm and the human world intermingle and all sorts of causalities, including time, are stopped for ordinary living beings."
"The story largely takes place in Misaki City in Japan and begins when high school student Yuji Sakai is thrown into the middle of this conflict and encounters a Flame Haze girl with flaming red eyes and hair dressed in all black wielding a katana. The girl informs him that he died some time ago, and that he is a , a human with greatly diminished Power of Existence, and whose remaining Power of Existence will slowly run out. In addition, Yuji is a , a special kind of Torch who contains a , a magical object created by Denizens that can provide special abilities or even Powers of Unrestraint; additionally, Mystes can move within Seals. Unfazed by his apparent death, Yuji befriends the girl and names her ""Shana"" after her sword. They later discover that the Treasure Tool within Yuji is the , which restores his Power of Existence every night at midnight."
"As time goes on, Shana and Yuji encounter several more Flame Haze, such as Margery Daw and Wilhelmina Carmel, and Denizens in Misaki City. An organization of Denizens called Bal Masqué discovers that Yuji possesses the Reiji Maigo and attempt to use the Treasure Tool on two separate occasions. Bal Masqué is led by three Lords called the Trinity: Hecate, Sydonay, and Bel Peol. They serve under a Crimson God known as the , who resides within the Reiji Maigo. When the Snake of the Festival emerges, it merges its consciousness with Yuji's, assuming command over Bal Masqué, and together they formulate an elaborate plan to create a parallel world called Xanadu, which will serve as a paradise for Denizens with unlimited Power of Existence. Shana, and all of the other Flame Haze around the world, oppose the creation of Xanadu, which would eventually cause a large-scale disruption in the human world, the Crimson Realm and Xanadu itself."
"Shana formulates a countermeasure and is ultimately successful in adding a single law to Xanadu where the Denizens are not allowed to eat humans anymore. With Xanadu created, the Denizens depart to the new world, soon followed by hundreds of Flame Haze determined to help enforce order on it. Yuji intends to go to Xanadu alone and make sure humans and Denizens can eventually learn to coexist, but Shana refuses to be left behind. In the end, Yuji accepts Shana's feelings and the two kiss, which activates a spell left to Yuji by Crimson Lord Lamia that restores his existence, so Yuji is no longer a Torch. With the help of another spell from Lamia, Yuji successfully restores all humans in Misaki City whose existence was absorbed by the Denizens before he and Shana depart for Xanadu together."
"In an early draft of what would later become ""Shakugan no Shana"", Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a different dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but the appearance of an older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict between her and her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was very excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; this was the first time Ito drew illustrations for a book."
"Shortly before writing ""Shakugan no Shana"", Takahashi made his debut as an author with ""A/B Extreme"", which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, ""A/B Extreme"" was too difficult for readers to understand, so for his next work, he set out to write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of ""Shakugan no Shana"" was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor."
"""Shakugan no Shana"" began as a light novel series written by Yashichiro Takahashi, with illustrations drawn by Noizi Ito. ASCII Media Works published 26 volumes between November 9, 2002 and November 10, 2012 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint; 22 comprise the main story, while the other four are side story collections. A short story was later published in the September 2017 issue of ASCII Media Works' ""Dengeki Bunko Magazine"". Viz Media licensed the novels for English distribution in North America, but they only released two volumes in 2007. The novels are also licensed in South Korea by Daewon C.I., and in Taiwan and Hong Kong by Kadokawa Media."
"A 160-page guide book titled was published on December 10, 2005 by ASCII Media Works. Two more guide books were published by ASCII Media Works for the anime adaptations: on October 27, 2006 with 176 pages, and on October 19, 2009 with 168 pages. Four 128-page art books illustrated by Ito were published by ASCII Media Works: on February 25, 2005, on August 9, 2007, on August 10, 2009, and on August 9, 2013."
"A manga adaptation, illustrated by Ayato Sasakura, was serialized in ASCII Media Works' manga magazine ""Dengeki Daioh"" between the April 2005 and October 2011 issues. The individual chapters were collected and published in ten ""tankōbon"" volumes from October 27, 2005 and October 27, 2011. A special limited edition version of volume two was bundled with a booklet titled ""Grimoire"" including contributions from guest artists and writers for various illustrations, manga, and short stories. Viz Media licensed the manga for English distribution in North America. Viz released six volumes between April 17, 2007 and September 21, 2010, but then cancelled the release of the final four volumes. The manga is also licensed in South Korea by Daewon C.I., in Taiwan and Hong Kong by Kadokawa Media, and in Germany by Egmont."
"A second manga illustrated by Shii Kiya, titled , is based on the events of the tenth novel and began serialization in ASCII Media Works' manga magazine ""Dengeki Black Maoh"" on September 19, 2007.

"The game follows a branching plot line through eight chapters with five possible endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Sometimes during text progression, an ""active countdown"" minigame appears, which requires the player to press the game buttons in a specific order in a set time limit. Success or failure in these minigames influence which endings are viewed. During the turn-based battle sequences, the player assumes the role of Shana. The player uses a combination of fire, powers of unrestraint, and treasure tools to battle Crimson Denizens; and Shana is also able to use a special attack and defend."
"A Nintendo DS port of the game titled ""Shakugan no Shana DS"", developed by Vridge and published by MediaWorks, was released on March 29, 2007. Those who pre-ordered the game received a calendar spanning April 2007 to March 2008, and an art book of rough sketches by Ito titled was available for a limited time with the purchase of the game. A new story for the DS version was written by Takahashi. The game also contains an image gallery that allows the player to see what Shana and Yoshida Kazumi look like in different clothes, and a battle mode that lets the player fight against the computer with a character other than Shana."
"Shana appears as a playable character in the crossover RPG """" for the Nintendo DS, and other characters from ""Shakugan no Shana"" also appear in the game. Shana appears in the 2014 fighting game """", which features various Dengeki Bunko characters."
"In October 2014, the novels were reported to have sold over 8.6 million copies. As reported on the obi strip on volume 4 of the ""Shakugan no Shana"" manga released in January 2008, 1.2 million copies of the manga had been sold. Theron Martin from Anime News Network reviewed the manga and called it ""inferior"" to the anime, and notes the anime develops characters better than the manga. Martin also critiques the art, saying the background art has little detail, and while the action scenes are handled well enough, they are still sub-par compared to the same scenes in the anime. Martin concludes the review by warning the readers that ""[if] this is your first exposure to the franchise, look to the anime version to see it done right."""
"When reviewing the anime, Martin thought the first ""Shakugan no Shana"" always manages to slightly exceed expectations, and while its story elements may be typical, its execution is not. Martin noted that Shana's Flame Haze transformation is a visual highlight of the series, and other details are shown equal care. Reviewer Chris Beveridge of Mania.com felt uncomfortable about the morbid nature of the series. While Beveridge did not think the series is ""groundbreaking"", it proves to be a ""solid title"" that continuously gets better. The pacing in the middle of the first season was criticized for quickly ending an arc before ""going into a storyline that feels out of character for the show."" Martin's review of ""Shakugan no Shana Final"" was less positive; he described Yuji as having been made into a different character (though his complexity was praised), criticized the addition of a large number of prominent characters without sufficient development, and described some things as not making sense, although he praised Shana's development over the course of the third series."

= = = Assyrian nationalism = = =
"Assyrian nationalism or Assyrianism increased in popularity in the late 19th century in a climate of increasing ethnic and religious persecution of the Assyrians of what is today central Iraq, south-east Turkey and north-west Iran."
"Assyrian nationalism – the ideology of a united Assyrian people – is to a great degree based on a common and specific historic, ethnic, religious, linguistic, cultural and geographic background and heritage. It is espoused by almost all Mesopotamian East Aramaic-speaking Assyrians. They are exclusively Christians, with most Assyrians following the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Ancient Church of the East and Protestant groups like the Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church, as well as those that are irreligious."
"They are the indigenous peoples of Mesopotamia, whose ancestors established the Assyrian Empire in what is modern day Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. The empire lasted from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC until its collapse around 7th century AD. Assyrian nationalism is also common in the diaspora communities that left these areas for Armenia, Georgia, Russia, Lebanon, Jordan and Azerbaijan and migrant Assyrians from all these lands now residing in the European Union, United States, Canada and Australia."
"The United Nations Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) recognises the modern Assyrians as an indigenous people of south-east Turkey, north-east Syria and the fringes of north-west Iran, as does the Political Dictionary of the Modern Middle East."
"The ideology of Assyrian nationalism advocates Assyrian independence or autonomy within the regions they inhabit, and is based on the political and national unification of ethnic Assyrian followers of a number of Syriac Christian Churches (mainly those originating in, or based in and around northern Mesopotamia) with classical Syriac as its cultural language and Eastern Aramaic dialects as spoken tongues. Its main proponents in the late 19th century and early 20th century were Naum Faiq, Freydun Atturaya, Ashur Yousif, Malik Khoshaba and Farid Nazha."
"Within the Syriac Christian population in the near east as a whole, Assyrianism is confined specifically by certain geographic, ethnic, linguistic and confessional boundaries."
"Geographically and linguistically an Assyrianist position is held by those who speak Eastern Aramaic dialects who live or descend from those who once lived in the northern half of Iraq, the north-east of Syria, south-eastern Turkey and north-western Iran."
"Theologically, the position is a little more complex."
"Followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, Ancient Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church usually adhere to an Assyrianist position, although sometimes the term Chaldo-Assyrian is used to avoid theological conflict between Assyrian followers of the original Church of the East and those who broke away between the late 17th and early 19th centuries and entered communion with the Roman Catholic Church, which named this new church the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1830. Chaldean Catholics should not be confused with ancient Chaldeans, a long extinct people with whom they share no links."
"Eastern Aramaic-speaking populations who follow the Syriac Orthodox Church and Syriac Catholic Church and live or descend from those who lived in northern Iraq, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran and the southern Caucasus tend to regard themselves as Assyrian, whereas formerly Western Aramaic-speaking and now almost exclusively Arabic-speaking Levantine members of these churches from the rest of Syria, Lebanon and south-central Turkey often espouse an Aramean, Phoenician (more common among Maronite Christians) or even Greek heritage (see Arameanism and Phoenicianism."
"This is in part due to the term ""Syriac"" being generally accepted by the majority of scholars to be a 9th-century BC derivation of ""Assyrian"" which for many centuries was used in specific and sole relation to the Assyrians and Assyria, and in part because the majority of the Christian population of these areas are not geographically from what was Assyria or Mesopotamia, and thus do not identify with an Assyrian heritage in the way that the ""pre-Arab"", ""pre-Islamic"" Mesopotamian Assyrians from Iraq, north-east Syria, south-east Turkey, Iran and the Caucasus naturally do."
"According to Raif Toma, Assyrianism goes beyond mere Syriac patriotism, and ultimately aims at the unification of all ""Mesopotamians"", properly qualifying as ""Pan-Mesopotamianism"". This variant of Assyrianism is independent of Christian, ethno-religious identity and qualifies as a purely ethnic nationalism, in that it identifies the Assyrian people as the heirs of the Assyrian Empire, and as the indigenous population of Mesopotamia, as opposed to Arabism, which is identified as a chronologically later, non-indigenous, and foreign intrusive element. This is expressed for example in the Assyrian calendar introduced in the 1950s, which has as its era 4750 BC; then thought to be the approximate date of construction of the first (pre-historical, pre-Semitic) temple to Ashur."
"Organisations advocating Assyrianism are the Assyrian Democratic Organisation, Assyrian National Congress, Assyrian Universal Alliance (since 1968) and Shuraya (since 1978). The Assyrian flag was designed by the Assyrian Universal Alliance in 1968."
"Mordechai Nisan, the Israeli Orientalist, also supports the view that Assyrians should be named specifically as such in an ethnic and national sense, are the descendants of their ancient namesakes, and denied self-expression for political, ethnic and religious reasons."
"Dr. Arian Ishaya, a historian and anthropologist of UCLA, states that the confusion of names applied to the Assyrians, and a denial of Assyrian identity and continuity, is on one hand borne out of 19th- and early 20th-century imperialism and condescension on the part of the west, rather than by historical fact, and on the other hand by long-held Islamic, Arab, Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian policies, whose purpose is to divide the Assyrian people along false lines and deny their singular identity, with the aim of preventing the Assyrians having any chance of unity, self-expression and potential statehood."
"Naum Elias Yaqub Palakh (better known as Naum Faiq), a 19th-century advocate of Assyrian nationalism from the Syriac Orthodox Church community in Diyarbakir, encouraged Assyrians to unite regardless of tribal and theological differences."
"Ashur Yousif, an Assyrian Protestant from the same region of south-eastern Turkey as Faiq, also espoused Assyrian unity during the early 20th century, stating that the Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic and Syriac Orthodox Assyrians were one people, divided purely upon religious lines."
Freydun Atturaya (Freydon Bet-Abram Atoraya) also advocated Assyrian unity and was a staunch supporter of Assyrian identity and nationalism and the formation of an ancestral Assyrian homeland in the wake of the Assyrian genocide.
"Farid Nazha, an influential Syrian-born Assyrian nationalist, was deeply critical of the leaders of the various churches adhered to by Assyrians, accusing the Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church of creating divisions among them, when their joint ethnic and national identity should be paramount."
"The ideology of Assyrian independence is a political movement that supports the re-creation of Assyria as a nation state corresponding to part of the original Assyrian homeland, in the Nineveh plains of northern Iraq. The issue of Assyrian independence has been brought up many times throughout the course of history from before World War I to the present-day Iraq War. The Assyrian-inhabited area of Iraq is located primarily but not exclusively in the Ninawa-Mosul region in northern Iraq where the ancient Assyrian capital of Nineveh was located. This area is known as the ""Assyrian Triangle."" Assyrians are generally found all over northern Iraq, including in and around the cities of Mosul, Erbil, Kirkuk, Dohuk, Amadia and Rawanduz, and there are a fair number of exclusively Assyrian towns, villages, hamlets and agricultural communities in the north, together with others that have significant Assyrian populations. Other communities exist over the borders in south-eastern Turkey (Mardin, Diyarbakir, Harran, Bohtan, Kültepe, Hakkari), north-eastern Syria (Al Hasakah, Qamlishi Khabur delta) region and north-western Iran (Urmia)."
"In post-Ba'thist Iraq, the Assyrian Democratic Movement (or ADM) was one of the smaller political parties that emerged in the social chaos of the occupation. Its officials say that while Assyrian members of the ADM also took a full and active part in the liberation of the key oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul in the north, the Assyrians were not invited to join the steering committee that was charged with defining Iraq's future."
"The continuity of Assyrian identity is endorsed and well supported by many non-Assyrian modern Assyriologists, Iranologists, orientalists, linguists, geneticists and historians, while others see the connection between ancient Assyria and the modern Assyrians as more complex. There was Assyrian resistance to Persian rule in Achaemenid Assyria. H. W. F. Saggs in his ""The Might That Was Assyria"" clearly supports cultural and historical continuity, as do Richard Nelson Frye, Simo Parpola, Robert D. Biggs and Patricia Crone among others."
= = = Sylvioidea = = =
"Sylvioidea is a superfamily of passerine birds, one of at least three major clades within the Passerida along with the Muscicapoidea and Passeroidea. It contains about 1300 species including the Old World warblers, Old World babblers, swallows, larks and bulbuls. Members of the clade are found worldwide, but fewer species are present in the Americas."
"The superfamily Sylvioidea was first proposed in 1990 in the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds based on DNA–DNA hybridization experiments. More recent studies based on comparison of DNA sequences have failed to support the inclusion of some families such as Certhiidae (treecreepers), Sittidae (nuthatches), Paridae (tits and chickadees) and Regulidae (goldcrests and kinglets) but instead support the addition of Alaudidae (larks)."
"Some of the families within the Sylvioidea have been greatly redefined. In particular, the Old World warbler family Sylviidae and Old World babbler family Timaliidae were used as wastebin taxa and included many species which have turned out not to be closely related. Several new families have been created and some species have been moved from one family to another."
