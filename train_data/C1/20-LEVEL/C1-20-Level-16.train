Not for all the hassle we get.

Well ninety per cent of the time you shouldn't be where we are cos it's no cars.
Absolute rubbish.
Unless you're a taxi.
Don't they know who I am?
Fog gets in.
Course it does.
All caravans are like that.
"But you've got to have those caravan, those vents because the van is so small and you've got gas supplied."
It's rules and regulations.
If you've got a gas fire in
It it means that they haven't been doing their duty in the winter then.
If they guarantee to put the mattresses all up  in the dry  they asked you to do yours  or did they say they would do it?
They done it.
Well how's the damn thing on the bed then?
Because they put it back there for these people  that was coming in.
Oh.
They didn't seemingly.
We don't know.
Do we?
No.
Well there were no  there anyway.
So they say.
It's all hearsay.
Well alright.
Perhaps the man was working part-time.
Perhaps he never noticed the .
Perhaps the people were in the van  and found the beds wet and said well we can't sleep here and they slept in the sit with the fire on.
I dunno.
It could have been.
cos there was only two here.
cold weather in any case.
Eh?
It's cold weather in any case.
That's right.
Shut the lights.
You don't know.
"Do they,"
Yes.
Oh.
"Mind, it is from  er,what they do is send them through the post, just check 'em, make sure everything's alright, ain't it."
"Did they ask you what you were leaving, and things like that."
No.
No.
Oh.
"I I forget to ask him, to make it"
What.
I don't whether they do  or not.
What.
See a man about a dog.
Oh.
Time he got his scruffy
"If anybody comes June, just say, I have you been in touch with yet, and they'll say no, well, say well,"
"Sasha, do you mind."
You'll have to go with
"Mind you can always say to  you caught me at a bad time, you say, it's supposed to have appointment only, but just say, can you, is there any chance of you coming back."
Yeah.
Yeah.
You put appointment only on board.
"But if you're not too bad, I mean, it don't really matter, does it."
"No, don't say it on board, does it."
"Yeah, they put it on board, if you if you having them by by appointment"
By appointment.
"only, they put it on board."
Stick come in front of that.
"Right, well."
"Oh, shit, we're having"
It's nowt shit.
"Take us as we find us,"
Ooh  it's early in the morning.
Yeah well I said to you
"There was skid marks all over and the traffic was right back down the A seventeen, when I got there it"
Would it be sort of before your dad went?
Perhaps say quarter to nine?
Cos I saw two police car go along there.
Might have been.
They were flashing their lights.
Wouldn't like to say really cos then you  when you start at quarter to five
No you
you haven't got no idea of the
No.
time sort of pass
But I did hear this one  and I run to the window
"By the time we do our morning and the , you're then getting up sort of thing you see"
Yeah.
this is it.
And then it's
And then there's two police cars going towards Wisbech I saw them
mummy.
flashing
Ah!
lights.
What's the matter dear?
So it  no this is broad daylight
I want another glass of sherry.
You better ask grandma.
He wants another glass of sherry grandma.
What time?
It'd be broad daylight so it'd be a bit later.
"And that's all you have, you don't have"
Yeah.
Two ounces as well as all the ginger?
"And puts it into roast in the oven, and takes it out after fifty minutes  and then  you get  Philadelphia cheese and white wine  melt it down in the wine"
Mm mm!
"stirring a bit more  you know, crushed root ginger"
Mm mm.
and that's your sauce to serve on the side.
"I tell, you've never eaten anything like it!"
Is it nice?
I could eat the tail.
Really?
It's gorgeous.
"But i , I keep saying to Michael it's so expensive!"
"I mean root ginger's like a pound a pound, or two pound a pound."
"No, not really."
"It's not, it's not as expensive as it used to be."
It's got more and more popular strangely enough.
But she does ginger tea.
Oops.
So do I?
Oh I haven't drunk ginger tea before.
Well I'll make you ginger tea.
Well we never tried that before.
"But that's sounds what, can I just ask again, so you have a roast chicken yo , and you  mix two"
A pound of Philadelphia cheese.
Yeah.
But she does about two pound of root ginger.
Most normal people would have half a pound at the most.
That's two good roots.
You crush it or do you chop
"Two whole, bash it."
it up?
Bash it?
To rebuild his rear end.
Hope he comes out of it.
"Well as long as nothing breaks, nothing gets ."
"No, now way must he strain so she's, she's got some liquid paraffin to drop on his dinner."
Quite a major operation.
He's been ever so bright.
"Walking about quite well, he did turn to lick his  under his tail but his little tail was wagging."
And he was walking fine.
He even stopped and had a tinkle.
See they don't know it's to hurt.
No  no.
No I think I think animals are fantastic they way they put up with pain.
Because they can't tell you.
And after a major operation there he was wagging his tail and
You don't know the threshold of pain in animals do you?
Can't tell you.
Well no.
Very seldom you hear a dog or a  in pain.
Oh you do.
Oh
What's the matter?
Odd.
What's odd?
I think it's getting better.
The muscle's gone
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Cup of herbal tea?
An aspirin?
Nothing I can do you for?
Oh you're  book's upstairs.
Do you want that?
".Is it actual pain then, or stiffness?"
What is it?
Ten P off.
Oh!
That's it.
No.
Oh no he's
He's very good!
He's very
Oh well
good!
He's a good boy!
He's !
"Yeah, all fluffy and  good aren't you?"
Tongue hanging out!
Got lovely bright eyes!
Looking very well these days!
"Masters again, yeah."
What do you mean masters?
Mastered to get into the race.
"Just gave it some thought, give it some thought and initiative and you're in!"
"I bet, I bet  he's scared"
"I walked down this ledge , walked down the stage and there's  for security guards."
You cannot walk past them if  you're going in that way.
So we had to go  past this little shed which is right up  right up this stupid grass earthy bank  right over the side so we could see quickly how to get in.
"Went right round the bottom of this field, looked round the bank and there was just a bloody great  hole in the gate  massive!"
"Walked through there and got to the simulator  took our jackets off, pretended we'd already been in  walked straight past and we were right on site!"
We wasn't aware it was there.
"Well I thought, saved us twenty quid!"
So all  ?
"We were going , we were in!"
We're in!
We're in!
I should have done that straight away.
Well spotted.
I will do it now.
"Say that again Paul, please."
"I'm sorry Paul, I can't understand you."
Something about an extractor?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It might be harmful to your lungs.
It hasn't been used yet.
But it's not er as good as
Well that's what it says it is on the erm  on the outside.
Orange spot on me notes .
Mm?
see what it was.
Now it's green.
That means it's been used with  copper.
We have a suspicion that  very little reaction has taken place because in fact very few bubbles have  risen to the surface.
This could be  I don't think acid spends itself as it sits in a bottle does it?
No.
It stays the same configuration.
Mm.
It's erm if you've used that lots and lots of times it may have used up all the .
It  may have exhausted mayn't it?
Yeah.
So  because it worked last time I used it.
I'm hoping that it has worked this time.
It's been in there much longer than  I'd normally leave it.
"So, it will either have not worked at all for some obscure reason  or it will have worked well and ."
"So whatever has happened, I'm now going to remove it from the acid."
I'm going to wash it.
"But like I said, it  it's just, it's gonna get moved like, no cost to you like, you know what I mean?"
It's er
Yeah.
But an advantage to them!
Is that what you mean?
"But if something went wrong then, this caravan was burnt  that's the end of it!"
They  might just take those down.
"Well i , cos the co , the insurance wouldn't cover it?"
Cos they have got these records   will have these records.
"No, you'll have a certificate then, and all, saying that the caravan covered, it'll be tested every year then."
So it isn't going to be used this week?
"But, no"
You know?
not this week.
"No, not this week."
So we shall lose our insurance?
"like that, yeah."
innit?
"See that man and woman that , yeah?"
Did you see these people in there?
What people?
A man and a woman.
There was two people sitting there.
They've just gone out.
No.
After you came.
"Well they've, they bought a  a caravan down here, a brand new one!"
Yeah.
And they bought it last summer  and they've had trouble ever since!
And they're going around asking people what !
What's up with their's then?
Well they've had to move the caravan !
"And if we if if we ring up, he puts he just puts the phone straight down, soon as you tell him who it is."
Probably goes back from when they went
"He said, I, she said I can live without him anyhow."
"It'll drop off, that."
It won't.
It will.
"Come on,yella."
"I found some Mighty Muscle in garage, you know."
How much.
You know that big round tin.
"I, not how much is in it, but it'll probably be about that much in bottom."
"I know  wanting  to do this room, really, 'cos it would be too cold."
Get away with one.
I wish we'd just  too cold.
"You won't, as far as  we're having to buy coal at that price."
"No, I know."
"Every time we have any spare money, it has to go on pigging coal."
how much.
You know that big round tin?
Yeah.
"I don't know how much is in it, but probably be about that much in bottom."
"might be  really, couldn't  too cold."
Get away with one.
"I wish we'd afford some  I mean, it's cold."
"You won't  while we're having the buy coal, at that price."
"No, I know."
"Every time we have any spare money, it has to go on pigging coal."
"We'll probably just buy some, and that lad'll ring up."
He probably will.
Especially if this mild weather stops.
"But it is mild today, ain't it."
Yeah.
Mm.
so can we talk about what your losses are?
We w suggest that you have losses under the heading of er
Mm.
"disruption to traffic, loss of revenue, so on and so forth"
Mm.
and I think we have er a a part to play in that.
Mm.
What about my extra costs?
And your extra supervision costs.
No.
I was thinking about the client's extra costs.
Oh.
Then the  gain
actually.
overrun by three weeks
the fact that we've still got our supervision
Yeah.
"But, but we put that in."
Yeah.
But during
Not only that
Yeah.
"But we, we should be prompting them."
course that we know about it.
"Well there's the fact that he might have borrowed the money for a ten million pound project, and he can't have a use of it because it's named  and he's paying interest"
on that ten million pounds.
Extended plus services for diverted traffic and so on.
be discussed.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So what
You'll end up with about a dozen letters on mantel again cos I always forget to post things.
Well I'll post that tomorrow.
Well there's no rush.
"Aye you can, yeah."
"Well usually if there's not a stamp wanted, is there a stamp wanted?"
No.
"Yeah usually if there's no stamp wanted I get one of lasses while I'm at work, they'll drop it off for me."
I always say will you do me a favour and they shove it in box.
Erm  ah
?
"No, shower."
shower?
Why do you want your hair washing?
No.
I'm gonna have a proper bath later.
See you later.
"Well I says to her, I says what,do won't they have a big gap?"
But some of these tapes are funny.
Why's that?
Well you know where they're working outside all time?
And traffic.
"Traffic and all sorts, see I were talking to Joyce this morning"
Mm.
"and, I meant to listen to it but I forgot"
Oh.
"and there were buses and lorries and, quite a lot of the tapes, they've got buses and lorries and all sorts, with working outside."
With you being a lollipop lady it's bound to happen innit?
Mm.
Haven't you thought of going back to doctors?
Haven't you thought it costs three pound bloody sixty a prescription?
"Yeah, and he always writes me out a couple and I ain't got the money."
Tt.
a lot of our clients
"But on a bigger job you can, you can put the resource in can't you?"
Yeah.
"But a lot of our client's finance sections, don't see the difference between a big and a little job they see some pigeon holes in their spreadsheet and they want to put something in there."
Anything.
"And th they, they've got this sort of"
But this is where we need to talk to the client
Yes.
Of course they are.
isn't it?
"J j just agree with client he might, might be  prepared to accept on a quarterly basis"
Yeah.
you know?
I mean we don't necessarily have to give him it every month.
One could argue
Yeah.
if we're not careful we'll be causing him work.
Oh.
know what they want half of them anyway when they're
Ah.
Let us halt it there.
the customers.
Yeah.
As er I said before.
"Let us sit down, Trev, and see what is sensible"
for us to provide them with.
"Go and talk to them and say look, this is what we can provide to you."
It will be meaningful.
Is that good enough?
"And the chances are they'll say, bloody hell, that's marvellous."
Because what they're getting now is nothing.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
"Also, we are a much more tolerant society, generally."
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"We can encompass people who are a bit different nowadays, which they couldn't."
Yeah.
Couldn't in those days.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
"I think they use the phrase now, do their own thing."
"That  yeah, yeah, yeah"
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
"Yes, yeah."
"So we now have erm, reference to the bible and the erm, prodigal son."
"The prodigal son was a black sheep to his father, and to his older brother."
But how different were the reactions of the two.
"His adventure started off quite normally, as I'm sure you'll remember from the erm, from the parable."
"Every child must break away from the parental fold, and establish his own personal identity."
Things began to go wrong when he got into bad company.
He had then asked for his share of his inheritance.
"He wanted it then and there, not later."
"With money in his possession, was he a pray to the unscrupulous."
I'm sure he was.
He had journeyed into a far country.
That showed initiative.
But did it cut him off from the guidance he needed?
"The story relates, that he spent all."
"He was not prudent enough to have saved, so he began to be in want."
Yes.
"I I I I went to to a place first and er I  and I I went home you know, without them knowing."
mother took me back  by the hair
Mhm.
By my hair.
Did did they know you'd gone home?
Pardon?
Did they know that you went?
No.
No?
"What did your mother say then, was she cross with you?"
"No she said, Oh, she said, What do you want?"
"So I says, I I don't like there I want to go I want to come back."
"So she said, Look here my dear girl, she said, you go back and tell the lady that you"
Do you remember how much they paid you?
Pardon?
well there was a lot of call for that.
Mhm.
"And women worked in that department, whereas the men worked at the huge broadloom"
Mhm.
"looms which are very heavy, very heavy, and through fashion, fashion changing and I mean people don't have these things any more."
A lot of pubs and hotels will do the the their places out in these narrow sections so if one gets worn they can lift it up and
"Mhm, yeah."
replace it.
"But houses, when you're doing a house you, you don't tend to do that now, you just have your broad loom"
Mm.
and fit it in.
So in that relationship
"the d the, the women are redundant as it were."
Yes.
"There only is two, well there are two, one, they do shiftwork."
Mhm.
Oh okay.
"Oh I suppose we've gotta, oh well what did we do last time?"
"I remember the problem was last time sending those little plans out, the Ormskirk you know?"
"Give them the drawing number so we sent a transmittal note, course we never got a transmittal note back."
It's best to avoid that.
Yeah.
"Erm  right well I think the thing to do is, on  beyond that is to make sure we work through the checklist."
Okay?
"Erm  Now layouts, site layouts."
Yeah maps and things.
So are you leaving the ball in my court on that?
On what?
On the statutory undertakers.
Cos I can probably get some information out of here.
I think i if you want  er I mean you're quite happy to draft a letter?
Yeah.
I mean that's a
I mean again
standard thing that goes to all of them
"we need to write them, warn yeah, and we ask them to let us know what they've got planned don't we?"
Yeah.
So you could send them a letter with a little diagram that
Yeah.
"I wonder how good that is, yes I think that's alright isn't it?"
"Then they wouldn't  they'd understand what we, that meant wouldn't they?"
Yeah but that's got specific things on .
True.
"Yeah well all we did for Ormskirk was, it was just an O S map and we just drew a bloody great circle round it"
and said this is the study area.
That's probably the best thing isn't it?
Yeah.
And blow up
And mum and Chrissy slept in the car.
"and and th that's ri they were, they, mum was gonna stay at home and I was gonna take you for a ride on the train"
Yeah.
and then mum decided she was going to come so we took the car.
"And we might, might well have been on that train that had the crash."
Yes.
Thank goodness we didn't.
Well it was one of those things wasn't it?
Well it's a good job mum came.
Mm mm.
"I hope, I hope ."
Well we went past the crash and we could see that there was something going on but we weren't sure what it was.
"It happened just after we went past the, just before."
You could see  er  a couple of Land Rovers going down with flashing blue lights and things towards
I
the crossing.
And th th and they would be police ones if they'd got blue lights and
Mm mm.
"so did you, could you hear the sirens?"
No I couldn't.
"But erm  when we, by the time we got into Hull I heard it on the radio what had happened  and we went to the toy fair and then we came back  and there was er  you could see all the ambulances and everything still there."
And the train was there leaning over.
But half of it was still on the rails.
Yes it was the front coaches went off.
Front coaches?
Onto the side I think.
Well what sort of express?
It was erm  well what do you think it would be?
Er  I think it must have been a multiple unit.
That's right.
It was a diesel multiple unit.
And it was before you had your pacers and sprinters.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
auth authority from the project manager.
"But there may be, there may be"
I think we're discussing two issues here.
"Can we, can we bottom the V O"
Yeah.
one as a start .
"I don't see there's a problem with the V O one, because"
It's
"nobody nobody can issue V Os unless they're delegated to do so, in, in the letter that's signed by me."
I rely on you gentlemen
"And, and they have got the permission of the project manager to spend that money."
Yeah.
Correct.
Yeah.
I rely on you gentlemen to make sure
Too right.
"that the people who are delegated, are competent to discharge those duties."
Yeah.
"An and I must admit that I wouldn't, I would not expect to see anybody delegated within the contract at less than M S one level."
"Because I just don't think they i they're competent to do the duties of the engineer's representative, because you need a knowledge of the contract."
Tt.
Well.
"There are some jobs that, that we get involved with  are very very small"
We've had John  on
Yeah.
John  's been on jobs and he's er
Well.
"He's been as the R E, which is reasonable to be fair."
Yeah.
So's Steve
"a and, and, and the S on the M as it were."
Yes.
Right.
"The oth the other, the other option is for us to hold that."
because it was supposed to be briefed last
Mm.
month.
"Well in that, in that case"
when
"I've seen, I've seen all this"
Mm.
in that case when
It is ours.
Well we can't
We've got a
Right.
"In that case Jim you say to your staff that you're gonna have a dialogue with Dave  and myself, with a view to confirming how it will be implemented as far as your organization is concerned."
But surely
"we can still issue it, we can still brief"
This issue
that issue?
Of course you can.
Yes.
Well.
It is
work
It's been issued Roger.
"I think, I, I personally, I think everyone's got to work to it until they find it doesn't work."
"Ca can't you just, can't Jim just brief his staff, but er as far as that's concerned w he takes it that the Q S has asked him to do all the site measurement er and that they will then produce the certification"
Mm.
based on that?
Yeah.
Right.
He wrote it and handed it to me for this newsletter and I ran out of space.
Could put the green councillors ten reasons to be one in I suppose.
Yes
Oh yes definitely .
Anything to fit .
It will depend what the space situation is.
A nice grovel can go in.
Advert for the letter box sticker.  want stuff or is it contact through the office to .
Yes.
Unless you have unless you have supplied a specific date.
Erm if you like I can provide a a specific spiel.
Seeing as it is the you know the birthday edition.
It will it is quite nice er make a thing of it.
I think also if we could have some sort of timings when people could turn up.
Yes sure.
Okay I'll knock those up and I'll have to run that by my household.
Mm yeah.
So when do you need those by then?
Erm er middle of next week I suppose roughly .
Okay.
I would say next meeting is at it's the one time we're going to have one.
Erm and do we have anything else to go in this newsletter?
Erm
I could keep one in the green Eurobonds advert.
Yep
Yeah.
certainly.
Fine idea.
And if anybody thinks of any more diary dates or anything.
Yeah I'll let you know.
I think there might be a I've got one  announcement you can put  from that.
Is it more or less straight up?
More or less horizontal?
About forty five or?
It's probably about seventy.
Right.
"Maybe seventy, maybe eighty."
"So you could draw a rough sketch like that,"
Mm.
"just measure it with a protractor, or measure along here."
That would be  if we drew wh wh how do we find the gradient really?
"We draw a little triangle, don't we?"
Yeah.
"So at point one, it's nought."
"What would, what would that be at the point two?"
For X
Three.
equals two?
Two three.
"So we could get the point two three, and we could take the gradient of that as being fairly close to the gradient of the curve."
Mm.
Erm how can we get it more accurately reflecting what's happening there?
Right.
Point something.
So if we did something like that that's where we want it.
That's where we want the gradient
Mhm.
"and we took a line from there to there, where this is that's where X is equal to, that'll go far."
Nought nought point nine say.
"And just the other side of it, where X equals one point one."
Mm.
"We're going to have, difference along the X axis will be nought point two."
Yeah.
"And everything's very nice , lovely!"
Mm.
"Because you want the right size  join  what you put in  they hadn't got any, no more of these"
No I said to Geoff well I hope he don't come back.
Who?
They're supposed to
"That bloke, I don't want him coming"
.
"Well dear you won't worry, I'll shall soon tell him to !"
"You ought to  you ought to say to him, I shall ring the police, you come round here any more!"
"people in the, in the  bay I wouldn't"
No I'm not!
"I don't want him, it worried me that he might come and bother your mother."
Yeah.
No!
There's no  this time.
I can stick up for myself!
Oh!
So he won't  you just don't
I did that
I know you can.
old bloke!
"End of the day   and if you don't let him in, he don't have to have any"
No.
anyway!
"Well I tell you something if he ke , if he does start to hassle us I shall ring the police and I shall tell them!"
Mm.
I should use
"I shan't have no qualms about it, I shall say well he's hassling  me and my mother-in-law and we can do without it!"
"That old boy that I spoke to, when his  he was with his daughter, I said you give me my bloody keys and you  money!"
I gotta move!
I said well there's a wheelbarrow down there mate!
Do they still do it?
the P E teacher is supposedly collecting aluminium cans and  we've been through various daft schemes of stopping the children from throwing the cans everywhere because we've got this coke machine.
And we even had one where they paid a ten p deposit  on a can so they paid forty p instead of thirty or whatever.
And I got hardly any cans back.
Or they did was b buy them from the school canteen where they were still thirty!
And the coke machine wasn't used.
Well why not er encourage the canteen to charge forty
They didn't  but then they had
as well?
"Well, they won't because they they they have to make money in order to survive."
The more money they make the better for them.
They have to run it as a business now.
For profit I'm afraid.
Er oh I did have one Polish lad who's now left who used to go round looking for all the cans and he'd  then collect the ten p's!
scheme folded.
Through lack of support.
So what else is mentioned here?
I think that  still holds.
"And I can check, I will go and ."
And car batteries is the same.
Other batteries I'll check.
Pills er  you check
Yeah.
.
Furniture erm  yeah I think that's.
Is there a second hand furniture shop now in Bishop's Stortford?
There is one isn't there?
Is there one down by the Causeway?
Yes there is.
Who is going to check that?
Well I can check it.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah but they're like four interviews on a sheet and really sort of
Yeah.
But I mean who
"what, how w , what are w , have we got our current ones, our standard ones?"
Yeah.
Cos presumably it would be best to use those wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"I think  you could, you could accommodate it if you just reduced that sli the, what the normal one slightly, and there's t there's room to put the er translation on the top."
I'll do you a mock up of that and see what you
"Yes, good idea."
what you think.
I think either that or have it on a separate sheet.
But I would have thought it's best to put it on there if we can.
How many are we gonna want?
Three thousand?
Perhaps it's worth having a separate print run for that isn't it?
"Yeah, might be."
"It's not  I think if they use this offset thing, the masters last about five hundred so you're not  it's not, it's not a silly amount."
Yeah.
"Would it take, oh wait a minute!"
Three thousand interviews
What
"say, would you think three thousand interviews?"
I'm just trying to think what we were averaging.
But I mean that  one of them's not gonna  you're not gonna get as many  on that B road.
Will we  will we want those?
Oh I can't remember you know what we used for Ormskirk
It doesn't matter if we  if we get too many cos you can always use
Well that's it.
Can't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
or with a specific letter  for them saying you know welcome if you  if you feel like it.
Actually just just quickly  er I just noticed on that list of your  questionnaires that we got back a couple  that they didn't actually know what was going on.
And that you know perhaps this is er erm publicity wise I wonder whether we're falling a bit short on our  publicity.
Well.
they didn't know  I mean  like first newsletter we've had in ages.
And it's something else that we need to get
we can't just sort of
No exactly
"We've got to get, we should get more publicity."
But it's ever so easy for somebody to sit at home and say well you should be doing this and you should be doing that
Oh yeah yeah.
and not doing
"No I'm I'm not sa , I'm not saying."
I'm not saying you should be  doing anything I'm just er
"No I didn't mean you, I meant them!"
No well .
I well really  I don't think you should say  you're not doing enough!
No
I think last year more or less shows that we really have to concentrate on one thing.
Do it and then plan
Yeah.
plan the next .
Because otherwise we just
And then write about it if we want to.
Yeah.
So what what we'll do quickly  to write and inform them all that we're doing this stall and   won't we?
Yes.
We could even send them  a recycling sheet.
Yeah.
And the most recent newsletter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But at least they were happy, you know what I mean."
'Cos they were with other birds.
"But I never missed, I never missed him."
I don't think you get attached to birds like you do animals.
I don't think you get attached to birds like dogs.
Not like dogs and cats.
No.
"I mean Albert said,if we do get that bungalow, we are  'cos the owner, he said she'll disappear."
She'll disappear.
"I mean I'll be upset about our Whisky, 'cos we're, I mean, we've had a long time, although she's not a pet  pet, you know what I mean."
What  feel like.
"Well, they they just, they go away when you take them somewhere fresh."
and they don't know where they are.
That one.
They're very very
"Sometimes, you're lucky, and you know, if if you keep them in long enough"
"We've always had cats, always had cats, when we lived at  and we moved into  and we'd had this one cat years, it were old cat."
"I wouldn't say it was ready for popping off, you know what I mean."
Yeah
"It were always fit and we were only there a fortnight, three weeks disappeared."
"I mean, if our Whisky died, I wouldn't be as upset about it, as I would about these."
But if she disappeared I'd be worried all time.
And yet
Aye.
"You know, like when our Dawn's kittens disappeared."
"It, they weren't bothered, I think Mick took them away meself."
Yeah.
I'm convinced he did.
I think he did.
"But I were I were upset about that, you know."
without a break.
Well maybe sometimes it's not their fault.
Most of the time people don't want to be
Yeah.
on the street.
But how do you know that?
"I mean, how could you be so sure it isn't their fault?"
They tell us.
Well those people out on the streets tell me that all the time.
"I mean, have you seen the reports?"
Of course I've seen the reports!
I'm not blind!
"Well the majority of them are a , abused or get thrown out of mental centres, I mean, some of them just run away from home because they want to  and that's only a minority, lots of them have"
I mean
very good reasons!
Well it's still not my problem is it?
Yeah!
It's everybody's problem!
Stop voting Conservative you stupid old bag!
"Yeah , and if you vote for"
There's nothing wrong with being Conservative!
"I i if Labour ca party came in the unemployment would be, unemployment, homelessness would be"
Have you got a family?
even worse!
Of course I've got a family!
How large?
If you don't mind me asking?
I have three children!
How old are they?
And have any of them contemplated running away?
Well how do I know!
I would !
"There's  one's fourteen, one's sixteen, and one's nineteen."
so they don't have the problem of of of of of
Yeah
the hassle of stocking it and so on.
Yeah.
So you know
I've just got this David  thing and and the  thing in the background.
I didn't want to tread on toes.
Well well you've got a lovely you've got a lovely opportun
You've got a lovely opportunity there to sell the non-price benefits.
Yeah.
Just have a try and h try and set up a c a a a meeting with this Sally and your engineering winger
Yeah okay.
and don't talk price at all.
No.
And than at a later stage go bock and have a go at Sally and and remind her of all these good things that you talked about .
The problem is we're buttoned down on deliveries on standard bearings cos of the balls up about .
Well okay so you've got to talk
.
you've got to talk your way through that.
It's the precision bearings that's really the prize.
I mean that's why .
Yes.
"And and and of course now that er now that we've got the total business beginning to operate as one, the chances of letting them down on standard bearings is very much smaller than it ever was before."
Yeah.
The problem the reason we've let her down on standard bearings is because of this changeover.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
You see it's got nothing to do with the with our
No no.
competence as a supplier.
No.
Yeah okay.
See they'll maintain that
Yeah that's right!
Social security .
I said you're paid the same.
No.
Social security is when you haven't got no money  and he has got money.
Well I ain't got any but they won't give me any!
Well that's like when older people when they save for their  retirement and that  you know
Yeah.
they can't get things cheap like bus passes and all that can they?
No.
"Well  Well I think, I, I don't think it pays you to save up  er"
No.
for your retirement and so you'll be comfortable off  cos you might as well live off your state like everybody else.
Yeah.
You might
"as well enjoy your money as you go along, why bother to have any!"
They were saying on the television the other day
Why bother!
the new taxes
"Well I certainly isn't going to, Sarah!"
The new tax law thing
I shall get as much out the system as I can mate!
Me me.
Well I told you that.
if they go up  erm  the government now wanna
Help!
"bring this new tax, but instead of poll tax and community charge and that  it's gonna be like a new erm  property tax."
"Oh yeah, I think I've heard of that."
"And er  what they're saying that, sort of, you get people, shall we say, older people who"
He's
are retired so they got no income  and then perhaps been left the house
It it's blue.
"I'm sure, she said it's blue."
It's got some cream in it as well ain't it.
"Well,more, so I couldn't see, but I just, to me it was just like er, thought it was like minky coloured."
"But mind ya,more like a, but what I was gonna say is,"
Suppose to be a  but I mean
"On back of it, on back of it, she's got like all them tapestry pictures laid over back of it."
Yeah.
"She got, same on chairs, all, you can hardly see the suite, 'cos she's got, she says, and er, I says to her, I says to her, oh it's nice your suite, innit."
"She says yeah, if I can keep it clean, she got all cushions covered up, well like er, er"
"Keep it clean, there's only them two buggers."
"I know, but what's the point of having a new suite, and having old covers on it like that."
"They make me laugh, when they sit in 'ouse with blanket round them, so they don't have to turn 'eating up."
I don't
"Aye, you go in there and it's empty that other"
That's empty.
"I know, I see it."
"I tell you what, you  to make mistakes in your life, I mean and, I just, well one of those things that  that I'm pleased about, is that I just  George when"
Don't work.
Aye.
When what?
When I stopped with Colin.
Oh well.
"You don't know how green, how green the grass is until you actually stand"
You can't go till your dad comes.
"Why, I'm going home all by myself, then."
"Well, get off there."
get on with it.
We do
You'll end up with a smack bum.
"Benjy, will you leave her alone."
Are you  have you told her to leave me alone?
Six.
So the gradient
Six .
"Wh when you do it to sort of fairly accurately like that, it  six."
"When we did it fairly roughly, it came to one point two?"
Yeah.
"Erm  six Because, because we didn't do this bit did we?"
That should have gone I think that was wrong.
That should have been six times nought point two over
Minu
Yeah.
Which again comes to six.
"So, that's more like it."
"What's the, what angle has a tan of six, then?"
Now it'll be in the seventy or eighties.
Eighty.
Eighty?
Good.
to be fifty.
Erm you can do that with any curve.
"If I gave you sort of X to the seventeen or something, well you could put two values in."
"And you could bring them fairly close together and say well I can't tell you exactly what the gradient is at that point, but if you draw a tiny little line and take the gradient of that."
Mm.
"That's er that's good enough, that's close enough."
That's a very good approximation.
Yeah.
"So gradients are a very important part of, of sketching a curve."
Erm you already pointed out some of the important points where the gradient gets to zero.
"Erm  does, does  things that might be interesting?"
Okay.
"You've already mentioned it earlier, actually, symmetry."
Not always symmetrical about this axis.
"No, I can't see the argument!"
"Well, to me you shouldn't have twenty five kids anyway!"
Well that's dictatorship
"Because because it, I would have a dictatorship on that!"
"I mean that's, I would have"
"Well that's, alright well  well that's"
"control of the world population, I se"
I would limit to two children.
"I would er, have control of the"
That's another argument!
world population.
Well fair enough!
But
Yeah.
that is another argument!
"It is, we're on the road ."
"That is er, that would mu , that would be my first priority."
Oh !
I thought your first one was everyone getting
I'm not go
the same pay!
"Yes, so everybody"
So
would need the same pay.
"But no matter what you'd, you know at the end of the week or the year or whatever"
"No, but I mean  I mean"
"there's all those people who have the same pay, that at the end of the year they would end up with different amounts  because people would manage money differently"
Differently
some would spend it
Of course they would!
as soon as they get it
Oh yeah.
"And this bit I do before the lesson and I do this, clean it up afterwards."
You don't have to do this bit.
"But notice that I'm pouring slowly and gently away from me into the dish which I shall then put in here, and I'm going to put the  the plate, which I described to you before, which has been covered with  what's on the back?"
Straw hat varnish.
What's on the front?
Hard wax.
Hard wax.
And scratched so the acid should bite through there.
Has anybody got a chronometer on them?
What?
you have haven't you?
What?
A watch.
Will you time er  two minutes please?
From the moment this goes into the acid.
You lower it in gently and sloosh it about so that the acid covers the surface.
"Right, you may troop by that and look down there, notice I wasn't wearing the goggles that was naughty of me wasn't it?"
I should have been  er while I go and get a turkey feather.
"Okay, you go and have a look at that covered up."
And try and see if we've got er   forming on the lines.
yes.
"That's what makes er these chemicals so dangerous, you don't know what they are."
What do you think I've got this for?
"Sorry, I can't hear you Paul."
So that er
I still can't hear you.
To scrape the zinc off.
To scrape the zinc off?
When it's ?
"Very good, yes."
That's correct.
As the zinc is eaten away  air bubbl er sorry not air bubbles  gas bubbles  I don't know what gas.
"Now it looks like, ah just stopped moving again, straight line, fixed speed that, this looks as if it's accelerating."
"It's very, it's deceptive if you're not working out what you're doing and relating it back to the graph, and relating it back to physics, to an experiment you're doing, someone's checking the clock every second to see how much further it's gone."
"Oh well, in the last second it went another ten metres."
Last second it went another ten metres.
It's going at a steady speed.
Fixed constant velocity.
"But here, that's still where it was last time I checked my watch."
Yeah.
Not moving.
So that's a steady speed.
And it stops.
"That's, it changes  abruptly."
From a steady speed.
It doesn't need to brake or does it just?
Mm.
"If it's a physical body, to change speed, it'll have to have to brake."
"And the s what would, so, that's a fixed speed."
There's another str another straight line  .
"There's another straight line, another fixed speed."
Which one is faster?
"Every one second,ten metres."
Every second that's going more than ten metres
Right.
So that
So the steeper it is?
The faster.
The faster it's going.
"So at this point, it's almost flat."
So it's going very slowly.
Now what's happening to its speed?
Accelerating.
Yeah.
"Twice he became a tutor, but he neglected his work."
"In one case he had an affair with the mistress of the house, which led to his dismissal."
"He had a period as a railway clerk at  Bridge, but was dismissed because of a deficit of eleven pounds."
"As Barbara and Gareth Lloyd-Evans say, it's impossible to know how the money disappeared."
"Embezzlement forgetfulness, inefficiency."
Did Branwell grow up.
He promised to much.
He was his own worst enemy.
"Like the prodigal son, he wasted his substance in riotous living."
"Er, it's a bit of back background then about Branwell."
You know anything about Branwell.
isn't it.
Mhm.
"Erm, that his father didn't make him go to school."
Mm
"Er, there's a suggestion that he had mild epilepsy, and they tried to keep it quite, and his father tutored him at home."
So he didn't have a normal life a boy of his circumstances in those days.
"Would have, yes."
"It was more lonely, there weren't other boys around him."
Mm.
Mm.
"There weren't other people around him, except his family."
"Yeah, So,"
Didn't help an unstable character.
"That may have contributed, yes, yes."
yeah.
Any other
Plus the rather powerful father figure.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Which tend to
Oh aye.
No it's not as if you're all close is it?
No.
And I mean we haven't seen them since ours hardly have we?
No
Watch this fool.
Ram him off the road.
Oh I had a really good day today.
"I didn't go till about  half ten  ah no cos I had a few letters and stuff to write first  and I thought right I'll just take me time  and, cos I wanted to  I didn't wanna go faster than  you know than I should, I should have done sort of thing cos I wanted to time it properly."
Erm it took me an hour and a quarter.
And it's exactly sixty miles into the middle of Caernarvon.
So I
"And that's where the survey's gonna be, right in the middle is it?"
Well no but that's where I had to go.
See you can allow a few extra miles for getting
Oh.
to the others.
So you wanna allow yourself a  an hour and half really don't you?
"Do you think, or not?"
"Well I don't think so because that, I mean there won't be any traffic hardly"
No.
when I'm going so I'll just allow the same.
And then I should do it in an hour.
You know  I'll be leaving at about half five.
"No, not b about quarter past five I'll be leaving, five to quarter past."
That's allowing a  a good hour and a quarter.
But it's not gonna take me longer at that time of the morning than it has done today at eleven o'clock or so is it?
Coming home it took me a bit longer cos it was all that delay at the  hill.
Oh aye that's right I heard it on the radio.
Yeah oh it's pathetic .
"Oh no the rest of it, it's not too bad, it's not a bad journey, it's quite pleasant really."
So I went straight to the  county offices and saw the rooms you know where we're going to
"No not yet, er only about France, and I told you about"
Oh I'm not sure
the
Oh dear
places you can go to
Mm
which is a fallacy
"I thought it was Barry  there, he looked a bit like him."
"No he's trying to get up, get down naughty boy."
"E T get down, down."
"Down there, there's a good boy"
"If you tell him sternly, he does understand the tone of your voice  if he goes off and sulks for a while, well so be it  you'll have to sulk till you get used to it, there you are."
"in the U K  mm, yeah, all looks very nice, camping"
Joking aren't you camping?
Well that's just what it looks like here  you just eating al fresco and going back up to the chateau at a night
Oh we're back in France again are we?
Mm
Yes
well
"Oh I see, yeah, yes it's"
Mm
"It's not a cheap holiday by the time we get, get down there your petrol"
Well for us I mean it's
and then the ferry across
it's not so bad for somebody living on the south coast
Yes
"but er, as you say erm, really it's such a long journey that you need a breather before you need to start to cross the channel"
Oh yes I think so  a good thing you're inviting Ken didn't I to come with us?
Yes I did mentioned it erm
Did you to Ken?
Well you were there weren't you too?
"I just mentioned it in passing and let the conversation carried on about something else so I, I don't know whether"
"Right, okay,my boudoir, I've just seen a few things  together."
"I should get changed, really, but I'll,"
No.
"what I'll do, is I'll  if I give you my clean shirt, you take it round to yours."
"If I want to change, I'll put it, the only thing is, if we do go up the bar, I think I'll be a bit warm, in something like this won't I?"
"Yeah, that's the trouble isn't it?"
But it's so cold out there.
"I know, it's a bloody, it's such a pain in the arse, because you freeze  to death, bloody getting up there, and then when you get in there, it's so bloody hot."
So start with  what the hell  which is really quite aggravating really.
Sorry?
"It's quite aggravating, innit?"
Mm.
"right, she did take that book with her, didn't she?"
Yeah.
Was she supposed to then?
"Right, lipstick, lipstick, lipstick."
lipstick on your collar    told a tale on you
really.
Oops
You need some more curtain hooks.
"No, I don't."
No.
Is that how many there were up there?
Yeah .
Or have they nicked some?
"They  they tended to spread them out a bit, about the house, you know, just willy-nilly, where they were wanted."
"They're just normal ones, aren't they?"
"Oh, I expect so."
"I know, does look a bit silly, doesn't it?"
"They shouldn't be  like that, we should, like, be able to pull cords and curtains as well gathering them a bit."
They are gathered even now.
"You probably can do in that, I just haven't mucked around with it."
"Imagine what it'd be like, when it's really cold."
"And I thought to myself, oh gosh, just drive up there,"
Yeah.
it's only a ten minute drive.
Yeah.
I picked the right time.
"See that's the thing, if I wanna go and do my studying, I can't just go, I have to  and, and dinner starts at erm, if I've got a lecture, my lecture is sort of one o'clock."
Just before one o'clock and the bus goes at five past one.
So I haven't got time to get any dinner.
No.
See what I mean?
"Well, what about"
No.
"So I have to get a bit, er jump on the bus, and then erm, either get something to eat at their college, but then, by that time, you see, cos dinner starts at quarter to twelve, it's all gone."
"And we went there last time, and all they had left was chips and this fatty stew."
"Er, that's"
And that's it.
"No veggies or nothing, no salad."
No veggies
No.
Oh dear
"So, it's, alright it's not a major problem, but that's the only difficulty with it is it's not, it's good having the bus service where you don't have to pay, right, if you don't, like I didn't realize the bus went at five past one, and I was all ready to go, and er, it was ten past one, and I thought, oh no, so I had to wait till three o'clock."
Do some work.
That's a bit silly really.
"Yeah, and then the next bus from six o'clock, is eight o'clock."
And that's the last bus home.
You would have thought these buses would
"It's only a ten minute, it's about a ten minute journey from Digby to Southlands."
Fifteen to Southlands to Whiteland.
"It's all round in a circle, it's not like then, I don't know why."
How peculiar.
"Yeah, it is a bit of a pain."
So the only ones that probably need to get made  are census stop if required etcetera.
So there's only three of those.
Yeah slow census and  whatever.
"So presumably if, if  Staffordshire have them made and we get those three whizzed up to Caernarvon  you know, the rest can sort of fit into place."
"Cos if you put survey instead of census at the bottom, I mean I know that's not strictly speaking how it should be, but they must have signs for us to survey because they have their own, presumably they have their own surveyors go out and"
Yeah.
Yeah like
you know and
you see yellow ones don't you?
On the motorway and stuff
Yeah.
they have survey on.
"But they very often, that triangular one with an exclamation mark, there'll be a little"
Yeah
plate on the bottom that says survey.
yeah.
"Well maybe it's not really right, but, but perhaps that  I'd have thought it would be alright."
Yeah.
"Census, it's probably the same in Welsh as well you know, don't you know?"
"Yeah, I see what you mean."
We might be able to get round it.
I'll see what this fella says.
"Well I mean I was saying to  this bloke well  can you think of anywhere where we might be able to, oh no no  no can't think of anywhere."
Well you could try Clwyd or something but   can't think everybody you know.
Clwyd might well do some.
I wonder
Oh it might be worth giving Nige a ring.
He's at Cheshire.
Oh yeah.
Who do we know at Clwyd?
Davydd .
Who?
The acceleration there is say forwards.
One two
"And for every one second, you're going forty metres per second."
So you're going at a steady speed.
Per second.
"It's, it's a, it's an acceleration, it's metres second to the minus two."
"Now are you happy with that, because most people aren't?"
Okay.
"We'll come back to that in a minute, but  let's say  a rocket, or a car, which would you prefer that do?"
Car.
Car.
Constant acceleration car.
"Erm  no frictional resis resistance, you just put your foot down and it's, you know where a car accelerates from rest"
Mm.
and then after a while the acceleration reduces?
"The speed is still going up, the acceleration, and eventually it reaches a top speed and it stays there."
Mm.
"Okay, it's zero acceleration, it's not getting any faster."
Mm.
Erm  how would we measure that?
A constant acceleration.
Say we had an accelerometer.
An acceleration measurer.
Mm.
"Which  force on a weight or something  can feel acceleration, I think you can, my son said you can't but I think you can"
"So, acceleration is a constant."
What's your eventual top speed?
"It just, just keeps going faster and faster and faster and faster"
Infinity.
"Infinity, speed of light, when you hit something."
It's pretty high.
Mm.
mm.
"And she said er  well it does take time for them to dry out doesn't it, she said?"
"But I, there was people in it last week!"
"Yes I know, she said!"
Well if she's covering
I said well there's no way I
she is paid to cover the boss!
"There's no way I'd of slept in it, I said and not  I wouldn't of done it!"
"Let alone, old age pensioners, I said!"
And you know  we've been to a few caravans
Go in that end bedroom and feel the bed!
"that feel a bit, caravans that we used to go to were like this chalet."
The chalets we used to go to  Mrs er  I can't remember her name now!
But her boys used to run steam roller outside middle house and I used to take them in.
She used to see  that the beds were aired.
She did see to them!
She put oil heaters  in the caravan  and she kept the  the mattresses in her bungalow!
She'd only got about eight caravans then.
"And  then we went in and had a caravan  somewhere up by Aberystwyth, Ginnie and me, and you kids."
That was an old farmer's caravan weren't
Yes.
it?
"But it wasn't too, that was too damp to sleep on!"
"who won the bloody war,roof up weren't it !"
"There wasn't, there wasn't a cup and saucer each!"
Remember?
Mm.
And these are no better!
"I mean, caravans are caravans, call them what you like!"
Only one saucepan we had!
And it was stew everyday if we didn't go out for dinner!
Ah!
And what happened say
They would never
were there ever occasions when there was one or more in your hay loft?
No no I don't think ever I can remember.
I th well I think er there was once or something but he he passed he didn't know that this er was so then they passed on.
Mm.
You see one stayed but he was there before him and the other one carried on.
No they would never they would never blend together.
Mm.
Like whiskies  blend .
No no they would never.
They were they were very very fine people.
And and the tinkers that came there.
Mhm.
Er wouldn't want to but from from  there was there was one lot.
And there were and the women folk would have their haberdashery and the men were tin smiths.
They would make pails and basins like you were being requiring in your sc er scullery or in the milk house as you would keep milk there.
So they were all and very industrious looking.
But they had for the winter time they their houses to go to.
Mm.
And they were just coming round in the summer.
Mm.
And their horses and my word they fairly looked after their animals mhm.
Did the crofting people have any special name for the the tinkers?
Not really no.
You've never heard the term summer walker?
Er er no no I could never say that.
Or mystery folk or?
Er well
Celts.
as the years came on they were beginning to get mystery fo folk but er not in my time.
Well that sort of people that was coming.
But what if they don't.
You've lost all your  ain't ya.
"Ya, so that's  the end of the world."
Even if you find out they won't.
No.
Why don't you get a free  put on market.
"No, the on the company's, that's coming up with all the money got to"
Oh aye.
do the valuation.
"And they ought to form  value of what, so they know how much it's worth, what the company that's gonna earn them the money want the money for the valuation."
It's just another way of making a bit more money out it.
That's it.
"Well, it's same as when you buying and selling 'ouses."
"You  when it comes out, when, the people that's, mind me cigarette, darling, the people that's gonna buy your 'ouse, who, mortgage company comes out and values it, they've got that to pay as well haven't they."
Yeah.
"The same as, I, them that buys our 'ouse, they'll have to pay whatever it cost for 'em to value our 'ouse, see if it's worth lending money, we'll have the same thing with er bungalow, down there."
Yeah.
"It's only money  I mean, how long are they 'ere."
Yeah.
Ten minutes.
"Mean, that woman come out, when when we had this done, didn't she,"
Mm.
To to see if it were satisfac she weren't here three minutes.
No.
"What was that for, for"
You know when we had extension put up.
"Oh yeah, yeah,"
"Well,"
Did it  value.
"They sent they sent 'em out from er, Abbey National and we had to pay, well we did pay 'im fifty pound, people that put the building on paid."
she keeps getting up.
She's not.
Victor says.
"And I thought like ah, and then mum sa I told mum, and she went you bastard, he told me that he gone and went to the hairdressers and done that."
"She went, right I'll get him, and I went, oh don't mum, I said, don't embarrass him."
"Do you know what she said, she went, what, I'm gonna bloody see that Victor."
"I went,no you're not  I said, don't do that, it's not nice, mum."
"I said, you wouldn't like it."
"She went, oh, she went oh I won't, I'll just wind him up."
"And Ryan came in  and she went oh, she went, I just learned who did er, your er little bit of hairstyling there Ryan."
"She went, he's pretty good with a pair clippers, ain't he, old Victor."
"Well, I went  ha ha ha   and she went, yes, I have heard, and he went, yeah, well, well, well, I mean, he just didn't how to spell my name."
"And she went, you wait,mu my mum went"
She gobbled him up with it.
Yeah.
"My mum went, you wait till I see Victor, she said, I'm gonna bloody have him."
"Right, see ya, what are you gonna do after"
"Erm, bye-bye"
you've finished?
I don't know.
I don't know.
"Well, we w"
What time do you finish?
"Well, we finish at nine, but er, might go up to the bar."
"Well, I tell you what, if you walk over to Annette's."
"If, if you want to go to the bar, walk over to Annette's after you've finished, because we probably won't go up until about nine, half nine, would we, and then we'll go up with ya."
"Well, we'll wait until you come round, and then decide what to do."
"okay,"
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"And then you know, if you've coming back, I'll drop you back home."
Thank you.
Rather than walk back on your own.
thank you.
Have fun.
She is.
"She'll bite you, and our Whisky can"
"She scratched him outside, didn't she."
"And, if she were here three and a half minutes, that's all she were 'ere, and it and it 'em fifty quid."
Yeah.
Bloody ridiculous.
It's all a bloody money making racket.
"Another thing is, I'll tell why we don't want er, they always having valuations, they are, they come and value it, and then they give us money."
That means we're gonna be paying extra eleven thousand with money we ain't got.
Yeah.
That's another reason we're daren't send it off.
Yeah.
"Yeah, because if ya, if ya, get it before ya start your business."
You've still got it to pay as soon as you get it.
Yeah.
"Trust them, because it's in their  at the moment."
"Well, I still believe in  and I don't pushed around and say, no you can't have money, no you can't get insured, and so that means  others."
You haven't lost anything have ya?
"Well, just er disappointment, I suppose."
For what
"Well, yeah,"
"Then again, I mean, I"
There's always summat else you can go and do.
"You know that, doing that, fabricating, and things like that, you know like actual welding and that type of  Er, we wouldn't make as much money out of that as you probably would"
No.
"No, you'll be, you'll be stuck to it, all time, and it's not good for 'im."
No.
And it kills your eyes welding.
Benjy.
"But as he said to me, why don't you go  welding."
"I says, the point is I've got bad eyes as it is,"
Yeah.
so I said well why's that then Norren?
"I've got used to doing it now, you know?"
Yeah
Well she said she's got a lot of scrubs to do and all that business
Yeah
"so she said while you've been doing that she said she's been sort of gassing to anybody you know, so she said it's been mentioned by management and they said oh well she'll be able to sort of hovering while she stood there you know, time, time to natter she could be erm, got time to do that."
"yeah  so I said oh I see, so that was that, so I think they've got a, a meeting in a couple of weeks and they'll sort of tell her discreetly that she has to carry on and do it what she's been the"
"time sort of thing you know, so, said it's been noticed that like"
and all that you know?
Yeah
"But erm, you know, get"
it's got to be scrubbed more often so you know
Normally
that is the same thickness as what this I think  can you hold that dear?
I'm surprised Joy didn't say something about it yesterday actually Joanne
Perhaps she didn't have it
she done quite a bit of hovering really
"Oh that's good then, yeah"
Is it alright now?
"Well, yeah"
It'll only pop out I suppose won't it?
Well it have to pop out but it keeps popping back in again that's all that is
Sorry
"alright thank you, prefers than what you done last time"
"Yeah better than that, yeah"
How's your mouth then?
Alright
Where's the other lighter?
There in here
oh I see.
Where's Samuel
where's Samuel's?
"I know erm  I thought I wrote to the electricity board in, I wrote to somebody  about erm how er things should be labelled about how efficient they are when using electricity."
You took part in the er electricity efficiency didn't you?
Yes.
"Yeah but didn't, we didn't write to our MPs though."
I thought we were
"supposed to write to somewhere else  was it  the department of the environment or  now what would it be, energy?"
"We wrote, wrote to them cos I've got a reply to that letter somewhere with a great wad of information"
about various fridges and
"Yeah, yeah"
and things.
Yeah
So I can't really say we've written to the MP can we?
We haven't found out about company car fleets have we?
We tried.
Well I tried and then I was let down by the group.
I don't remember anything about that one
We arranged it  two days or three days and each was cancelled
March ninety one?
. In March this year?
It was this year.
Last year.
Last year.
I didn't think we'd done anything about that this year.
But that was last year.
Yeah.
But we haven't done a march  ninety one then.
Scanned the local press for power station applications or authorizations  H M I P.
Written to Michael Heseltine about acid rain?
May ninety one.
Written to your MP to ask him her to press for strict E C standards for C O two emissions from vehicles May ninety one.
when was that?
Wasn't that on the talk?
Mm.
They were talking  pedestrianizing
"I think that's been on, on the cards for a long time hasn't it?"
Yeah.
Pedestrianizing and they've never done it.
Sorry!
Erm  Wh have we done anything about the environmental charter?
Because I  started doing it a long time ago
"Yeah, yeah Bob did that didn't he?"
It vaguely Yeah and we presented it and then it fizzled.
The group  fizzled out because we presented the charter.
And that was the aim of
It asks here have they adopted it?
Erm
wouldn't or we aim to still try.
Well  .
"I I think, I've a funny feeling that  did  adopt it but quite how much that means I don't understand."
"Well it's awful, having to do this  questionnaire we, we've done ."
All these workshops that have been going on that we haven't been to.
Well they just kind of recognized the principles don't they but they don't ensure that they'll actually put them into practise.
That's what adopting means  it's not actually committing .
"Yes I thought they had, yes."
How about these questions.
Does the group have a constitution?
No.
Does the group have an office?
No.
We've got our plastic box!
Plastic?
"I know I know everybody will be disappointed but I couldn't get  cardboard ones, stick it all in."
We bought the storage boxes anyway to keep all the .
No but you can't really I mean that's what  supposed to have it like an actual proper office.
Yeah.
and then someone scores and the guy goes in straight calmly and scores straight away.
You know it's people aren't
Yeah.
"I don't know, it's psychologically sort of still got their mind on going through what's er"
On what happened.
Yeah.
"It's like at school when they're thinking oh no, no and they've scored again."
"It's like you've scored, you're so elated and you"
Fact you you often sort of watch videos of managers.
"Managers are often shrieking you know about what's happening next rather than you know, all their players are jumping with joy all over each other and you think  and they're saying get in your positions."
Do your stuff.
"Don't let it slip straight away, I mean  That was annoying thing is that we didn't deserve to lose three one really, I mean"
Sneak that  that box of sweets in then for mum .
I bet she knows you've done that for her.
Eh?
I bet she knows you've bought that for her.
"Well she knows that we're giving her something, yes."
"I mean we could have been worse, could have forgotten completely."
"I mean it's easy, cos when mum gets all those things for everybody else, clearly she doesn't get something for herself."
Don't know why not.
What did you get her last year?
It was the same thing wasn't it?
"No I didn't get, we didn't do this did we, last year?"
Yes we did.
We always have the tree presents.
Do we?
Our sunroof's pretty isn't it?
You what?
Our sunroof's pretty isn't it?
Very stylish.
What's the time?
any financial commitment.
And it doesn't change the contract.
So I mean
B t t
"The reason why, no, the reason why these, these"
but they do.
procedures were written is because in the past we had that foggy situation
Mm.
Mm.
"and I wanted to clarify that, and make sure that our procedures actually were back to back with contract procedure."
"So I think in terms o of this particular erm procedure, we're okay."
Mm.
"Where, where we're not okay is in the point that Jim has raised, the general point and that is, what do we mean, what do we d define as a project engineer?"
So junior junior R Es then will not issue V Os.
Unless they're delegated t to do so within the contract and I rely on you to make sure that whoever is delegated to issue
"What if they're,wh what if they're below M S two level?"
No no.
No R E will issue a V O.
They might do if they're M S two I mean  the project engineer
If it's the project engineer.
Yes.
Yeah.
Fine.
specifications here Trevor?
With regards to?
On one two or
Yeah.
three?does it use the word th the term
No.
project engineer?
Definitely
not in the erm er in the M S ones.
okay
"Hey bud, where you going?"
I was supposed to be going home
"Example a thousand pound  normally two and forty eight pounds, now only forty eight pounds"
What?
D'you think it's the wheel of fortune?
"Well it says it is, it's been"
It's a whole page spread  from such an established reputable company.
"All prices are fully inclusive of double glazing, grade one security p v c delivered ."
I don't know.
It doesn't say anywhere there's a guarantee  .
Cheshire.
I wonder if it's the same address as when we got ours?
Well we should have guarantee somewhere in the box there
"I mean it's it's, how long is it since it was supposed to have gone bust?"
Well it's years since I thought it had gone bust
I thought it was about ten years
Wasn't there somebody from  who got
I can't remember.
"When we got that, when we had ours and er they said if you if you found someone else who would like who would have  you would get seventy five pounds back and you gave the thing, who was it who was thinking about it?"
Was it erm what did they call?
Isabel?
Isabel?
.
Wasn't it her?
"It might have been, I can't remember"
Wasn't it just before or after her husband died?
It's been that long I don't know.
Her husband died when we were .
It couldn't have been that.
No.
Well I phoned Shirley and she said she's fine.
Yeah.
"if they don't, that's it."
"They don't come and look at your 'ouse, they come have a look at what they can do with it, you now, have a look like, why you got extension and,"
I don't mind beds being untidy and things like that.
No.
"I mean, you don't look at, your not, who's sleeping in your bed."
"When ours were, it was a right state when we looked at ours, but we still said we'd have it."
"Mind, it's just that, it's worth nowt as we've  name it."
We'll get it right one day.
"One day, Karen, one day."
When the moon comes up and it's in two.
When the
You got two moons.
"Yeah, all I wanted was go in and, now we're bankrupt and we're nowt where we are."
If we were well off we could get it done.
"You'd be employing, you'd be employing builders to come in and do it for you."
"Yeah, that's what I said, it'd be nice, wannit."
It would.
your half of next door to get some
"Remember, remember, if you want taking anywhere, it's er, is it four pound ten an hour  chauffeurs."
Yeah.
"What I mean you have to put petrol in, I mean, it doesn't"
"No, you have to put petrol in."
"Do you hell, not at four pound an hour."
Walk.
"One fifty an hour, driving."
"Ain't it four fifty an hour  chauffeuring, and he puts petrol in, and taxes and insures car."
Bugger off.
Back of the bloody van.
"You can't go in van with ya, with ya suit on, and"
"Oh, you've got to, you go play your part."
"You got to have a chauffeur, you'll have to buy me a hat  you'll have to buy me a hat  you'll have to make it worth me while coming off dole at forty pound a week."
So we got money coming in.
Mm.
our Karen.
"But er, I mean, I says, can't we manage without him, can't you manage by yourself, but Colin says he can't really, because"
He needs somebody.
Yeah.
"Well, Colin's gotta be able to do a lot of office work, he's gonna be out doing quotes, you know what I mean, so he's going have to have somebody there."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Or I would apply for er, family credit straight away."
"get coming in, I'm gonna say, yeah, we've got ten thousand pounds."
"But we don't know how long it'll be, before get any money coming in, and if you go on to family credit, you get it for six months, so that'll be our wages."
"So then, what what comes out of business we'll pay him anyway."
Yeah.
"You might have too much in bank for family credit, that ten thousand, it's only eight, innit?"
"It's got, it's gotta know what  increase, when you running a business."
Yeah.
"Oh, I don't know."
"If you apply for it straight away, could you say you don't know how much monies coming in."
How much money your gonna coming in.
"His dad's in a new business, anyway,bec so you should get forty quid a week at least, anyway."
"Thirty-five now,"
"Is it thirty-five,"
Yeah.
Bloody hell.
Yeah.
It's like everything else
"I mean, that's seventy pound, you wouldn't have had, anyway, ain't it."
No.
Oh.
"I ju I mean, it, now it's just getting me, more depressed than nowt else, I mean, I just wish that they'd phone and say yeah, we've got you a insured."
"And then, I mean, 'cos we daren't say that to accountant know, to have 'ouse valued, 'cos what's point in, I mean, anybody said to us, er, get it sent off, you'll find, you're, somebody will insure ya."
The other thing  I mean to be healthy  it's more important  to dry things and keep them dry for a while than to boil them.
Bacteria survive heat for a short time.
Yeah.
But they don't a for the percentage of bacteria that survives drought  is is minimal.
So you don't need to boil  logically.
"Er if you just keep your hankies  iron them, keep them dry."
"Then they are, then they are sterile."
be bothered.
"Anyway, back to the point."
He said pointedly.
Well  leaflet.
stall.
We've got to get back to the stall.
Yeah er the recycling leaflet.
Who's gonna do it?
It's not gonna be done if we don't get somebody to actually front you know
well
take it on
The  thing is that I  I can do  revamp it on computer.
Because it w you can scan
What ma manually?
No you just stick it on  a photocopier
I see I wa before you do that I'll get in touch with the guy who drew it and if he  if he has got  an original copy he might be able to erm to er
"What, what you can do is you can then get basically you get the computer to type that out  type that out."
Ah.
"And then you just do a run, you don't have to go on to print it at all you just print it off."
That's one option
Then photocopy the rest of it.
I've got a laser printer yeah so I mean that's what I use for my business.
I've got a Mackintosh and a laser printer.
So I mean
I've got some recycled paper but but
Do they need to do the  they've proposed that they  to bypass erm  if we're doing the Caernarvon bypass.
Well can they detrunk that bit?
Well it doesn't say that.
Well can they detrunk that bit?
responsibility not
Yeah.
theirs if they put the bypass in.
"So what came out of this, well it could be"
So are they looking to build a bypass first?
The gut reaction this morning is we could end up  with a bypass scheme at the end of it and no Caernarvon link.
Oh that's no good is it?
Of course it is.
Cos we're still continuing designing a Caernarvon link .
four percent fee .
"Mind you it's, it's a smaller job."
What's smaller?
"Well if they're doing that then we s we're looking to make this a dual carriageway  on the Richard  principle that if it's a trunk road it's worth building a dual, a dual carriageway."
If you can convince him on traffic grounds fair enough.
So they're serious
"Course the initial thing is we get some reaction back from this, this"
so they're seriously looking to  the trunk road network coming down  bypass and then going off round the Caernarvon bypass?
Or is that just
That wasn't er  Ray  's view.
That was this other guy's view.
Based on this other scheme really he said oh yes.
"But which,whi which other guy?"
This Ve Vernon whatever his name is.
The  are proposing this.
They won't want that.
They wo they won't
But the  the guy that's looking after the  schemes
Yeah.
"Cos Mark's going in one, Sally's going in the other."
Oh bring them home then.
Bring them home and tell them that you're taking them home to air.
"And I don't suppose, they're not wet  you see."
"It's different  it's, they're damp  it's different if there'd been a hole and the water was coming in."
They're not saturated.
No.
It won't take them long.
That's what I says.
If those men wasn't working there I wouldn't hesitate.
The fire would go on and I'd leave it on low
Mm.
and the atmosphere would warm up  right through the caravan.
Mm.
But I'd hump them into the sitting room.
If those men came there on Tuesday
Mm.
"and done their work  and Mark rang me here and said, on Tuesday  the caravan's great now, the fires are alright."
I'd go straight over there and switch the fires on.
Mm.
Well I'd even tell him to go down only he ain't got the keys.
Cos they're not going to take an awful long time in a good hot room  to dry.
"the only thing again that I'm thinking of  what if we gets them out of the caravan  and we gets them into the car and we're getting them in and out here  and then we gets them back into the car to take them back over and in to the caravan, what if we rip the bloody things?"
Well if we rip them we rip them and I'll mend them.
Mm.
They are yours aren't they?
Mm.
Put a patch on them.
"Then she turned round and she said, I said to her those beds are soaking, I said."
There's nobody can sleep in those.
"Yes, she said but er when I went down there to check after you'd gone, she said  erm  yours was erm  the driest of them sort of thing."
Suppose they didn't bother with them.
And the more people that know what good work we do the better.
Provision of photographic services.
Over to you my friend.
Oh.
Provision of photographic services?
Right.
"Erm just to say that, just to confirm the note sent round that erm we will only pay for any photographic services by Intercity East Coast if it has been procured using a task request form in accordance with the same way we procure any other internal B R er service."
Now.
Surely if all we want is prints off existing things all you need do is a request with a DOPACS number?
Yeah.
Surely not you know fill in a task form in for print off a couple of negs.
Is this the external
Yes.
request request for external
Mm?
services?
Well.
B b w w why?
Why can't you just use a task request form that says.
Please p
Well.
I mean
please provide
Prints off the following negative numbers
"four number eight by eight prints off these t off, off negative numbers so and so."
Splendid.
Are you gonna write
And put the DOPACS number on.
You're gonna on something.
Yeah.
Copy it to Andrew  and then Andrew knows when the I B I S invoice comes forward that it's something to be
Then he'll sign it off.
Has Barney got little little legs
Mm.
a little bit bigger don't ya.
Look at that flaming dog.
"Come on, come on, throw them over there."
"I wonder if there's any way you can actually check, you know, where he is, is there any way that"
"Watch me tea, now."
"straight out, or,"
"Well, what what do you think erm,"
Are you worried about how much money it's gonna cost ya.
"No, because money's cost us less."
"Er, you know when they said we had to pay two hundred and fifty one for er, administration and search and survey."
"It's come back, and it's under two hundred."
"Can I have a cup of tea, please."
Then they said I've got to pay five hundred pounds for
"Do what, love."
I don't think Allied Dunbar will deal with anybody that's dodgy.
No.
"Er,"
"Now, watch that tea."
Yeah.
That's what he said.
Are you ready.
I don't think they'd deal with anybody that dodgy.
Er.
Bert.
"Are you doing alright, are ya."
"What they do, they look they look around and they weigh up up pros and cons up, and it it's like these insurance brokers, they ring all over to buy cheapest insurance for you, well, that's what Allied Dunbar are doing."
"Well, well, this is a broker, but it's a  broker, so that's"
Yeah.
"You see, what it is, it's where they've been behind with their mortgage, we will pay a slightly higher rate, but it's only"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Subtract them that way round.
They'll go out.
"And we've got three point one squared, minus"
Two point nine squared .
Two point nine squared .
Mm.
"Which will come to, if we add them it's six times nought point two."
The gradient will be one point two.
That's a bit better because a gradient of one is forty five degrees and we s we said it should be more than that.
Erm  one point two.
Find out which ang what angle has a tan of one point two.
Tan minus one .
One point two.
Fifty.
Fifty.
"So you were, you were closer to seventy."
"You see how hard it is to see just from the graph, from a, from"
Mm.
"a sketch, if you plotted it on paper, but this is without plotting it, we're getting it quite accurately."
"Erm  maybe someone says it could be useful for you to try it again, without any help from this page at all."
"So we've got Y equals X squared, minus one."
And we want the gradient at the point where X equals three.
"But we want to get very very close to it, like only nought point nought one before it and nought point nought one after it."
So what value would ?
Around the point where X is three.
Erm so you'd need  nought in the middle.
"No, I'm not thinking of drawing a sketch at the moment, we've done the sketch on the other page"
Ah.
"and we're just thinking of  what value are we going to, what would be the value of X point nought one before three?"
Er two point nine nine.
Okay.
"Oh well, according to that it's cloud."
"At least it's a white cloud, not a black one"
Did you see your mother?
"No but I get a message, will you tell my brother, no don't tell my brother, they said, she said to one of the nurses and they said, your brother?"
"No, my son."
I said well what did don't you have to tell me?
"She said, we're not gonna tell you."
So I didn't get to know what what they didn't have to tell
Oh.
What was she doing tonight?
I don't know
"Mostly dry, sunny spells"
"Mostly dry, sunny spells"
Sally was quite intrigued by that
We'll have to get her a set of books.
"There's some bottles, jars, for the bottle bank as well"
"You know the last time you  the erm, the last time you missed the television pages, television supplement in the  out of the Mirror."
I don't think they believed me.
And it's erm it'll be twice in a month and Chris is back again as our paper boy.
The other one was so useless but according to the er that new manager in the paper shop everyone else got theirs.
So I said I'm sorry but I'm not included in everyone else and he gave me one.
The Radio Times?
Why?
Because it's got all the
Ah.
Are we staying up all Thursday night?
"Well, it's up to you ."
"Of course, well you could stay in bed all day on Friday  And I could take the kids to schools and go back"
"I need to go, I need to go into the Co-op and Iceland."
What shall I get for your mother?
I'll get some chocolate biscuits I think.
"You would think she would put on a lot of weight, wouldn't you?"
And the bus left at a quarter past eight.
Hour and a quarter.
I could have travelled home.
Yeah.
Bloody hell.
"Honestly, it was just sitting there, we were just not moving."
"Well, you probably know what it's like, I was just sitting there."
"Is it, is your parking permit saying what college you're at?"
"Yeah, I have to."
"I'm not allowed to park in their colleges, other colleges."
See what I mean?
Yeah.
So I can't drive there
Said you can't get on the bus either .
No.
That's what I said.
"Well, the good thing is, where Southlands is, which is on the south  which is a very nice area."
"Well, it's not that nice, but there's a hell of a lot of little roads, all around it, it's not a like Roundtree is, is it?"
"It's just on a little main road, but it's situated almost in this housing estate."
"They must say, God they must get pissed off with it, so I've already looked around, and there's loads of parking places,"
Mm.
"there's no yellow lines, there's loads of little roads."
That's true.
"I mean, I could park it there, if Nicole didn't want to drive."
"But the, the bus, the erm  staggered."
"You got a bus at eight fifteen, and you got another bus at one o'clock, and you got another bus at three o'clock, and another bus at six"
You serious?
"and, and if you wanna come home, there's supposed to be a bus at half past four, and our lecture finished at quarter to four, so you like, three quarters of an hour to get to the bus, right, and then it didn't turn up."
"So we had to wait for the next bus, which was six o'clock."
Oh no.
It's a long time.
"We were sitting like this, sitting on the pavement, with our umbrellas up"
"Cos some people  er er  may think, you know, the agreement because I have split the load you can still charge me the same price and it may not be the case."
Right.
Next one.
What's the question  ja Andy?
"What is the cus , sorry, what should"
What should
the customer provide prior to the collection of a consignment?
What was some of the answers there?
"Janey's put, name, address, from another consignment note filled out and service requirement"
and weight of the consignment.
Yeah.
So what we were looking for was something more  er erm
Did I answer that one?
No.
I didn't get round to it.
"Anybody get what we were looking for in the, yes you should?"
What should the customer provide prior to the collection of a consignment?
"Well obviously the delivery name and address is important and the consignments, so you didn't get that wrong but there was, what we were looking for  as well a full written declaration of the nature of contents of any consignment containing dangerous  infested, contaminated"
Aha.
or fragile goods.
"In other words, is there anything, did anybody pick up"
You got that.
"Yeah,"
unusual
I did.
"I might have given you one there, that looks good enough."
Oh.
Did you get that there?
I did a part of it.
Oh
I reckon Justin's got enough cos
What
Regional railways have asked for that as well.
Have they?
Yes.
Erm that that
Well Dennis er Roger's been doing for it for Leeds North West haven't you?
He has.
Yeah.
But he's been doing it manually haven't you Rog?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Be be because I don't think you can trust the forecast reports from DOPACS.
"I think y yo you could blip from month to month er, er as a priority slipped in or changed, or a person slipped out or, or somebody forgot to zero something or y"
It's too fragile isn't it?
It's far too fragile.
Mm.
"It it's there for us to, to use as a, as a sore thumb exercise to ask questions but, but to actually do anything er, er as critical as saying, we're gonna spend twelve thousand pounds next period and eleven thousand pound the period after and fourteen thousand the period after, er I don't think that's"
computer system's tying your hands behind your back.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
"So, so really"
"we're gonna have to have a manual involvement or override there by the project coordinator to, to, to"
"Well if, if you remember we, we agreed with Keith  he would have a think  that and a talk to"
Yeah.
Roy er Roy
You'd remind him about it Hugh.
Yeah.
"But what I'm gonna suggest is that again we go back to the client, and say basically, this is what we think we can provide is that good enough?"
Mm.
This is what you want.
"If we give you that we can give you it in a certain way, but it is not necessarily meaningful."
Mhm.
He wants every single penny accounted for  before he starts doing anything.
But she's that  we
"He had er, fourteen and a half thousand pound once in a building society four year ago  there's nine hundred pound left in his bu er, building society account!"
They want to know where that is.
"She,"
"The solicitor, nobody else, just the solicitor."
Er  he's got some insurance policies  one's for eleven hundred pound  right?
And they're gonna pay that.
And that's gotta go straight direct to the solicitor.
"Also, he's supposed to have had an insurance policies  but General Accident said it's only for a year  and he took it out in seventy seven to nineteen seventy eight."
But he's still got the policy  life insurance on it.
He was insured with the Co-op.
He was insured with the Co-op.
Oh that were a  that'll be  bound to come.
So that's
I don't know.
"Yeah, he won't pay Mrs  insurance money out yet will he?"
"No, he, he, he, he's gotta pay it to the solicitor."
It all gotta go to them?
It's all got to go to solicitor.
And that  fourteen thousand five hundred pound every single penny's got to be accounted for.
Well who's gonna know about that then?
The bank.
Building society he put it in.
The solicitors who gave him the court order  for them to release all the details on that.
And even that car he bought  the
Who?
the solicitor can take it off him
The solicitor wants to know why
And he'd bought a car had he?
Yeah.
For a boy.
On their own
singularly
That's a long word isn't it?
Singularly yeah that's not so bad
What's it mean?
"Something to do with singling,si si singing"
We  we can have a game of count down masters
Count down masters
cogitation  don't follow that one up
Mm
"Come on oh the loo, how much further is it?"
I'm getting desperate
Ah desperate's a good word
"Desperado, singular desperate"
Mm
Latin for desperado
"Oh dear   oh it's down about here when, did it the other day, and the woman just drove out straight in front of me from another lane"
Lovely
"I just, I mean, why bother having roundabouts I ask myself"
Well it was a woman come on
Yes it was a woman
"women don't comprehend roundabouts, driving cars"
Oh
"you should know that by now, nothing is ever"
it is an excuse
What?
er don't put your ear piece to the micro to my blooming sweets
I'm not keen on  ear droppings in my sweets
"They're not mine, don't worry"
"Mm, I know"
"I love it, I love it."
So why have you started taking up the bag?
They ring up at seven and eight o'clock at night.
Yeah.
Asking us whether we want to borrow some money.
"Er, asking if there's anything we co , look at him walking about with that"
"Everything, everything, what oh, papers have got, has got Legal and General on it."
Mm.
"So, I thought, well"
Yeah.
it can't be a a dodgy
I don't think it'll be anything dodgy.
It won't be dodgy.
Oh.
"But you can always, easily find out"
"What usually happens, though."
"All you do, is pick the phone up and and get, oh now, what place do you ring."
"I forgot what place you ring, but we're find out, and you ring up to see what they're, what the company's like."
"You know, if it's a variable company."
Yeah.
"Things like that, you could do that."
"Different companies take over, I remember that time we borrowed that four thousand pound."
"We started out with Key Finance and we ended up with Mercantile Credit, didn't we?"
Yeah.
"Changed companies three times, that time we had that four thousand pounds."
"You told me about that, yeah."
Well  said that it will be a sm a really small building society.
"He says, that, 'cos er, it's not"
Well.
"Big building societies are not prepared to give you rates, and small building societies are wanting to get going"
"You see, the only trouble with building societies is, it's the same when you buy a pigging house , they put the money on what you've actually borrowed every year."
Yeah.
"Well, finance companies only, you only get the interest on what is left."
On the money that you owe.
If we do this it will be a lot more meaningful.
Is that acceptable?
Yeah.
One point
Fine.
that occurred to me where we could
"perhaps give them some flexibility, is that we could say, if that's not acceptable to you, we will delay invoicing."
"Cos now we don't have to pay interest on our fees,i if, if, if a jam's spread over six months a a a and it might risk and slip to nine months, we might do better to offer to jam spread it over nine months and only invoice for part of the money."
Mm.
Don't like the sound of that.
Er
"the project engineer sits down and manually, let's be honest."
No.
Cos he's gonna just divide it by the number and it's it's
It's it's a very minor part of the operation.
Mm.
I think you've got a little bit careful with lots of our jobs which have got
very very small fees attached to them.
Yeah.
Yes.
which
"It's, it's hardly worth doing."
"at the present time we're saying to  on the monthly report we're saying to the client, we've spent three thousand out of five thousand, and their anticipated final cost is going to be five thousand."
Yeah.
And i he knows when we're actually gonna finish the job and therefore
Mm.
he can almost do that sum himself.
Yes.
I agree.
Er er I think on a bigger job i it it's perhaps a different story.
The trouble is Dennis a lot of our
little jobs.
What was that one?
it was about death penalty wasn't it?
.
"there's all sorts like, like recruiting, making contact with the schools, er, lobbying, er, there, there about ten or twelve different workshops now, almost on almost every aspects, so and that would be something that we could give, if, if these weren't  ."
"But there has to be one guarantee in  because I think once we had rather good one, about six people kept, you can never tell how many  come, I mean you'd want maybe bigger, more than, more space in this room."
"Well, we've, have got another room maybe we might sometimes be able to use haven't we?"
Well we could use the .
"Or your dining room, yes."
it's probably better that
"Mm, we often need to use one more than one room for those."
Mm.
Mm.
Though we do seem to be doing quite well in numbers.
"Yes, we have lately, yes."
Better than last year.
"That suddenly, I mean it means you divide into smaller groups quite often, and, and have discussions on  you can, yeah.."
Speak on what you've got.
"No, might be my speech, do we need a, meet, meet in a more public place, erm."
"No, no, we can't."
.
"But you, erm"
.
"Yes, yes, you, you."
"Erm, your business would take care of itself if we have that pressure of booking it,."
I honestly think it would.
"I think if anything, I'm sure it would."
"Yeah, mm, sure."
I think.
I'm sure that it would  make us more careful the months before.
"Mm, mm."
"Right, going on the streets think it would, going to find that many people that, that could speak to"
That was
Mm mm mm mm.
"he's very  fast  er, deduced  comedy."
There's a lot going on  at a very fast speed.
Which makes
Well I thought it was quite farce like.
Sorry?
I've seen the play and I thought it was quite like a farce.
You know
Yeah.
like
Okay.
But
"this is rather what  what it, makes it difficult is that  I had a copy as well farce  right, but don't say farcical."
That's got different meanings.
"Er, like farce  okay?"
As in this.
Any other things that made it  made it difficult for you to read?
So it's only the language?
"The language, if it had been translated in modern language there'd be no, no problem?"
Were there are any reasons?
"It's supposed to be a play, I suppose you have to watch it."
"When we were reading it I found that I was just reading it as a book and the  and that all the coming about you forget who's in, who's there and who's not there."
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
"More, again, much more by the shape of it, an intensely visual dramatic play, that relies on you being able to see"
spatially  in terms of space  on the  stage.
"People knocking on doors, people hiding behind things, people coming on in costume."
"You know, on the page you can't work out  why erm,is suddenly called  erm  nuns, somebody called the Captain, you know, you, you, you think these are three different characters."
"On the stage you wouldn't make that mistake, you'd be able to keep track of the identity."
"So, another reason  that just adds that  is the element of disguise."
"In Shakespeare  you know, you haven't got that many disguises going on."
Mhm.
the ins and outs.
Mhm.
But that happens all over.
"Mhm, what's the pay like compared to other factories in the area?"
It's quite low.
Is it?
Mhm.
Because er  how many years ago is it?
"Seven or eight years ago we, we, we're on piecework, we made our own wage."
"Er and most of us had in excess of a hundred pound, maybe a hundred and six, a hundred and ten pound, but when this guy bought place over, there was a kind of flat rate, and we'd to drop sixteen pounds to ninety"
Mm.
pounds.
"Well at the time you're thinking, God that's better than twenty or twenty five pound if you were unemployed,"
That's right.
"on the brew, kind of thing."
Mhm.
"So you jumped at the chance, but it is, I think th th poverty wage in Europe is it not, not about a hundred and forty, a hundred and forty five pounds?"
"Well we're nowhere near that, nowhere near that."
"Mm, that's right, mm."
That's why when I hear my daughter talking about getting fifteen or twenty K a year I'm going  it would pay me two or three years  for God's sake.
You can look after me then.
But saying that if you want a decent wage in here you have to work a lot of overtime.
Yes.
And most people do.
Mm.
Because er i from the management point of view if you have got four hundred people and you work a lot of overtime that saves you having six or seven hundred people.
Mhm.
And if you want to cut back you can either cut down on your workforce or you can cut down in the
Mhm.
overtime.
"In my department just now they're working seven days a week,"
Specially with Palace I think they seem to think  but they really .
Should have finished them off in that first
Yeah   Can I just flick the light on for a second?
Thank you.
"Yes, see who  I mean  I can't think of anybody who's in the reserves who could do any better than the lot that are in, in at the moment."
Can you?
"Other than perhaps give Colleymore a full blooded  game, right?"
Doesn't he get a full blooded game at the moment?
"I think perhaps it's, it's worth it now."
"The season, I mean we're not gonna come top of the league are we?"
Right?
We've gotta make sure we stay in the first division but
I think we can afford to blood Colimore as a good one now.
"He could have this whole of this season to get used to playing, right?"
Yeah.
And then who knows what fireworks could happen the season after.
I mean  he's never gonna be a  when he's obviously another Bright.
Who wants another Bright?
We're supposed to  to the better style of play.
"No, I don't know."
Well why did we buy Gabiadini?
Why?
What would be the point of buying Gabiadini?
"No, well I, I mean you saw the point really."
"I mean  to pick I mean who, who  who could replace ?"
"He's, I, he, the way he plays is virtually unique, isn't he?"
So I mean you're not gonna say  well let's go and get another Ian Wright off the peg so fair enough.
But er  in the kind of situation where Ian Wright was very very good was in tight situations.
differently through se sheer speed and  but er I can see Gabiadini  I mean Ian Wright never flicks like some of the flicks that he does.
I mean some of the flicks are fantastic.
But erm there is a nice side to his game but god he doesn't half fade.
"Can you afford somebody that fades like that, I don't know it's"
Will it go in?
"Yeah, I'm sure it will."
Thank you
Thank you
"They're not really  are they, the Chinese or  Oriental dancers?"
"I don't think so anyway, they seem to be"
A lot of cars at the school this morning.
"I parked right on the end of the erm  the lane, just"
Mm
"in, there was just enough room for me."
Mm?
Course we were late anyway  well not late for John's but
Which way do you go
When I came back
into ?
Cos you can cut through that
"I turn round and go back, yeah."
Mm.
"And of course the coach had come up the hill  couldn't overtake where I was parked, blocking off the entrance to the lane where I'd just come out of so that the string of cars coming down the road and the first one wanting to turn in and of course the coach had covered it."
Oh yeah
It was completely blocked off  coach couldn't go backwards because there was cars behind it.
So I gingerly walked down and crept into the car realized that I was the one that had caused all that
and drove off
And ignored
Slinked off into the mist.
So he couldn't back back then
"No  no that wa that was it, completely stalemate."
"big Volvo estate was facing  if he'd go down there, I can get through and he can come back again and  he wasn't gonna do that."
Too much  brain damage
there's a big notice at the end of the lane which says
Well he'd come up from Totnes this morning.
Erm then.
"And er so I mean it's you know, I am a politician I mean you know, it's in the blood I've b been in the in the House of Commons now for about a quarter of a century."
"Over a quarter of a century, most of it on the front bench."
And erm I like it.
"But the fact is I mean I you know, you do ask these questions, your family make you ask these questions quite understandably."
I there are other things I could do.
I'm a manic gardener and I that's what I've been doing.
"Erm I could go back to commerce, although er that side of my life is some way behind and it it's always been very successfully done by er my colleagues in the company that I started."
"So er you know I I've I've never had a sort of er a one way track about politics, although I adore it and I've er I've enjoyed it hugely Am enjoying it and I"
"Ah I was going to pick  you said, I have enjoyed it hu I was about to leap in and say, Ah that means ."
Yes ye no no no no no no.
How kind.
"Well that's the value of a programme like this, you can correct."
Otherwise that'd be over the headlines.
"Heseltine says, Future"
Quite.
is in the past.
You know
Which is not exactly what I am saying.
Erm no the fact is that er I I love politics.
It's er and and I have always wanted to be president of the board of trade.
"But what about more ambition, further ambition now?"
Well that's a sort of wary question but all politicians
But you'd expect me to ask it.
I know you're bound to ask it.
And you I'm not going to give any different answer I've ever given.
I my belief is that John Major will win the next election.
"I helped to win the last one, I shall help to win the next one."
"And er er I I think that er all this sort of chat about leadership challenges and all that, I think that's for the birds."
I don't think we shall see it.
I especially I don't think so after after the very er impressive speech he made on Friday.
But there is We can come to that in a moment if we may.
Do we need them
Bilingual?
bilingual?
They can't have been bilingual last time because they were hired from Staffordshire County Council.
No.
And the other thing er if they  they just haven't got anything like that.
Yeah.
They use sort of blank
Wasn't there a big fuss though because  there wasn't enough effort made on the bilingual side  the last survey we did?
I don't think so was there?
There's a letter in the file
Well that's
about erm why we didn't use bilingual staff for one of the particular dates.
"Erm it come from the county surveyor, apparently he'd had complaints."
But I mean it was purely a re a recruiting problem.
"Er you know erm the letter, the reply went back from Dave  saying that every  you know, possible thing was done to  get bilingual staff but at the end of the day  you know they couldn't come up with the goods."
"I mean the lengths they went to advertising, I hope we're gonna have more luck now."
"They had temping agencies, job centres, local papers  the job centre only came up with about two people."
So I'm touching wood that we're gonna be in a different situation.
"I wonder if, I wonder if erm  you know if you rang up erm  the county council and said   you know   I mean er  y just make use of a contact and say look, we wanna do this survey, you know, do you happen to know a any members of your family"
Yeah.
You know?
It maybe
Yeah.
You can very often er for instance at Cheshire very often  I mean there were sort of some people's wives would like to do it.
Yeah.
"It may be, you know?"
Yeah.
See how the response goes with this and then
Who is it you've spoken to at Gwyneth?
Er Gwyllam .
And where is he?
can!
The sheep to cross the road and
Mm.
quite unusual!
I'd never seen it before and that's the one time I've seen it.
"I can remember when you'd see  a cloud of dust, perhaps it'll be a mile away  and this would be  a flock of sheep."
"Course, they hadn't had  lorries in them days, they drive them on the road  and you see old shepherd coming along with a couple of dogs  and goodness knows how many sheep!"
"And of course, the roads were all gravel then, no tarmac, see this cloud of dust across there."
"And er  if you see it was coming towards  of course you run into them, but if they were going the other way  course the dust still keep going."
But  but of course this was many years ago.
Never see a flock of sheep on the road now.
It's all done with cars.
You wouldn't like this dairy you wouldn't.
It er  oh!
"It used to be  occasional or more perhaps, sometimes show time  different shows and that."
"So many sheep  or, ha  show time see, you see these flocks of shop  but now you always"
Been to a cattle market.
That's a long time ago because se the roads have been tarmacked for goodness knows how long now!
I can remember when the first bit of tarmac was put on a road round here  and that down here at Upton bypass  and all
Oh yes!
what they call Upton bypass.
Yeah.
Oh it was er  cry over war wound!
Oh!
Horses will never be able to stand on it!
It's slippery and that.
What a state they were in then!
"My father had er, horses at that time and  my uncle out at Holt, he had some horses  they were talking about this one day and  uncles would say  well a horse didn't work nearly as hard with that  road's were nice and solid."
"Father said well it's, it's so slippery they can't stand on them."
"But it wasn't, it wasn't slippery see, but they thought it would be."
Yeah.
An oh!
You'll be knackered.
I know.
Er yeah so we'll have this thing at Arrow Park to do.
He's hoping to do that.
"We'll looking into doing  we need to know how many cars gone in, how many cars go out"
Into the ?
of the hospital grounds.
But there's residential sections as well.
And then see how long each vehicle stayed there.
There's two entra entrances
You'll have to er take the registration of every bloody car!
That's what we are doing.
Jesus god!
It's probably because they're taking over the er  accident and emergency department from Clatterbrick it's shutting down and it's all going to Arrow Park.
Well that's not why we're doing it.
Well it is.
"That's what's happening, it was on the radio the other day."
This is just  well I mean it maybe connected with that but we're doing it because they want to increase the car parks .
So we're looking to do it with tape recorders  on the busiest entrance  and you know and just say car D five one four R G M  blah blah blah.
Get them all down   and then the person on the quieter entrance can just write them down.
But  you don't necessarily have to say the whole number.
You know you can just say D five one four.
"Well that's what you wanna, so much quicker wouldn't it, just say the Escort D five one four."
"Yeah, you don't even have to say the  the make."
"And then  erm they all get punched into the, Rob's got a special computer programme thing, you punch them all in  er  and then it does a ma a matching thing."
"And it  come, at the end of the day it comes out with all the ones it's matched, the duration it's been there  and er makes it a damned sight easier basically."
Should be quite good.
Then we've got  in June we're supposed to be doing journey time surveys and traffic counts on the M sixty three.
"I won't get off at this one, no?"
No.
I'll get off at the
Erm now they're talking of doing roadside interviews in both directions on the motorway on the slip roads.
"as he thought, authenticate it"
"What, what they call it, stressing it don't they?"
"Stressing it, yeah stressing it"
Mm
and er it would of been impossible to rest your feet on the rail them performing the most uncomfortable
"contortionist, it says here"
oh
Mm
"but did it look authentic with the thing, I mean not to the extent of"
"Well I mean to the untrained eye with a , this guy was suspicious when he saw all this cracked varnish"
Yeah
which it turned out to be wax
Oh
to simulate old varnish you see?
Oh
So then he started looking
Yeah
They've got a way of measuring wear on er stretchers
"Yeah  I mean it's, it's so clever really isn't it how, how they do sort of er fake furniture like that."
"I mean to my mind you might just as well spend your money on, what are you doing idiot, on a well made piece of furniture today like some of those we've seen in, in"
"beautifully made erm, I mean they're brand new but they will be antiques I suppose in the future  you know for your, for your grandchildren sort of thing, but er I mean you can't possibly think what's"
"things that are in there, it's astronomical."
"Mm, quite expensive as you say"
"Mm, you silly dog, what are you doing, what are you doing, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, right, right, then, yeah, yeah, yeah, get him, right  oh he said that heaven"
Mm
"yeah, you do  huh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,Where's Muffin, behind the settee?"
Yes  mm
Did you read this erm review about Ruby Wax?
No I haven't read that yet
"She's is a, quite a"
"character actually, mind you she does er, it looks like one of those programmes you know er, when you don't want to be sitting in the front row, if she's going to"
Mm pick on you
Yes .
Yes.
"So you're really, in a way, you're not much difference than where you started."
"I think Margaret's right, if, if we really want to get through the business we can and however busy we are, erm ."
"I wouldn't we wouldn't to  every time, but I mean it can be, it can be just a very brief report on what's happened, you know, if we want to get through."
"If we said, like, if we, every second month say or every third month, then we, we knew we were going to have a speaker, we could the time before we could then do the business more thoroughly and carefully so that the month of the speaker we could just go through it very quickly ."
.
"Alternatively to, alternative to, to speaker, can we get erm, you know, brief films about different countries and, political systems and so on."
Mm.
"Yes, yes we have the video too, we have, we have the erm the Amnesty video and we, there are, there are schools videos to."
"Do, do, do they do different videos for different countries?"
"Not, they're not, no, the one I've, the one the group has is, is a general one it's on Amnesty's work ."
"Oh, I see ."
"Yeah, yeah, there probably are ones on different countries."
"I'm not sure that Amnesty does produce on, on, one particular country."
"erm, we have."
other organisations that
"Yes they might, yes, mm."
Though even that's the sort of thing that on T V that er
We can video ourselves.
that's right.
"Mm,, mm."
Yeah.
"Yes, there are a lot, mm"
There's all these workshops Margaret.
"Yes, I, I, I have about twelve workshops."
.
On all kinds of things.
.
"On all kinds of things, yes."
I enjoyed that very much that last one.
What was that one?
I bet they don't dispense much of that now because most people buy it over the counter don't they?
"Oh their own, yes"
I mean you're not going to spend three pound forty on a prescription if you can get a bottle for about one pound fifty  so
where you do it
so well where you gonna go for that?
Where else can you try?
Er well I was gonna ask for
"when he comes, gonna ask or ask"
At the college do you mean?
"They seem to know about it, the ones who live in that area  and"
the chemist
Mm
he's an old fashioned type
Well why don't you try Mr Bentley I mean
He's bloody finished now
"Well the shop's closed, but erm, he might be able to tell you somewhere nearer than"
"to get it, I mean he's very obliging."
He lives over the shop still doesn't he?
Or at the back of the shop.
He's a proper character isn't he?
Mm
"But erm he might be able to er oblige you, he was certainly one of the last of the old breed of chemists I think"
"a tissue in machine, bits dropping in and out"
"Look in the pockets you great pi , oh"
I think there's probably one inside a pillow case knowing you
"Oh jesus, Maggots  I caught a few"
there might be a fiver in one of them
You've got no chance of that
Hey did you know this
Yes  oh god  Muffin you're not going out again you're covered in mud.
"I suppose they get fed up stuck in all the time, don't they?"
"Yeah, and they're only out for a few minutes and they're fed up out there as well, and backwards and forwards like a fiddlers elbow  go on  I want to put those lupins in"
Oh nine.
Right.
"So,."
It's a million so one million
It's a
times minus one million.
Is?
million times
And what is the sign of it though?
Minus.
It's the same
Right.
So it's minus a million squared.
"So wh when X is very big well, say, when it's big compared to ten"
Yeah.
this looks like Y equals minus X squared.
Mm.
"And this part of the graph, in there I mean that wouldn't start showing until we get beyond about say twentyish."
"At that point, it could be doing all sorts of weird things, and you'd think oh, I've got this wonderful graph and I plotted a lot of points close together, so I know my sketch was right, because it looked like this funny W thing or M or something"
Mm.
"erm it might well look like that for that very small piece of graph, but the overall picture you've lost completely by not going far enough so you, you want minus infinity to plus infinity."
"When you substitute infinity in, just think well if it was about a million, what could we ignore?"
"I mean, you could work all this out  right."
Ten X plus another ten X. Okay?
"And then minus a hundred and minus X squared, and put the millions and things in but don't need to."
"You've got it factorized like this, you could just, oh, that's about a million."
"It's about minus a million, so it's about minus a million squared."
And there'll be marks going for .
"It's where most people throw it away on the sketches, they just pick a tiny, tiny portion and look at that in great detail, say ah, look at that, wonderful."
Mm.
"But you've lost the, the overall shape of it."
"Tt, erm plotting graphs, you had one question didn't you where they asked a gradient?"
With me so far?
Mm.
But not all of those hundred must vote for the must vote for the closure there must be a hundred people there to take part in the vote is that right?
No.
It is no good putting a closure vote by ninety nine to one or even ninety nine to nought.
The objector cunningly doesn't vote.
We must have a hundred MPs voting for the closure.
All of it ah right okay.
So we need a hundred  present.
Which is where  on a Friday afternoon.
But if if everybody else around the country has been lobbying as hard we have there's a good chance.
After all there's three hundred and three hundred and however many was yes three hundred and sixty MPs who supported it.
Three hundred and twenty seven put their name to an easy end.
So out of those we should be able to manage a hundred surely.
The other thing is if we're successful with Atkins if he's behind the bill the MPs are unlikely to talk it out.
They'll accept it and put send it through on the nod if we can get his support.
So he's crucial.
Why is the Whip so important?
Because surely he's just enforcing the Minister's policy.
Erm yes.
But these people get together.
Right.
I mean it's not as if Robert Atkins  making all the decisions.
"Three hundred people say hang round the bar and say,conservation board I've had lots of letters, well so have I, we'll get get through them they might cause trouble."
That that's the plan.
Well go for democracy the decision being you know for the country being taken by three
Tories rather than
Well that's right yes rather than one.
Well they don't ask John Major of course.
. They can tell  John Major .
So why I'm I'm slightly puzzled as to why Robert Atkins is actually more important than John Selwyn Gummer?
I mean
Do you think that makes any difference?
I think it would really in a way  and yet the people in  know how you sing so the  whereas the  maybe wouldn't know.
Mhm.
"And you would  you would be more, you'd be more nervous in case they they thought, Well she's terrible isn't she?"
"But it would also be fresher for them, you know"
Oh yes.
folk folk that know you either w might be too critical or they might just switch off because they have heard it before .
"They have heard it before, mhm."
But I've never  well I've never really
You've never
sang in  anything other than the pantomime that
Mhm.
"int he village you know, except maybe at  at the  Social or something like that, said, Come on up and sing and then I forget my words and  that's me."
"Do you like to know where, for quite a while in advance what you're going to sing then  ?"
I do really.
"Aha, I do really."
If somebody's would l if somebody wanted me to sing I really would like to know er because
Do you not have a wee store of your favourite things then that you
"Oh I have a wee store, yes, but you see you don't carry them, I don't carry them with me, if I carried them with me I could sing  I could, well that's it,"
"If you did it more often maybe,"
"I feel if, yes, you would remember them an awful lot easier."
Aha.
But er
"What, how did how did you collect the songs that you sing then, I mean were they just things that"
"Just taking  aye, just songs that I liked and  I just er take them off tapes and, and records, and I just write them down,"
Do you do that all the time?
"Are you always, when you're hearing something"
Mhm.
you're listening
Mhm.
"thinking, Oh I'd like to sing that ."
"And I'd like to, aye, and I just  write it down in a  if it's on a tape you can put that pause on and just take line by line, you know."
"Everybody comes from miles around, all the kids come and the parents last year, was it last year?"
Yeah.
"it look just like a ski resort all the bright jackets and the woolly hats and it was lovely, I mean they made it into, into an absolute skating ring for driving on"
Couldn't get your car up .
"Which, every, every thing went sideways, but it was such fun"
Mm.
"and the sun was shining and everyone had got pla plastic bags, anything they could get to slide on you know"
Oh yeah.
"they were going down our front lawn then down the, then down then down the roadway, cos it's a dead end you see, so there's not much , not much traffic"
"oh I see, oh you're alright"
"It's not, it's not when you get to the end of it  then there might be a couple of ."
"Yeah if you, if you're coming up you daren't stop the driver and there's things hurtling at ya, there's kids on sledges coming at you at about fifteen miles an hour and you'll have to try and drive around them and"
I'll stick to the old  what they've got in California then.
"Oh yeah, erm, oh I'd rather have our climate I think."
"It get up over a hundred, people killed"
Oh it's horrible isn't it?
it's a high death rate some .
"Yeah, yeah."
"Funny actually they couldn't, when the rescue people came they couldn't see where the damage was because of the dust."
Really!
"Mm, it's, it's, it's on this mornings news"
Oh .
"This dust, this dust  in California."
"I have heard, I have read about it ."
"This dust , and a, what's it a hundred and fifty cars all piled up on top of one another"
Oh shit.
"and there's a lot of people isn't it, and they don't know how many's dead because there's so much dust they can't see."
Oh how awful.
.
Oh that's awful.
So.
I wouldn't like it that dry.
No.
"It's the same as that place in Australia where they haven't seen rain for seventeen years, I mean there's children who are grown up now at college have never seen a spot of rain, I'd hate that  I'd rather have our, sometimes dismal climate."
"Well look how we get don't we, when er we've gone too long with  shower of rain"
"Mm, mm."
you know the sun is nice
"That's right ,"
"and all that, but it the air get's so dry, that, that, you feel it wants dampening down."
"that's right, and when you do get the thunder storm well my family get into their bathing costumes and go out and stand in it because it's so lovely to have the rain."
That's right.
.
Get away with that now.
Yeah.
"oh well, we, really the weather's not to bad, you, you haven't got to be to sensitive about things have you, you've got to just take it enjoy the lot, enjoy"
"Yes, you have."
.
"Yeah, so far we've been very lucky in, in Britain I think, apart from the hurricane damage, once or twice, on the whole our climates is not bad."
"Oh, you  ."
"Yeah, but, you're mad getting worried to much, you know we had our green house all smashed up and everything and it's been upsetting ,"
Yes .
"erm, when you think about after all ."
"Yes, exactly."
Mm
.
"Exactly, you can't spend your life worrying about things, people are important."
You've got to try and enjoy life.
"My wife's father er he said to me, cos he was, he worked hard you know, he had a tough life you know up in London and all that as, as a kid and that and he said to me what you want to do, enjoy everyday that you live, I said yeah, oh I said oh but you can't can you?, he said yes you can."
"I said but when you're doing the job that you don't like, oh don't do it he said don't do another one"
Yes.
.
He's got the right out .
Too true.
He's got the right out look.
But we really need a candidate and there isn't anybody erm obvious who's in a position to do it unfortunately.
Fishergate this year?
Mm.
Yes.
Yes he does he lives in .
That's in Fishergate isn't it?
That's very true.
Must be an experienced person.
I don't know  cold candidate.
No.
Yeah the main difficulty is in is in the time period because it's it's quite likely that I mean I'd we'd been we'd been hoping that the target candidate could put in a reasonable amount of personal commitment to to the campaign.
"Other and if it wasn't for for me doing a course next year which would probably preclude me from doing that, I'd be quite interested."
But I haven't got I couldn't at this stage say I could do a tap next year.
Even the year afterwards may be not.
Well shall I ask Humphrey whether he's
Worth sounding him out.
Ask ask him if he'd like to do it.
We'll come back to you if we can't find somebody who's got more time I guess.
Okay that sort of covers I think what I need to know for for election stuff.
Because we've said we're gonna have a selection ballot.
Right.
Erm another thing I noted under any other business is green strategy document.
This Government one.
I mean this might not be a good time to chat about it.
I it's just that I remember on Monday morning hearing on the radio that it was being talked about that afternoon and of course immediately forgot to go and get a copy of the next day's Guardian and read about it and all the other
It's today's Guardian.
It's today's Guardian.
I've got it I've got it at home I can bring it in at the next meeting or whatever.
That would be good.
Or drop it into their office.
Possibly we could have later event if we'd read
Especially
Well he got promoted didn't he  he's stable now that child though hasn't he?
"Until they start tre tra blurgh they start treatment straight away don't they, these days."
Oh he's only twelve and ended up as one of the  smallest birds
"But it said I heard that it said chemotherapy well what's that's erm drugs is it, no that's radiation isn't it?"
Makes your
Oh y
hair fall out
well you wouldn't give that to a little baby would they?
Well you'd have to.
I thought they washed the blood out  changed all the blood.
Blood type  and that's what that other woman died  girl died of didn't she they
I was saying to Trevor  it's it's not very nice but it's rather so much better than than than having a cot death isn't it?
If you see what I mean.
Mm.
"I can actually imagine the feeling of going to a cot and then finding no  no the child was dead, that's awful."
Done  there was a  our school dinners today  I went into this  give you four pounds back  I get twenty two pounds sixty  Have you got two tens in change of a twenty?
I haven't got  five pounds
Have you got two tens you want to change for a twenty Paul?
No sorry.
That's been quite good that cos you know  I had a hundred and ten pounds left
Mm.
I only took out the palace because I knew  I'd given I'd written a cheque for forty
You'd written out a cheque
"and I've only just started, still got two people outstanding so I've got that forty pound and I put that into the building society and use that forty pounds  for months see  so it kind of like saved it for me, I've managed, had to do without it"
Yeah.
and er
When have you got to pay all that.
What mu a a th agent says I only have to pay it off a day
How much is it?
What just write a cheque?
Yeah  and that way .
Well you won't be there on the day.
"Changes in job specifications, personnel changes."
Reinforced ones
Alright  changes in job spec
I  procedures were introduced.
Any others?
backlog
Okay.
"Yeah, erm"
By examining people's body language .
"We're not going to that one now, cos I haven't examined your body language I'm not really interested."
"Erm right, difficult one that it's like the body language after what?looking at  do some work."
Amazing
"Yes, thank you for that precise definition there."
"What was that, sorry?"
"Yeah you wanna see if they can do it or not you can tell if somebody, if you give somebody something to do  body language you can normally"
Yeah  sit at their desk .
"Now the thing about positives, when  identify you know somebody might have training."
Now be positive about it.
When they've been promoted to a high ranking job.
"Right, promotion."
"And if you've got somebody who's gonna be promoted or you think might be promoted in a couple years' time, or even yeah less than that, well what should you be doing?"
you ever heard a succession plan is?
"Er you probably don't do it  erm  you know er so brazenly probably the back of your mind but again key staff, you are key staff er yeah if you actually prepare somebody to take over your job when you're not there sort of thing."
So in a way it's a succession plan.
What other things might come out?
What do we do once a year?
Review.
What?
Review.
Review.
"Anything else, appraisals, yeah things like that?"
Anyone else .
South Africans.
Now controversial stuff here in the Sporting Life David Ashforth.
Now Jerry Bailey the man who rode Ah Kong This is at a press conference after the Breeders' Cup.
Jerry Bailey typically articulate was being asked about his success on Ah Kong He described how he had moved alongside a European ridden horse.
He didn't know which one it was he just knew it wa was a European rider.
How did he know that?
The Americans all sniggered.
Bailey smirked a bit.
Well he replied he was kind of flopping about.
And everyone laughed.
Well all the Americans did.
We didn't.
That was Walter Swinburne he was talking about.
"And Bailey's comments are backed up by the trainer Derek Meredith who says American jockeys are better, they ride closer to the horse they're neater and they are stronger too."
There was a warm hum of approval from the American hacks.
"You were there John, what did you think of all that ?"
I wasn't part of the warm hum of approval
I don't suppose so.
and Mr Meredith was a failed jockey in England.
He ended up riding a few jumpers in France so its erm although he's a good trainer now I don't think he's an authority and it's poppycock er frankly.
But when  appear over here they're a great success.
Is there anything in it?
Oh of course they're of course they are a great success.
They are top class jockeys.
But our top class jockeys in America do not flop about they use a slightly different style.
Admittedly they're a little bit less streamlined but if you're going to say that that makes a serious difference
but what's the difference in the courses
as well over here that our our guys have to cope with.
true
The tracks in America okay we go over there and we say they're tight they're quite difficult to ride.
"There's nothing like an Epsom, there's nothing like the variety that our jockeys have to cope with"
Yes.
But you can't back out of the whole rehearsal
"I mean I've backed out of going, having, I'm supposed to be working on that on the stalls as well but I backed out of that and said I've got a hair cut, erm, so I'll have to be done last."
"It's not, it's not gonna go on very long is it?"
"Yes, er probably until about half four"
"Well that's alright, she ain't she's not here till half three in any case"
"Yeah, you'll have to come home a bit er, a bit er"
Yes I know
She's  so this'll probably be our last appointment here wouldn't it?
"No I was saying to her  I'd probably have one more before I go anyway and er  I'm, I'm gonna ask her if she  with my, cos at that nana's there, I mean there'll be four of us there, it might be worth an hour and a quarter drive"
What her?
She wouldn't wanna drive an hour and a quarter
"Well she might not, she might do"
"She wouldn't drive an hour and a quarter, it's not worth it"
"Well we haven't much choice, we'll have to arrange something else that's all, mm I don't, I don't wanna give her up, she's a good hairdresser"
Well you can hardly ask her to drive round and er an hour and a half
An hour and a quarter
for twenty quid
"It's not twenty quid, if Melanie and I have our hair permed, that's, that's two perms and two, two cuts"
And granny have it done
Possibly
dad can have it done
Possibly
nice family outing
Er if she was to come over
Saturday
"No, no, no"
she won't do that
"but she could, I dunno perhaps we can work something out, I dunno, er failing that we'd have to come out to her house"
"Oh right, yeah, I'd rather go up the road, stupid"
"I know, but she's really good though, I be shall sorry to erm, have to give her up"
"oh dear, see that tutor tomorrow morning for an hour, hey hey"
"What, get the job er copied up then"
exac stop this casual labour business you see?
"Whe whereas the building trade would say oh I'll take you, you're a friend of mine, I'll take you you're a friend of  I can take you, you're a friend ."
"It was  It was  a great lot down in Leith here, and I've often seen it down in Leith docks."
"When I've been down there trying to get casual work, you know in Leith docks?"
"And he just down, they're all in a big crowd ."
"And a chap come out the offices and say right, you you you ."
So in actual fact it was always a favour cos I got the jobs.
"So to stop all that, this is with the b building trade, they had to guarantee them."
So presumably that was quite a popular piece of er legislation?
"Legislation, oh definitely."
Mhm.
"I've had s still operating now to present day, I don't know."
Mm.
What did you do erm after that?
Well as a  reach up up .
"In fact that's what I left from, I left from the job at job street in George street with the building trade."
That's when I .
And I  work after that.
"But the site  prepared to let me work, to carry on then as s they ma and I wouldn't claim my pension until I'd finished."
"And behind that, their reasoning for that is, for every year that I worked over my retir retireable age, there's a  that is added to my pension."
He says I  haven't got you working long  longer I worked the bigger the pension I have when I go out .
So were you allowed to work er after your retireable age?
"Not, not at that particu when they got to hear about it."
Mm.
"Of course they, they had questions of  and he says oh well I've sat with him, the man's prepared  working at Lambert, but no you can't allow the man to work after he's sixty and that was it."
So that was me on.
But the OAPs
Were you involved in any erm political parties or anything er ?
"No no not necessary though, though I have done quite a wee bit just now er in support of my Labour Party, you know?"
"Done quite a wee bit and I've been there at a few of their, quite a few of their meetings and erm a good friend of quite a few of the councils."
And Lothian  District Council.
Quite a good friend of them you know and I'm a close contact with them.
"today, somewhere  never mind, no, you're not having any more biscuits you  Right I erm, I see it's ten past eleven, I want to get this ball washed, so, er, let them go in the wash"
Right I'm going to work in the workshop
"I'll tell you what, I get the erm, I get the battery of the, the other one, you can try it."
You want to try it don't you if you're going to have it?
"Well this is it, it might be knackered now those two"
"Has he been in the, in the loft in the workshop?"
Or
No.
"Well you, it's not corroded or anything is it?"
Let's turn that down
Can't turn it out.
Power isn't it?
"Yes, but you won't get the same connections will you?"
I don't know
Use your
Fantastic that
pause
"I'm looking for something somewhere   Yes, well it appears to be working, but whether it's working correctly I don't know oh  Ray, there is provision here for the headphones, you, you said are you supposed to use headphones with it, mind you  it sounds pretty audible anyway, I don't think you need headphones, I mean I'm not sure there's a"
No
See how she goes.
Erm
Thing is I've got to try by turning those volts down on some of them
"Yeah it's just that find out if there's any nails in the, in the wood."
Possibly have
stones
You're not likely to get stones em embedded in the
"Oh  I mean whether, whether that one is, is good enough for"
enough
"Mm, and it"
the nails in the wood that's all
"Oh yes it's, it's, how long ago was it when Robin bought that?"
Eleven or twelve wasn't he?
So if we're going to do er  I'd better unclip this hadn't I?
Yo
Yes
not one
not once
not one but two
Oh that's awful
Oh dear
You'd thought that these houses could of least put a bit of paint on
Why?
Make it look more attractive
No
They look grotty like that
I still think that you should buy Jean a Range Rover
Why?
"She likes them, nice cars"
I'll buy her a dinky toy one
they're beautiful
"Mm, they might be beautiful but they're difficult to run"
What do you mean difficult to run?
They're a damn sight more efficient than this I'll tell you that for a start
Rubbish
"they take more petrol, but servicing-wise they don't require as much"
Rubbish  they're probably a lot more expensive to run than this
"Well just because this is a Jag H J six convertible, it's neither here nor there"
"Oh, what the whole part of the problem running is, is the depreciation thing, the more, the more you spend on a car the more the more depreciation you're going to get"
Oh I suppose so
I'm not saying I suppose it's better
well this is a classic car as they go
"It's a, it's a, it's a er"
Oh no
What?
Very good.
"We got our free milk, of course, we got our free milk."
"That was one  we got our free milk  as many pints of milk as we required for to keep our fam but no more, no more than that, just  much your family had they'd allow you a pint per  per person."
Was it erm was it hard work in the in the creamery?
Oh no.
No not in comparison to the jobs I'd already been in.
Oh no this was much easier for me.
Because   at that time .
And er after this did you move back to Edinburgh?
"I moved back to Edinburgh too because er my er my family had taken a yearning for Edinburgh, they didn't like East Kilbride so I says  left."
"And also it's true today, you go where your family wants to go and that was, this was er they had a yearning for that and they were not settling down so"
What did you do when you when you moved back to Edinburgh?
"Well I went into a timber yard er known as er, what was the timber yard again now?"
.
And they .
Where as I said  er working with timber.
Was that erm like sawmill or something?
"Sawmills, sawmills and ."
Cabinet makers
Was that a dangerous job?
"Well it could be dangerous, if you didn't watch what you were doing."
"Like every other, other job you've got to er gain experience as you go along, you've got to experience."
"And you've always got to, you've always g advice and on how to handle it before you, you put  actually handling them."
Were there erm any accidents or anything?
"Er but if there was any accidents through negligence, if there were accidents, it was negligence er and the people by themselves."
"Which is er worker often, often  often most of our accidents is caused by negligence."
So what were the conditions in the er in the mill like?
"Very good, very good conditions."
"Very good conditions indeed, aye."
Was there a union there as well?
Er there w wasn't a union then.
Mm.
Alright.
I'll give you something to
"I'm going tomorrow morning there anyway cos Roy's just given me a call, they've got some problems with  screw support bearings locking up, but er I'll go over there some time"
Right.
.
Yeah .
Yeah.
.
So I'll  Sally .
"Okay, is that happiness?"
"Right, yeah okay."
Erm just the  one's me main concern.
I mean the others you know it's it's what we get and and  sort of thing.
With them it's it's yeah.
Mm.
Erm I'm not happy with them and I don't know how you get round it .
Knowing what's happening there.
Well er at the end of the day it may be one that we're gonna we're gonna lose but erm
Mm.
If it is
Love the ultimate four letter word and were about to use it all over your television screen.
"Where do you start with love, every body wants to love, every body wants to be loved, every one at some time or another is disappointed by love and while its difficult sometimes talking about it not talking about it can have some really serious consequences, so let's try to get to the heart of it tonight, one hundred women are prepared to share their wisdom if not their secrets, I'd like to start off by seeing if we can differentiate between loving and being in love."
"Have you ever been in love?, are you now?, button one for yes, button two for no  and in this hundred, woof ninety three people have been in love, what, what happened?,"
"I mean what, what how did you know you were in love?"
"How did you know that was, that, that was what it was?, yes"
Temporary madness
can
only temporary
"er, well it does wear off you can't, you can't, you can't"
sustain it indefinitely
"and what, what were the symptoms in your case?"
Your mad!
"What is it though, what's historical linguistics?"
Is it like what we do in Old English or not?
Cos that
Yeah it is.
That sounds excellent.
Right it's due in week three I think.
Hurray.
"Er but  as far as I'm concerned if it comes in in week four, that's fair enough, but things after that then they start to get a bit upset"
"But I sa I said to Chris, When is it?"
"She said, Week three."
"Er and I said, Give or take a few days, and she said, Yeah."
"So if it's inside week four then that will quite reasonable, does that sound okay?"
Okay has anyone had a think about what they want to do?
I mean does anybody else know?
sort of everything we've had so far's been pretty general.
Okay if any of you wanted to you could always go out some tape recorder  and people have a listen to it.
But obviously if you're going to do that you'll have to do it during next week some time  On the other hand I could give you a list of five topics and you could choose one.
Yeah Oh yeah I mean there's five five things five things in men or women's conversation t to do and essay about.
"Say one about interrupting, one about topics, and one about perhaps interaction with children, one about er  what    Or you could even I mean if I did er I did a list of that you could even do the same one, you wouldn't have to do one each."
You know you got your erm tag questions?
Yeah.
might not be one of the question in it as  tag questions could be
Oh yeah.
specific.
Okay er  There's one title I've got written down here which I don't know if anyone's interested in.
Evaluate the claim that women are more d ob Evaluate the claim that women are more observant of the prestige norms in their speech than men are.
Does anyone fancy that?
Let's If I write down   Okay the  which I've just suddenly thought of were er
"turn-taking and interruptions and overlap and tags and tag questions, topic selection and interaction with children, which I think I just mentioned make sure you've got them down so we can forget them."
Er
What?
"I I wrote to Atkins saying as Minister for the Environment er, Please support the energy conversation bill because it's dead good."
Presumably I can also write to John Gummer saying  is dead good.
Am I right to write to the others saying I or should
Oh yeah.
"I write to Gerry  saying say, Please prod Robert Atkins and remind him that the energy conservation bill's dead good in case he's forgotten."
Erm no I think the former I think the Parliamentary
But I can write to him in his capacity as Robert Atkins' Parliamentary Private Secretary.
Yes.
Cos otherwise it looks like writing to random M Ps.
I think you're sort of drawing drawing their attention to the public concern over that sort of phrase.
And widespread  cross party support.
Yes.
Honest guv.
wishy-washy statements for your audience.
I presume getting letters out is more important than high quality prose here is it?
Oh yes.
Just a couple
Cos I mean
of lines will do.
name name dropping the supporters I mean for to those Tories telling them that the that the association for county councils for example is a backer probably counts more than telling them that that   is a backer .
Yeah well I think particularly
or green particularly
doing their own I just take the letters I've already written to other people change one sentence and change the er name on
That's fine so
comrade.
Printed off on my er employer's er computer and er put it in one of their envelopes and try to steal a stamp from them.
We're gonna get it all down Andy don't worry.
How wide is the Green Party's main bill associated with  do you think?
Well in the main lobbyist has been Ron  who's the who's our elected campaigns officers and he's quite literally been spending time treading the the hallowed halls of Westminster
I mean in the media.
In the media I mean I haven't seen much about it in the media.
Er
"It's not how many stocks and shares they've got, it's not what the size of their balance is, how much they've got on deposit account, how much credit, how credit worthy they are, that is not the richness of a man or a woman."
"Here the wise man says, the blessing of God, it makes a person rich  and it does not bring sorrow with it."
It's a strange verse.
Put it to the back of your mind a moment please.
"As I turn in to the book of Genesis I read there of God coming to Abraham, and saying to Abraham,that Abraham in your family all the nations of the world are gonna be blessed !"
How is that blessing gonna come?
It comes through the Messiah.
"It blessed the  for Abraham, the Messiah."
Jesus.
Because we become  middle class?
Because we've become better off?
Of course not!
We are blessed in him because he gave his life for us.
That is the source of God's blessing.
"Not in getting, but rather in giving."
"The apostle Paul when he's writing to the Corinthians in his first letter to them, one Corinthians  ."
Well what is this?
What's the definition?
"I suppose if I come around and ask each one of us this morning, can you give a definition?"
"I'm writing a dictionary and I'm stuck on a word, I want the definition of blessing."
"And I suppose for every person here, there would be a  I would say a similar, but a different er definition."
"There'd be a lot of similarity to it, and I think if we're honest  a lot of it would come back to things."
Well let's see what God himself has to say cos he gives us a definition of blessing.
Gives it to us in psalm a hundred and thirty three  and it's in the last verse.
He is talking about God people being in unity.
"And he says, as a result of them being in unity, dwelling together in unity, he says it is there that the Lord commanded the blessing."
Whatever that is!
And it gives the blessing for what it is.
Life forever.
That is God's blessing!
That is God's blessing to you.
That is God's blessing on me.
This is just in a courtyard and there'll be shrubs and things so she's got
Hold on.
Wha how  where is it going to be seen from?
I presume it's seen from the wards  that are up behind looking down onto this courtyard.
"There's also erm  a play area for the  the children's ward  there's also some murals on the  the walls, various artistic murals."
"And, of course, they've got this grant from  Artcan  for six thousand pound  for a proggie mat exhibition."
A six thousand pound grant for a proggie mat
Well
exhibition?
"well over, over a period, it's  and other things too but they sa they said that murals and proggie mats are involved in it."
And various other art things.
"But also,th the thought of a gar a garden and the children keeping the garden  up."
"But that's a, apparently that was a long way and they have transport difficulties to go from here  to  the Wandsbergh Hospital."
"But then I thought, perhaps  if  that"
I can't see the education committee  with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here
Well they won't
to go Ashington Hospital to do a
"they won't so the they, they"
garden.
"the, the, the  education committee and the school governors have no money at all"
No.
to pay for that.
I would expect
But then
that's a very low priority.
"well it isn't even a priority, it is nothing."
They won't get the money.
Th they won't pay for them to go swimming
Well I don't
they've gotta walk to go swimming.
"But, I thought that  now that the M S has acquired that bus  and it's going to be standing around doing nothing for most of the time  and it's a twenty nine seater bus."
"I mean, the seats come out so that wheelchairs can go in  but  in between times it's twenty seats you see."
How you going to know exactly where the boundaries go or i in between some land-lock countries  that you got it in the right position
How many land-lock countries are there in South America?
"Well enough anyway, I mean I thought you were giving me something easier to do not"
Well I think  why would you do it tonight if I didn't have it?
Yes
Say I didn't have it tomorrow you'd
well
do it tonight?
probably ni or tomorrow I was gonna do that.
"I seem to think you should take the easy bit, cos that's gonna be miles too hard!"
"No I like to balance it, I ju there's some balance there, there's some easy ones and some hard ones."
I'll tell you what's best for Michael.
I don't feel that's very good  because you're just gonna get children totally pull out of it unless they're
No.
really really good.
Children are allowed to go
"You find that if if if i in a team, if there's teams  i you find that in a singles, but if there's a team e if everybody feels the everybody feels they can contribute something to it  when you've got"
You can have those
"allowed to be the idea of that, you don't wanna make it"
Yeah I know
too easy
No there are no husbands allowed to be with any wife  and children can attach themselves to which group they want.
"So work out the groups, you work out the groups."
Well there's going to be  apart from your father there's going to be seven adults.
"Listen, a man with a woman  but not wi not  by marriage  cos say like Andy with Nanna"
"Well I could go with two children, I expect."
"Well write down the names let's have a go at, let's work out, let's work out the teams"
"Cos I'm the cleverest person, I can go with two teenies!"
"lo , write down the names."
Modest!
No and I could be the only adult with two children cos I'm so clever.
Write down the names and th work out some balanced teams then for me please.
but I bet one of those holes will take a whole wheelbarrow full of that
Oh easily
concrete and that's got to be one mix each time isn't it?
Because what I used to do is throw the bricks in and concrete and water
And water
"erm, no I mean apart from the concrete it helps to fill the hole"
Yes
so if you just put the
well
the sand and gravel and the concrete as you say a barrow load goes nowhere
Yeah
"I mean, huh, they never get blown over, but er, it's a lot of work isn't it?"
Where's little tiddly gone?
Where is he by the way?
Erm I said to you he's on the settee
"Hello, hello, hello"
if he's on there just shout at him will you because
oh he's in here
he's by the radiator aren't you beaut?
"He's a beauty babe, oh, rascal aren't you?"
"Would give you that continuous conversation, erm where is, is life is  it's surprising how much time you do have to put into it."
I mean it surprised me I thought oh yes
"one and a half tapes a day, yeah, it's, it's a doddle, but erm, not, not only have you got to know how it functions, but you've got to know, know you've got to fill in your, your document"
Yeah
"to I mean ideally, ideally it'll be better to fill it in as you go along"
Personally I would of
Well of course that's what vitamin C is isn't it?
Well acetic acid is you know the chemical
"you know, it's got to be three third, er thirty three percent you see"
Oh
which the vinegar's only about two percent probably that
"oh my god, well that's the stripper then really isn't it?"
Lets.
Stack them high and sell them cheap.
Erm oh we'll they're going to go for twenty P plus cost of the stamped addressed return envelope
Yeah.
friend.
Which is slightly more  than some people   do with their money.
Erm  where are we.
Oh yes orders to receive letter box stickers.
"Erm  Lisa is that  I'm not quite sure, from the York University student rooms, is  in to help us with the big box pile up."
And having spoken to her on Saturday when she came along to the energy conservation stall I intend to invite her if it's alright with the meeting to our next meeting which is on the ninth of February to discuss how the Greens can help how the University Greens can help us with that demonstration.
And perhaps forge a link you never know.
So if that's that's approved I'll give that a tick and so we can bring it up again later.
Great.
Erm I've also received information on conference accommodation and on the billboards but I've billed those as separate items so that you don't listen to me half off all evening.
That's it.
Okay.
Do we have a treasurer's report in absent here?
No he's absent.
He's .
But I do have something from the membership secretary.
Right so that's other officers.
membership secretary.
"Well the membership secretary, if I can remember how to spell it, erm mm has indeed been in touch with erm John  who very kindly sent us a free copy of erm their version of our membership list."
Which is how we found out that one that we have a new member erm Sally  who I'll add on to my list and er send a newsletter to.
Also Joan  Ian  and Mrs Green  erm we all thought they joined locally and the national party have no record.
It's the same old story.
Erm John  has suggested that we send their membership on and then that's definitely it.
We're now all up to date and we agree with head office and we can take it from here.
Erm one minor alteration on that point.
I've got a membership card for  possibly er previous
From January.
sort of yeah from the end of January's er
as the dances are concerned.
And another thing is the young ones don't dance.
They can
Do you mean by young ones my generation ?
"I mean , yes, well maybe you can but I do but the the younger ones are ever er you know younger ones like Carl and them, they can disco but they they can't waltz or  er foxtrot or"
How did you learn to waltz then?
"Just by going to dances, just by going to dances, we just, you just picked it up, your your partner could do it and you just learnt from there."
Mhm.
That's one thing I've always been a quick learner which has been quite
Mhm.
I think Jane's got  er that as well.
She seem to be able to pick thing sup.
Does she like dancing?
Not as fa not the dancing but when she was working in an office you know they just needed to show her something once and she could pick it up.
Mhm.
"It was the same in the the pantomimes when Lily has learnt learnt the dancing, I could er after she had showed us about twice I could I could have it no bother and the rest of them were still struggling away trying to learn the steps."
So it's quite an advantage.
So did you go to dances quite a lot before you were married  ?
Oh yes in  aye.
Was that the place where everybody went to
To the Town Hall.
young lads and lasses would get together ?
"Lasses would yes, aye, to the dances."
"And they used to run  er buses to different places, you know, you used to go to different places, and ."
And what kind of band played for the dances when you were in  then?
"Bands like what Tommy has, you know accordion bands."
That er they were all more or less that kind of band.
So by the time you came here it would mostly just be Tommy that was playing?
"Roundabouts, er the only one I can remember is Tommy round about, you know playing er in the Hall."
"And , it was just these kind of bands that"
Mhm.
"were in those days, the accordion bands."
"And the same in most of our organizations in this country at the present day, and that's what's wrong."
It's holding them back.
"When you've got a left, a right and a centre, you've got three different parties within a party."
So the Labour Party got united then at that time?
"Oh definitely, very well united, yes."
Then.
"But don't forget that was just after the war and er the Labour were beginning to build up, getting things better, run better country than they were  previous p people."
Did the Labour Party gain a lot of support after the war?
"Oh yes, aye they did oh."
"Oh aye proved it, they got in."
E eventually they got into parliament.
"Erm now did your er Labour Party membership lapse after, after that time?"
Er yes it did lapse.
"Because I had seen my young brother-in-law and I says I'm gonna be like that then, didn't fe er feel any of this er at that time."
"Me,as the district council."
I couldn't see myself doing it so as I said I wasn't going to make a fool of myself by putting my name as being nominated forward er as a candidate etcetera  lose interest  that's the first thing that happened because they knew I was an outspoken bloke.
"I knew  spoke too much  next nominee, next candidate for ."
"And I felt it wasn't up to them, I didn't have enough experience I wanted to gain some more experience but it just fell away, lapse."
"And erm you're, you're not a member of the Labour Party again?"
No I'm not a member of the Labour Party yet.
Oh.
"You see the pre the present system we've got  Scottish Old Age Pensioners is non sectarian, non political."
You understand?
Is this er does that actually debar from belonging to er
"Oh I could have er er well it doesn't debar me but I feel it, it would it wouldn't be right, for me being a Labour Party member sitting on a, a non-segregated and non-political gr er ah association,"
Mhm.
"Now er you, you mentioned your, your pensions association."
"Now you're area treasurer, aren't you, for the"
"Area treasurer, er Edinburgh area"
Can you tell me a bit about the organization and what its aims
"Well the aims  I'll just read this  and this says, this gives you most ."
This   the name of the association shall be the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association.
"You're only, you only"
Well you only put
putting that much in
Oh
"in this, in like a pint"
"Mm, so you only want a small amount then really don't you?"
"That's the trouble, I don't need a ruddy gallon"
Mm
"and the other of course is the eight eighty ammonia which is only half of five mil, two and a half mil teaspoon."
Which chemist did you go to?
Bob's
"Oh, and neither of them, no E T will you stop it you two, you see"
Aye
get in your basket this minute
"I thought, I thought the other one had got it"
"go on , go on."
"When you think of it, these chemists to date, no wonder their wives are on a low wage and the moaning all the time because they're not bloody chemists, they're just getting pills out of a box"
"Yeah, that's right , yes, yeah"
"you don't see erm doing this  but, well after that, I mean"
"and er, well years ago they had all these bottle of potions on the back shelf I suppose"
"they were mixing up all the time, it's all antibiotics now and isn't it tablets or"
Mm
bottles of
"already, ready mix"
"There's a jar already done, you just pour it in"
"Yeah, I suppose and mostly to erm, medicines are, are in tablet form aren't they?"
You know you don't get that many liquids it's usually for children isn't it?
Ninety percent probably
The erm you get
The only liquid you get are probably cough medicines and stuff like that and
Yeah
"which are all, er what they called?"
"Thirty odd, thirty"
"That's round about thirty-seven per cent, innit, somewhere around there."
"Yeah, we paid thirty eight pound off it last year."
Makes more.
"It's ridiculous, you know, mortgage payments."
When you think of it.
I know.
"and on 'ouse, they put eight hundred and ninety eight pound, you could say, nine hundred pound interest on 'ouse."
Oi.
"I don't know how they get away with mortgage payments like they are, because, you know,it it's totally unfair,"
They are.
"I mean, alright, we know you're handling large lumps of money, but when you think of it, if you, if you, borrowed it at a different rate, you know, same rate as you could do finance, 'cos which I think the government could do it and make a profit at it."
Yeah.
You know what I mean.
"Instead of having all these different mortgage companies, Abbey National and that, the government have er, have er, a whatsname to do it, they're wouldn't be half and a quarter."
"I mean, it happens all over the world, you know, in in the in the especially in the whatsname countries."
I know.
Communist countries.
"Everything's owned by the by the government and er, I know it's not a right good thing, like, but if it could work properly, it would be a damn good thing."
Watch she don't bite ya.
"I mean, communism in England,"
"in it's  in it's proper form would be a wonderful thing, but er, it's on because er, it's only the rich people what make people poor."
I know.
"The say as with damn education, like, at bloody Tory sods, they took all blinking, we gi for al for all these people what's going to college, every time they drop on holidays they've got nothing to keep 'em."
No.
"So I my opinion, what this government's doing is stopping stopping the lower class, well I say lower classes, the lo the the"
isn't it.
"poorer people, they stop 'em getting educated."
That I'm I'm almost convinced.
Yeah.
"It says, everything they're doing, it says, is going back to the eighteenth century, when you hear about these Kath Catherine Cookson days, working for pennies and you can't get educated"
"un cutting back,"
"she was nearly retired, Billy"
"she was nearly retiring by the, no still the girls go to her at the school so she must have been going for, two or three years after we came up here, but I would be in the choir just, maybe two or three years."
And then it
And did it
"it fell the choir fell folded up ,"
Folded up and she
"Aye, oh"
retired?
There was nobody else took it on.
Was there a church choir going at that time then?
"Yes, aye there would be, just the same ladies that have s been in it for years."
"But there were men in it for quite a while, I was wondering when that kind of faded out."
Oh that was faded out before
That was a good while before
Aye before we came up here.
"I wonder if, it Mr, was it  choir or his father or something that had it, I can if I can remember somebody saying."
So what was going on in the way of entertainments and things like that when you came to  ?
When I came up to live here?
"There was quite a few dances, in er, do you mean dances in the Town Hall?"
"Ah there would be  there well just one or two, not not every week or anything like that as far as I can remember."
Just a few over the winter?
"Just aye, aye, oh they didn't have them in the in the summer, and of course in them days well the  the bars shut at ten o'clock which meant you know they came into the dance hall just after that where nowadays the bars shut at twelve o'clock and"
It's hardly worth having a dance .
It's not worth having a dance.
"But I heard the Town Hall was having one, not the Town, was it the Town Hall or Community Council having one between, I think it's the Town Hall, between Christmas and New Year and really I don't think it's worth their while  having them then."
Do you think that's been a big thing contributing to there being a=less dances and things then?
Do you mean the bars being op oh I think
And clubs.
I think so really
Do you think it's the main thing ?
"I think that's what's really, it's killed them  as far"
Mhm.
He should know about them shouldn't he?
"Well we must  that's why, certainly have to, before"
Could you drag him along  to a meeting?
Yeah well that's what  they said we could do that.
I'll write that down.
"Erm, is that okay for that I just have something that I read in New Scientist does everybody take it?"
No
Oh well I'll give you one to look at  it's just a little article about
Thank you.
recycling in in Egypt.
And I just liked reading it so much that I thought you'd like to read it too.
Don't have to read it now cos it's quite long.
It's it's  it's really hot  .
Cos they they reuse absolutely everything.
And they make they're living out of it.
In East German they are now drowning in rubbish because  they used to have a perfect recycling scheme  everything was collected and recycled cos they just didn't have the materials.
Now they are flooded with the West European goods  their recycling isn't worth any more.
On the other hand they haven't got the landfills and the whole scheme that the west has developed and they   I mean it's a health  hazard meanwhile.
One of the major problems they have to face.
Far East  lots of guys sort of collecting cardboard boxes and that's all they did they flatten down cardboard boxes and then another one did newspapers and whole newspapers and
The whole town is composed of a
Yeah.
it's like a big .
I just thought it was  interesting.
Erm  I did write er as was suggested asking about  erm facilities for cyclists in the potential  shopping centre development in Bishop's Stortford.
"And they are, they are interested in cyclists but from what I could make out reading this  they're not really going to help us a great deal."
If you want to pass it round and read it.
It's it's they're gonna use the green wedges that are already there and the existing footpaths which are already cycled along.
"What, what good is that to me?"
It's just  in Stortford it's not that easy for a cyclist is it?
No
And they've got all the places  say don't lean your bicycle here and you're not allowed to take it into Jackson
"all they're doing is erm, where people do it on a Saturday they, they won't do their, go football or something and then go on a Sunday, now I think it's nice to have a, a day when nothing happens."
"Yes, when it's all quite all the shops are closed ."
.
"Apart from religion or anything else, you know."
"Yeah,."
Yeah.
"It, I think it's nicer when, when it"
"Oh yes, not necessarily religious grounds I agree with you, it's just nice to have one day a week where everything is peaceful."
"That's right, yeah, where as it's now they're all going to open up, gonna go chasing around"
"Just be like a Saturday ,."
"we shan't know which day, there'll be no weekend, will we really"
No.
it won't be a weekend.
No
"And that it's all for money and they're doing alright, I mean they're already making so many you know, millions they're making aren't they?"
"Well the big ones are, yeah."
Yes.
Oh yes.
"There's only one thing, it might mean more part time jobs for college leavers and things if they go to work on a Sunday in the big stores and they did, give them a foot up to start a job, then get taken on you know as  ."
"But the one's that's gonna be hit I think are, people like old Lionel."
Yes.
Mm.
"Because he, he's not doing all that good you see, and when er, he, he re he reckons on Sunday"
Yeah Sunday morning .
.
"But I prefer Lionel, I'll go round the supermarket's but I'll shop at Lionel's on the way back."
"We do, we don't buy ."
"Cos I can pick out his stuff or say I don't like the look of that one and he'll, he'll chuck it in the back."
"Mm, mm."
"And he'll often say to me look there's a fresh box under there, help yourself to what you want, i haven't opened that box."
"And, and if you complained about anything, er like we found, perhaps had a banana that's not been quite ripe, he'll give you two or three the next time you go in if you say anything about it"
"Oh yes indeed, indeed , well only last week I said do need some flowers, come on Thursday they're fresh, I said I want them now Lionel, I hate to be without flowers in the room and he said well have two for the price of one, he would insist that I had two bunches for the price of one."
Before we get bogged down.
"I haven't received the samples, er oh sorry I I'll moving on to what we're talking about."
The National Party are mounting a poster campaign for the elections.
For both elections which hope hopefully covers the Euros and the er locals starting at the beginning er towards the end of the local election campaign to running through to the  June.
And they said erm if you would like to see the designs write and ask for a sample so we wrote and I haven't actually received any samples yet.
But I have had a letter erm explaining where the billboards are in our area and how much they cost.
It's a very badly written letter actually.
"For one thing it starts,Dear Mrs Knightingale  which got my back up."
"Erm and then it goes on to say,Please find the enclosed the postal sites available in your area Miriam   who's the Green Party person who's organizing it  has provided the required areas and if you need any more details please don't hesitate to call me or my secretary."
And under the sites  may also  availability at the time of booking.
I look forward to hearing from you with your selections .
But introductory letter aside erm  interesting.
Can I just get clarification here?
Yes.
That letter almost sounds like we us around this table are expected to choose some of the sites.
Yeah.
We didn't just write for information as to what National Parties
"Erm well I just wrote Miriam and said, I saw your article in Green Week can you send me further details."
And this is what's happened so.
What it transpires is local parties who are interested enough get what's
Yeah.
get to try and choose site.
Right.
Erm now then it gives us a erm a price here which I think is weekly.
Because the availability columns are weekly so it makes sense that the price means weekly.
Erm and it has a number of different types W and F .
But if I run through the addresses I think it'll make sense because everybody will recognize where they are.
Erm in York Holgate Road which is twelve pounds a week.
Hundred and ten Fishergate which I think is the side of Jacksons that's fifteen pounds a week.
Erm in fact there's two there.
East Parade eighteen pounds a week.
Tang Hall Lane eighteen pounds.
"where, where I found more so were"
that's the oldest part isn't it?
That's the oldest part
That's right on the knife
and the er
"whether the grain was straighter, maybe that was the answer"
and the awkward thing was to hack a wood in the centre
"Yeah that's right, yeah, yeah"
An American oak is not too bad
But the English you can end up doing a lot of scrapping for your finish
Mm
"and it's just only because of the climate, there's er"
"Cold weather, the, oh, is that what it was?"
"That's right, yeah, he's, he's"
"Mm, mm, funny there was a lad here"
"this chap was here last week he bought this pine table up, got his key, and he'd been working for three years in Norway"
Oh yeah
as a joiner
Yeah
"and he was saying, told me some of the different names, you know, other than pine, I suppose their name for whatever these pines were, the timber there was beautiful"
Yeah
the er
all the
"knots, very few knots, just lovely yellow pine and er and they make all their furniture out of these pieces, so, he said that's what set me off on making furniture he said"
"say that the cost of living there tremendous, tremendous"
"ten years ago now they took out these tremendous mortgages because their wages had trebled, it, it about a ten year period, you know when the boom was on"
Yeah
"a few years ago, and he said er there was a lot of repossessions there."
It's happening everywhere you see.
"You could buy a house very cheaply then, but er"
"we, we didn't know what was going to happen"
"that's not all you can do now is blame the Labour Party, it's incredible now."
"The seventy nine of you who voted for banning hunting,a are you all townees, do you not understand th the fabric of er, of the country?"
"Do you have an alternative to offer that would er, that would sustain that fabric?"
Yes?
"I live in the country, I live in the heart of the country right next to a sheep farm, and there's no co , no message at all from the farmer that  foxes are a pest  it's a misnomer put about by the hunt."
"Fox hunting was started, two hundred, three hundred years ago by the aristocracy because there wasn't enough deer, because the fo the forests were getting obliterated by the same pi , the same people, it was started as an entertainment, it's an entertainment now!"
"And now the hunt are turning round and they're lying about what they're doing, they're saying it's pest control, they're saying, we do it, it's quick, it's a sharp nip in the back of the neck."
It's not!
"The hunt encourages foxes into their land  they actually build artificial earths, we saw one of Saturday when we were out protesting, the ar , they encourage foxes onto the land so they can hunt them."
A hunt is no good without foxes.
They don't want foxes
Alright.
"to be depleted at any way, they encourage them!"
So you actually go out and do something about
Yes.
your your your er  your feelings?
Wha what do you do as a protester?
"We actually, I'm actually er, in the Scottish Action Against Blood Sports"
Aha.
"and we do many things, we write to MP's, we write to councils trying to get them banned off the land, and we've been very successful."
"We've actually helped stop the  oldest hunt in Scotland, in Li Lithgo in Stirlingshire, which ended last year."
We were very successful then and we've now  progressed.
"We go out every single Saturday, weekdays if we can, and we try and stop the  stop the fo , hounds killing the foxes"
So
peacefully.
"so so you're proud of having stopped the oldest hunt in, in Scotland?"
Very!
Right.
I'd like to disagree with that.
Ah.
"I'm an ex-master's wife from Lithgo in Stirlingshire hunt, and we had to stop because erm  the country was disappearing underneath us."
We had a new
Mm.
It doesn't make sense to buy the cheapest brand of baked beans to save a few pence.
It's true.
So then fill your car tank at the most expensive petrol station  in town.
"If you're going to make economies , make efficient ones."
"Similarly, if you are going to be extravagant, be so in an a area,where you're actually going to see the benefit"
So you see
Ha
I told you you should have those two pairs of shoes.
happiness will come to all Virgos  who aim the right arrows at the right targets this weekend .
"Gearoid, what are you?"
It depends.
"It is the nineteenth of February, which one does it fall on theirs?"
Pisces or  Aquarius?
Pisces.
"Aquaria , Aquarius."
Mhm.
"so the term a minor crime I, I don't think is a very good one to be using."
"mm, yes"
I was actually mugged on holiday er then years ago and I was held up with a gun and it was the most horrendous feeling
where was that?
"in Barbados and er some young chaps had saw me lying on the beach and er they stole my bag and they stuck a gun in my face and freeze lady, you don't do any thing, you just let them take what they want and its a horrible feeling when your there, we were there for three weeks and it just totally spoiled the holiday but the ramifications of it don't just stop once you got on the plane home, it was very frightening"
"well your talking about it now and, and with a degree of emotion, do you still feel it?"
"oh, it was feel , it was so terrifying, you just, you regard every one with suspicion after that."
"mm, mm"
"I actually feel, there was a time I used to think it wouldn't happen to me because if I was in that situation I would do this, I would do the next thing and when it did actually happen to me  it took me ages to get over"
mm
the trauma because your so helpless and
"what was, what was the it can I ask that happened?"
mm
I mean if you don't want to say its alright
"no, I don't particularly want to say"
yeah
Yes
So I asked if they wanted anything and she said a bed at the cottage hospital
What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
Well there are special beds
Oh you mean a bed?
You mean a special kind of mattress?
Well she just asked about a bed so I told her that
You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?
"She just said a bed, so I told her there were special beds that we are very useful in fact very necessary in  cases and we tend to be short of them"
Ah ha
and a  bed costs two thousand pounds.
There's another one  can't remember the name of which costs a lot more
Ah ha
Something like five thousand .
"Anyway, I said I'd make enquiries as to what was wanted and I said because there's a new children's ward will open at the  hospital and perhaps they would ."
So I saw Mrs  and Mrs  said they were aiming to raise money for scanner appeal
Yes
They're also going to have a obstetric  department  first time
A what?
Obstetric and patients
Yes
and that obviously they would be tend to be other children with mother's there so they would need perhaps a play facility there and other children who goes to the E N T clinic can go to the  not just go to the outpatients  casualty
Yes
There's very limited facilities for children to play with.
"So, but I also approached Mrs Earl about a ."
"Anyway, she wanted me to go and see her."
"She said there was the scanner appeal, the  talk about all sorts of other things that were possible and there's an arts appeal and for arts facilities in hospital and all sorts of things."
"So I went back to Miss White and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be she thought that would be the best idea, not the ."
"I also told here it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital and the children from  invited to the hospital that day, that week sorry, it's gonna be a week in June so she wanted to know the details so I asked Mrs  t would she write to Miss White and give her all the details but she thought it would be far better if she went to see her and explain it all."
"She was going on Wednesday, I hope she went."
"Hold on, which one was going to see which one?"
Mrs  was going to see Miss White
yes
"yeah fine, okay great thanks."
Sarah.
I work  my main aim on this course is to gain confidence
right
I don't do many presentations mainly because I work in a small team
"right, right so it's about confidence Great thanks."
Bob
Senior  Midland area and I've been working on a job in  Coventry which is basically  work er what I hope to get mainly out of this course is an increased level of personal confidence so I can overcome basic nervousness when speaking.
"how to handle the nerves, I'll say right now and half of you may want to walk out of the room."
I don't have a magic wand I do not have a magic wand that you know take three deep breaths turn round twice and your nerves will disappear yep.
"So if that's what wanting   we've got problems straightaway erm but certainly we will discuss what to do about that yes and to recognise them and to understand why, yes, fine but I don't have a magic wand."
I'd I'd be a millionaire if I did wouldn't I?
Rob .
Senior Engineer for Midlands area I'm er presently on  seventeen million pound office development  the job's  completion  erm my presentations are basically from site labour to erm professional engineers and architects
yep
on a one to one basis or or to small meetings
Mm
What I hope to gain on the course is to be able to speak more confidently and to get over the nerves.
"right, great thanks."
Gordon
"Senior Engineer for Midlands region, currently been working on the  developments which is design built and  development gangs of which"
yep
erm I have er one to one dealing with subcontractors engineers the architects and site meetings not a great preparation but there is
more or less every day to day
right
erm I hope to get out of this more personal confidence and more  talk more clearly
So it's to be clear in what you're saying to be able to explain yourself clearly so it's about clarity
right
"The need to make it clear so that people understand without having to sort of keep coming back and asking again and again, yep, great, thanks."
John
I'm  I'm the senior  south west I currently work  schemes my main aim on the course is er to gain more confidence
Give over one of the rooms to  people .
When is it?
It's er the first weekend in March.
Anyway shall we
Okay shall we move on.
Do you want to tell us all about the stall for for the energy conservation bill?
Certainly.
Yeah the stall was extremely successful.
We kicked off at eleven and went on till three and there were I think six people stuffing er in the course of the day Bob Andy Mark and myself and Chris .
A late showing from the man himself.
And erm I was particularly pleased to get Chris along because he was extremely effective.
Erm what we were doing was filling in these these postcards asking MPs to turn up on February the fourth to support the energy conservation bill when it has its er second reading in Parliament.
"And erm it was ex ex it was great having Chris along because erm he went out and grabbed everybody in the street, pulled them in onto the stall and er and got them got them to sign on the dotted line so to speak."
Er he came along after the the Heworth Green er demonstration.
Which he described incidentally as a bit of a damp .
And they all they all ran away very soon after the press left.
So so he came along and did some work for us.
Apart from that erm the scores on the doors forty six postcards were sent out which doesn't sound perhaps like very many but is in fact quite a lot of work when you're having to find people who's who people's MPs are for them and so on.
And we were we covered sixteen different MPs which is especially good news because Hugh Bailey normally supports the bill and as far as we know is likely to turn up and and vote for it.
But getting out to MPs like erm John Prescott the energy spokesperson for the Labour Party and so on.
And John Gummer.
John Gummer right yeah.
Lots of people who are marginal erm we don't know erm ourselves if if they're intending.
So this might help tip the balance.
And because  in with it it's a national campaign.
It's er it's all all to the good.
And so it's keeping up the the good work that's of of lobbying MPs to such a degree that they they've got to back it which is what's brought it to its second reading as one of the most popular er private member's bills in history.
Erm we received eleven pounds eighty seven in donations.
Er the cost of stamps was eight pounds seventy four and therefore our profit
profit was  three pounds thirteen pence .
Not bad for somebody who thought it was going to  cost us money .
So people gave us money for the stamps that we put on and other people gave us donations.
Yeah.
then she said do you know these last six months we do nothing but argue  she said we've never argued so much!
Yeah.
And she said oh I think it's only the pressure.
Well that's right.
"I said well me and Geoff argue more, I said we never used to  cos we never argued a lot did we?"
No.
Well we have done  I felt sorry cos I hadn't really  when she phoned me up over there I was up  I thought oh my God!
"Yeah,"
"Cos I'm a bit worried we gotta get things sorted out  so I rang  I said I didn't to get onto you, she said no I know how they feel  she said  her granddad always do things like that."
What?
You know break appointments  I said well that only worries
it ain't quite the same is it?
well I said I suppose Geoff couldn't get away.
Well they just wouldn't let me
"I said that that worried m that really sort of worried me  so I rung her back anyway, she's alright."
"Well, you don't wanna worry about them because at the end of the day, I mean if  if that was absolutely desperate I shall turn round and say well I'm sorry I've bloody got to and that's it!"
"You know, but I mean"
But you must go Wednesday Geoff!
Yeah  No
And she been
"it was  they was that panicking cos tomorrow morning, the ministry are coming  and"
Yeah.
they was panicking.
"We all it is ba , well I say all it is  this bloody great strip right be between the ceiling and the walls, the right length of corridor and the manager see it and he said look  that should be shiny sort of like   and it's all pitted  so he said you'll have to go up here he said and do it all with steel abrasive  said fair enough."
"So of course I, took me about half hour to find the forklift cos somebody had nicked it  by time I went got the chemicals Robin comes down, he said oh don't worry about he said do i do it tomorrow morning he said, they'll be nobody about then  can you go down the bot bottom and do the butterflies?"
"I felt well  bloody marvellous, you now,i it was that imperative it had gotta be done, you can't have time o no I'm sorry you can't!"
So you could of gone to that appointment tonight?
"Well, well no, no because it was then about, that's what I'm is, then four o'clock you see, so I mean I knew I wouldn't make it anyway  that's why I thought I'd better ring  cos the job that we finished was half past three so I thought well even if I come home  I shall be late even if I don't get changed and washed or anything."
Yeah well you can't go there not washed and changed.
No that's what I thought I was
But you got an appointment fo you could of had one for tomorrow but I thought Wednesday is a better day I thought.
"Well it's not much, I mean"
You would like to see more  on the tables
Well we have had more fish out  yeah  we have had more fish out
in the show
Pardon?
Where did we come in the show ?
Ninth
Ninth
Ninth
that wasn't too bad.
I shall put in the report must do better!
do better!
we do want more fish out.
any comment about  the s the sort of format of the table show  do we want to change them at all
"How, how did it work out on the champion of champions night with having the  the table show, the full table show that we cancelled when Danny  came  er how did it work er did it work out comfortably?"
Oh yeah
"Er I felt, I've been after Danny for nearly twelve months to come see  and not been able to get him on the night I want him  the only night he was able, was available was  I think it was one night when we had something else on  I can't remember what it was."
"Erm  I think it was an inter-club actually, oh the inter-club table show  was the only night he could manage and that was no good to us  so erm  we, we  the only way we could do it was to t bring him the night that there was a full table show  transfer the full table show to the champion of champions  judge that first  and put the winning fish into the champion of champions and I know, well it's gonna be  woof  you know  a rush and that will, oh well, never mind."
Least we knew we'd get some extra fish didn't we?
yeah it's good that they had a fairer chance of getting on to the tables
twenty minutes
"So erm I'm  you kn I don't propose to do that again because I wouldn't er  I wouldn't arrange a speaker if we had a full table show but  it's nice to know that it did work out because we were, I was forced into a corner a little bit  erm and I think it was worth it because we  as I say I've waited a long time for Danny and he was well worth  listening to, I can listen to Danny for hours because he  he just speaks  and, and tells you about his fish, I'm, I'm very  very fond of listening to Danny cos I think he gives a good talk."
"he has  he  the same problems that we've all had  you know erm  and yes he's, he's, he's very easy to listen to  despite the fact that he's a southerner."
But we'll forgive him that
"He comes from near Windsor, doesn't he, cos he said he has a mate has a fish shop in Windsor"
That's right
often go to Windsor
That's right.
We was looking at a video
"erm it's an old one  and it's called Fancy Fish  and we were sorting our videos out to list 'em   and then we'll make a list  and then we'd let you have and then if you want a video and that, you know what you got  and we were looking through this Fancy Fish  and it's erm I don't know if you remember it, it shows an open show  at Oxford"
"Oh yeah, I think so."
Yes I remember.
He never put me on a heavy job until at such times he thinks I was fit .
Well that's the way I was treated when I came home.
By the the  I served five year then and I left that and I went into corporation transport which was tramcars then.
"And I went then from a, a timber mill and they  there's various different jobs I've been in since then, you know?"
What was the conditions like in the building trade after the war?
"Well er you know at that time there  in the building trade there was er what they term a, an essential work order."
"Which you had, the government, the government or building firms had to guarantee you forty four hours' payment f of wages, forty four hours guaranteed and you had to get that whether you were working or not."
So that was an essential work order was  by the government in power then.
"That m er the firms must guarantee forty four hours wages for the man, doesn't matter what"
"Was, was this erm  to protect the men or to make sure that erm"
It's er it's more or less a
retainer for the men.
Aha.
"A retainer so that they could have, that man couldn't go in another job"
.
Aye.
Presumably this was cos there was a big erm a big surge on to rebuild the
"Oh yes, yes there was"
country
"yes, yeah."
Mhm.
"The, the present, the present day er in Edinburgh, the present day buildings that I helped to build up are now in Pilton and in fact er out in Saint  I built, that was a er built a  fact I did all the rough ."
"Both in Pilton and in present day er Pilton Circus which is er er there's a lot of er controversy going over er m making them, privatizing them and so forth but I l I was er the building of these things and did all the er the  work for them."
"Is that erm quite a dangerous job working on the, on the building sites?"
"Well it depending what, what sort of job you're doing."
"All depending what sort of job your job, it could be dangerous if you didn't know what you were doing."
"I mean you couldn't put a stranger on  a job that you, you yourself ."
But once you were qualified for the job you couldn't put a stranger on you had to ta teach that stranger a job.
Before what he was to
"Erm where did you go after the, after the building, the building work?"
"After the building I left er the building work and became a tram conductor where I went through a course in the, down at Shrub Hall went through a conductor's course."
"After going through the conductor's course I then went to Leith depot, old Leith depot er of the, with the tramcars."
And just take note of that.
And that's what it looked like in nineteen seventy seven.
"Er one had the gateway, cobbled stone, approach to the railway station."
"Terrible shame in my opinion that that building was demolished, allowed to go to wrack and ruin, er and then then demolished."
"There you have the  er individual walkway th along there, and the entrance along here er up the yard."
The old  sort of double  erm er  goods shed.
"Er and er vehicles would go down, it drops down inside there, and there's planking er at obviously, level erm on either side er of this arch er this erm er wide way er through to the bottom."
And I'll show you a bit more in a little while.
"There is another picture, taken on a different day, showing, again in about nineteen seventy eight."
"Seventy seven seventy eight, the remains of quite a substantial goods shed, for a relatively small place."
"Now I daresay most of you know that, really the population of  or , was pretty static in the er well from eighteen fifty to about nineteen fifty, or even nineteen sixty."
Erm round about three and a quarter thousand.
Very little change.
"They had er seventeen or nineteen pubs, I can never quite remember."
Er for that population.
"Er and er of course a number were closed in the er early part of this century, and more er coming along."
"We've still got about ten or eleven I think, haven't we?"
"Erm really the railway was closed in nineteen fifty nine, for passenger traffic."
Just about the time that Dougie  started er building substantially in the town and doubled to population to its present six and a half thousand or so.
"Er whether or not it would have survived, I I wouldn't know."
"Anyhow that as I say, was the er goods shed."
Er that erm was in use er as I say until the closure.
"Now there's a picture of the station, and you can see that we've got the post, the cobbled entrance, on this on the left hand side was the station master's house, the garden."
You'll notice that the the erm fencing is vertical.
"Erm and that was normal practice until the early part of the century, about nineteen O seven I think it was that the  started using the er forty five degree angles, style."
"But er er vegetable garden, and the lot."
There's over here there's er a passenger station.
Four wheeled coaches er in here.
"Some goods er wagons on that side, erm lovely ladies in the long dresses and so on."
Er on this right hand side you've got erm various advertisements for er Belfast and Northern Ireland and er and sort of er away days and and so on.
Erm various signals.
"The main er sort of booking place, er waiting rooms and so on."
Mm.
W what about  Street school?
"Street School, I was th there on only there a year, and the headmaster came in one day, he was another Liberal politician."
"Headmasters were always members of the council, in those days, and they were always tended to be La Liberal or Labour, which I the present Labour would say was very pale pink."
"And the headmaster at er  Street school, Joseph , was a Labour member of council, and Joseph  was tended to be more Liberal."
"He came in one day and asked what M C C stood for, and I've always known a lot of useless information, so I could tell him, so I was then dispatched everyday to the erm radio shop in the High Street, to get the cricket scores in Australia."
"And then he asked me, he said, Well, have you read that notice on the board about er scholarships?"
"I said, Yes, but there's no hope."
"He says, Well, your aunt was a teacher,co you could go teaching."
You're na you're not going down the pit?
"I said No, no-one at home was, Everyone at home had said, You're not going down the pit."
"And he entered me for the scholarship,, and er, I won."
Mm.
"I incurred his displeasure on one occasion, there was a young lady sat on the form in front, we had those, where you sat in pairs, on the iron sort of things."
"She had plaits, and I tied them together, on to th behind the bar, and he he caned me.."
Mm.
"I suppose caning was a a more frequent form of discipline, in those days?"
"Caning was, er yes, erm."
"If you asked for trouble, you got it."
"Would you ev would you ever get any comeback from you your father, if you got told told off at school ?"
"If you got in trouble at school, you got in trouble at home."
No if and buts..
"About going t about getting the Henr scholarship to , had only just opened then ,"
That
hadn't it?
It hadn't er I went when it opened.
"We were er before then there was the , the school just over the wall to  Street, was the  Centre."
"It was a pupil, teacher centre."
"It started life as a technical school, which it was given by subscription, mainly the colliery company, for scientific education."
But used during the day by the Education Committee as a pupil-teacher centre.
"And up till then, you went to you got your scholarship, you went to the tu pupil- teacher training centre and then you became a teacher."
"Erm if you  passed  , erm you did a stint and then you came to  College, Nottingham for your teaching ticket."
And again.
Very steeply pitched roof.
"Now if you want to go and have a look at the other oth the oth other building, at er railway er the  Railway, erm going down  Road, er again a pointer to that one time this er town did have er a railway, er is of course the  Arms."
"I think that's they've altered that, they've put a porch over there haven't they, since er I took that one."
"Er but er that was very much the local, er in Victorian times."
Er for the er the station.
"There again erm I think there's still on the windows here, there's still reference to one of the coal merchants I think isn't there?"
Have a look anyhow.
"Erm looking across from the  Arms, one can see that, what I can only describe as a delightful bit of architecture, erm perhaps I'm a little bit er of a philistine, but er I think it's one of the nicest, most attractive buildings in the town."
Erm you know I like Georgian and I like a lot of other architecture but that I think has got tremendous character.
Er and of course was the old station master's er house.
"The erm well let's see, again the steeply pitched roof, the er the chimney's, er the barge-boards, the finials, er and the er angled fencing, which was characteristic of the  Railway er post about nineteen O seven."
"And also the  Railway used it and er it was used elsewhere, and it's interesting this, I noticed that erm B R have recently erected er er this type of fencing er which is adds insult to injury possibly, on the  at er ."
Er but i you know it's rather nice actually.
"Erm anyhow, that was the sort of site er a few years ago."
"See it's very very attractive, the erm stonework and so on and the slate roofs."
"And er er it didn't used to be erm white barge-boarding, er nor white erm fencing."
But nevertheless I think it looks very attractive in that way.
"Just note the er the entrance round there in the in the hedge, er from the new building nearby."
"There's another picture of it where  er  this was er  about five or six years ago this was taken, and you can see there, going along to the end of the er of this fencing, the post there which was one of the er of the posts er to which the gates, the crossing gates were attached."
There you have a brick wall.
"Now once upon a time, there was a railway."
"Looking back you can see the  riverside erm and basically just er here was the railway, and the entrance to the goods yard, er coal offices etcetera, or at least one of the entrances, was on that side."
"Coming back to look at this erm er, as I say, very attractive building, again, and you can see there's still a bit of  work there."
And er to go back and you can see it here.
"nice lamp and as I say, these er  the barge-boarding."
"Excellent erm brickwork as well, just just proud there."
"Now you can see here, again, we've still got er some gateposts."
"That actually is a a railway gate post unless they've changed it, which I don't think they have."
"On that one was taken a little bit earlier, you can see they certainly had one of the old er  gates there."
"And looking  up that er driveway er now they've got that house there,you can see er what the view is, say up that entrance."
"And there again, much the same."
"coast, which is er the Black Polish isn't it?"
yeah
"mm  there's a photograph that was in erm Karen's Radio Times, those two girls erm going on a diet."
Oh yes the
Erm
the very big lady
"er, yes, yes, forty minutes on er B B C, have her stomach stapled"
Gosh
Sounds drastic doesn't it?
does it literally staple the stomach on the outside or does it
"Well it, according to what I read before, they say they staple the stomach down to the size of er, of a tea spoon, so presumably she, her stomach must only receive, she must of been eating twenty four hours a day, you know, to keep they, she didn't lose any weight, the other girl did, but er"
But I still like
"either that or, or the capacity re for your stomach expanding is, is er incredible because er, she still, you know she still doesn't lose weight"
I still like to know how they staple it.
"Yeah  yes, I don't think you er you can measure I don't know, I mean if they staple it they close it off, er"
It must be an operation or
"Oh eh, just to staple have a another operation lost twelve stone, god it's like having, losing another person isn't it?"
"Oh I see so it is a case of open you up and putting, inserting these staples  must be"
"Mm she was, what, what are you doing?"
Stop it
sounds a bit drastic
"Said she, she's going in for her fourth operation  presumably to have this stapling done again, she says I believe that she'd be far more counsellor, I, I would of thought she, she would of had counselling anyway before they go to  stage of operating, surely, I mean, er don't they look in into sort of psychological aspects of it, it's usually a"
On the concept yep
"more than just physical reason I, I mean a lot of people are grossly overweight they, you know, people usually say oh it's the"
but now apparently in most cases it's very rare with that so it's gotta be too much eating and why do people over eat
That's right it's usually too much eating or lack of exercise
"you know, I mean, there must be compensation for something mustn't there?"
Yes it's er
"I must record that Wildlife on One on er, tomorrow night, so I'm in Wales"
Oh yes
Have you read any of your letters about the poems in last week's Observer?
No
"Yes, but they never do!"
"You might say that about the human animal really, mightn't you?"
Yes
Thank you all very much for a civilized and interesting discussion.
Thank you for joining us.
Goodbye.
"What time do you get there   what, what time did you get there?"
.
.
"No,."
You said this morning  didn't ya?
"Travelling, between Woking and Guildford, or whatever."
"Er, and that, you, you'll  at the town cooking dinner, watching television, talking to my friend, or just roughly what you're doing at that time that conversation took place, okay,at work,form, then make me a cup of tea, she was photo-copying,"
Mm.
"that's what she was, she was doing  ."
There's an awful lot involved though.
", you're usually saying oh it's just, just general ."
Mm.
"Went shopping or whatever, as I say, it, it, it, a couple of days or whatever you feel, if you, if you, if you want to get into it you might find you want to do them all"
Mm.
"but if you, in two days, that"
yeah
"would be grate, okay, and the same thing for next page, this is the day I started which, like maybe tomorrow or next day or when ever you start it Wednesday, I started at ten o'clock in the morning, was I, I was in Woking, what was I doing  nothing just reading a, do whatever you have to put in your whatever you  ,"
yeah
"where you went for a walk, down, went to the shops"
mm.
"or whatever, just let them know roughly what you're doing, cos, all they get is a tape, it gives them an idea of what sort of things were happening at that time, any words they can't pick up  if she's cooking, maybe that's something she was making or whatever, erm, in the  please write the first names and details, why you know them, of all the people speaking on this side of the tape, in order in which they speak on the tape in the first, first instance, right, you know, so now Carla, my husband, myself, Lee and, you don't need to repeat them again after that"
Mm.
"so if you don't, don't want, not worried too much about this, I mean, although we want you to do this, I mean, rather just get the conversation, in, even though you don't do this ."
You want more than that .
The knob on the cooker's been turned.
Is it just been recently that you've started to get involved ?
"Within the last ten years, I've been ten years activ actively concerned with the old aged pensioners' association and er the Labour movement."
Mhm.
D do y do you think there's a great difference between the Labour Party now and the Labour Party when you were working ?
"Ah well, more or less the same."
"They're more or less as a, I don't think there's a great lot of difference onl I d I, they're not pushing, they haven't the same, the, I would like to say, I would say they haven't the same interest in their union, they've not the same interests in the union as they had in the earlier days when there was a union."
Mm.
"Did your involvement in the trade unions when you were young got  lead to your, any involvement in the Labour Party or anything like that?"
"Oh no, not necessarily through the union, no no."
I've just had so solely an interest to defend myself.
Ah but I believed if I'm going to discuss or argue about anything as regarding that I had to be interested in it.
And to be interested you've got to attend your branch meetings and know what's going on.
Whether it be a union branch meeting or any other branch meeting you had to be there and you had to know what you're talking about.
Don't just go into these meetings and sat there  like a dumbbell.
"You liked it, if you've been active at all you'd want to know what's going on."
And the only way you can do that is b attending your branch meetings.
"I mean there's no, no use a man being employed and he's got a shop steward  if he don't  and depend on the shop steward coming down to tell him what happens in the meeting."
"My reply to these people, if they asked me what happened at the branch meeting I say, do you want to know what happened in the branch meeting?"
"Yes, I said well attend them."
So that was er that was my answer
"When you were er in the unions and you were a shop steward, did you find that you got a lot of people working in branch meetings?"
"Well it wasn't too bad, it were not too bad from the, the firm that I oper I worked from."
The firm that I worked from weren't too bad.
"But as I say as paying the er r I, I've seen them when I'm going round the site er I got an option from the firm, I'd be allowed time off my work, my actual work on the, on the, on the site, to go round and collect their unions dues."
I'd got an option from the firm and they were very good that way.
"And I've seen them, whenever they see me come along, going away and trying to hide."
But I say there's been a
You mentioned the erm the National Association of
Scottish Old Age Pensioners' Associations
Scottish Old Age Pensioners' Association.
"What do they erm, that, what does that association do?"
Oh well wait a  I'm just going to read  first to you.
"Oh, very happy memories really, we erm we had two or three masters from , erm one was the Sunday School superintendent, again this chapel and the son-in-law of the headmaster of  Street, George Edward ,, as he's known to thousands."
"He must be rolling round, cos he was the maths master, he must be rolling round in his grave, as people say percentage, because he if you said percentage he yelled at you, Percentage of what?"
". Erm but you'd failed him, if you didn't get a distinction in School Certificate maths, or arithmetic."
So h how old were you when you left school?
Sixteen.
"Which was, I mean, very late for those  ?"
No.
No.
"We left er the secondary school, or as they were then, the grammar schools, at sixteen."
You left the other one at fourteen.
"I could have stayed at  Street  till I was fourteen , I could have stayed at  Street until I was fourteen, and then you would've been out."
"And er but at er there you'd got to go for the other two years, and some parents were rather wondering whether that left you late in the queue for a job, because jobs were very difficult."
"Or whether you were going to earn enough, later on."
Mm.
How did you go about finding a job?
"Wrote hundreds of letter,er to the people you wanted to do, because I'd never expected having to find a job, I must admit, because the year before I took School Certificate I had got a Naval a artificer apprenticeship, but then I got kicked in the eye playing rugby, and failed a medical."
"Something I'd never to do, so I had to settle down and get School Certificate, which I got with my matric exemption, and people from  did."
"It er you were taught, and er I ju I'd say it was as liberal a education as you get now, but you'd got to get your maths, you'd got to English, you'd got to get a language, you'd got to get a science, and"
Mm.
it was broadly based.
And so what was the job  found ?
"And eventually I found a job er as assistant to the er clerking to the  rating officer, who had also been a member of t , who was a member of the chapel, and er knew I was looking for a job and er, I hadn't written to him cos I didn't know this one was coming up."
"And so he told you about it, rather than?"
"Yes, he told me, he said Ah well, have you got a job yet?"
"I said No, not yet, erm I'm awaiting replies from so many."
"So I accepted a job with him, and then I got two offers the next day, one with the savings bank, I think it was, and one with someone else.."
And what what payment did you get?
Ten shilling a week.
Would it have been better had you gone to the other jobs?
Or would it have been about the same?
"I don't know erm, probably about the same, then."
It was about it was the same as I'd probably got if I'd have gone to the pit at fourteen..
I .
"Well John and I are both Chair Person, are Co-Chair at the moment, erm"
"Yeah, we don't, we don't seem to have a Vice Chairman, looking at last years"
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps it was because of that we didn't have it, and the treasurer and the secretary are officially erm, and we do have constitution don't we now of course, so we can look at the constitution and see what it says"
.
"erm, I think what those post were, were erm elected and then the"
Means we've got to produce  .
.
"Right, we, we, we did actually draw, or we not draw, we, we adopted a constitution during the year and the officers that are erm elected are the Chair, the Secretary and the Treasurer, erm and other, together with other such officers, yeah to  to determine by general meeting, erm, so it's really only those three, er and we have sometimes had Advice Chair if there's only been one Chairman haven't we, one Chair person erm  so I think people need to say if they don't wish to carry on the jobs they're doing and if anybody wishes to nominate anyone in a particular post then slip at the bottom of the minutes could be filled in and either brought to meeting or sent back to the Secretary."
"Erm, I think I will give up being Chair this time, I've done it too long, too long, and I've had it John as Co-Chair during the year and I hope that he'll be able to carry on as, as Chair Person, I think really I've done it, done it for long enough erm, and we'll have to ask, we hope, we hope the Treasurer just taken over will carry on"
.
"erm, and if anybody else has any other post they, they're interesting in doing in taking on or, or would like to help with that could be said as well couldn't it?"
Well are we then not going to have another Co-Chair?
"Well it depends how you want to deal with it, I mean erm, this, the, the, the I think it was just my idea last year of, of sort of erm sharing some of the load I think at that point and hoping that someone could perhaps take over, erm, this just says the following should be elected, A, Chair, B, Secretary and C, Treasurer, but erm"
"Well, I, will, you know, I mean, will carry on as Chairman, but I, I'd welcome  competition in the post if anyone's interested"
.
"but, it's unfair saying that I erm, I,continue in my inefficient way if you're all willing to put up with me."
"I think if, if you are going to be the only Chair Person then there should be a, there, there should be a, a Deputy so if you're not able to take the chair, there is somebody else ."
"Perhaps, yeah, yeah, yeah , erm"
Somebody could perhaps sat and
Perhaps that's that's a good idea .
"that, that person ought to be elected as well."
"Mm, what under, that'll be a what Vice Chairman or"
"Well was to be Chairman, was to be  Vice Chair now under these this new ."
Is it in the constitution?
"It isn't in the constitution, no."
No it isn't is it?
.
"No, but you"
.
Mm.
"Not, not very good at drawing up constitutions are we?"
No  no point in me  well anyway when she
She'll know.
"Mm  so he said erm, that's the situation he said but you can forget your business he said, as far as I'm concerned he said, you've lost for two years so he said consequently he said you're gonna lose this year are you?"
I said well I wouldn't be surprised.
So he said well all I can say is he said you wanna just forget that  erm
And just do it on the money you owe on the house.
Yeah exactly  don't get involved at all.
So he said well  how do you feel about your business?
"So I said well  you know, I can't just wind it up over the next  six months, I said er  what I wanna do I said is erm  I gotta carry it on for that  transit  for that  Orion till I finished anyway  so it's gotta go another year  so I said well what I'm feeling about doing I said is er  just sort of keeping a finger in the pie  I said, he said, if I'd said tomorrow, if I had finished the whole the tomorrow  I've gotta buy a car  I can buy it finance so I'm gonna get no tax relief on the H P  I get no depreciation  no nothing like that I said so at least if I still self employed  I can  if I have the sort of two or three vehicles or whatever  three, four, five vehicles but I said at least I can have some   erm  and I can then sort of they would be more  utilised, where as I said at the moment  we got more vehicles than we really need to keep full capacity  so he said yeah, yeah fair enough then."
"I said well that's what is, I said if you look at it the depreciation is so heavy  compared with the income, and I said and the insurance as well but I said hopefully cos we haven't had any  of er  any claims at all this year  you know, I said I know but all of the insurances of gone up, but I said  I'm hoping that we can sort of get the insurance down if possible  so he said, yeah fair enough then."
"He said well from my point of view anyway at least he said just disregard that  completely he said and we will do it on what you earnt, so he said all I can is  erm  just put in as many hours as you can to get your wages up on that side  erm  and then by the time we look at that he said, the end of February obviously you'll have December, January and February which will be good months  there, I said yeah  so he said well then you know  erm  a hundred pound here and a hundred pound here he said, it all helps to keep the figure up for you  so he s"
Yeah but that don't help us with Malcolm does it?
"No, but I mean all I can say is basically erm"
"Give him as much as yo , we can, when we can."
Yeah.
And can you do
"And he said he's quite prepared to do it, he said, there wouldn't be no problem  but he said I cannot do it, he said they are"
"What, is he gonna lend, what's he gonna lend you then?"
"About thirty three thousand  but you see what he said is, head office make the rule and he said and  they're not"
No there's no problem  that we can
No.
have it?
"That's right, he said what"
But you can't have it till February.
Yeah because he said as soon as they  see arrears he said they insist that it's paid up  and they insist that you have like  three months  pay them  no problem  he said
Yeah.
and then there's no problem.
"I said no, but he's"
Well we can manage that probably
Yeah.
couldn't we?
"but he's, he give me a a print out, he said well here's your print out look  so he said as soon as"
.
"Er this is erm, er this is the Spring, can't read out what it is, the Spring, this is the great Spring raffle, Amnesty does get quite a lot of money from the raffles, er they start off with just the Christmas one now we have them all through the year I think,"
.
"and they, the first prize is a thousand pounds cash, second prize family holiday cottage in the Isle of Mule and third prize holiday cottage in Norfolk and fourth prize holiday apartment in Cumbria and the, I mean the idea is you take a book and try, if you have a place of work or, or friends that will buy raffle tickets er just try and sell them and er, how much are they? er"
Fifty pence each.
"fifty pence each, right, erm, and er fill in the slips and either bring them back to us or send them off yourself to Headquarters, shall I put, I'll put those out for anybody who feel they could sell them, it all, it all helps to raise money for Amnesty and helps to get them  erm spend the money on the new prisoner's."
"Yeah, I have a complimentary copy of new internationalist  I'm not quite sure why they sent them, but"
"It's on, it's on the  right ."
"Yes , it's, it's got stuff that we could use that's all."
Mm.
"Er, the news letters we get, monthly news letter for groups, er, this one, which is all about what different groups in Britain are doing, can give you ideas ."
"Were not gonna have , were not gonna have quite enough are we this time, I think if perhaps the people who come regularly, erm perhaps could take first, erm I don't know, you, we have ten, is it ten?"
"Yeah, and I've taken one."
Mm.
.
"They are interesting, I mean then, they're, they're, got quite a lot of information on about what's going on"
Yeah
within British Section
Yeah.
anyway.
"I'll erm, the International news letter which has lots of groups and details about people getting killed."
Mm.
What's going on .
"Erm, and then if anyone wants to look at these, look at the er ninety one annual reports"
Haven't seen them.
and these booklets that are .
"Has that recently become ninety one, one?"
"No, we had these two meetings ago, but I bring it with me on meetings for anyone who's  ."
"Yes, and people should tell you if they take it,mm, mm."
"Okay, that's all."
"Right, very good, that's all from Headquarters, right then we move on to then any other business, erm I think mainly it's just the odd verse with arrangements for next meeting, because our next meeting is our own A G M, erm, at, which we erm elect our officers for the next year, er, and there are, are other arrangements to make, erm we sometimes put a little form don't we on the end of the minutes that, people to fill in if they wish to nominate someone, I think we should do that even though very, very rarely gets actually filled in, erm, and we have some post which we have elections for others where we can phone the people who are doing those jobs and, and hope they'll carry on."
"And I think the, the erm, the jobs which are elected are the Chair Person and, do we still have a Vice Chair Person? are you still Vice Chair Person?"
"Er, I have an example of"
Right.
"Could be, certainly quite old, erm, and a socialist, of course."
Yeah.
You ought to point out.
Right.
Not completely true.
"Ah, let me just say what  leaders of peacetime  Margaret  was after   early life was that  a cold mother who was erm, full of  personality  People of London  biography of the leader of the Conservative, because at least half the book is about"
That's where it belongs.
Erm.
"at least not fully in command of ourselves, let alone the social and political world around us."
"It's certainly wrong though,I think erm, there was erm, the question"
Mm.
"Er, but I do believe that  made very important  the reason, er, the first question is  and people weren't  reading about that."
"Erm,"
Well
"Well done, that was absolutely first rate, I mean erm, it was a difficult er, task you had, especially as the book wasn't in the library, of which I am deeply apologetic, because I thought it was, and er, I thought you er, you coped with a very difficult assignment extremely well, and I think you can have an extra  and I'm sure everyone else thinks so too."
"Er, as I have said, I haven't done Woodrow Wilson before in the past, so, so it was an experiment, and erm, I must admit,yo you rose to the occasion excellently."
"The choice of literature, as you realize was meant to be contrasting, and I put  book down as an example of what I thought was the worst possible, er, use of  use of psychoanalysis, kind of gutter journalism, erm and  which you didn't look at, and it's, it's no criticism of you erm, because er, you had your work cut out with what you did do, but the reason I put down Gandhi's Truth, if anybody's ever read that, have they?"
"This is the exact opposite from , because it's erm, it idealizes Gandhi."
"It kind of builds Gandhi up into a great er figure, as it were, ignoring his feet of clay, erm, which he definitely had."
"So erm,book on  which is kind of a character association by a pop cycle analysis and Gan erm, book on Gandhi, which is  using cycle analysis, of, of, of, of tremendous contrast."
"And er, er, the question is of course, where does Freud's book on Woodrow Wilson belong?"
"Does it belong in the kind of  erm, camp or not?"
"Well, erm, what do other people think?"
"But isn't, isn't that the quote at the beginning of your book, er, unsigned quote, erm, doesn't that say something about how, how, you know, long aired radio biography of someone is very political or  sort of er, disregard all of the important things they really done, and I don't know, I don't know if it's er, pertinent erm, but obviously, in Freud, Freud wanted to set out to criticize Wilson erm, so he, you know, he went in with it."
"I mean, he was"
Yes.
obviously going to buck out of the
He was.
biographical allegiance which made him look bad.
Yes.
Perhaps if I move on I think we've perhaps got one a little bit bigger.
Oh no.
Erm I'll go back a minute.
"Er there's another little stubby bit of track there, and that er provided er what was termed end loading facilities, er so that erm Er in the old days er the sort of lord of the manor er would have a er horse a horses and carriage."
"Erm and er they had what they call carriage trucks, which were er flat trucks basically, or thereabouts."
"Which could be attached to passenger trains, and the er the actual er gentleman's carriage, er horse-drawn carriage, could be loaded onto this flat truck, and er the er would be transported to be available er at his destin in his or her destination."
"Erm and er it was er it was a ramp basically, er up here, so that one could run straight off that ramp, onto this flat truck."
And that's a that's one of the what that was used for.
"Erm as you I say, initially er it was a single track into the station, over  crossing."
"And erm in between the wars, erm it was made double track, er up towards  over there."
"By just merely putting in an additional point, or turnout, here, er to er to make that say double track."
That's er well that's all there.
That's a er  map I acquired off the Water Board
I think from somewhere.
. Erm the slightly larger erm Engine shed here as I say.
"Erm cattle pens, goods shed, The main station building here, the erm station master's house here."
"A signal box, the platforms on both sides, the smaller building on the North side of the station."
"Erm a weighed a weighing machine, a weighing office over here, and coal offices were situated there."
"Erm I will give a little bit of history of dates, and what things were altered and when in a bit."
"Erm the the railway track, erm once it was extended through to  and I say I'll give you the details on that in a minute, erm went over the er  Road, and then the track that was nearest to er the town, was curved in and joined that other line erm and er went off to to ."
"And there's a book on  engine sheds, and er  engine sheds, which was published some years ago I think by  publishing company, er which gives track plans to help people."
"But  looked at a er at any ordinance survey map, they'd have seen that they got the track plan wrong."
Erm that is that is what it should be.
"Erm some additional sidings,mills over here, some additional sidings were put in, in the early part of this century, and they came off the this track erm just this side of on the left hand side of the level crossing, erm and went er up to a dead end er just along in the right hand side, er over now towards where  factory is."
Erm or bakery.
"And then er they returned the line, or double track round here, er and bringing so goods wagons could be brought round into the sort of unloading area er of  's mill."
Of course 's was a very important customer of the of the railway.
Now let's give a little bit of er of information.
The er there were many railways erm were contemplated in the eighteen thirties and forties and beyond.
"And erm the er there was a Nottingham, Lincoln and Hull line I think, proposed in eighteen thirty."
"Erm  but this line involving ,, er was actually er part of a much bigger scheme that was put forward about eighteen forty, and really involved er a line from near  Cross to , on to , on to , and then up to  and connecting ."
"Basically sort of cutting across country, about twenty eight miles I think it was."
Yeah.
get the
Yeah.
things reprographicated and
Yeah.
and er
it usually takes about three working days and er
Okay.
and away you go.
How  subjects are you ?
"Erm  with a thing like this, I mean what I usually say to people it depends on erm if you've got a lot of numerical data, oh you might as well have this back for the time being so"
sweaty hands soaking into it or anything
"erm er then it does help, if you're looking for P less than point O five, and aren't we all these days, erm"
"you know  er it helps if erm it helps if the groups that you're comparing between there's about sort of at least twenty people in each sort of thing, erm  and the same goes for things like, things that you might want to do  squares on or something like that erm so I mean if you were interested in comparing people who attended very regularly with people who only attended once in a while erm you know it would help if there were about sort of  more than forty people altogether so that there was sort of, you know"
Mm.
"you could median split them at  whatever the medium was and then you've got two groups to compare erm because it usually looks quite nice if you've got something comparative as well as looking at the average sort of, you know, pattern of responses on the questionnaire."
Equally if you've got erm  I don't know what other kinds of differences you might want to erm  er  look for but again if you're looking for differences it helps if there's about sort of twenty people in each of the groups sort of thing.
"Or if you're comparing people with themselves as it were, that is looking for differences between how they answer one question and how they answer another question, then sort of , you know, kind of twenty or more people and you've got a reasonable chance of showing up some, some P less than point O fives."
"Erm  I don't know that's, this is not in any official stats books but it's just my experience with students' projects that if you get more than, there's a sort of critical mass of about, about forty respondents and then you're much more likely to start showing some interesting statistically significant findings for some reason, erm I don't quite know why but er   it's one of life's little mysteries but er so that's  usually if there's a lot of numerical data what I'd try and advise people to er to get."
Oh that's
"So you know I mean more than that by all means, you know, er so much the better, you know y the more the merrier but erm certainly you know kind of it's a good idea to at least try and get that many erm"
Yeah.
so er
"I've got, I've got in touch with a football supporters society"
Mm.
and erm they've got eighty members so
Oh right.
Mhm.
"so they're like sending me a list, well they sent me back a  half list"
Mm.
I said to them can I have a list they said oh yeah sure she went we'll put it in your
Mm.
"so I'm saying ah that's that and that, that, so I basically have  we were looking at erm, what's it?"
"Partnerships, did you know that if I start a partnership with Phil right, mum"
Mm
I will be completely liable for erm   liability
Yes
"but that's, wouldn't affect me because I'll be taking loans out  so there and I can have up to twenty er partners, nineteen in fact, because there's twenty partners altogether, basically, so there is definitely benefits for being in partnership"
"as if er, there's not, if you've got twenty partners or there's twenty of you altogether you're splitting profit twenty ways"
"I'm not having twenty partners, I'm having Phil and that's it"
"What, we'll sort it out later"
Erm
when you've got the capital right?
"Erm, but sole, we're looking at sole proprietor as well, there's some good things in that, I E they're cheap to set up, stuff like that, so they're not bad as they go, but, I suppose well I'll have to sell when I've got more money, I didn't get any replies today  not a single blooming one, I'm a bit cheesed off, so erm, I think I might ring back that one of the ones that I did get a reply from and say thank you."
I would leave it for a while Richard
Well dad said I should say something
I would just leave it for a while
"But er, it's all I've had for now I suppose,oh God  I've got maths tomorrow, hate maths"
No you don't
I do
"Well that is, that is a really stupid attitude to go into isn't it?"
Oh I hate it
No you
be one G C S E I'll fail
"Don't be so silly, if he drops that glass I'm gonna kill him"
Dog went mad when I
Eh?
Sorry?
Dog went mad
"Mm, mm"
"dumping himself and running around and banging into doors and things, stupid mutt, so er, erm give him his Bonio, he gets, he now barks at me when I sit down, till I get up and give him his Bon Bonio mum"
"Mm, mm"
"well he is so cheeky, and you can tell when he's hungry cos he goes back for and stand by it again, sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't"
Well more fool you for letting him
"She accepts that she then  was confused, she didn't know what to do  erm  she didn't think there was any point in getting out of the car which is what sh she should of done, she should of  tried to make some enquiries about the child  er, but she  er, she looked around shrugged her shoulders and  and then carried on her journey because she didn't think there was anything else  she could do about it."
"And then again, ignorance  er, at what she should subsequently have done  er, then took over because she didn't realise that by having had  er  made contact with an individual  erm  it was necessary for her to report the matter to the police and she just  didn't realise that that was something  that she should have done."
"Your worships, er, there's nothing at all more sinister in the failure to stop and failure to report than  than that,i th that is a a  true record of the er  er er of the  incident as far as Mrs  was concerned  erm  and it is something which  erm  comes about  an accident which came about  probably through the inexperience of the children  er, running across the pedestrian crossing thinking that they have priority  erm  and not having regard to other road users  er, and Mrs   was travelling at slow speed but it was  she was put in a difficult position by the  the way in which the children ran across the road."
"Erm  your worships as far as the personal circumstances are concerned  she is fifty nine years old, she hasn't worked for the last three years she's in receipt of invalidity benefit  similarly her husband who hasn't worked for the last ten or eleven years  er, is on invalidity benefit."
"Erm  she  would ask that and fine that impose today  er, could be paid by her  at the rate of five pounds  per week  erm, she  er  runs a car  her  invalidity income  amounts to forty six pounds fifteen pence per week  and she also receives  a super annuation payment from her former employers Goldeson's Hospital at the rate of a hundred and three pounds per month  but she and her husband  do have to er  to run the home and er, and run the house  er, run run the car  and she would ask that  she'll be allowed to pay at the rate of five pound per week."
Yep..
sit down and watch Mrs .
Oh thank you.
Sit down there.
Well Mrs  you're pleading guilty for these offenses  and we've listened to what Mr  has said on your behalf  and we're going to be as lenient as we can in the circumstances.
"For the offence of failing to stop you'll be fined fifty pounds, you're licence will be endorsed with five penalty points."
For failing to report you'll be fined twenty pounds and your licence will be endorsed  and for failing afford precedence on  the pedestrian on a zebra crossing you'll be fined ten pounds.
You will also be required to pay  ten pounds costs.
That's ninety pounds  and we will  order it be paid at a rate of five pounds a week.
"So Mrs  the court will endorse your licence that means that the fact that you have these offenses er  against your record now  will be entered onto on your driving licence by the court, the court will then send your driving licence to the driving licence centre at Swansea  so that they can er  also record on your driving record."
You'll get your licence back in about three weeks time from the driving licence centre.
You must start paying five pounds a week  by next Tuesday  the court usher will give you the address  of the court  but you must make you send that money every week.
Yes.
Alright?
Right.
You can go now Mrs .
Thank you.
Take care of it.
Mrs ?
Mr  sir.
Is that all?
Yes.
Oh fine.
"Would you deal with an additional matter please your worships  er, not on your list he's only been brought in  almost at the start of the court of this morning."
Carl Robert .
Is he outside or is in he cells?
He's in the cell sir.
".. And er this was one of things that my old boss, when people came into name their children, he said Now remember, these initials will go on case, perhaps, one day, and you don't want S A P, or something like that."
"And if they came in a with name that was unusual, er Now, are you sure?"
Do you want a moment  to think about it ?
"You know, when somebody came up with Mehetabelle, or something like that."
"Er but no, er Robin  and the local dramatic club was er very, very good, you're in the market for money, putting on things in the chapel, or in the Co-op hall, at ."
"Hit-the  was usually done in the Co-op hall, and er they were good."
Mm.
"I mean, people didn't pay money just  out of,you know, loyalty, completely."
What about the Spanish Civil War?
Do you remember?
"Well, at that time my best pal went to the pit, his mother wouldn't let him enter in th for scholarship, but he did happen to come here for, Well, he seemed to always get a day's day release from the year dot, I think, and er eventually he got some A levels."
"He got his trade unions things, and his deputy's certificate, and that."
"But then, he got some A levels and he's finally got an Open University degree, good luck to him."
"And er we used to go occasionally to W E A meetings, in the library at , and er I wasn't a member of his class, but I did once go and hear Hugh , when he was at Nottingham."
"And er then er we had er a tutor who was very, very keen and we nearly all went to er the Spanish Civil War, and we took er the er paper for ages, erm and er But one of the group did go, Frank  from , went, but the  were always Communist, they never claimed to be Labour."
"But er they were always er well-remembered, and er w Spanish Civil War through, I suppose nowadays, you call them fringe newspapers, but there was this paper we used to get at the tim at the time It wasn't the er Morning Star, or even it's predecessor, erm but you got a paper and you sort of heard the other side."
"Erm er, very concerned as to what it was going to lead up to up, and hoping, you know, against hope that's you weren't going to be involved in anything like that."
Mm.
And my Grandmother certainly wouldn't have wanted me going She had er her feet very firmly on the ground.
"I hadn't realized till long, long afterwards, until she after she was dead, that er she and her brother came to work, when the Midland Railway came to Nottingham, they left Norfolk, and he's got a horse, as a carter, and they walked from Holt, in Norfolk, to Nottingham, in search of a job."
"And they went to live at , and"
Wh what about the Sec Second World War?
The Second World War?
"Well, originally er I was involved in er registration, because there, with this very loose connection with the registrar, by now I was full time with the council, as rating assistant and rent collector."
"And er I got involved on national registration and er, on one occasion, we were working, we'd got a deadline and we were working through the weekend, and my wife came to pick me up at what she thought was a reasonable time, at one o'clock on Saturday, found she was given a cup of tea and set to work, and we finished, going home about midnight.."
So would you would you work overtime a lot ?
"Oh yes, you worked overtime, for which there was no pay, I mean, it didn't count er You see things , you know, there was less structure about it, then, erm and you could have ti if you wanted time off for something, you'd probably have got it fairly easily, but er it didn't seem to be the great arguments that you've had since."
"And of course, er by nineteen forty erm well, Christmas thirty nine, I'd got my calling up papers."
Were you on th ?
"You were on the point of getting married, by that time,?"
No.
"I We'd talked about it and said Well, we're not going to get married whilst war's on, as er probably the generation before, had said in nineteen fourteen, and er we got married eventually on the first of December, nineteen forty."
"Erm   right the open show  fifty nine ninety five for the hire of the hall, much the same as last year, it's keeping pretty well down  er, it's, we paid fifty three eighty last year, but I think because  little bit for a longer time this year."
"Erm  the judges, seventy five  er  and that's ten pound less than last year, maybe because we're struggling to get judges  forty two pound for the trophies  erm    er, fifteen pound for the fish tank  and plates at seventy five forty seven, crisps, eight seventy eight, which we struggled to sell  we think you could sell crisps but we had a struggle."
"Postage, stationery, fourteen O six  raffle tickets, eleven pound, making a total of two thirty twenty six  as against on the other side the income, three ninety six  so we made a hundred and sixty six pound on  on the open show  which is a great  increase on last year because last year we only made  twelve pounds something  twelve pound and a penny we made last year, so this is a great increase."
"the coach to   the breeders' evening  that's what I mentioned before, we paid for the refreshments and the rent  show secretary has only claimed two pounds which is a scandal really  she's probably paid twenty out, twenty pounds"
Yeah  I think so cos she's sitting here smiling.
So Joe doesn't get so many mushy peas.
"Er  champion of champions  we've, I bought some prizes for the champion of champions, and food  er  just to go with the trophies  er Keith  again was our judge and erm  knowing that he doesn't  willingly accept money, he wants to come and do it for nothing  erm  how many proposed that we  buy him something  a bottle to take with him, so we bought him a bottle of wine to take with him and er  that was the three pound."
So that gives us a total  expenditure of seven eighty seven sixty two for the year  and that leaves us with a balance  er of the year and that's nine ninety eight ninety nine pence.
"So we're exceedingly well off really  for the size of the club  and my trip to  Amazon, up the Amazon collecting fish gets nearer and nearer"
Gets nearer every day  You wouldn't get
Erm
"very far on a thousand pound though, would you?"
"Well as I say  I mean we're doing very well  and all the money  and, and you know, ninety percent of the money comes out of the  the er  the members' pockets really  I mean ev even the sub for the open show, we put out a lot of that  even  the stuff  and things like this, so we do provide an awful lot of money."
"Er  we haven't used very much of it this year  I mean I think er  I mentioned a few weeks ago the, the  question of trips out  perhaps in the spring to do fish  and that, we could consider  er  we don't want to just go er  accumulating money for the sake of it  erm, we want to get some benefit out of the money we've got."
"Erm  we may of course go to  Bowness next year  if the circumstances change and we can manage it  that will course cost a fair amount of money  but that remains to be seen, we'll have to wait and see how the club progresses during the year  whether we think we can do it ."
"Right, any questions?"
No?
We don't  them.
We don't  with thousand pound in his back pocket  can't be bad.
"It's coming to the stage soon when we'll have to put it in a building society, get some interest on it."
"I mean  sh shame in the banks  I mean we don't get charges any charges from this bank, I mean if, if you er  put it in some banks you get interest  charge you on your cheques and all sorts of things, it, it's as broad as it's long usually  but er  I mean we are gonna accumulate money, I don't think we should accumulate very much more now, we, we've ample funds for everything we need  er  but it's a question"
"But it's just lying in the bank dormant and it's not making any interest  I know it's not being, I know we're not being charged but"
Trouble is
"building society, I don't know  they do it."
"Maybe you could  the only way we could do it is  er a joint account  and that would be have to be based on trust  you know, a mutual trust between er y your two main people  er y you would just have to trust them  erm  nobody, how do members feel about if you"
That's true.
"Well it's a  and stuff like that, I mean"
But I mean I
the reason I propose  giving   he has to do is come
It's embarrassing.
"and sometimes he, he, he feels it be putting on those"
Yes  yes  and he's such a nice man and he does it so willingly if he can.
"We're very obsessed with things called viewing figures in television and I worked out quite simply that if everybody among the eleven million people who are supposed to view Keeping Up Appearances every Sunday, popped a penny into a money box for Save The Children Fund one Sunday night, that would raise a hundred and ten thousand pounds within an hour, now why don't we get going and encourage people to do that."
Multiply that by seven  and it's seven hundred and seventy thousand pounds.
"What we are able to do in my job is to do what I was happy to do which is to give a performance in aid of a charity, one soon learns how to expend one's energy and in which direction to focus it."
"Earlier this year, on April the twenty second,her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, entertained various representatives from the world of entertainment and sport and journalism at Buckingham Palace."
"We had the most wonderful evening, it began with a film show, an extremely well er composed film to do with the work that is being done, the variety of work that is being done in the variety of places."
Various reports  a plea for support  a plea for interest particularly for the seventy fifth anniversary year next year and after that we had the most lovely party.
I have a list here of people in my particular part of the profession who have pledged themselves to assist with the great drive forward for the seventy fifth anniversary.
A number of celebrities were appearing in the Cadbury's sponsored pantomimes around the country and supporting the Save The Children fund raising activities.
"These include Lesley Joseph, Jeff Capes, Bobby Davro, Windsor Davies, John Nettles and Gloria Hunniford and Ian Botham."
"Pam Ferris from the Darling Buds of May is actively supporting the fund and will help with publiscation and er fund raising, publicising and fund raising in the birthday year."
"Sandi Toksvig, the comedy actress, has been advising on the seventy fifth birthday plans with television, book and consumer magazine support, she'll be visiting Zimbabwe in October with a B B C television crew to film a documentary and will be visiting and filming Save The Children Fund projects while she's there."
"Lulu  Ulrika Johnson, Tessa Sanderson, Debby McGee and Linda Bellingham all lent their support to this year's Cadbury's strollathon and we look forward to their continued support in our birthday year."
"Next year I am going to be very active in the theatre and I've already this morning, sown the seed er for possibly er giving a particular performance er of one of the plays in this particular season I'm going to do er for Save The Children Fund and I've said"
"I've said move fast, get on with it."
"William Wordsworth  nearly two hundred years ago, wrote this  my heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky."
So it was when my life began  so it is now that I am a man.
So be it when I shall grow old or let me die.
The child is father of the man.
And that is what it seems to me  is the purpose of all our support for this fund.
I've been particularly impressed with the officials and executives and workers that I've met.
"I've been particularly impressed today to learn how people come here every year, particularly for this meeting and of all the various ways in which money can be raised."
"The money is there, we know this."
I always say that we all spend our money on what we really want to spend it on  and put a bit by for what we really desire to achieve.
It is wonderful all the work that you do.
And I applaud and admire it.
I  am here partly because I was fortunate enough to have the happiest and healthiest of childhoods and I see it  as a very happy obligation to try to do my best to ensure that all over the world it is possible for other children to enjoy something of what I had.
God bless you all and I hope to be  walking alongside you during the seventy fifth year anniversary efforts.
In Sri Lanka thousand of families have moved from the countryside to the capital Colombo in search of a better life.
"Instead they find nowhere to live, nothing to eat and poor health and education."
"Save The Children is helping families to rebuild the ghettos, to make a better life for themselves and the next generation."
In the Sudan cities are surrounded by huge camps filled with victims of a five year long civil war.
It's a poor part of Africa but most of its problems are man made.
"Yes, may please your worships I am satisfied that those documents  to cover the  defendant for the date in question  and will therefore offer no evidence  in relation to the  protest to these premises  but to dismiss them."
Could I ask sir
"Yes, stand up Mr   we listening to those three charges  and maybe you'll  no test certificate in those two  ."
Er
Now unless there's a prosecution we have the facts for the other offenses I understand.
"Yeah so please your worships it was the twenty first of June in the morning when the police officer was on duty  on the Aces Accrington at Worley he had occasion to stop the vehicle which was being driven by Mr   and he noticed that the excise licence which was being displayed had in fact, expired at the end of March."
"Mr  was unable to produce his documents in relation to the vehicle which he indicated was his own and he was therefore given an H R T one to produce those documents  but you will appreciate from the matters that he's pleaded  pleaded guilty to this morning  he in fact, failed to produce  his insurance  driving licence  and test certificate within the required period."
"Your worships, those are the brief facts, I would ask you consider back duty of eight pounds thirty three pence  at being called a month of  May."
I think you'll find
He says .
I would like them both to go back from the month of June.
I know.
I'd also ask you to consider costs of ten pounds.
.
He could have the li you can have your licence back  offenses to endorse it with.
Yeah  and er    .
You're able to help him anyway.
"Yes,"
I wonder if I may
Can I just say before we start but  er  why that he doesn't  call  June  and his licence for seven months.
"Sir, I apologise, I was  going by this figure made by  which indicated  that it expired on the thirty first of March, I think and in fact, that is a  an error on the officer's part  it would appear  from  the licensing authorities  in fact, it expired at the end of May."
Yeah.
Yeah.
.
"Your worships er, these offenses arrived out of er  what was, initially a road  traffic accident which occurred on the twenty first of June  er, when  er, Mr  's vehicle came into collision with  er, a vehicle that was  erm  stationary in the centre of the road waiting to turn right."
"No  er allegations of erm  concerning the  correct, his driving  er, are made by the pro prosecution  er  as a result of the incident but  er, as a result of the  officer's enquiries  er, it came to light that Mr   was  er, in breach of some of the  er, other regulations regarding road uses and  so the summonses which are to deal with this morning have er  have been issued against him."
"Erm, and you will  be aware that  at two of  er, three of the er  summonses that are now left here to de deal with, that's three of the four  er, do in fact, relate to clearly produce the documents."
"Er, failure to produce his driving licence  failure to produce  a  test certificate for the vehicle and failure to produce his insurance documents  and what Mr  says  in respect of er, those three offenses is that  er, the officer, he accepts, did tell him that he was obliged to produce the documents to a police station  but he says that  he was suffering some shock as a result of the road accident  and er  he didn't appreciate what the officer was saying to him at the time  and, never having had to produce his documents at the police station before  er, he had never  er no , known that that was a procedure that had to be followed  and in the circumstances  he didn't pay any attention to the print on the H R T  er, one form that was issued to him and he  didn't produce the documents."
It was completely ignorance on his part  in that respect.
"Er your worships, the one remaining summonses, the one relating to the fact that his vehicle  er, wasn't taxed at the time of the accident  and, I think er  he he will be aware his tax  er, did run out at the end of May  and this accident happened on the twenty first of June."
"I've asked him about that and what he said is that  er, he was saving up and he was going tax the vehicle as soon he  was able to do so  but he didn't have the funds and  er, to do so at, at that time."
"Erm  he is obviously aware that er  by not having the vehicle taxed  it's going to cost him considerably more than if he had er  taxed the vehicle at the right, correct and proper time."
Is that on?
What's this?
Shouldn't eat that.
There's no T V .
"Well St Aldate's in the Civil War is quite a problem to talk about really, erm in half an hour, because it's so enmeshed in the story of Oxford in the Civil War which is a long, very interesting one, so what I'm going to try and do is erm to pick out some of the local landmarks that did survive in the 17th century and relate them to what we know about some of the people  and in this short half an hour, just try and picture what it was like to live in St Aldate's during the civil war."
Obviously a whole lot else is .
"I think it's quite important to orientate ourselves first, and you're looking at a map of Oxford in 1643, erm and 17th century maps for the most part are what we should call upside down."
"The north is at the bottom, and I think it helps if you stop thinking about it as a map and you think about it as a birds-eye view, a helicopter view, erm and then the whole thing begins to make sense."
"erm Now, what you've got there is a slightly later map of 1675, which is exactly the same, the north is at the bottom, I'm afraid the top is not very obvious, if I could just hold it up, you've got the castle there, and you've got it the right way up, and actually there's some writing  as well."
"erm And the reason I've given you that one is that that was drawn in 1675  by David Loggen, and it's a very, very accurate one, and it's rather easier to see some of the places I shall be talking about, so I think it's a nice one for you to have close up."
erm There are some little differences which are quite interesting too.
"Now, if we find Carfax first in the middle, Oxford's on the  crossroads principle, like so many cities, we've got St Giles down here, erm and Oxford of course a small city, or we should regard it as a very small city."
"It was still a walled city, the walls were all virtually intact, the castle was a bit ruinous, but it was there, and it had its four main gates, erm East Gate on the important London Road going out past Magdalen and over Magdalen Bridge, erm the North Gate here, the Westgate by the Castle, and then still existing then but not in your map if you can find it, the South Gate across the road, just at the bottom of Christchurch, can you find Christchurch on your map? erm Now, perhaps you can that there's a difference in Christchurch on your map with this one."
"When Cardinal Wolsey fell, he hadn't finished the building of Tom Quad, the whole of this side was left open because he'd planned a very grand perpendicular chapel like King's College Chapel, and erm the ruins, well no, not the ruins, the  foundations were still to be seen apparently in the 17th Century John Gomley tells us."
"But it was open, I mean it must have been fenced in some way  later on."
"erm But there was this great gap and I think had the civil war not come, the dean of Christchurch who was the first of the two Fells, would have probably finished that building then."
"As it was it was finished, as you can see on your map, after the war, erm but perhaps you can also see that Tom Tower is not yet built on yours."
That wouldn't come till the 1680s.
Now St Aldate's was a long narrow parish.
"It didn't quite reach up to Carfax, and it had another great landmark, as well as the big, rich college of Christchurch, and that was the Guildhall, built at the centre of the civic power, which was more or less, well, just where the Town Hall is now."
"It had 2 big inns, and we're more or less, well, we are on the site of the first one, Blue Boar Inn, and on your map, rather strangely, it seems to be built across the opening of Blue Boar Lane, I don't know if you can see."
"erm Anyway, it's just about there, and then, almost next door, presumably in competition with each other is the other inn, the Unicorn Inn, erm so that was it just on the South Side of Blue Boar Lane."
"erm One very important house is erm what is now the Newman Mobray Bookshop, and that of course is still very much as it was in the 17th Century."
"It belonged to an extremely important erm civic family, Thomas and John Smith, who are the two important ones during the civil war, Thomas was mayor just before the War, John Smith was a member of parliament in the Long Parliament, and erm there's a slightly complicated story to the house, Thomas moved out of it just before the war and built another one  way up the street, but John stayed there, and another important landowner in Marston, Umpton Croak, owned the other half of it."
"If you go down to Newman Mobray, and walk down that little alleyway, Rose Place, you see what is the frontage of that house, and it's very fine, and you can tell these are important people building themselves a fine house."
"erm And I've got a picture in here somewhere , which I'll pass round."
"erm And also, the Alice Shop?"
"Do you know where I mean? erm Well, that too, is a 17th century building, I've got a  an early 19th century Butler engraving of it here, and some pictures from the Alice shop itself, Now that was owned by a Walter Paine, both these citizens were well off brewers, erm those are just pictures of the same one, it's a little bit of a problem because this is called the house belonging to the manciple of Christchurch."
"I think in fact that's a mistake from,a mistaken  caption."
"Manciples were like college bursars, and they were very important."
"I'm rather advertising this because I think it's important to understand that although, and I'm sure you know, that there's this constant war really between, it wasn't of course a physical war, but certainly tension, and difficulty between the university and the city."
"I wish I knew , though , how one ought to see about changing one 's position ."
I should very much like to move about .
"If I only could , I would glide up and down the ice there , as I saw the boys doing ; but somehow or other , I do n't know how to run . '"
` Bow-wow ! '
barked the old yard-dog ; he was rather hoarse and could n't bark very well .
His hoarseness came on when he was a house-dog and used to lie in front of the stove .
` The sun will soon teach you to run !
"I saw that last winter with your predecessor , and farther back still with his predecessors !"
They have all run away ! ' '
"I do n't understand you , my friend , ' said the Snow-man ."
` That thing up there is to teach me to run ? '
He meant the moon .
"` Well , it certainly did run just now , for I saw it quite plainly over there , and now here it is on this side . '"
"` You know nothing at all about it , ' said the yard-dog ."
"` Why , you have only just been made ."
The thing you see there is the moon ; the other thing you saw going down the other side was the sun .
"He will come up again tomorrow morning , and will soon teach you how to run away down the gutter ."
The weather is going to change ; I feel it already by the pain in my left hind-leg ; the weather is certainly going to change . ' '
"I ca n't understand him , ' said the Snow-man ; ` but I have an idea that he is speaking of something unpleasant ."
"That thing that glares so , and then disappears , the sun , as he calls it , is not my friend ."
I know that by instinct . '
` Bow-wow ! '
"barked the yard-dog , and walked three times round himself , and then crept into his kennel to sleep ."
The weather really did change .
"Towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood ; later on came an icy wind , which sent the frost packing ."
"But when the sun rose , it was a glorious sight ."
"The trees and shrubs were covered with rime , and looked like a wood of coral , and every branch was thick with long white blossoms ."
"The most delicate twigs , which are lost among the foliage in summer-time , came now into prominence , and it was like a spider 's web of glistening white ."
"The lady-birches waved in the wind ; and when the sun shone , everything glittered and sparkled as if it were sprinkled with diamond dust , and great diamonds were lying on the snowy carpet ."
` Is n't it wonderful ? '
exclaimed a girl who was walking with a young man in the garden .
"They stopped near the Snow-man , and looked at the glistening trees ."
"Those who had dismounted began scrambling into the saddle ; the rest rode in pursuit ; but they had to make the circuit of the consecrated ground , and it was plain their quarry would escape them ."
"Hatch , roaring an oath , put his horse at the hedge , to head him off ; but the beast refused , and sent his rider sprawling in the dust ."
"And though he was up again in a moment , and had caught the bridle , the time had gone by , and the fugitive had gained too great a lead for any hope of capture ."
The wisest of all had been Dick Shelton .
"Instead of starting in a vain pursuit , he had whipped his crossbow from his back , bent it , and set a quarrel to the string ; and now , when the others had desisted , he turned to Bennet and asked if he should shoot ."
`` Shoot !
shoot ! ''
"cried the priest , with sanguinary violence ."
"`` Cover him , Master Dick , '' said Bennet ."
`` Bring me him down like a ripe apple . ''
The fugitive was now within but a few leaps of safety ; but this last part of the meadow ran very steeply uphill ; and the man ran slower in proportion .
"What with the greyness of the falling night , and the uneven movements of the runner , it was no easy aim ; and as Dick levelled his bow , he felt a kind of pity , and a half desire that he might miss ."
The quarrel sped .
"The man stumbled and fell , and a great cheer arose from Hatch and the pursuers ."
But they were counting their corn before the harvest .
"The man fell lightly ; he was lightly afoot again , turned and waved his cap in a bravado , and was out of sight next moment in the margin of the wood ."
`` And the plague go with him ! ''
cried Bennet .
"`` He has thieves ' heels ; he can run , by St Banbury !"
"But you touched him , Master Shelton ; he has stolen your quarrel , may he never have good I grudge him less ! ''"
"`` Nay , but what made he by the church ? ''"
asked Sir Oliver .
`` I am shrewdly afeared there has been mischief here .
"Clipsby , good fellow , get ye down from your horse , and search thoroughly among the yews . ''"
Clipsby was gone but a little while ere he returned carrying a paper .
"`` This writing was pinned to the church door , '' he said , handing it to the parson ."
"`` I found naught else , sir parson . ''"
"`` Now , by the power of Mother Church , '' cried Sir Oliver , `` but this runs hard on sacrilege !"
"For the king 's good pleasure , or the lord of the manor -- well !"
"But that every run-the-hedge in a green jerkin should fasten papers to the chancel door -- nay , it runs hard on sacrilege , hard ; and men have burned for matters of less weight ."
But what have we here ?
The light falls apace .
"Mr. Trelawney , I 'm surprised at you , sir ."
"Doctor , I thought you had worn the king 's coat !"
"If that was how you served at Fontenoy , sir , you 'd have been better in your berth . ''"
"The doctor 's watch were all back at their loopholes , the rest were busy loading the spare muskets , and everyone with a red face , you may be certain , and a flea in his ear , as the saying is ."
The captain looked on for a while in silence .
Then he spoke .
"`` My lads , '' said he , `` I 've given Silver a broadside ."
"I pitched it in red-hot on purpose ; and before the hour 's out , as he said , we shall be boarded ."
"We 're outnumbered , I need n't tell you that , but we fight in shelter ; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline ."
"I 've no manner of doubt that we can drub them , if you choose . ''"
"Then he went the rounds and saw , as he said , that all was clear ."
"On the two short sides of the house , east and west , there were only two loopholes ; on the south side where the porch was , two again ; and on the north side , five ."
"There was a round score of muskets for the seven of us ; the firewood had been built into four piles -- tables , you might say -- one about the middle of each side , and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders ."
"In the middle , the cutlasses lay ranged ."
"`` Toss out the fire , '' said the captain ; `` the chill is past , and we must n't have smoke in our eyes . ''"
"The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney , and the embers smothered among sand ."
`` Hawkins has n't had his breakfast .
"Hawkins , help yourself , and back to your post to eat it , '' continued Captain Smollett ."
"`` Lively , now , my lad ; you 'll want it before you 've done ."
"Hunter , serve out a round of brandy to all hands . ''"
"And while this was going on , the captain completed , in his own mind , the plan of the defence ."
"`` Doctor , you will take the door , '' he resumed ."
"`` See , and do n't expose yourself ; keep within , and fire through the porch ."
"Hunter , take the east side , there ."
"Joyce , you stand by the west , my man ."
"Mr. Trelawney , you are the best shot -- you and Gray will take this long north side , with the five loopholes ; it 's there the danger is ."
"If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports , things would begin to look dirty ."
"Hawkins , neither you nor I are much account at the shooting ; we 'll stand by to load and bear a hand . ''"
"As the captain had said , the chill was past ."
"As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees , it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught ."
Soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house .
"Jackets and coats were flung aside , shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders ; and we stood there , each at his post , in a fever of heat and anxiety ."
A singular sneer played about the young nobleman 's mouth as he made answer : `` These are very brave words .
But to the more essential -- are ye Lancaster or York ? ''
"`` My lord , I make no secret ; I am clear for York , '' Dick answered ."
`` By the mass ! ''
"replied the other , `` it is well for you . ''"
"And so saying , he turned towards one of his followers ."
"`` Let me see , '' he continued , in the same sneering and cruel tones -- `` let me see a clean end of these brave gentlemen ."
Truss me them up . ''
There were but five survivors of the attacking party .
"Archers seized them by the arms ; they were hurried to the borders of the wood , and each placed below a tree of suitable dimension ; the rope was adjusted ; an archer , carrying the end of it , hastily clambered overhead ; and before a minute was over , and without a word passing upon either hand , the five men were swinging by the neck ."
"`` And now , '' cried the deformed leader , `` back to your posts , and when I summon you next , be readier to attend . ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said one man , `` beseech you , tarry not here alone ."
Keep but a handful of lances at your hand . ''
"`` Fellow , '' said the duke , `` I have forborne to chide you for your slowness ."
"Cross me not , therefore ."
"I trust my hand and arm , for all that I be crooked ."
Ye were backward when the trumpet sounded ; and ye are now too forward with your counsels .
But it is ever so ; last with the lance and first with tongue .
Let it be reversed . ''
"And with a gesture that was not without a sort of dangerous nobility , he waved them off ."
"The footmen climbed again to their seats behind the men-at-arms , and the whole party moved slowly away and disappeared in twenty different directions , under the cover of the forest ."
"The day was by this time beginning to break , and the stars to fade ."
"The first grey glimmer of dawn shone upon the countenances of the two young men , who now turned once more to face each other ."
"`` Here , '' said the duke , `` ye have seen my vengeance , which is , like my blade , both sharp and ready ."
"But I would not have you , for all Christendom , suppose me thankless ."
You that came to my aid with a good sword and a better courage -- unless that ye recoil from my misshapenness -- come to my heart . ''
"And so saying , the young leader held out his arms for an embrace ."
"In the bottom of his heart Dick already entertained a great terror and some hatred for the man whom he had rescued ; but the invitation was so worded that it would not have been merely discourteous , but cruel , to refuse or hesitate ; and he hastened to comply ."
"`` And now , my lord duke , '' he said , when he had regained his freedom , `` do I suppose aright ?"
Are ye my Lord Duke of Gloucester ? ''
"`` I am Richard of Gloucester , '' returned the other ."
`` And you -- how call they you ? ''
Did you ever see such a rookery ?
And perched right close to the road too .
An old house with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its eyes picked out . ''
"`` I think an old , deserted house is such a sad sight , '' said Anne dreamily ."
`` It always seems to me to be thinking about its past and mourning for its old-time joys .
"Marilla says that a large family was raised in that old house long ago , and that it was a real pretty place , with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it ."
"It was full of little children and laughter and songs ; and now it is empty , and nothing ever wanders through it but the wind ."
How lonely and sorrowful it must feel !
Perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights ... the ghosts of the little children of long ago and the roses and the songs ... and for a little while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again . ''
Diana shook her head .
"`` I never imagine things like that about places now , Anne ."
Do n't you remember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined ghosts into the Haunted Wood ?
To this day I ca n't go through that bush comfortably after dark ; and if I began imagining such things about the old Boulter house I 'd be frightened to pass it too .
"Besides , those children are n't dead ."
They 're all grown up and doing well ... and one of them is a butcher .
And flowers and songs could n't have ghosts anyhow . ''
Anne smothered a little sigh .
She loved Diana dearly and they had always been good comrades .
But she had long ago learned that when she wandered into the realm of fancy she must go alone .
The way to it was by an enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her .
"A thunder-shower came up while the girls were at Carmody ; it did not last long , however , and the drive home , through lanes where the raindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the drenched ferns gave out spicy odors , was delightful ."
But just as they turned into the Cuthbert lane Anne saw something that spoiled the beauty of the landscape for her .
"Before them on the right extended Mr. Harrison 's broad , gray-green field of late oats , wet and luxuriant ; and there , standing squarely in the middle of it , up to her sleek sides in the lush growth , and blinking at them calmly over the intervening tassels , was a Jersey cow !"
Anne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips that boded no good to the predatory quadruped .
"Not a word said she , but she climbed nimbly down over the wheels , and whisked across the fence before Diana understood what had happened ."
"`` Anne , come back , '' shrieked the latter , as soon as she found her voice ."
`` You 'll ruin your dress in that wet grain ... ruin it .
She does n't hear me !
"Well , she 'll never get that cow out by herself ."
"I must go and help her , of course . ''"
Anne was charging through the grain like a mad thing .
"Diana hopped briskly down , tied the horse securely to a post , turned the skirt of her pretty gingham dress over her shoulders , mounted the fence , and started in pursuit of her frantic friend ."
cried his daughter .
"` Well , that is not worth much , my dear , ' said he ."
"` Besides , you have rings enough , I should think . '"
"` Never mind , I like it , ' replied the princess ."
"But as soon as she was alone , to her amazement , the ring suddenly left her finger and became a man ."
"You can imagine how frightened she was , as , indeed , anybody would have been ; but in an instant the man became a ring again , and then turned back to a man , and so it went on for some time until she began to get used to these sudden changes . '"
"I am sorry I frightened you , ' said Hans , when he thought he could safely speak to the princess without making her scream . '"
"I took refuge with you because the old hill-man , whom I have offended , was trying to kill me , and here I am safe . '"
"` You had better stay here then , ' said the princess ."
"So Hans stayed , and he and she became good friends ; though , of course , he only became a man when no one else was present ."
"This was all very well ; but , one day , as they were talking together , the king happened to enter the room , and although Hans quickly changed himself into a ring again it was too late ."
The king was terribly angry .
` So this is why you have refused to marry all the kings and princes who have sought your hand ? '
he cried .
"And , without waiting for her to speak , he commanded that his daughter should be walled up in the summer-house and starved to death with her lover ."
"That evening the poor princess , still wearing her ring , was put into the summer-house with enough food to last for three days , and the door was bricked up ."
"But at the end of a week or two the king thought it was time to give her a grand funeral , in spite of her bad behaviour , and he had the summer-house opened ."
"He could hardly believe his eyes when he found that the princess was not there , nor Hans either ."
"Instead , there lay at his feet a large hole , big enough for two people to pass through ."
Now what had happened was this .
"When the princess and Hans had given up hope , and cast themselves down on the ground to die , they fell down this hole , and right through the earth as well , and at last they tumbled into a castle built of pure gold at the other side of the world , and there they lived happily ."
"But of this , of course , the king knew nothing ."
` Will anyone go down and see where the passage leads to ? '
"he asked , turning to his guards and courtiers . '"
I will reward splendidly the man who is brave enough to explore it . '
For a long time nobody answered .
"The hole was dark and deep , and if it had a bottom no one could see it ."
"At length a soldier , who was a careless sort of fellow , offered himself for the service , and cautiously lowered himself into the darkness ."
"But in a moment he , too , fell down , down , down ."
"Was he going to fall for ever , he wondered !"
"Oh , how thankful he was in the end to reach the castle , and to meet the princess and Hans , looking quite well and not at all as if they had been starved ."
"They began to talk , and the soldier told them that the king was very sorry for the way he had treated his daughter , and wished day and night that he could have her back again ."
"So when he had freed Wendy , he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others , and himself took her place by the mast , her cloak around him so that he should pass for her ."
Then he took a great breath and crowed .
To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin ; and they were panic-stricken .
"Hook tried to hearten them ; but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs , and he knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him ."
"`` Lads , '' he said , ready to cajole or strike as need be , but never quailing for an instant , `` I 've thought it out ."
There 's a Jonah aboard . ''
"`` Ay , '' they snarled , `` a man wi ' a hook . ''"
"`` No , lads , no , it 's the girl ."
Never was luck on a pirate ship wi ' a woman on board .
We 'll right the ship when she 's gone . ''
Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint 's .
"`` It 's worth trying , '' they said doubtfully ."
"`` Fling the girl overboard , '' cried Hook ; and they made a rush at the figure in the cloak ."
"`` There 's none can save you now , missy , '' Mullins hissed jeeringly ."
"`` There 's one , '' replied the figure ."
`` Who 's that ? ''
`` Peter Pan the avenger ! ''
came the terrible answer ; and as he spoke Peter flung off his cloak .
"Then they all knew who 't was that had been undoing them in the cabin , and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed ."
In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke .
"At last he cried , `` Cleave him to the brisket ! ''"
but without conviction .
"`` Down , boys , and at them ! ''"
Peter 's voice rang out ; and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship .
"Had the pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won ; but the onset came when they were still unstrung , and they ran hither and thither , striking wildly , each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew ."
"Man to man they were the stronger ; but they fought on the defensive only , which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry ."
"Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea ; others hid in dark recesses , where they were found by Slightly , who did not fight , but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces , so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys ."
"There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons , an occasional screech or splash , and Slightly monotonously counting -- five -- six -- seven eight -- nine -- ten -- eleven ."
"I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook , who seemed to have a charmed life , as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire ."
"They had done for his dogs , but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all ."
"Again and again they closed upon him , and again and again he hewed a clear space ."
"He had lifted up one boy with his hook , and was using him as a buckler -LSB- shield -RSB- , when another , who had just passed his sword through Mullins , sprang into the fray ."
"The woman had been surprised before at the disappearance of her food , but she was more astonished still when , instead of the plank , she beheld a baby ."
"However , she was fond of children and had none of her own , so she made up her mind that she would keep it and take care of it ."
"The baby grew and throve as no baby in that country had ever done , and in four days he was a man , and as tall and strong as any brave of the tribe ."
"` You have treated me well , ' he said , ` and meat shall never fail to your house ."
"But now I must go , for I have much work to do . '"
Then he set out for his home .
"It took him many days to get there , and when he saw his son sitting in his place his anger was kindled , and his heart was stirred to take vengeance upon him ."
"So he went out quickly into the forest and shed tears , and each tear became a bird ."
"` Stay there till I want you , ' said he ; and he returned to the hut . '"
"I saw some pretty new birds , high up in a tree yonder , ' he remarked ."
And the son answered : ` Show me the way and I will get them for dinner . '
"The two went out together , and after walking for about half an hour they old man stopped ."
"` That is the tree , ' he said ."
And the son began to climb it .
Now a strange thing happened .
"The higher the young man climbed the higher the birds seemed to be , and when he looked down the earth below appeared no bigger than a star ."
"Sill he tried to go back , but he could not , and though he could not see the birds any longer he felt as if something were dragging him up and up ."
"He thought that he had been climbing that tree for days , and perhaps he had , for suddenly a beautiful country , yellow with fields of maize , stretched before him , and he gladly left the top of the tree and entered it ."
"He walked through the maize without knowing where he was going , when he heard a sound of knocking , and saw two old blind women crushing their food between two stones ."
"He crept up to them on tiptoe , and when one old woman passed her dinner to the other he held out his hand and took it and ate if for himself ."
"` How slow you are kneading that cake , ' cried the other old woman at last ."
"` Why , I have given you your dinner , and what more do you want ? '"
replied the second .
"` You did n't ; at least I never got it , ' said the other . '"
I certainly thought you took it from me ; but here is some more . '
And again the young man stretched out his hand ; and the two old women fell to quarrelling afresh .
"But when it happened for the third time the old women suspected some trick , and one of them exclaimed : ' I am sure there is a man here ; tell me , are you not my grandson ? '"
"` Yes , ' answered the young man , who wished to please her , ` and in return for your good dinner I will see if I can not restore your sight ; for I was taught in the art of healing by the best medicine man in the tribe . '"
"And with that he left them , and wandered about till he found the herb which he wanted ."
"Then he hastened back to the old women , and begging them to boil him some water , he threw the herb in ."
"As soon as the pot began to sing he took off the lid , and sprinkled the eyes of the women , and sight came back to them once more ."
"There was no night in that country , so , instead of going to bed very early , as he would have done in his own hut , the young man took another walk ."
"This was a very important point , and needed much discussion ."
A thousand names were proposed and rejected for a thousand silly reasons .
"One was another reminded the queen of somebody she did not like ; but at length an idea flashed into the queen 's head , and she called out : ' I know !"
We will call her Muffette . '
"` That is the very thing , ' shouted the frog , jumping high into the air ; and so it was settled ."
The princess Muffette was about six months old when the frog noticed that the queen had begun to grow sad again .
` Why do you have that look in your eyes ? '
"she asked one day , when she had come in to play with the baby , who could now crawl ."
"The way they played their game was to let Muffette creep close to the frog , and then for the frog to bound high into the air and alight on the child 's head , or back , or legs , when she always sent up a shout of pleasure ."
"There is no play fellow like a frog ; but then it must be a fairy frog , or else you might hurt it , and if you did something dreadful might happen to you ."
"Well , as I have said , our frog was struck with the queen 's sad face , and lost no time in asking her what was the reason . '"
"I do n't see what you have to complain of now ; Muffette is quite well and quite happy , and even the Lion Fairy is kind to her when she sees her ."
What is it ? '
` Oh !
if her father could only see her ! '
"broke forth the queen , clasping her hands ."
` Or if I could only tell him all that has happened since we parted .
"But they will have brought him tidings of the broken carriage , and he will have thought me dead , or devoured by wild beasts ."
"And though he will mourn for me long -- I know that well -- yet in time they will persuade him to take a wife , and she will be young and fair , and he will forget me . '"
"And in all this the queen guessed truly , save that nine long years were to pass before he would consent to put another in her place ."
"The frog answered nothing at the time , but stopped her game and hopped away among the cypress trees ."
"Here she sat and thought and thought , and the next morning she went back to the queen and said : ' I have come , madam , to make you an offer ."
"Shall I go to the king instead of you , and tell him of your sufferings , and that he has the most charming baby in the world for his daughter ?"
"The way is long , and I travel slowly ; but , sooner or later , I shall be sure to arrive ."
"Only , are you not afraid to be left without my protection ?"
Ponder the matter carefully ; it is for you to decide . '
"` Oh , it needs no pondering , ' cried the queen joyfully , holding up her clasped hands , and making Muffette do likewise , in token of gratitude ."
But in order that he may know that you have come from me I will send him a letter . '
"And pricking her arm , she wrote a few words with her blood on the corner of her handkerchief ."
"Then tearing it off , she gave it to the frog , and they bade each other farewell ."
"It took the frog a year and four days to mount the ten thousand steps that led to the upper world , but that was because she was still under the spell of a wicked fairy ."
"By the time she reached the top , she was so tired that she had to remain for another year on the banks of a stream to rest , and also to arrange the procession with which she was to present herself before the king ."
"remarked Miss Draper , who felt uncomfortably near crying herself ."

Margaret 's Patient -LSB- Illustration : `` DID DR. FORBES THINK SHE OUGHT TO GIVE UP HER TRIP ? '' -RSB-
Margaret paused a moment at the gate and looked back at the quaint old house under its snowy firs with a thrill of proprietary affection .
"It was her home ; for the first time in her life she had a real home , and the long , weary years of poorly paid drudgery were all behind her ."
Before her was a prospect of independence and many of the delights she had always craved ; in the immediate future was a trip to Vancouver with Mrs. Boyd .
"For I shall go , of course , thought Margaret , as she walked briskly down the snowy road ."
"I 've always wanted to see the Rockies , and to go there with Mrs. Boyd will double the pleasure ."
She is such a delightful companion .
Margaret Campbell had been an orphan ever since she could remember .
"She had been brought up by a distant relative of her father 's -- that is , she had been given board , lodging , some schooling and indifferent clothes for the privilege of working like a little drudge in the house of the grim cousin who sheltered her ."
The death of this cousin flung Margaret on her own resources .
"A friend had procured her employment as the `` companion '' of a rich , eccentric old lady , infirm of health and temper ."
"Margaret lived with her for five years , and to the young girl they seemed treble the time ."
"Her employer was fault-finding , peevish , unreasonable , and many a time Margaret 's patience almost failed her -- almost , but not quite ."
In the end it brought her a more tangible reward than sometimes falls to the lot of the toiler .
"Mrs. Constance died , and in her will she left to Margaret her little up-country cottage and enough money to provide her an income for the rest of her life ."
"Margaret took immediate possession of her little house and , with the aid of a capable old servant , soon found herself very comfortable ."
"She realized that her days of drudgery were over , and that henceforth life would be a very different thing from what it had been ."
Margaret meant to have `` a good time . ''
She had never had any pleasure and now she was resolved to garner in all she could of the joys of existence .
"`` I 'm not going to do a single useful thing for a year , '' she had told Mrs. Boyd gaily ."
"`` Just think of it -- a whole delightful year of vacation , to go and come at will , to read , travel , dream , rest ."
"After that , I mean to see if I can find something to do for other folks , but I 'm going to have this one golden year ."
And the first thing in it is our trip to Vancouver .
I 'm so glad I have the chance to go with you .
"It 's a wee bit short notice , but I 'll be ready when you want to start . ''"
"Altogether , Margaret felt pretty well satisfied with life as she tripped blithely down the country road between the ranks of snow-laden spruces , with the blue sky above and the crisp , exhilarating air all about ."
"There was only one drawback , but it was a pretty serious one ."
"It 's so lonely by spells , Margaret sometimes thought wistfully ."
All the joys my good fortune has brought me ca n't quite fill my heart .
`` Dear life and heart ! ''
"exclaimed Mrs. Emory , pausing in the act of scalding a milk-can when Murray emerged from a side door ."
"`` What on earth is the matter , Mr. Murray ?"
"You ai n't sick now , surely ?"
I told you them pond fogs was p ` isen after night !
"If you 've gone and got -- '' `` Nothing is the matter , dear lady , '' interrupted Murray , `` and I have n't gone and got anything except an acute attack of early rising which is not in the least likely to become chronic ."
"But at what hour of the night do you get up , you wonderful woman ?"
Or rather do you ever go to bed at all ?
"Here is the sun only beginning to rise and -- positively yes , you have all your cows milked . ''"
Mrs. Emory purred with delight .
"`` Folks as has fourteen cows to milk has to rise betimes , '' she answered with proud humility ."
"`` Laws , I do n't complain -- I 've lots of help with the milking ."
"How Mrs. Palmer manages , I really can not comperhend -- or rather , how she has managed ."
I suppose she 'll be all right now since her niece came last night .
I saw her posting to the pond pasture not ten minutes ago .
She 'll have to milk all them seven cows herself .
But dear life and heart !
Here I be palavering away and not a bite of breakfast ready for you ! ''
"`` I do n't want any breakfast until the regular time for it , '' assured Murray ."
`` I 'm going down to the pond to see the sun rise . ''
"`` Now do n't you go and get caught in the ma ` sh , '' anxiously called Mrs. Emory , as she never failed to do when she saw him starting for the pond ."
"Nobody ever had got caught in the marsh , but Mrs. Emory lived in a chronic state of fear lest someone should ."
"`` And if you once got stuck in that black mud you 'd be sucked right down and never seen or heard tell of again till the day of judgment , like Adam Palmer 's cow , '' she was wont to warn her boarders ."
"Murray sought his favourite spot for pond dreaming -- a bloomy corner of the pasture that ran down into the blue water , with a dump of leafy maples on the left ."
He was very glad he had risen early .
A miracle was being worked before his very eyes .
"The world was in a flush and tremor of maiden loveliness , instinct with all the marvellous fleeting charm of girlhood and spring and young morning ."
Overhead the sky was a vast high-sprung arch of unstained crystal .
"Down over the sand dunes , where the pond ran out into the sea , was a great arc of primrose smitten through with auroral crimsonings ."
"Beneath it the pond waters shimmered with a hundred fairy hues , but just before him they were clear as a flawless mirror ."
"The fields around him glistened with dews , and a little wandering wind , blowing lightly from some bourne in the hills , strayed down over the slopes , bringing with it an unimaginable odour and freshness , and fluttered over the pond , leaving a little path of dancing silver ripples across the mirror-glory of the water ."
"Birds were singing in the beech woods over on Orchard Knob Farm , answering to each other from shore to shore , until the very air was tremulous with the elfin music of this wonderful midsummer dawn ."
"Alan wrote it , putting all thought of Lynde Oliver sternly out of his mind for the time being ."
He had no notion of falling in love with her .
He knew nothing of love and imagined that it counted for nothing in his life .
"He admitted that his curiosity was aflame about the girl , but it never occurred to him that she meant or could mean anything to him but an attractive enigma which once solved would lose its attraction ."
"The young women he knew in Rexton , whose simple , pleasant friendship he valued , had the placid , domestic charm of their own sweet-breathed , windless orchards ."
"Lynde Oliver had the fascination of the lake shore -- wild , remote , untamed -- the lure of the wilderness and the primitive ."
"There was nothing more personal in his thought of her , and yet when he recalled Isabel King 's sneer he felt an almost personal resentment ."
* * * * * During the following fortnight Alan made many trips to the shore -- and he always went by the branch road to the Four Winds point .
He did not attempt to conceal from himself that he hoped to meet Lynde Oliver again .
In this he was unsuccessful .
Sometimes he saw her at a distance along the shore but she always disappeared as soon as seen .
"Occasionally as he crossed the point he saw her working in her garden but he never went very near the house , feeling that he had no right to spy on it or her in any way ."
He soon became convinced that she avoided him purposely and the conviction piqued him .
He felt an odd masterful desire to meet her face to face and make her look at him .
Sometimes he called himself a fool and vowed he would go no more to the Four Winds shore .
Yet he inevitably went .
He did not find in the shore the comfort and inspiration he had formerly found .
"Something had come between his soul and the soul of the wilderness -- something he did not recognize or formulate -- a nameless , haunting longing that shaped itself about the memory of a cold sweet face and starry , indifferent eyes , grey as the lake at dawn ."
"Of Captain Anthony he never got even a glimpse , but he saw the old cousin several times , going and coming about the yard and its environs ."
"Finally one day he met her , coming up a path which led to a spring down in a firry hollow ."
She was carrying two heavy pails of water and Alan asked permission to help her .
"He half expected a repulse , for the tall , grim old woman had a rather stern and forbidding look , but after gazing at him a moment in a somewhat scrutinizing manner she said briefly , `` You may , if you like . ''"
"Alan took the pails and followed her , the path not being wide enough for two ."
"She strode on before him at a rapid , vigorous pace until they came out into the yard by the house ."
Alan felt his heart beating foolishly .
Would he see Lynde Oliver ?
"Would -- `` You may carry the water there , '' the old woman said , pointing to a little outhouse near the pines ."
`` I 'm washing -- the spring water is softer than the well water .
Thank you '' -- as Alan set the pails down on a bench -- `` I 'm not so young as I was and bringing the water so far tires me .
Lynde always brings it for me when she 's home . ''
"She stood before him in the narrow doorway , blocking his exit , and looked at him with keen , deep-set dark eyes ."
"In spite of her withered aspect and wrinkled face , she was not an uncomely old woman and there was about her a dignity of carriage and manner that pleased Alan ."
"That day the cows wandered father than ever they had done before , and never stopped till they had reached a moor where the heather was burning ."
"The fire was fierce , but the cows took no heed , and walked steadily through it , Covan the Brown-haired following them ."
"Next they plunged into a foaming river , and Covan plunged in after them , though the water came high above his waist ."
"On the other side of the river lay a wide plain , and here the cows lay down , while Covan looked about him ."
"Near him was a house built of yellow stone , and from it came sweet songs , and Covan listened , and his heart grew light within him ."
"While he was thus waiting there ran up to him a youth , scarcely able to speak so swiftly had he sped ; and he cried aloud : ` Hasten , hasten , Covan the Brown-haired , for your cows are in the corn , and you must drive them out ! '"
"` Nay , ' said Covan smiling , ` it had been easier for you to have driven them out than to come here to tell me . '"
And he went on listening to the music .
"Very soon the same youth returned and cried with panting breath : ` Out upon you , Covan son of Gorla , that you stand there agape ."
"For our dogs are chasing your cows , and you must drive them off ! '"
"` Nay , then , ' answered Covan as before , ` it had been easier for you to call off your dogs than to come here to tell me . '"
And he stayed where he was till the music ceased .
"Then he turned to look for the cows , and found them all lying in the place where he had left them ; but when they saw Covan they rose up and walked homewards , taking a different path to that they had trod in the morning ."
"This time they passed over a plain so bare that a pin could not have lain there unnoticed , yet Covan beheld with surprise a foal and its mother feeding there , both as fat as if they had pastured on the richest grass ."
"Further on they crossed another plain , where the grass was thick and green , but on it were feeding a foal and its mother , so lean that you could have counted their ribs ."
"And further again the path led them by the shores of a lake whereon were floating two boats ; one full of gay and happy youths , journeying to the land of the Sun , and another with grim shapes clothed in black , travelling to the land of Night ."
` What can these things mean ? '
"said Covan to himself , as he followed his cows ."
"Darkness now fell , the wind howled , and torrents of rain poured upon them ."
"Covan knew not how far they might yet have to go , or indeed if they were on the right road ."
"He could not even see his cows , and his heart sank lest , after all , he should have failed to bring them safely back ."
What was he to do ?
"He waited thus , for he could go neither forwards nor backwards , till he felt a great friendly paw laid on his shoulder ."
"` My cave is just here , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor , of whom Covan son of Gorla had heard much ."
"` Spend the night here , and you shall be fed on the flesh of lamb , and shall lay aside three-thirds of thy weariness . '"
"And Covan entered , and supped , and slept , and in the morning rose up a new man ."
"` Farewell , Covan , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor ."
"` May success go with you , for you took what I had to give and did not mock me ."
"So , when danger is your companion , wish for me , and I will not fail you . '"
"At these words the Dog of Maol-mor disappeared into the forest , and Covan went to seek his cows , which were standing in the hollow where the darkness had come upon them ."
"At the sight of Covan the Brown-haired they walked onwards , Covan following ever behind them , and looking neither to the right nor to the left ."
"All that day they walked , and when night fell they were in a barren plain , with only rocks for shelter ."
"The front door of Four Winds opened directly into a wide , low-ceilinged living room , furnished with simplicity and good taste ."
"Leaving the two men there , Lynde and the old cousin vanished , and Alan found himself talking freely with the Captain who could , as it appeared , talk well on many subjects far removed from Four Winds ."
"He was evidently a clever , self-educated man , somewhat opinionated and given to sarcasm ; he never made any references to his own past life or experiences , but Alan discovered him to be surprisingly well read in politics and science ."
"Sometimes in the pauses of the conversation Alan found the older man looking at him in a furtive way he did not like , but the Captain was such an improvement on what he had been led to expect that he was not inclined to be over critical ."
"At least , this was what he honestly thought ."
He did not suspect that it was because this man was Lynde 's father that he wished to think as well as possible of him .
Presently Lynde came in .
"She had changed her outdoor dress , stained with moss and soil in her fall , for a soft clinging garment of some pale yellow material , and her long , thick braid of hair hung over her shoulder ."
She sat mutely down in a dim corner and took no part in the conversation except to answer briefly the remarks which Alan addressed to her .
Emily came in and lighted the lamp on the table .
"She was as grim and unsmiling as ever , yet she cast a look of satisfaction on Alan as she passed out ."
"One dog lay down at Lynde 's feet , the other sat on his haunches by her side and laid his head on her lap ."
"Rexton and its quiet round of parish duties seemed thousands of miles away from Alan , and he wondered a little if this were not all a dream ."
When he went away the Captain invited him back .
"`` If you like to come , that is , '' he said brusquely , `` and always as the man , not the priest , remember ."
I do n't want you by and by to be slyly slipping in the thin end of any professional wedges .
You 'll waste your time if you do .
"Come as man to man and you 'll be welcome , for I like you -- and it 's few men I like ."
But do n't try to talk religion to me . ''
"`` I never talk religion , '' said Alan emphatically ."
`` I try to live it .
"I 'll not come to your house as a self-appointed missionary , sir , but I shall certainly act and speak at all times as my conscience and my reverence for my vocation demands ."
"If I respect your beliefs , whatever they may be , I shall expect you to respect mine , Captain Oliver . ''"
"`` Oh , I wo n't insult your God , '' said the Captain with a faint sneer ."
Alan went home in a tumult of contending feelings .
"He did not altogether like Captain Anthony -- that was very clear to him , and yet there was something about the man that attracted him ."
"Intellectually he was a worthy foeman , and Alan had often longed for such since coming to Rexton ."
"He missed the keen , stimulating debates of his college days and , now there seemed a chance of renewing them , he was eager to grasp it ."
And Lynde -- how beautiful she was !
What though she shared -- as was not unlikely -- in her father 's lack of belief ?
She could not be essentially irreligious -- that were impossible in a true woman .
Might not this be his opportunity to help her -- to lead her into dearer light ?
"The fight lasted all day , and the prince 's strength was well-nigh spent , when the dragon , thinking that the victory was won , opened his jaws to give a roar of triumph ."
"The prince saw his chance , and before his foe could shut his mouth again had plunged his sword far down his adversary 's throat ."
"There was a desperate clutching of the claws to the earth , a slow flagging of the great wings , then the monster rolled over on his side and moved no more ."
Muffette was delivered .
After this they all went back to the palace .
"The marriage took place the following day , and Muffette and her husband lived happy for ever after ."
"The Adventures of Covan the Brown-Haired -LSB- From Les Contes des Fees , par Madame d'Aulnoy . -RSB-"
"On the shores of the west , where the great hills stand with their feet in the sea , dwelt a goatherd and his wife , together with their three sons and one daughter ."
"All day long the young men fished and hunted , while their sister took out the kids to pasture on the mountain , or stayed at home helping her mother and mending the nets ."
"For several years they all lived happily together , when one day , as the girl was out on the hill with the kids , the sun grew dark and an air cold as a thick white mist came creeping , creeping up from the sea ."
"She rose with a shiver , and tried to call to her kids , but the voice died away in her throat , and strong arms seemed to hold her ."
Loud were the wails in the hut by the sea when the hours passed on and the maiden came not .
"Many times the father and brothers jumped up , thinking they heard her steps , but in the thick darkness they could scarcely see their own hands , nor could they tell where the river lay , nor where the mountain ."
"One by one the kids came home , and at every bleat someone hurried to open the door , but no sound broke the stillness ."
"Through the night no one slept , and when morning broke and the mist rolled back , they sought the maiden by sea and by land , but never a trace of her could be found anywhere ."
"Thus a year and a day slipped by , and at the end of it Gorla of the Flocks and his wife seemed suddenly to have grown old ."
"Their sons too were sadder than before , for they loved their sister well , and had never ceased to mourn for her ."
"At length Ardan the eldest spoke and said : ` It is now a year and a day since our sister was taken from us , and we have waited in grief and patience for her to return ."
"Surely some evil has befallen her , or she would have sent us a token to put our hearts at rest ; and I have vowed to myself that my eyes shall not know sleep till , living or dead , I have found her . '"
"` If you have vowed , then must you keep your vow , ' answered Gorla ."
` But better had it been if you had first asked your father 's leave before you made it .
"Yet , since it is so , your mother will bake you a cake for you to carry with you on your journey ."
Who can tell how long it may be ? '
"So the mother arose and baked not one cake but two , a big one and a little one ."
"` Choose , my son , ' said she ."
"` Will you have the little cake with your mother 's blessing , or the big one without it , in that you have set aside your father and taken on yourself to make a vow ? ' '"
"I will have the large cake , ' answered the youth ; ` for what good would my mother 's blessing do for me if I was dying of hunger ? '"
And taking the big cake he went his way .
"Straight on he strode , letting neither hill nor river hinder him ."
Swiftly he walked -- swiftly as the wind that blew down the mountain .
"The eagles and the gulls looked on from their nests as he passed , leaving the deer behind him ; but at length he stopped , for hunger had seized on him , and he could walk no more ."
Trembling with fatigue he sat himself on a rock and broke a piece off his cake .
"`` Consider , '' cried Mrs. Finch , `` that when water gets into the nest it remains there and your little ones are drowned . ''"
"The thrushes begged Solomon with a look to say something crushing in reply to this , but again he was perplexed ."
"`` Try another drink , '' suggested Mrs. Finch pertly ."
"Kate was her name , and all Kates are saucy ."
"Solomon did try another drink , and it inspired him ."
"`` If , '' said he , `` a finch 's nest is placed on the Serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces , but a thrush 's nest is still as dry as the cup of a swan 's back . ''"
How the thrushes applauded !
"Now they knew why they lined their nests with mud , and when Mrs. Finch called out , `` We do n't place our nests on the Serpentine , '' they did what they should have done at first : chased her from the meeting ."
After this it was most orderly .
"What they had been brought together to hear , said Solomon , was this : their young friend , Peter Pan , as they well knew , wanted very much to be able to cross to the Gardens , and he now proposed , with their help , to build a boat ."
"At this the thrushes began to fidget , which made Peter tremble for his scheme ."
Solomon explained hastily that what he meant was not one of the cumbrous boats that humans use ; the proposed boat was to be simply a thrush 's nest large enough to hold Peter .
"But still , to Peter 's agony , the thrushes were sulky ."
"`` We are very busy people , '' they grumbled , `` and this would be a big job . ''"
"`` Quite so , '' said Solomon , `` and , of course , Peter would not allow you to work for nothing ."
"You must remember that he is now in comfortable circumstances , and he will pay you such wages as you have never been paid before ."
Peter Pan authorises me to say that you shall all be paid sixpence a day . ''
"Then all the thrushes hopped for joy , and that very day was begun the celebrated Building of the Boat ."
All their ordinary business fell into arrears .
"It was the time of year when they should have been pairing , but not a thrush 's nest was built except this big one , and so Solomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland ."
"The stout , rather greedy children , who look so well in perambulators but get puffed easily when they walk , were all young thrushes once , and ladies often ask specially for them ."
What do you think Solomon did ?
He sent over to the housetops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes ' nests and sent their young to the ladies and swore they were all thrushes !
"It was known afterward on the island as the Sparrows ' Year , and so , when you meet , as you doubtless sometimes do , grown-up people who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are , very likely they belong to that year ."
You ask them .
"Peter was a just master , and paid his work-people every evening ."
"They stood in rows on the branches , waiting politely while he cut the paper sixpences out of his bank-note , and presently he called the roll , and then each bird , as the names were mentioned , flew down and got sixpence ."
It must have been a fine sight .
"And at last , after months of labor , the boat was finished ."
"Oh , the deportment of Peter as he saw it growing more and more like a great thrush 's nest !"
"From the very beginning of the building of it he slept by its side , and often woke up to say sweet things to it , and after it was lined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it ."
"He sleeps in his nest still , and has a fascinating way of curling round in it , for it is just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round like a kitten ."
You ca n't conceive the effect of it .
"Brownie held out her arms to the Duke and he flung himself into them , the Queen leapt into the arms of the Lord Chamberlain , and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of her gentlemen , for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything ."
"Thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place , for if you leap into each other 's arms it is a fairy wedding ."
Of course a clergyman has to be present .
How the crowd cheered and leapt !
"Trumpets brayed , the moon came out , and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring ."
"Most gladsome sight of all , the Cupids plucked the hated fools ' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air ."
And then Maimie went and spoiled everything .
She could n't help it .
"She was crazy with delight over her little friend 's good fortune , so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy , `` Oh , Brownie , how splendid ! ''"
"Everybody stood still , the music ceased , the lights went out , and all in the time you may take to say `` Oh dear ! ''"
"An awful sense of her peril came upon Maimie , too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the gates , she heard the murmur of an angry multitude , she saw a thousand swords flashing for her blood , and she uttered a cry of terror and fled ."
How she ran !
and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head .
"Many times she lay down , and then quickly jumped up and ran on again ."
Her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she was in the Gardens .
"The one thing she was sure of was that she must never cease to run , and she thought she was still running long after she had dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep ."
She thought the snowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night .
"She thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket , and tried to pull it over her head ."
And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept .
But it was the fairies .
I am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief her .
When she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as `` Slay her ! ''
`` Turn her into something extremely unpleasant ! ''
"and so on , but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front , and this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and demand a boon ."
"Every bride has a right to a boon , and what she asked for was Maimie 's life ."
"`` Anything except that , '' replied Queen Mab sternly , and all the fairies chanted `` Anything except that . ''"
"But when they learned how Maimie had befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown , they gave three huzzas for the little human , and set off , like an army , to thank her , the court advancing in front and the canopy keeping step with it ."
They traced Maimie easily by her footprints in the snow .
"But though they found her deep in snow in the Figs , it seemed impossible to thank Maimie , for they could not waken her ."
"They went through the form of thanking her , that is to say , the new King stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome , but she heard not a word of it ."
"They also cleared the snow off her , but soon she was covered again , and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold ."
"`` Well , I reckon it 's about the blessed same to me , shipmate , '' he replied ; `` so it 's strong , and plenty of it , what 's the odds ? ''"
"`` All right , '' I answered ."
"`` I 'll bring you port , Mr. Hands ."
But I 'll have to dig for it . ''
"With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could , slipped off my shoes , ran quietly along the sparred gallery , mounted the forecastle ladder , and popped my head out of the fore companion ."
"I knew he would not expect to see me there , yet I took every precaution possible , and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true ."
"He had risen from his position to his hands and knees , and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved -- for I could hear him stifle a groan -- yet it was at a good , rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck ."
"In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked , out of a coil of rope , a long knife , or rather a short dirk , discoloured to the hilt with blood ."
"He looked upon it for a moment , thrusting forth his under jaw , tried the point upon his hand , and then , hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket , trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark ."
This was all that I required to know .
"Israel could move about , he was now armed , and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me , it was plain that I was meant to be the victim ."
"What he would do afterwards -- whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom , trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him -- was , of course , more than I could say ."
"Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point , since in that our interests jumped together , and that was in the disposition of the schooner ."
"We both desired to have her stranded safe enough , in a sheltered place , and so that , when the time came , she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be ; and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared ."
"While I was thus turning the business over in my mind , I had not been idle with my body ."
"I had stolen back to the cabin , slipped once more into my shoes , and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine , and now , with this for an excuse , I made my reappearance on the deck ."
"Hands lay as I had left him , all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light ."
"He looked up , however , at my coming , knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often , and took a good swig , with his favourite toast of `` Here 's luck ! ''"
"Then he lay quiet for a little , and then , pulling out a stick of tobacco , begged me to cut him a quid ."
"`` Cut me a junk o ' that , '' says he , `` for I have n't no knife and hardly strength enough , so be as I had ."
"Ah , Jim , Jim , I reckon I 've missed stays !"
"Cut me a quid , as 'll likely be the last , lad , for I 'm for my long home , and no mistake . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I 'll cut you some tobacco , but if I was you and thought myself so badly , I would go to my prayers like a Christian man . ''"
`` Why ? ''
said he .
"`` Now , you tell me why . ''"
`` Why ? ''
I cried .
`` You were asking me just now about the dead .
"You 've broken your trust ; you 've lived in sin and lies and blood ; there 's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment , and you ask me why !"
"For God 's mercy , Mr. Hands , that 's why . ''"
"I spoke with a little heat , thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed , in his ill thoughts , to end me with ."
"Dan felt they did not quite trust him , and never showed them his best side , but took a wilful pleasure in trying their patience and thwarting their hopes as far as he dared ."
"Mr. Bhaer did not approve of fighting , and did not think it a proof of either manliness or courage for two lads to pommel one another for the amusement of the rest ."
"All sorts of hardy games and exercises were encouraged , and the boys were expected to take hard knocks and tumbles without whining ; but black eyes and bloody noses given for the fun of it were forbidden as a foolish and a brutal play ."
"Dan laughed at this rule , and told such exciting tales of his own valor , and the many frays that he had been in , that some of the lads were fired with a desire to have a regular good `` mill . ''"
"`` Do n't tell , and I 'll show you how , '' said Dan ; and , getting half a dozen of the lads together behind the barn , he gave them a lesson in boxing , which quite satisfied the ardor of most of them ."
"Emil , however , could not submit to be beaten by a fellow younger than himself , for Emil was past fourteen and a plucky fellow , so he challenged Dan to a fight ."
"Dan accepted at once , and the others looked on with intense interest ."
"What little bird carried the news to head-quarters no one ever knew , but , in the very hottest of the fray , when Dan and Emil were fighting like a pair of young bulldogs , and the others with fierce , excited faces were cheering them on , Mr. Bhaer walked into the ring , plucked the combatants apart with a strong hand , and said , in the voice they seldom heard , `` I ca n't allow this , boys !"
Stop it at once ; and never let me see it again .
"I keep a school for boys , not for wild beasts ."
Look at each other and be ashamed of yourselves . ''
"`` You let me go , and I 'll knock him down again , '' shouted Dan , sparring away in spite of the grip on his collar ."
"`` Come on , come on , I ai n't thrashed yet ! ''"
"cried Emil , who had been down five times , but did not know when he was beaten ."
"`` They are playing be gladdy what-you-call - 'em s , like the Romans , Uncle Fritz , '' called out Demi , whose eyes were bigger than ever with the excitement of this new pastime ."
"`` They were a fine set of brutes ; but we have learned something since then , I hope , and I can not have you make my barn a Colosseum ."
Who proposed this ? ''
asked Mr. Bhaer .
"`` Dan , '' answered several voices ."
`` Do n't you know that it is forbidden ? ''
"`` Yes , '' growled Dan , sullenly ."
`` Then why break the rule ? ''
"`` They 'll all be molly-coddles , if they do n't know how to fight . ''"
`` Have you found Emil a molly-coddle ?
"He does n't look much like one , '' and Mr. Bhaer brought the two face to face ."
"Dan had a black eye , and his jacket was torn to rags , but Emil 's face was covered with blood from a cut lip and a bruised nose , while a bump on his forehead was already as purple as a plum ."
"In spite of his wounds however , he still glared upon his foe , and evidently panted to renew the fight ."
"`` He 'd make a first-rater if he was taught , '' said Dan , unable to withhold the praise from the boy who made it necessary for him to do his best ."
"`` He 'll be taught to fence and box by and by , and till then I think he will do very well without any lessons in mauling ."
"Go and wash your faces ; and remember , Dan , if you break any more of the rules again , you will be sent away ."
That was the bargain ; do your part and we will do ours . ''
"The lads went off , and after a few more words to the spectators , Mr. Bhaer followed to bind up the wounds of the young gladiators ."
"It certainly was a pleasant place , airy , clean , and bright ."
"A hop-vine shook its green bells round the open window , the pretty aquarium stood in the middle of the room , with some delicate water plants rising above the water , and gold-fish showing their brightness as they floated to and fro below ."
On either side of the window were rows of shelves ready to receive the curiosities yet to be found .
"Dan 's tall cabinet stood before the great door which was fastened up , while the small door was to be used ."
"On the cabinet stood a queer Indian idol , very ugly , but very interesting ; old Mr. Laurence sent it , as well as a fine Chinese junk in full sail , which had a conspicuous place on the long table in the middle of the room ."
"Above , swinging in a loop , and looking as if she was alive , hung Polly , who died at an advanced age , had been carefully stuffed , and was no presented by Mrs. Jo ."
The walls were decorated with all sorts of things .
"A snake 's skin , a big wasp 's nest , a birch-bark canoe , a string of birds ' eggs , wreaths of gray moss from the South , and a bunch of cotton-pods ."
"The dead bats had a place , also a large turtle-shell , and an ostrich-egg proudly presented by Demi , who volunteered to explain these rare curiosities to guests whenever they liked ."
"There were so many stones that it was impossible to accept them all , so only a few of the best were arranged among the shells on the shelves , the rest were piled up in corners , to be examined by Dan at his leisure ."
"Every one was eager to give something , even Silas , who sent home for a stuffed wild-cat killed in his youth ."
"It was rather moth-eaten and shabby , but on a high bracket and best side foremost the effect was fine , for the yellow glass eyes glared , and the mouth snarled so naturally , that Teddy shook in his little shoes at sight of it , when he came bringing his most cherished treasure , one cocoon , to lay upon the shrine of science ."
`` Is n't it beautiful ?
I 'd no idea we had so many curious things .
I gave that ; do n't it look well ?
We might make a lot by charging something for letting folks see it . ''
Jack added that last suggestion to the general chatter that went on as the family viewed the room .
"`` This is a free museum and if there is any speculating on it I 'll paint out the name over the door , '' said Mr. Laurie , turning so quickly that Jack wished he had held his tongue ."
`` Hear !
hear ! ''
cried Mr. Bhaer .
`` Speech !
speech ! ''
added Mrs. Jo .
"`` Ca n't , I 'm too bashful ."
"You give them a lecture yourself you are used to it , '' Mr. Laurie answered , retreating towards the window , meaning to escape ."
"But she held him fast , and said , laughing as she looked at the dozen pairs of dirty hands about her , `` If I did lecture , it would on the chemical and cleansing properties of soap ."
"Come now , as the founder of the institution , you really ought to give us a few moral remarks , and we will applaud tremendously . ''"
"Seeing that there was no way of escaping , Mr. Laurie looked up at Polly hanging overhead , seemed to find inspiration in the brilliant old bird , and sitting down upon the table , said , in his pleasant way , `` There is one thing I 'd like to suggest , boys , and that is , I want you to get some good as well as much pleasure out of this ."
"Just putting curious or pretty things here wo n't do it ; so suppose you read up about them , so that when anybody asks questions you can answer them , and understand the matter ."
"I used to like these things myself , and should enjoy hearing about them now , for I 've forgotten all I once knew ."
"It was n't much , was it , Jo ?"
After that he lay down and slept soundly .
"The sun was shining when he awoke , and he jumped up and ran to the pot ."
"The plant had disappeared and in its stead was a thick syrup , just as the book had said there would be ."
"He lifted the syrup out with a spoon , and after spreading it in the sun till it was partly dry , poured it into a small flask of crystal ."
"He next washed himself thoroughly , and dressed himself , in his best clothes , and putting the flask in his pocket , set out for the palace , and begged to see the king without delay ."
"Now Balancin , whose foot had been much less painful since Gilguerillo had wrapped it in the plaster , was counting the days to the young man 's return ; and when he was told Gilguerillo was there , ordered him to be admitted at once ."
"As he entered , the king raised himself eagerly on his pillows , but his face fell when he saw no signs of a slipper ."
"` You have failed , then ? '"
"he said , throwing up his hands in despair . '"
"I hope not , your majesty ; I think not , ' answered the youth ."
"And drawing the flask from his pocket , he poured two or three drops on the wound ."
"` Repeat this for three nights , and you will find yourself cured , ' said he ."
And before the king had time to thank him he had bowed himself out .
"Of course the news soon spread through the city , and men and women never tired of calling Gilguerillo an impostor , and prophesying that the end of the three days would see him in prison , if not on the scaffold ."
"But Gilguerillo paid no heed to their hard words , and no more did the king , who took care that no hand but his own should put on the healing balsam ."
On the fourth morning the king awoke and instantly stretched out his wounded foot that he might prove the truth or falsehood of Gilguerillo 's remedy .
"The wound was certainly cured on that side , but how about the other ?"
"Yes , that was cured also ; and not even a scar was left to show where it had been !"
Was ever any king so happy as Balancin when he satisfied himself of this ?
"Lightly as a deer he jumped from his bed , and began to turn head over heels and to perform all sorts of antics , so as to make sure that his foot was in truth as well as it looked ."
"And when he was quite tired he sent for his daughter , and bade the courtiers bring the lucky young man to his room ."
"` He is really young and handsome , ' said the princess to herself , heaving a sigh of relief that it was not some dreadful old man who had healed her father ; and while the king was announcing to his courtiers the wonderful cure that had been made , Diamantina was thinking that if Gilguerillo looked so well in his common dress , how much improved by the splendid garments of a king ' son ."
"However , she held her peace , and only watched with amusement when the courtiers , knowing there was no help for it , did homage and obeisance to the chemist 's boy ."
"Then they brought to Gilguerillo a magnificent tunic of green velvet bordered with gold , and a cap with three white plumes stuck in it ; and at the sight of him so arrayed , the princess fell in love with him in a moment ."
"The wedding was fixed to take place in eight days , and at the ball afterwards nobody danced so long or so lightly as king Balancin ."

-LSB- From AEventyr fra Zylland samlede og optegnede af Tang Kristensen .
Translated from the Danish by Mrs. Skavgaard-Pedersen . -RSB-
There was once an old couple named Peder and Kirsten who had an only son called Hans .
From the time he was a little boy he had been told that on his sixteenth birthday he must go out into the world and serve his apprenticeship .
"So , one fine summer morning , he started off to seek his fortune with nothing but the clothes he wore on his back ."
"For many hours he trudged on merrily , now and then stopping to drink from some clear spring or to pick some ripe fruit from a tree ."
"That is all we are , lookers-on ."
Nobody really wants us .
"So let us watch and say jaggy things , in the hope that some of them will hurt ."
The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there .
"When the children flew away , Mr. Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained Nana up , and that from first to last she had been wiser than he ."
"Of course , as we have seen , he was quite a simple man ; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off ; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion 's courage to do what seemed right to him ; and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children , he went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel ."
"To all Mrs. Darling 's dear invitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly : `` No , my own one , this is the place for me . ''"
In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kennel until his children came back .
"Of course this was a pity ; but whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess , otherwise he soon gave up doing it ."
"And there never was a more humble man than the once proud George Darling , as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and all their pretty ways ."
Very touching was his deference to Nana .
"He would not let her come into the kennel , but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly ."
"Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab , which conveyed him to his office , and he returned home in the same way at six ."
Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours : this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention .
"Inwardly he must have suffered torture ; but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his little home , and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked inside ."
"It may have been Quixotic , but it was magnificent ."
"Soon the inward meaning of it leaked out , and the great heart of the public was touched ."
"Crowds followed the cab , cheering it lustily ; charming girls scaled it to get his autograph ; interviews appeared in the better class of papers , and society invited him to dinner and added , `` Do come in the kennel . ''"
"On that eventful Thursday week , Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery awaiting George 's return home ; a very sad-eyed woman ."
"Now that we look at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days , all gone now just because she has lost her babes , I find I wo n't be able to say nasty things about her after all ."
"If she was too fond of her rubbishy children , she could n't help it ."
"Look at her in her chair , where she has fallen asleep ."
"The corner of her mouth , where one looks first , is almost withered up ."
Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there .
"Some like Peter best , and some like Wendy best , but I like her best ."
"Suppose , to make her happy , we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back ."
"They are really within two miles of the window now , and flying strong , but all we need whisper is that they are on the way ."
Let 's .
"It is a pity we did it , for she has started up , calling their names ; and there is no one in the room but Nana ."
"`` O Nana , I dreamt my dear ones had come back . ''"
"Nana had filmy eyes , but all she could do was put her paw gently on her mistress 's lap ; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was brought back ."
"As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife , we see that his face is more worn than of yore , but has a softer expression ."
"` Well , but I do n't see how I am to get to you , ' said the Stalo , looking up and down ."
"` Jump over , as I did , ' answered Andras ; ` it is quite easy . '"
"` But I could not jump this river ; and I do n't know how you did , ' replied the Stalo . '"
"I should be ashamed to say such things , ' exclaimed Andras ."
"` Do you mean to tell me that a jump , which the weakest Lapp boy would make nothing of , is beyond your strength ? '"
"The Stalo grew red and angry when he heard these words , just as Andras meant him to do ."
He bounded into the air and fell straight into the river .
"Not that that would have mattered , for he was a good swimmer ; but Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries , and took aim at him ."
"His aim was good , but the Stalo sprang so high into the air that the arrow flew between his feet ."
"A second shot , directed at his forehead , fared no better , for this time the Stalo jumped so high to the other side that the arrow passed between his finger and thumb ."
"Then Andras aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalo 's head , and when he sprang up , just an instant too soon , it hit him between the ribs ."
"Mortally wounded as he was , the Stalo was not yet dead , and managed to swim to the shore ."
"Stretching himself on the sand , he said slowly to Andras : ` Promise that you will give me an honourable burial , and when my body is laid in the grave go in my boat across the fiord , and take whatever you find in my house which belongs to me ."
"My dog you must kill , but spare my son , Andras . '"
Then he died ; and Andras sailed in his boat away across the fiord and found the dog and boy .
"The dog , a fierce , wicked-looking creature , he slew with one blow from his fist , for it is well known that if a Stalo 's dog licks the blood that flows from his dead master 's wounds the Stalo comes to life again ."
"That is why no REAL Stalo is ever seen without his dog ; but the bailiff , being only half a Stalo , had forgotten him , when he went to the little lakes in search of Andras ."
"Next , Andras put all the gold and jewels which he found in the boat into his pockets , and bidding the boy get in , pushed it off from the shore , leaving the little craft to drift as it would , while he himself ran home ."
"With the treasure he possessed he was able to buy a great herd of reindeer ; and he soon married a rich wife , whose parents would not have him as a son-in-law when he was poor , and the two lived happy for ever after ."
"The White Slipper -LSB- From Lapplandische Mahrchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-"
Once upon a time there lived a king who had a daughter just fifteen years old .
And what a daughter !
"Even the mothers who had daughters of their own could not help allowing that the princess was much more beautiful and graceful than any of them ; and , as for the fathers , if one of them ever beheld her by accident he could talk of nothing else for a whole day afterwards ."
"Of course the king , whose name was Balancin , was the complete slave of his little girl from the moment he lifted her from the arms of her dead mother ; indeed , he did not seem to know that there was anyone else in the world to love ."
"Now Diamantina , for that was her name , did not reach her fifteenth birthday without proposals for marriage from every country under heaven ; but be the suitor who he might , the king always said him nay ."
"Behind the palace a large garden stretched away to the foot of some hills , and more than one river flowed through ."
"Hither the princess would come each evening towards sunset , attended by her ladies , and gather herself the flowers that were to adorn her rooms ."
"She also brought with her a pair of scissors to cut off the dead blooms , and a basket to put them in , so that when the sun rose next morning he might see nothing unsightly ."
"When she had finished this task she would take a walk through the town , so that the poor people might have a chance of speaking with her , and telling her of their troubles ; and then she would seek out her father , and together they would consult over the best means of giving help to those who needed it ."
But what has all this to do with the White Slipper ?
my readers will ask .
"Have patience , and you will see ."
`` Tarry we no more . ''
"In the chancel they found Dick waiting , attended by a few young men ; and there were he and Joan united ."
"When they came forth again , happy and yet serious , into the frosty air and sunlight , the long files of the army were already winding forward up the road ; already the Duke of Gloucester 's banner was unfolded and began to move from before the abbey in a clump of spears ; and behind it , girt by steel-clad knights , the bold , black-hearted , and ambitious hunchback moved on towards his brief kingdom and his lasting infamy ."
"But the wedding party turned upon the other side , and sat down , with sober merriment , to breakfast ."
"The father cellarer attended on their wants , and sat with them at table ."
"Hamley , all jealousy forgotten , began to ply the nowise loth Alicia with courtship ."
"And there , amid the sounding of tuckets and the clash of armoured soldiery and horses continually moving forth , Dick and Joan sat side by side , tenderly held hands , and looked , with ever growing affection , in each other 's eyes ."
Thenceforth the dust and blood of that unruly epoch passed them by .
They dwelt apart from alarms in the green forest where their love began .
"Two old men in the meanwhile enjoyed pensions in great prosperity and peace , and with perhaps a superfluity of ale and wine , in Tunstall hamlet ."
"One had been all his life a shipman , and continued to the last to lament his man Tom ."
"The other , who had been a bit of everything , turned in the end towards piety , and made a most religious death under the name of Brother Honestus in the neighbouring abbey ."
"So Lawless had his will , and died a friar ."

_BOOK_TITLE_ : Robert_Louis_Stevenson___Treasure_Island.txt.out
"PART ONE -- The Old Buccaneer 1 The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow SQUIRE TRELAWNEY , Dr. Livesey , and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island , from the beginning to the end , keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island , and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted , I take up my pen in the year of grace 17 __ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof ."
"I remember him as if it were yesterday , as he came plodding to the inn door , his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow -- a tall , strong , heavy , nut-brown man , his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat , his hands ragged and scarred , with black , broken nails , and the sabre cut across one cheek , a dirty , livid white ."
"I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so , and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''"
"in the high , old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars ."
"Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried , and when my father appeared , called roughly for a glass of rum ."
"This , when it was brought to him , he drank slowly , like a connoisseur , lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard ."
"`` This is a handy cove , '' says he at length ; `` and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop ."
"Much company , mate ? ''"
"My father told him no , very little company , the more was the pity ."
"`` Well , then , '' said he , `` this is the berth for me ."
"Here you , matey , '' he cried to the man who trundled the barrow ; `` bring up alongside and help up my chest ."
"I 'll stay here a bit , '' he continued ."
"`` I 'm a plain man ; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want , and that head up there for to watch ships off ."
What you mought call me ?
You mought call me captain .
"Oh , I see what you 're at -- there '' ; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold ."
"You have got a conscience , though you are a little boy , and you must learn to mind it . ''"
"`` Well , my conscience did n't prick me a bit when she said ` Let 's get over the wall , ' '' answered Rob , quoting one of Demi 's expressions ."
`` Did you stop to see if it did ? ''
`` No . ''
`` Then you can not tell . ''
"`` I guess it 's such a little conscience that it do n't prick hard enough for me to feel it , '' added Rob , after thinking the matter over for a minute ."
`` We must sharpen it up .
"It 's bad to have a dull conscience ; so you may stay here till dinner-time , and talk about it with Nan ."
I trust you both not to untie yourselves till I say the word . ''
"`` No , we wo n't , '' said both , feeling a certain sense of virtue in helping to punish themselves ."
"For an hour they were very good , then they grew tired of one room , and longed to get out ."
"Never had the hall seemed so inviting ; even the little bedroom acquired a sudden interest , and they would gladly have gone in and played tent with the curtains of the best bed ."
"The open windows drove them wild because they could not reach them ; and the outer world seemed so beautiful , they wondered how they ever found the heart to say it was dull ."
"Nan pined for a race round the lawn , and Rob remembered with dismay that he had not fed his dog that morning , and wondered what poor Pollux would do ."
"They watched the clock , and Nan did some nice calculations in minutes and seconds , while Rob learned to tell all the hours between eight and one so well that he never forgot them ."
"It was maddening to smell the dinner , to know that there was to be succotash and huckleberry pudding , and to feel that they would not be on the spot to secure good helps of both ."
"When Mary Ann began to set the table , they nearly cut themselves in two trying to see what meat there was to be ; and Nan offered to help her make the beds , if she would only see that she had `` lots of sauce on her pudding . ''"
"When the boys came bursting out of school , they found the children tugging at their halters like a pair of restive little colts , and were much edified , as well as amused , by the sequel to the exciting adventures of the night ."
"`` Untie me now , Marmar ; my conscience will prick like a pin next time , I know it will , '' said Rob , as the bell rang , and Teddy came to look at him with sorrowful surprise ."
"`` We shall see , '' answered his mother , setting him free ."
"He took a good run down the hall , back through the dining-room , and brought up beside Nan , quite beaming with virtuous satisfaction ."
"`` I 'll bring her dinner to her , may I ? ''"
"he asked , pitying his fellow-captive ."
`` That 's my kind little son !
"Yes , pull out the table , and get a chair ; '' and Mrs. Jo hurried away to quell the ardor of the others , who were always in a raging state of hunger at noon ."
"Nan ate alone , and spent a long afternoon attached to the sofa ."
"Mrs. Bhaer lengthened her bonds so that she could look out of the window ; and there she stood watching the boys play , and all the little summer creatures enjoying their liberty ."
"Daisy had a picnic for the dolls on the lawn , so that Nan might see the fun if she could not join in it ."
"Tommy turned his best somersaults to console her ; Demi sat on the steps reading aloud to himself , which amused Nan a good deal ; and Dan brought a little tree-toad to show her as the most delicate attention in his power ."
But nothing atoned for the loss of freedom ; and a few hours of confinement taught Nan how precious it was .
A good many thoughts went through the little head that lay on the window-sill during the last quiet hour when all the children went to the brook to see Emil 's new ship launched .
"She was to have christened it , and had depended on smashing a tiny bottle of currant-wine over the prow as it was named Josephine in honor of Mrs. Bhaer ."
I do n't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person 's mind .
"Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you , and your own map can become intensely interesting , but catch them trying to draw a map of a child 's mind , which is not only confused , but keeps going round all the time ."
"There are zigzag lines on it , just like your temperature on a card , and these are probably roads in the island ; for the Neverland is always more or less an island , with astonishing splashes of colour here and there , and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing , and savages and lonely lairs , and gnomes who are mostly tailors , and caves through which a river runs , and princes with six elder brothers , and a hut fast going to decay , and one very small old lady with a hooked nose ."
"It would be an easy map if that were all ; but there is also first day at school , religion , fathers , the round pond , needlework , murders , hangings , verbs that take the dative , chocolate pudding day , getting into braces , say ninety-nine , three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself , and so on ; and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through , and it is all rather confusing , especially as nothing will stand still ."
Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal .
"John 's , for instance , had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting , while Michael , who was very small , had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it ."
"John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands , Michael in a wigwam , Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together ."
"John had no friends , Michael had friends at night , Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents ; but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance , and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other 's nose , and so forth ."
On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles .
"We too have been there ; we can still hear the sound of the surf , though we shall land no more ."
"Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact ; not large and sprawly , you know , with tedious distances between one adventure and another , but nicely crammed ."
"When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth , it is not in the least alarming , but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very nearly real ."
That is why there are night-lights .
"Occasionally in her travels through her children 's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand , and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter ."
"She knew of no Peter , and yet he was here and there in John and Michael 's minds , while Wendy 's began to be scrawled all over with him ."
"The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words , and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance ."
"` Yes , he is rather cocky , ' Wendy admitted with regret ."
Her mother had been questioning her .
"` But who is he , my pet ? '"
"` He is Peter Pan , you know , mother . '"
"At first Mrs. Darling did not know , but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies ."
"There were odd stories about him ; as that when children died he went part of the way with them , so that they should not be frightened ."
"She had believed in him at the time , but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person ."
"` Besides , ' she said to Wendy , ` he would be grown up by this time . '"
"` Oh no , he is n't grown up , ' Wendy assured her confidently , ` and he is just my size . '"
"She meant that he was her size in both mind and body ; she did n't know how she knew it , she just knew it ."
"Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling , but he smiled pooh-pooh ."
"` Mark my words , ' he said , ` it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads ; just the sort of idea a dog would have ."
"Leave it alone , and it will blow over . '"
But it would not blow over ; and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock .
Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them .
"For instance , they may remember to mention , a week after the event happened , that when they were in the wood they met their dead father and had a game with him ."
"There was something he wanted very much , but , though he knew he wanted it , he could not think what it was ."
"What he wanted so much was his mother to blow his nose , but that never struck him , so he decided to appeal to the fairies for enlightenment ."
They are reputed to know a good deal .
"There were two of them strolling along the Baby Walk , with their arms round each other 's waists , and he hopped down to address them ."
"The fairies have their tiffs with the birds , but they usually give a civil answer to a civil question , and he was quite angry when these two ran away the moment they saw him ."
"Another was lolling on a garden-chair , reading a postage-stamp which some human had let fall , and when he heard Peter 's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip ."
To Peter 's bewilderment he discovered that every fairy he met fled from him .
"A band of workmen , who were sawing down a toadstool , rushed away , leaving their tools behind them ."
A milkmaid turned her pail upside down and hid in it .
Soon the Gardens were in an uproar .
"Crowds of fairies were running this way and that , asking each other stoutly , who was afraid , lights were extinguished , doors barricaded , and from the grounds of Queen Mab 's palace came the rubadub of drums , showing that the royal guard had been called out ."
"A regiment of Lancers came charging down the Broad Walk , armed with holly-leaves , with which they jog the enemy horribly in passing ."
"Peter heard the little people crying everywhere that there was a human in the Gardens after Lock-out Time , but he never thought for a moment that he was the human ."
"He was feeling stuffier and stuffier , and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose , but he pursued them with the vital question in vain ; the timid creatures ran from him , and even the Lancers , when he approached them up the Hump , turned swiftly into a side-walk , on the pretence that they saw him there ."
"Despairing of the fairies , he resolved to consult the birds , but now he remembered , as an odd thing , that all the birds on the weeping beech had flown away when he alighted on it , and though that had not troubled him at the time , he saw its meaning now ."
Every living thing was shunning him .
"Poor little Peter Pan , he sat down and cried , and even then he did not know that , for a bird , he was sitting on his wrong part ."
"It is a blessing that he did not know , for otherwise he would have lost faith in his power to fly , and the moment you doubt whether you can fly , you cease forever to be able to do it ."
"The reason birds can fly and we ca n't is simply that they have perfect faith , for to have faith is to have wings ."
"Now , except by flying , no one can reach the island in the Serpentine , for the boats of humans are forbidden to land there , and there are stakes round it , standing up in the water , on each of which a bird-sentinel sits by day and night ."
"It was to the island that Peter now flew to put his strange case before old Solomon Caw , and he alighted on it with relief , much heartened to find himself at last at home , as the birds call the island ."
"All of them were asleep , including the sentinels , except Solomon , who was wide awake on one side , and he listened quietly to Peter 's adventures , and then told him their true meaning ."
"`` Look at your night-gown , if you do n't believe me , '' Solomon said , and with staring eyes Peter looked at his nightgown , and then at the sleeping birds ."
Not one of them wore anything .
`` How many of your toes are thumbs ? ''
"said Solomon a little cruelly , and Peter saw to his consternation , that all his toes were fingers ."
The shock was so great that it drove away his cold .
"`` Ruffle your feathers , '' said that grim old Solomon , and Peter tried most desperately hard to ruffle his feathers , but he had none ."
"Then he rose up , quaking , and for the first time since he stood on the window-ledge , he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him ."
"`` I think I shall go back to mother , '' he said timidly ."
"`` Good-bye , '' replied Solomon Caw with a queer look ."
But Peter hesitated .
"`` Yes , ma'am , '' said Dan , meekly , and looked a little scared by the serious tone of the last remarks , for he hated books , yet had evidently made up his mind to study anything she proposed ."
`` Do you see that cabinet with twelve drawers in it ? ''
was the next very unexpected question .
"Dan did see two tall old-fashioned ones standing on either side of the piano ; he knew them well , and had often seen nice bits of string , nails , brown paper , and such useful matters come out of the various drawers ."
He nodded and smiled .
"Mrs. Jo went on , `` Well , do n't you think those drawers would be good places to put your eggs , and stones , and shells , and lichens ? ''"
"`` Oh , splendid , but you would n't like my things ` clutterin ' round , ' as Mr. Page used to say , would you ? ''"
"cried Dan , sitting up to survey the old piece of furniture with sparkling eyes ."
"`` I like litter of that sort ; and if I did n't , I should give you the drawers , because I have a regard for children 's little treasures , and I think they should be treated respectfully ."
"Now , I am going to make a bargain with you , Dan , and I hope you will keep it honorably ."
"Here are twelve good-sized drawers , one for each month of the year , and they shall be yours as fast as you earn them , by doing the little duties that belong to you ."
"I believe in rewards of a certain kind , especially for young folks ; they help us along , and though we may begin by being good for the sake of the reward , if it is rightly used , we shall soon learn to love goodness for itself . ''"
`` Do you have 'em ? ''
"asked Dan , looking as if this was new talk for him ."
"`` Yes , indeed !"
I have n't learnt to get on without them yet .
"My rewards are not drawers , or presents , or holidays , but they are things which I like as much as you do the others ."
"The good behavior and success of my boys is one of the rewards I love best , and I work for it as I want you to work for your cabinet ."
"Do what you dislike , and do it well , and you get two rewards , one , the prize you see and hold ; the other , the satisfaction of a duty cheerfully performed ."
Do you understand that ? ''
"`` Yes , ma'am . ''"
"`` We all need these little helps ; so you shall try to do your lessons and your work , play kindly with all the boys , and use your holidays well ; and if you bring me a good report , or if I see and know it without words for I 'm quick to spy out the good little efforts of my boys you shall have a compartment in the drawer for your treasures ."
"See , some are already divided into four parts , and I will have the others made in the same way , a place for each week ; and when the drawer is filled with curious and pretty things , I shall be as proud of it as you are ; prouder , I think for in the pebbles , mosses , and gay butterflies , I shall see good resolutions carried out , conquered faults , and a promise well kept ."
"Shall we do this , Dan ? ''"
"The boys answered with one of the looks which said much , for it showed that he felt and understood her wish and words , although he did not know how to express his interest and gratitude for such care and kindness ."
"She understood the look , and seeing by the color that flushed up to his forehead that he was touched , as she wished him to be , she said no more about that side of the new plan , but pulled out the upper drawer , dusted it , and set it on two chairs before the sofa , saying briskly , `` Now , let us begin at once by putting those nice beetles in a safe place ."
"These compartments will hold a good deal , you see ."
"I 'd pin the butterflies and bugs round the sides ; they will be quite safe there , and leave room for the heavy things below ."
"I 'll give you some cotton wool , and clean paper and pins , and you can get ready for the week 's work . ''"
"`` But I ca n't go out to find any new things , '' said Dan , looking piteously at his foot ."
"`` That 's true ; never mind , we 'll let these treasures do for this week , and I dare say the boys will bring you loads of things if you ask them . ''"
"`` They do n't know the right sort ; besides , if I lay , no , lie here all the time , I ca n't work and study , and earn my drawers . ''"
"In the very article , comes Captain Hoseason with the story of your drowning ; whereupon all fell through ; with no consequences but concern to Mr. Campbell , injury to my pocket , and another blot upon your uncle 's character , which could very ill afford it ."
"And now , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you understand the whole process of these matters , and can judge for yourself to what extent I may be trusted . ''"
"Indeed he was more pedantic than I can represent him , and placed more scraps of Latin in his speech ; but it was all uttered with a fine geniality of eye and manner which went far to conquer my distrust ."
"Moreover , I could see he now treated me as if I was myself beyond a doubt ; so that first point of my identity seemed fully granted ."
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` if I tell you my story , I must commit a friend 's life to your discretion ."
"Pass me your word it shall be sacred ; and for what touches myself , I will ask no better guarantee than just your face . ''"
He passed me his word very seriously .
"`` But , '' said he , `` these are rather alarming prolocutions ; and if there are in your story any little jostles to the law , I would beg you to bear in mind that I am a lawyer , and pass lightly . ''"
"Thereupon I told him my story from the first , he listening with his spectacles thrust up and his eyes closed , so that I sometimes feared he was asleep ."
But no such matter !
he heard every word -LRB- as I found afterward -RRB- with such quickness of hearing and precision of memory as often surprised me .
"Even strange outlandish Gaelic names , heard for that time only , he remembered and would remind me of , years after ."
"Yet when I called Alan Breck in full , we had an odd scene ."
"The name of Alan had of course rung through Scotland , with the news of the Appin murder and the offer of the reward ; and it had no sooner escaped me than the lawyer moved in his seat and opened his eyes ."
"`` I would name no unnecessary names , Mr. Balfour , '' said he ; `` above all of Highlanders , many of whom are obnoxious to the law . ''"
"`` Well , it might have been better not , '' said I , `` but since I have let it slip , I may as well continue . ''"
"`` Not at all , '' said Mr. Rankeillor ."
"`` I am somewhat dull of hearing , as you may have remarked ; and I am far from sure I caught the name exactly ."
"We will call your friend , if you please , Mr. Thomson -- that there may be no reflections ."
"And in future , I would take some such way with any Highlander that you may have to mention -- dead or alive . ''"
"By this , I saw he must have heard the name all too clearly , and had already guessed I might be coming to the murder ."
"If he chose to play this part of ignorance , it was no matter of mine ; so I smiled , said it was no very Highland-sounding name , and consented ."
"Through all the rest of my story Alan was Mr. Thomson ; which amused me the more , as it was a piece of policy after his own heart ."
"James Stewart , in like manner , was mentioned under the style of Mr. Thomson 's kinsman ; Colin Campbell passed as a Mr. Glen ; and to Cluny , when I came to that part of my tale , I gave the name of `` Mr. Jameson , a Highland chief . ''"
"It was truly the most open farce , and I wondered that the lawyer should care to keep it up ; but , after all , it was quite in the taste of that age , when there were two parties in the state , and quiet persons , with no very high opinions of their own , sought out every cranny to avoid offence to either ."
"`` Well , well , '' said the lawyer , when I had quite done , `` this is a great epic , a great Odyssey of yours ."
"You must tell it , sir , in a sound Latinity when your scholarship is riper ; or in English if you please , though for my part I prefer the stronger tongue ."
You have rolled much ; quae regio in terris -- what parish in Scotland -LRB- to make a homely translation -RRB- has not been filled with your wanderings ?
"You have shown , besides , a singular aptitude for getting into false positions ; and , yes , upon the whole , for behaving well in them ."
"This Mr. Thomson seems to me a gentleman of some choice qualities , though perhaps a trifle bloody-minded ."
"It would please me none the worse , if -LRB- with all his merits -RRB- he were soused in the North Sea , for the man , Mr. David , is a sore embarrassment ."
"But you are doubtless quite right to adhere to him ; indubitably , he adhered to you ."
"He was mighty plainly habited , with a knitted nightcap drawn over his ears , and smoked a foul cutty pipe ."
"For all that he had the manners of a king , and it was quite a sight to see him rise out of his place to welcome us ."
"`` Well , Mr. Stewart , come awa ' , sir ! ''"
"said he , `` and bring in your friend that as yet I dinna ken the name of . ''"
"`` And how is yourself , Cluny ? ''"
said Alan .
"`` I hope ye do brawly , sir ."
"And I am proud to see ye , and to present to ye my friend the Laird of Shaws , Mr. David Balfour . ''"
"Alan never referred to my estate without a touch of a sneer , when we were alone ; but with strangers , he rang the words out like a herald ."
"`` Step in by , the both of ye , gentlemen , '' says Cluny ."
"`` I make ye welcome to my house , which is a queer , rude place for certain , but one where I have entertained a royal personage , Mr. Stewart -- ye doubtless ken the personage I have in my eye ."
"We 'll take a dram for luck , and as soon as this handless man of mine has the collops ready , we 'll dine and take a hand at the cartes as gentlemen should ."
"My life is a bit driegh , '' says he , pouring out the brandy ; `` I see little company , and sit and twirl my thumbs , and mind upon a great day that is gone by , and weary for another great day that we all hope will be upon the road ."
And so here 's a toast to ye : The Restoration ! ''
Thereupon we all touched glasses and drank .
"I am sure I wished no ill to King George ; and if he had been there himself in proper person , it 's like he would have done as I did ."
"No sooner had I taken out the drain than I felt hugely better , and could look on and listen , still a little mistily perhaps , but no longer with the same groundless horror and distress of mind ."
"It was certainly a strange place , and we had a strange host ."
"In his long hiding , Cluny had grown to have all manner of precise habits , like those of an old maid ."
"He had a particular place , where no one else must sit ; the Cage was arranged in a particular way , which none must disturb ; cookery was one of his chief fancies , and even while he was greeting us in , he kept an eye to the collops ."
"It appears , he sometimes visited or received visits from his wife and one or two of his nearest friends , under the cover of night ; but for the more part lived quite alone , and communicated only with his sentinels and the gillies that waited on him in the Cage ."
"The first thing in the morning , one of them , who was a barber , came and shaved him , and gave him the news of the country , of which he was immoderately greedy ."
"There was no end to his questions ; he put them as earnestly as a child ; and at some of the answers , laughed out of all bounds of reason , and would break out again laughing at the mere memory , hours after the barber was gone ."
"To be sure , there might have been a purpose in his questions ; for though he was thus sequestered , and like the other landed gentlemen of Scotland , stripped by the late Act of Parliament of legal powers , he still exercised a patriarchal justice in his clan ."
"Disputes were brought to him in his hiding-hole to be decided ; and the men of his country , who would have snapped their fingers at the Court of Session , laid aside revenge and paid down money at the bare word of this forfeited and hunted outlaw ."
"When he was angered , which was often enough , he gave his commands and breathed threats of punishment like any king ; and his gillies trembled and crouched away from him like children before a hasty father ."
"With each of them , as he entered , he ceremoniously shook hands , both parties touching their bonnets at the same time in a military manner ."
"Altogether , I had a fair chance to see some of the inner workings of a Highland clan ; and this with a proscribed , fugitive chief ; his country conquered ; the troops riding upon all sides in quest of him , sometimes within a mile of where he lay ; and when the least of the ragged fellows whom he rated and threatened , could have made a fortune by betraying him ."
"On that first day , as soon as the collops were ready , Cluny gave them with his own hand a squeeze of a lemon -LRB- for he was well supplied with luxuries -RRB- and bade us draw in to our meal ."
"`` They , '' said he , meaning the collops , `` are such as I gave his Royal Highness in this very house ; bating the lemon juice , for at that time we were glad to get the meat and never fashed for kitchen ."
"* Indeed , there were mair dragoons than lemons in my country in the year forty-six . ''"
* Condiment .
"But there was one recess in the wall , no larger than a bird-cage , which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell ."
"It could be shut off from the rest of the home by a tiny curtain , which Tink , who was most fastidious , always kept drawn when dressing or undressing ."
"No woman , however large , could have had a more exquisite boudoir and bedchamber combined ."
"The couch , as she always called it , was a genuine Queen Mab , with club legs ; and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in season ."
"Her mirror was a Puss-in-boots , of which there are now only three , unchipped , known to the fairy dealers ; the wash-stand was Pie-crust and reversible , the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth , and the carpet and rugs of the best -LRB- the early -RRB- period of Margery and Robin ."
"There was a chandelier from Tiddly winks for the look of the thing , but of course she lit the residence herself ."
"Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house , as indeed was perhaps inevitable ; and her chamber , though beautiful , looked rather conceited , having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up ."
"I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy , because those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do ."
"Really there were whole weeks when , except perhaps with a stocking in the evening , she was never above ground ."
"The cooking , I can tell you , kept her nose to the pot ."
"Their chief food was roasted breadfruit , yams , cocoa-nuts , baked pig , mammee-apples , tappa rolls and bananas , washed down with calabashes of poe-poe ; but you never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe , it all depended upon Peter 's whim ."
"He could eat , really eat , if it was part of a game , but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy , which is what most children like better than anything else ; the next best thing being to talk about it ."
Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder .
"Of course it was trying , but you simply had to follow his lead , and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge ."
Wendy 's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed .
"Then , as she expressed it , she had a breathing time for herself ; and she occupied it in making new things for them , and putting double pieces on the knees , for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees ."
"At this high-handed proceeding , and the threat which accompanied it , Jack 's patience gave out , and catching up Caesar , as he thought , sent him flying after the retreating tyrant with the defiant declaration , -- `` Keep them , then , and your old book , too !"
I wo n't look at it till you give all my stamps back and say you are sorry .
So now ! ''
"It was all over before Mamma could interfere , or Jill do more than clutch and cling to the gum-brush ."
"Frank vanished unharmed , but the poor book dashed against the wall to fall half open on the floor , its gay cover loosened , and its smooth leaves crushed by the blow ."
`` It 's the album !
"O Jack , how could you ? ''"
"cried Jill , dismayed at sight of the precious book so maltreated by the owner ."
`` Thought it was the other .
Guess it is n't hurt much .
"Did n't mean to hit him , any way ."
"He does provoke me so , '' muttered Jack , very red and shamefaced as his mother picked up the book and laid it silently on the table before him ."
"He did not know what to do with himself , and was thankful for the stamps still left him , finding great relief in making faces as he plucked them one by one from his mortified countenance ."
"Jill looked on , half glad , half sorry that her savage showed such signs of unconverted ferocity , and Mrs. Minot went on writing letters , wearing the grave look her sons found harder to bear than another person 's scolding ."
"No one spoke for a moment , and the silence was becoming awkward when Gus appeared in a rubber suit , bringing a book to Jack from Laura and a note to Jill from Lotty ."
"`` Look here , you just trundle me into my den , please , I 'm going to have a nap , it 's so dull to-day I do n't feel like doing much , '' said Jack , when Gus had done his errands , trying to look as if he knew nothing about the fracas ."
"I shall be sure to come to grief , and then every one will say , ' I told you so , ' and that is so provoking ."
I 'd rather keep still a week longer .
Had n't I better ? ''
"His mother smiled and nodded as she said , sewing away at much-abused old Caesar , as if she loved him , `` Do as you think best , dear ."
"I always want you at home , but I do n't wonder you are rather tired of it after this long confinement . ''"
"`` I say , Jill , should I be in your way if I did n't go to school till the first of February ? ''"
"called Jack , laughing to himself at the absurdity of the question ."
`` Not much ! ''
"answered a glad voice from behind the screen , and he knew the sorrowful eyes were shining with delight , though he could not see them ."
"`` Well , I guess I may as well , and get quite firm on my legs before I start ."
"Another week or so will bring me up if I study hard , so I shall not lose my time ."
"I 'll tackle my Latin as soon as it 's ready , mother . ''"
"Jack got a hearty kiss with the neatly covered book , and Mamma loved him for the little sacrifice more than if he had won a prize at school ."
"He did get a reward , for , in five minutes from the time he decided , Jill was singing like a bobolink , and such a medley of merry music came from behind the screen , that it was a regular morning concert ."
"She did not know then that he stayed for her sake , but she found it out soon after , and when the time came did as much for him , as we shall see ."
"It proved a wise decision , for the last part of January was so stormy Jack could not have gone half the time ."
"So , while the snow drifted , and bitter winds raged , he sat snugly at home amusing Jill , and getting on bravely with his lessons , for Frank took great pains with him to show his approbation of the little kindness , and , somehow , the memory of it seemed to make even the detested Latin easier ."
"With February fair weather set in , and Jack marched happily away to school , with Jill 's new mittens on his hands , Mamma nodding from the door-step , and Frank ready to give him a lift on the new sled , if the way proved too long or too rough ."
"`` I shall not have time to miss him now , for we are to be very busy getting ready for the Twenty-second ."
"The Dramatic Club meets to-night , and would like to come here , if they may , so I can help ? ''"
"said Jill , as Mrs. Minot came up , expecting to find her rather low in her mind ."
"`` Certainly ; and I have a basket of old finery I looked up for the club when I was rummaging out bits of silk for your blue quilt , '' answered the good lady , who had set up a new employment to beguile the hours of Jack 's absence ."
"When the girls arrived , that evening , they found Mrs. Chairwoman surrounded by a strew of theatrical properties , enjoying herself very much ."
"All brought such contributions as they could muster , and all were eager about a certain tableau which was to be the gem of the whole , they thought ."
"Jill , of course , was not expected to take any part , but her taste was good , so all consulted her as they showed their old silks , laces , and flowers , asking who should be this , and who that ."
"All wanted to be the `` Sleeping Beauty , '' for that was the chosen scene , with the slumbering court about the princess , and the prince in the act of awakening her ."
"Jack was to be the hero , brave in his mother 's velvet cape , red boots , and a real sword , while the other boys were to have parts of more or less splendor ."
"`` Mabel should be the Beauty , because her hair is so lovely , '' said Juliet , who was quite satisfied with her own part of the Queen ."
"`` No , Merry ought to have it , as she is the prettiest , and has that splendid veil to wear , '' answered Molly , who was to be the maid of honor , cuffing the little page , Boo ."
"`` I do n't care a bit , but my feather would be fine for the Princess , and I do n't know as Emma would like to have me lend it to any one else , '' said Annette , waving a long white plume over her head , with girlish delight in its grace ."
"`` I should think the white silk dress , the veil , and the feather ought to go together , with the scarlet crape shawl and these pearls ."
"That would be sweet , and just what princesses really wear , '' advised Jill , who was stringing a quantity of old Roman pearls ."
Judging from her expression she was very well satisfied with herself .
"A pale little thing , with smooth ripples of fine , silky , fawn-colored hair flowing over her shoulders , must , Anne thought , be Annetta Bell , whose parents had formerly lived in the Newbridge school district , but , by reason of hauling their house fifty yards north of its old site were now in Avonlea ."
"Three pallid little girls crowded into one seat were certainly Cottons ; and there was no doubt that the small beauty with the long brown curls and hazel eyes , who was casting coquettish looks at Jack Gills over the edge of her Testament , was Prillie Rogerson , whose father had recently married a second wife and brought Prillie home from her grandmother 's in Grafton ."
"A tall , awkward girl in a back seat , who seemed to have too many feet and hands , Anne could not place at all , but later on discovered that her name was Barbara Shaw and that she had come to live with an Avonlea aunt ."
She was also to find that if Barbara ever managed to walk down the aisle without falling over her own or somebody else 's feet the Avonlea scholars wrote the unusual fact up on the porch wall to commemorate it .
"But when Anne 's eyes met those of the boy at the front desk facing her own , a queer little thrill went over her , as if she had found her genius ."
She knew this must be Paul Irving and that Mrs. Rachel Lynde had been right for once when she prophesied that he would be unlike the Avonlea children .
"More than that , Anne realized that he was unlike other children anywhere , and that there was a soul subtly akin to her own gazing at her out of the very dark blue eyes that were watching her so intently ."
She knew Paul was ten but he looked no more than eight .
"He had the most beautiful little face she had ever seen in a child ... features of exquisite delicacy and refinement , framed in a halo of chestnut curls ."
"His mouth was delicious , being full without pouting , the crimson lips just softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners that narrowly escaped being dimpled ."
"He had a sober , grave , meditative expression , as if his spirit was much older than his body ; but when Anne smiled softly at him it vanished in a sudden answering smile , which seemed an illumination of his whole being , as if some lamp had suddenly kindled into flame inside of him , irradiating him from top to toe ."
"Best of all , it was involuntary , born of no external effort or motive , but simply the outflashing of a hidden personality , rare and fine and sweet ."
With a quick interchange of smiles Anne and Paul were fast friends forever before a word had passed between them .
The day went by like a dream .
Anne could never clearly recall it afterwards .
It almost seemed as if it were not she who was teaching but somebody else .
She heard classes and worked sums and set copies mechanically .
The children behaved quite well ; only two cases of discipline occurred .
Morley Andrews was caught driving a pair of trained crickets in the aisle .
Anne stood Morley on the platform for an hour and ... which Morley felt much more keenly ... confiscated his crickets .
"She put them in a box and on the way from school set them free in Violet Vale ; but Morley believed , then and ever afterwards , that she took them home and kept them for her own amusement ."
"The other culprit was Anthony Pye , who poured the last drops of water from his slate bottle down the back of Aurelia Clay 's neck ."
"Anne kept Anthony in at recess and talked to him about what was expected of gentlemen , admonishing him that they never poured water down ladies ' necks ."
"She wanted all her boys to be gentlemen , she said ."
Her little lecture was quite kind and touching ; but unfortunately Anthony remained absolutely untouched .
"He listened to her in silence , with the same sullen expression , and whistled scornfully as he went out ."
"Anne sighed ; and then cheered herself up by remembering that winning a Pye 's affections , like the building of Rome , was n't the work of a day ."
"In fact , it was doubtful whether some of the Pyes had any affections to win ; but Anne hoped better things of Anthony , who looked as if he might be a rather nice boy if one ever got behind his sullenness ."
When school was dismissed and the children had gone Anne dropped wearily into her chair .
Her head ached and she felt woefully discouraged .
"There was no real reason for discouragement , since nothing very dreadful had occurred ; but Anne was very tired and inclined to believe that she would never learn to like teaching ."
"`` One other fellow , '' after a pause ."
"`` Yes , I understand ; '' and Mr. Acton 's eye glanced at Joe with a look that seemed to say , `` I wish he 'd held his tongue . ''"
"A queer smile flitted over Jack 's face , for Joe was not the `` other fellow , '' and knew very little about it , excepting what he had seen when he was sent on an errand by Mr. Acton on Friday ."
"`` I wish you would explain the matter , John , for I am sure it is better than it seems , and it would be very hard to punish you when you do n't deserve it . ''"
"`` But I do deserve it ; I 've broken the rule , and I ought to be punished , '' said Jack , as if a good whipping would be easier to bear than this public cross-examination ."
"`` And you ca n't explain , or even say you are sorry or ashamed ? ''"
"asked Mr. Acton , hoping to surprise another fact out of the boy ."
"`` No , sir ; I ca n't ; I 'm not ashamed ; I 'm not sorry , and I 'd do it again to-morrow if I had to , '' cried Jack , losing patience , and looking as if he would not bear much more ."
"A groan from the boys greeted this bare-faced declaration , and Susy quite shivered at the idea of having taken two bites out of the apple of such a hardened desperado ."
"`` Think it over till to-morrow , and perhaps you will change your mind ."
"Remember that this is the last week of the month , and reports are given out next Friday , '' said Mr. Acton , knowing how much the boy prided himself on always having good ones to show his mother ."
"Poor Jack turned scarlet and bit his lips to keep them still , for he had forgotten this when he plunged into the affair which was likely to cost him dear ."
"Then the color faded away , the boyish face grew steady , and the honest eyes looked up at his teacher as he said very low , but all heard him , the room was so still , -- `` It is n't as bad as it looks , sir , but I ca n't say any more ."
"No one is to blame but me ; and I could n't help breaking the rule , for Jerry was going away , I had only that time , and I 'd promised to pay up , so I did . ''"
"Mr. Acton believed every word he said , and regretted that they had not been able to have it out privately , but he , too , must keep his promise and punish the offender , whoever he was ."
"`` Very well , you will lose your recess for a week , and this month 's report will be the first one in which behavior does not get the highest mark ."
You may go ; and I wish it understood that Master Minot is not to be troubled with questions till he chooses to set this matter right . ''
"Then the bell rang , the children trooped out , Mr. Acton went off without another word , and Jack was left alone to put up his books and hide a few tears that would come because Frank turned his eyes away from the imploring look cast upon him as the culprit came down from the platform , a disgraced boy ."
"Elder brothers are apt to be a little hard on younger ones , so it is not surprising that Frank , who was an eminently proper boy , was much cut up when Jack publicly confessed to dealings with Jerry , leaving it to be supposed that the worst half of the story remained untold ."
"He felt it his duty , therefore , to collar poor Jack when he came out , and talk to him all the way home , like a judge bent on getting at the truth by main force ."
"A kind word would have been very comforting , but the scolding was too much for Jack 's temper , so he turned dogged and would not say a word , though Frank threatened not to speak to him for a week ."
"At tea-time both boys were very silent , one looking grim , the other excited ."
"Frank stared sternly at his brother across the table , and no amount of marmalade sweetened or softened that reproachful look ."
"Jack defiantly crunched his toast , with occasional slashes at the butter , as if he must vent the pent-up emotions which half distracted him ."
"Of course , their mother saw that something was amiss , but did not allude to it , hoping that the cloud would blow over as so many did if left alone ."
"But this one did not , and when both refused cake , this sure sign of unusual perturbation made her anxious to know the cause ."
"As soon as tea was over , Jack retired with gloomy dignity to his own room , and Frank , casting away the paper he had been pretending to read , burst out with the whole story ."
"Mrs. Minot was as much surprised as he , but not angry , because , like most mothers , she was sure that her sons could not do anything very bad ."
"`` I will speak to him ; my boy wo n't refuse to give me some explanation , '' she said , when Frank had freed his mind with as much warmth as if Jack had broken all the ten commandments ."
`` He will .
"You often call me obstinate , but he is as pig-headed as a mule ; Joe only knows what he saw , old tell-tale !"
"and Jerry has left town , or I 'd have it out of him ."
"Even after she was gone , we had nothing to say , as indeed nothing was enough for such a kindness ."
Only Alan stood a great while upon the shore shaking his head .
"`` It is a very fine lass , '' he said at last ."
"`` David , it is a very fine lass . ''"
"And a matter of an hour later , as we were lying in a den on the sea-shore and I had been already dozing , he broke out again in commendations of her character ."
"For my part , I could say nothing , she was so simple a creature that my heart smote me both with remorse and fear : remorse because we had traded upon her ignorance ; and fear lest we should have anyway involved her in the dangers of our situation ."
"CHAPTER XXVII I COME TO MR. RANKEILLOR The next day it was agreed that Alan should fend for himself till sunset ; but as soon as it began to grow dark , he should lie in the fields by the roadside near to Newhalls , and stir for naught until he heard me whistling ."
"At first I proposed I should give him for a signal the `` Bonnie House of Airlie , '' which was a favourite of mine ; but he objected that as the piece was very commonly known , any ploughman might whistle it by accident ; and taught me instead a little fragment of a Highland air , which has run in my head from that day to this , and will likely run in my head when I lie dying ."
"Every time it comes to me , it takes me off to that last day of my uncertainty , with Alan sitting up in the bottom of the den , whistling and beating the measure with a finger , and the grey of the dawn coming on his face ."
I was in the long street of Queensferry before the sun was up .
"It was a fairly built burgh , the houses of good stone , many slated ; the town-hall not so fine , I thought , as that of Peebles , nor yet the street so noble ; but take it altogether , it put me to shame for my foul tatters ."
"As the morning went on , and the fires began to be kindled , and the windows to open , and the people to appear out of the houses , my concern and despondency grew ever the blacker ."
"I saw now that I had no grounds to stand upon ; and no clear proof of my rights , nor so much as of my own identity ."
"If it was all a bubble , I was indeed sorely cheated and left in a sore pass ."
"Even if things were as I conceived , it would in all likelihood take time to establish my contentions ; and what time had I to spare with less than three shillings in my pocket , and a condemned , hunted man upon my hands to ship out of the country ?"
"Truly , if my hope broke with me , it might come to the gallows yet for both of us ."
"And as I continued to walk up and down , and saw people looking askance at me upon the street or out of windows , and nudging or speaking one to another with smiles , I began to take a fresh apprehension : that it might be no easy matter even to come to speech of the lawyer , far less to convince him of my story ."
"For the life of me I could not muster up the courage to address any of these reputable burghers ; I thought shame even to speak with them in such a pickle of rags and dirt ; and if I had asked for the house of such a man as Mr. Rankeillor , I suppose they would have burst out laughing in my face ."
"So I went up and down , and through the street , and down to the harbour-side , like a dog that has lost its master , with a strange gnawing in my inwards , and every now and then a movement of despair ."
"It grew to be high day at last , perhaps nine in the forenoon ; and I was worn with these wanderings , and chanced to have stopped in front of a very good house on the landward side , a house with beautiful , clear glass windows , flowering knots upon the sills , the walls new-harled * and a chase-dog sitting yawning on the step like one that was at home ."
"Well , I was even envying this dumb brute , when the door fell open and there issued forth a shrewd , ruddy , kindly , consequential man in a well-powdered wig and spectacles ."
"I was in such a plight that no one set eyes on me once , but he looked at me again ; and this gentleman , as it proved , was so much struck with my poor appearance that he came straight up to me and asked me what I did ."
* Newly rough-cast .
"I told him I was come to the Queensferry on business , and taking heart of grace , asked him to direct me to the house of Mr. Rankeillor ."
"`` Why , '' said he , `` that is his house that I have just come out of ; and for a rather singular chance , I am that very man . ''"
"`` Then , sir , '' said I , `` I have to beg the favour of an interview . ''"
"`` I do not know your name , '' said he , `` nor yet your face . ''"
"`` My name is David Balfour , '' said I. `` David Balfour ? ''"
"he repeated , in rather a high tone , like one surprised ."
"`` And where have you come from , Mr. David Balfour ? ''"
"he asked , looking me pretty drily in the face ."
"`` I have come from a great many strange places , sir , '' said I ; `` but I think it would be as well to tell you where and how in a more private manner . ''"
"The fairies take an hour longer in the morning , the beasts attend to their young , the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights , and when pirates and lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other ."
"But with the coming of Peter , who hates lethargy , they are all under way again : if you put your ear to the ground now , you would hear the whole island seething with life ."
On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows .
"The lost boys were out looking for Peter , the pirates were out looking for the lost boys , the redskins were out looking for the pirates , and the beasts were out looking for the redskins ."
"They were going round and round the island , but they did not meet because all were going at the same rate ."
"All wanted blood except the boys , who liked it as a rule , but to-night were out to greet their captain ."
"The boys on the island vary , of course , in numbers , according as they get killed and so on ; and when they seem to be growing up , which is against the rules , Peter thins them out ; but at this time there were six of them , counting the twins as two ."
"Let us pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file , each with his hand on his dagger ."
"They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him , and they wear the skins of bears slain by themselves , in which they are so round and furry that when they fall they roll ."
They have therefore become very sure-footed .
"The first to pass is Tootles , not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band ."
"He had been in fewer adventures than any of them , because the big things constantly happened just when he had stepped round the corner ; all would be quiet , he would take the opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood , and then when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood ."
"This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance , but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it , so that he was quite the humblest of the boys ."
"Poor kind Tootles , there is danger in the air for you to-night ."
"Take care lest an adventure is now offered you , which , if accepted , will plunge you in deepest woe ."
"Tootles , the fairy Tink who is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool , and she thinks you the most easily tricked of the boys ."
` Ware Tinker Bell .
"Would that he could hear us , but we are not really on the island , and he passes by , biting his knuckles ."
"Next comes Nibs , the gay and debonair , followed by Slightly , who cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes ."
Slightly is the most conceited of the boys .
"He thinks he remembers the days before he was lost , with their manners and customs , and this has given his nose an offensive tilt ."
"Curly is fourth ; he is a pickle , and so often has he had to deliver up his person when Peter said sternly , ` Stand forth the one who did this thing , ' that now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it or not ."
"Last come the Twins , who can not be described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one ."
"Peter never quite knew what twins were , and his band were not allowed to know anything he did not know , so these two were always vague about themselves , and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way ."
"The boys vanish in the gloom , and after a pause , but not a long pause , for things go briskly on the island , come the pirates on their track ."
"We hear them before they are seen , and it is always the same dreadful song : ` Avast belay , yo ho , heave to , A-pirating we go , And if we 're parted by a shot We 're sure to meet below ! '"
A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock .
"Here , a little in advance , ever and again with his head to the ground listening , his great arms bare , pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments , is the handsome Italian Cecco , who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao ."
That gigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the Guadjo-mo .
"Here is Bill Jukes , every inch of him tattooed , the same Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the Walrus from Flint before he would drop the bag of moidores ; and Cookson , said to be Black Murphy 's brother -LRB- but this was never proved -RRB- ; and Gentleman Starkey , once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways of killing ; and Skylights -LRB- Morgan 's Skylights -RRB- ; and the Irish bo ` sun Smee , an oddly genial man who stabbed , so to speak , without offence , and was the only Nonconformist in Hook 's crew ; and Noodler , whose hands were fixed on backwards ; and Robt ."
Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on the Spanish Main .
"In the midst of them , the blackest and largest jewel in that dark setting , reclined James Hook , or as he wrote himself , Jas ."
"First the kits , who rushed at the bowl and thrust their heads in , lapping as if for a wager ; then the cats , who each went to one of the four piles of scraps laid round at intervals and placidly ate their meat ; while Molly retired to the basket , to ponder over the phenomena taking place in the house ."
She could not imagine what had started the old lady .
"It was not the example of her neighbors , who had beaten carpets and scrubbed paint every spring for years without exciting her to any greater exertion than cleaning a few windows and having a man to clear away the rubbish displayed when the snow melted ."
"Molly never guessed that her own efforts were at the bottom of the change , or knew that a few words not meant for her ear had shamed Miss Bat into action ."
"Coming home from prayer-meeting one dark night , she trotted along behind two old ladies who were gossiping in loud voices , as one was rather deaf , and Miss Bat was both pleased and troubled to hear herself unduly praised ."
"`` I always said Sister Dawes meant well ; but she 's getting into years , and the care of two children is a good deal for her , with her cooking and her rheumatiz ."
"I do n't deny she did neglect 'em for a spell , but she does well by 'em now , and I would n't wish to see better-appearing children . ''"
`` You 've no idee how improved Molly is .
"She came in to see my girls , and brought her sewing-work , shirts for the boy , and done it as neat and capable as you 'd wish to see ."
"She always was a smart child , but dreadful careless , '' said the other old lady , evidently much impressed by the change in harum-scarum Molly Loo ."
"`` Being over to Mis Minot 's so much has been good for her , and up to Mis Grant 's ."
"Girls catch neat ways as quick as they do untidy ones , and them wild little tykes often turn out smart women . ''"
"`` Sister Dawes has done well by them children , and I hope Mr. Bemis sees it ."
He ought to give her something comfortable to live on when she ca n't do for him any longer .
He can well afford it . ''
`` I have n't a doubt he will .
"He 's a lavish man when he starts to do a thing , but dreadful unobserving , else he 'd have seen to matters long ago ."
"Them children was town-talk last fall , and I used to feel as if it was my bounden duty to speak to Miss Dawes ."
"But I never did , fearing I might speak too plain , and hurt her feelings . ''"
"`` You 've spoken plain enough now , and I 'm beholden to you , though you 'll never know it , '' said Miss Bat to herself , as she slipped into her own gate , while the gossips trudged on quite unconscious of the listener behind them ."
"Miss Bat was a worthy old soul in the main , only , like so many of us , she needed rousing up to her duty ."
"She had got the rousing now , and it did her good , for she could not bear to be praised when she had not deserved it ."
"She had watched Molly 's efforts with lazy interest , and when the girl gave up meddling with her affairs , as she called the housekeeping , Miss Bat ceased to oppose her , and let her scrub Boo , mend clothes , and brush her hair as much as she liked ."
"So Molly had worked along without any help from her , running in to Mrs. Pecq for advice , to Merry for comfort , or Mrs. Minot for the higher kind of help one often needs so much ."
"Now Miss Bat found that she was getting the credit and the praise belonging to other people , and it stirred her up to try and deserve a part at least ."
"`` Molly do n't want any help about her work or the boy : it 's too late for that ; but if this house do n't get a spring cleaning that will make it shine , my name ai n't Bathsheba Dawes , '' said the old lady , as she put away her bonnet that night , and laid energetic plans for a grand revolution , inspired thereto not only by shame , but by the hint that `` Mr. Bemis was a lavish man , '' as no one knew better than she ."
"Molly 's amazement next day at seeing carpets fly out of window , ancient cobwebs come down , and long-undisturbed closets routed out to the great dismay of moths and mice , has been already confided to the cats , and as she sat there watching them lap and gnaw , she said to herself , -- `` I do n't understand it , but as she never says much to me about my affairs , I wo n't take any notice till she gets through , then I 'll admire everything all I can ."
It is so pleasant to be praised after you 've been trying hard . ''
"She might well say that , for she got very little herself , and her trials had been many , her efforts not always successful , and her reward seemed a long way off ."
"Poor Boo could have sympathized with her , for he had suffered much persecution from his small schoolmates when he appeared with large gray patches on the little brown trousers , where he had worn them out coasting down those too fascinating steps ."
"As he could not see the patches himself , he fancied them invisible , and came home much afflicted by the jeers of his friends ."
"Then Molly tried to make him a new pair out of a sack of her own ; but she cut both sides for the same leg , so one was wrong side out ."
So that night Alan carried down his fiery cross and set it in the bouman 's window .
He was troubled when he came back ; for the dogs had barked and the folk run out from their houses ; and he thought he had heard a clatter of arms and seen a red-coat come to one of the doors .
"On all accounts we lay the next day in the borders of the wood and kept a close look-out , so that if it was John Breck that came we might be ready to guide him , and if it was the red-coats we should have time to get away ."
"About noon a man was to be spied , straggling up the open side of the mountain in the sun , and looking round him as he came , from under his hand ."
No sooner had Alan seen him than he whistled ; the man turned and came a little towards us : then Alan would give another `` peep ! ''
"and the man would come still nearer ; and so by the sound of whistling , he was guided to the spot where we lay ."
"He was a ragged , wild , bearded man , about forty , grossly disfigured with the small pox , and looked both dull and savage ."
"Although his English was very bad and broken , yet Alan -LRB- according to his very handsome use , whenever I was by -RRB- would suffer him to speak no Gaelic ."
"Perhaps the strange language made him appear more backward than he really was ; but I thought he had little good-will to serve us , and what he had was the child of terror ."
Alan would have had him carry a message to James ; but the bouman would hear of no message .
"`` She was forget it , '' he said in his screaming voice ; and would either have a letter or wash his hands of us ."
"I thought Alan would be gravelled at that , for we lacked the means of writing in that desert ."
"But he was a man of more resources than I knew ; searched the wood until he found the quill of a cushat-dove , which he shaped into a pen ; made himself a kind of ink with gunpowder from his horn and water from the running stream ; and tearing a corner from his French military commission -LRB- which he carried in his pocket , like a talisman to keep him from the gallows -RRB- , he sat down and wrote as follows : `` DEAR KINSMAN , -- Please send the money by the bearer to the place he kens of ."
"`` Your affectionate cousin , `` A. S. '' This he intrusted to the bouman , who promised to make what manner of speed he best could , and carried it off with him down the hill ."
"He was three full days gone , but about five in the evening of the third , we heard a whistling in the wood , which Alan answered ; and presently the bouman came up the water-side , looking for us , right and left ."
"He seemed less sulky than before , and indeed he was no doubt well pleased to have got to the end of such a dangerous commission ."
"He gave us the news of the country ; that it was alive with red-coats ; that arms were being found , and poor folk brought in trouble daily ; and that James and some of his servants were already clapped in prison at Fort William , under strong suspicion of complicity ."
"It seemed it was noised on all sides that Alan Breck had fired the shot ; and there was a bill issued for both him and me , with one hundred pounds reward ."
This was all as bad as could be ; and the little note the bouman had carried us from Mrs. Stewart was of a miserable sadness .
"In it she besought Alan not to let himself be captured , assuring him , if he fell in the hands of the troops , both he and James were no better than dead men ."
"The money she had sent was all that she could beg or borrow , and she prayed heaven we could be doing with it ."
"Lastly , she said , she enclosed us one of the bills in which we were described ."
"This we looked upon with great curiosity and not a little fear , partly as a man may look in a mirror , partly as he might look into the barrel of an enemy 's gun to judge if it be truly aimed ."
"Alan was advertised as `` a small , pock-marked , active man of thirty-five or thereby , dressed in a feathered hat , a French side-coat of blue with silver buttons , and lace a great deal tarnished , a red waistcoat and breeches of black , shag ; '' and I as `` a tall strong lad of about eighteen , wearing an old blue coat , very ragged , an old Highland bonnet , a long homespun waistcoat , blue breeches ; his legs bare , low-country shoes , wanting the toes ; speaks like a Lowlander , and has no beard . ''"
"Alan was well enough pleased to see his finery so fully remembered and set down ; only when he came to the word tarnish , he looked upon his lace like one a little mortified ."
"As for myself , I thought I cut a miserable figure in the bill ; and yet was well enough pleased too , for since I had changed these rags , the description had ceased to be a danger and become a source of safety ."
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` you should change your clothes . ''"
"`` Na , troth ! ''"
"said Alan , `` I have nae others ."
"A fine sight I would be , if I went back to France in a bonnet ! ''"
"This put a second reflection in my mind : that if I were to separate from Alan and his tell-tale clothes I should be safe against arrest , and might go openly about my business ."
"Nor was this all ; for suppose I was arrested when I was alone , there was little against me ; but suppose I was taken in company with the reputed murderer , my case would begin to be grave ."
"asked Mr. Bemis , quite unconscious that his own unusual interest in his daughter 's affairs made her look so bright and winsome ."
`` This ?
"Why , father , I 've worn it all winter , and it 's frightfully ugly , and almost in rags ."
"I asked you for a new one a month ago , and you said you 'd ` see about it ' ; but you did n't , so I patched this up as well as I could ; '' and Molly showed her elbows , feeling that such masculine blindness as this deserved a mild reproof ."
`` Too bad !
"Well , go and get half a dozen pretty muslin and gingham things , and be as gay as a butterfly , to make up for it , '' laughed her father , really touched by the patches and Molly 's resignation to the unreliable `` I 'll see about it , '' which he recognized as a household word ."
"Molly clapped her hands , old gloves and all , exclaiming , with girlish delight , `` How nice it will seem to have a plenty of new , neat dresses all at once , and be like other girls !"
"Miss Bat always talks about economy , and has no more taste than a -- caterpillar . ''"
"Molly meant to say `` cat , '' but remembering her pets , spared them the insult ."
`` I think I can afford to dress my girl as well as Grant does his .
"Get a new hat and coat , child , and any little notions you fancy ."
"Miss Bat 's economy is n't the sort I like ; '' and Mr. Bemis looked at his wristbands again , as if he could sympathize with Molly 's elbows ."
"`` At this rate , I shall have more clothes than I know what to do with , after being a rag-bag , '' thought the girl , in great glee , as she bravely stitched away at the worst glove , while her father smoked silently for a while , feeling that several little matters had escaped his eye which he really ought to `` see about . ''"
"Presently he went to his desk , but not to bury himself in business papers , as usual , for , after rummaging in several drawers , he took out a small bunch of keys , and sat looking at them with an expression only seen on his face when he looked up at the portrait of a dark-eyed woman hanging in his room ."
"He was a very busy man , but he had a tender place in his heart for his children ; and when a look , a few words , a moment 's reflection , called his attention to the fact that his little girl was growing up , he found both pride and pleasure in the thought that this young daughter was trying to fill her mother 's place , and be a comfort to him , if he would let her ."
"`` Molly , my dear , here is something for you , '' he said ; and when she stood beside him , added , as he put the keys into her hand , keeping both in his own for a minute , -- `` Those are the keys to your mother 's things ."
"I always meant you to have them , when you were old enough to use or care for them ."
"I think you 'll fancy this better than any other present , for you are a good child , and very like her . ''"
"Something seemed to get into his throat there , and Molly put her arm round his neck , saying , with a little choke in her own voice , `` Thank you , father , I 'd rather have this than anything else in the world , and I 'll try to be more like her every day , for your sake . ''"
"He kissed her , then said , as he began to stir his papers about , `` I must write some letters ."
"Run off to bed , child ."
"Good-night , my dear , good-night . ''"
"Seeing that he wanted to be alone , Molly slipped away , feeling that she had received a very precious gift ; for she remembered the dear , dead mother , and had often longed to possess the relics laid away in the one room where order reigned and Miss Bat had no power to meddle ."
"As she slowly undressed , she was not thinking of the pretty new gowns in which she was to be `` as gay as a butterfly , '' but of the half-worn garments waiting for her hands to unfold with a tender touch ; and when she fell asleep , with the keys under her pillow and her arms round Boo , a few happy tears on her cheeks seemed to show that , in trying to do the duty which lay nearest her , she had earned a very sweet reward ."
"So the little missionaries succeeded better in their second attempt than in their first ; for , though still very far from being perfect girls , each was slowly learning , in her own way , one of the three lessons all are the better for knowing -- that cheerfulness can change misfortune into love and friends ; that in ordering one 's self aright one helps others to do the same ; and that the power of finding beauty in the humblest things makes home happy and life lovely ."
Chapter XVIII .
"May Baskets Spring was late that year , but to Jill it seemed the loveliest she had ever known , for hope was growing green and strong in her own little heart , and all the world looked beautiful ."
"With the help of the brace she could sit up for a short time every day , and when the air was mild enough she was warmly wrapped and allowed to look out at the open window into the garden , where the gold and purple crocuses were coming bravely up , and the snowdrops nodded their delicate heads as if calling to her , -- `` Good day , little sister , come out and play with us , for winter is over and spring is here . ''"
`` I wish I could ! ''
"thought Jill , as the soft wind kissed a tinge of color into her pale cheeks ."
"`` Never mind , they have been shut up in a darker place than I for months , and had no fun at all ; I wo n't fret , but think about July and the seashore while I work . ''"
"The job now in hand was May baskets , for it was the custom of the children to hang them on the doors of their friends the night before May-day ; and the girls had agreed to supply baskets if the boys would hunt for flowers , much the harder task of the two ."
"Fondly hoping no one would observe it , she sewed bright buttons wherever they could be put , and sent confiding Boo away in a pair of blue trousers , which were absurdly hunchy behind and buttony before ."
"He came home heart-broken and muddy , having been accidentally tipped into a mud-puddle by two bad boys who felt that such tailoring was an insult to mankind ."
"That roused Molly 's spirit , and she begged her father to take the boy and have him properly fitted out , as he was old enough now to be well-dressed , and she would n't have him tormented ."
"His attention being called to the trousers , Mr. Bemis had a good laugh over them , and then got Boo a suit which caused him to be the admired of all observers , and to feel as proud as a little peacock ."
"Cheered by this success , Molly undertook a set of small shirts , and stitched away bravely , though her own summer clothes were in a sad state , and for the first time in her life she cared about what she should wear ."
"`` I must ask Merry , and may be father will let me go with her and her mother when they do their shopping , instead of leaving it to Miss Bat , who dresses me like an old woman ."
"Merry knows what is pretty and becoming : I do n't , '' thought Molly , meditating in the bushel basket , with her eyes on her snuff-colored gown and the dark purple bow at the end of the long braid Muffet had been playing with ."
"Molly was beginning to see that even so small a matter as the choice of colors made a difference in one 's appearance , and to wonder why Merry always took such pains to have a blue tie for the gray dress , a rosy one for the brown , and gloves that matched her bonnet ribbons ."
"Merry never wore a locket outside her sack , a gay bow in her hair and soiled cuffs , a smart hat and the braid worn off her skirts ."
"She was exquisitely neat and simple , yet always looked well-dressed and pretty ; for her love of beauty taught her what all girls should learn as soon as they begin to care for appearances -- that neatness and simplicity are their best ornaments , that good habits are better than fine clothes , and the most elegant manners are the kindest ."
"All these thoughts were dancing through Molly 's head , and when she left her cats , after a general romp in which even decorous Granny allowed her family to play leap-frog over her respectable back , she had made up her mind not to have yellow ribbons on her summer hat if she got a pink muslin as she had planned , but to finish off Boo 's last shirt before she went shopping with Merry ."
"It rained that evening , and Mr. Bemis had a headache , so he threw himself down upon the lounge after tea for a nap , with his silk handkerchief spread over his face ."
"He did get a nap , and when he waked he lay for a time drowsily listening to the patter of the rain , and another sound which was even more soothing ."
"Putting back a corner of the handkerchief to learn what it was , he saw Molly sitting by the fire with Boo in her lap , rocking and humming as she warmed his little bare feet , having learned to guard against croup by attending to the damp shoes and socks before going to bed ."
"Boo lay with his round face turned up to hers , stroking her cheek while the sleepy blue eyes blinked lovingly at her as she sang her lullaby with a motherly patience sweet to see ."
"They made a pretty little picture , and Mr. Bemis looked at it with pleasure , having a leisure moment in which to discover , as all parents do sooner or later , that his children were growing up ."
"`` Molly is getting to be quite a woman , and very like her mother , '' thought papa , wiping the eye that peeped , for he had been fond of the pretty wife who died when Boo was born ."
"`` Sad loss to them , poor things !"
But Miss Bat seems to have done well by them .
"Molly is much improved , and the boy looks finely ."
"She 's a good soul , after all ; '' and Mr. Bemis began to think he had been hasty when he half made up his mind to get a new housekeeper , feeling that burnt steak , weak coffee , and ragged wristbands were sure signs that Miss Bat 's days of usefulness were over ."
"Molly was singing the lullaby her mother used to sing to her , and her father listened to it silently till Boo was carried away too sleepy for anything but bed ."
"When she came back she sat down to her work , fancying her father still asleep ."
"She had a crimson bow at her throat and one on the newly braided hair , her cuffs were clean , and a white apron hid the shabbiness of the old dress ."
"She looked like a thrifty little housewife as she sat with her basket beside her full of neat white rolls , her spools set forth , and a new pair of scissors shining on the table ."
"There was a sort of charm in watching the busy needle flash to and fro , the anxious pucker of the forehead as she looked to see if the stitches were even , and the expression of intense relief upon her face as she surveyed the finished button-hole with girlish satisfaction ."
"Her father was wide awake and looking at her , thinking , as he did so , -- `` Really the old lady has worked well to change my tomboy into that nice little girl : I wonder how she did it . ''"
"Then he gave a yawn , pulled off the handkerchief , and said aloud , `` What are you making , Molly ? ''"
for it struck him that sewing was a new amusement .
"`` Shirts for Boo , sir ."
"Four , and this is the last , '' she answered , with pardonable pride , as she held it up and nodded toward the pile in her basket ."
`` Is n't that a new notion ?
"Some of them were moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail as one in bitter anguish. The elder brother wished to purchase it, and offered to support the Jogi for a whole year if he would consent to part with his wonderful instrument. The Jogi, however, knew its value, and refused to sell it."
"It so happened that the Jogi some time after went to the house of a village chief, and after playing a tune or two on his fiddle asked for something to eat. They offered to buy his fiddle and promised a high price for it, but he refused to sell it, as his fiddle brought to him his means of livelihood. When they saw that he was not to be prevailed upon, they gave him food and a plentiful supply of liquor. Of the latter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated. While he was in this condition, they took away his fiddle, and substituted their own old one for it. When the Jogi recovered, he missed his instrument, and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to return it to him. They denied having taken it, so he had to depart, leaving his fiddle behind him. The chief's son, being a musician, used to play on the Jogi's fiddle, and in his hands the music it gave forth delighted the ears of all who heard it."
"When all the household were absent at their labours in the fields, the Bonga girl used to come out of the bamboo fiddle, and prepared the family meal. Having eaten her own share, she placed that of the chief's son under his bed, and covering it up to keep off the dust, re-entered the fiddle. This happening every day, the other members of the household thought that some girl friend of theirs was in this manner showing her interest in the young man, so they did not trouble themselves to find out how it came about. The young chief, however, was determined to watch, and see which of his girl friends was so attentive to his comfort. He said in his own mind, ""I will catch her to-day, and give her a sound beating; she is causing me to be ashamed before the others."" So saying, he hid himself in a corner in a pile of firewood. In a short time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle, and began to dress her hair. Having completed her toilet, she cooked the meal of rice as usual, and having eaten some herself, she placed the young man's portion under his bed, as before, and was about to enter the fiddle again, when he, running out from his hiding-place, caught her in his arms. The Bonga girl exclaimed, ""Fie! Fie! you may be a Dom, or you may be a Hadi of some other caste with whom I cannot marry."" He said, ""No. But from to-day, you and I are one."" So they began lovingly to hold converse with each other. When the others returned home in the evening, they saw that she was both a human being and a Bonga, and they rejoiced exceedingly."
"Now in course of time the Bonga girl's family became very poor, and her brothers on one occasion came to the chief's house on a visit."
"The Bonga girl recognised them at once, but they did not know who she was. She brought them water on their arrival, and afterwards set cooked rice before them. Then sitting down near them, she began in wailing tones to upbraid them on account of the treatment she had been subjected to by their wives. She related all that had befallen her, and wound up by saying, ""You must have known it all, and yet you did not interfere to save me."" And that was all the revenge she took."
The Cruel Crane Outwitted
Long ago the Bodisat was born to a forest life as the Genius of a tree standing near a certain lotus pond.
"Now at that time the water used to run short at the dry season in a certain pond, not over large, in which there were a good many fish."
And a crane thought on seeing the fish:
"""I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them."""
"And he went and sat down at the edge of the water, thinking how he should do it."
"When the fish saw him, they asked him, ""What are you sitting there for, lost in thought?"""
"""I am sitting thinking about you,"" said he."
"""Oh, sir! what are you thinking about us?"" said they."
"""Why,"" he replied; ""there is very little water in this pond, and but little for you to eat; and the heat is so great! So I was thinking, 'What in the world will these fish do now?'"""
"""Yes, indeed, sir! what are we to do?"" said they."
"""If you will only do as I bid you, I will take you in my beak to a fine large pond, covered with all the kinds of lotuses, and put you into it,"" answered the crane."
"""That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard of, sir, since the world began. It's eating us, one after the other, that you're aiming at."""
"""Not I! So long as you trust me, I won't eat you. But if you don't believe me that there is such a pond, send one of you with me to go and see it."""
"Then they trusted him, and handed over to him one of their number a big fellow, blind of one eye, whom they thought sharp enough in any emergency, afloat or ashore."
"Him the crane took with him, let him go in the pond, showed him the whole of it, brought him back, and let him go again close to the other fish. And he told them all the glories of the pond."
"And when they heard what he said, they exclaimed, ""All right, sir! You may take us with you."""
"Then the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the other pond, and alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there."
"But he threw it into a fork of the tree, struck it with his beak, and killed it; and then ate its flesh, and threw its bones away at the foot of the tree. Then he went back and called out:"
"""I've thrown that fish in; let another one come."""
"And in that manner he took all the fish, one by one, and ate them, till he came back and found no more!"
"But there was still a crab left behind there; and the crane thought he would eat him too, and called out:"
"""I say, good crab, I've taken all the fish away, and put them into a fine large pond. Come along. I'll take you too!"""
"""But how will you take hold of me to carry me along?"""
"""I'll bite hold of you with my beak."""
"""Nay, but you have been in here,"" said he; ""and now you shall lose your life."""
"Then the lad begged and prayed so hard that he got off with his life, but the man gave him a good thrashing. And when it was over, they were as good friends as ever."
"Some time after the man set off again, and said he should be away fourteen days; but before he went he forbade the lad to go into any of the rooms he had not been in before; as for that he had been in, he might go into that, and welcome. Well, it was the same story over again, except that the lad stood out eight days before he went in. In this room, too, he saw nothing but a shelf over the door, and a big stone, and a pitcher of water on it. Well, after all, there's not much to be afraid of my seeing here, thought the lad."
"But when the man came back, he asked if he had been into any of the rooms. No, the lad hadn't done anything of the kind."
"""Well, well; I'll soon see that,"" said the man; and when he saw the lad had been in them after all, he said:"
"""Ah! now I'll spare you no longer; now you must lose your life."""
"But the lad begged and prayed for himself again, and so this time too he got off with stripes; though he got as many as his skin would carry. But when he got sound and well again, he led just as easy a life as ever, and he and the man were just as good friends."
"So a while after the man was to take another journey, and now he said he should be away three weeks, and he forbade the lad anew to go into the third room, for if he went in there he might just make up his mind at once to lose his life. Then after fourteen days the lad couldn't bear it, but crept into the room, but he saw nothing at all in there but a trap door on the floor; and when he lifted it up and looked down, there stood a great copper cauldron which bubbled up and boiled away down there; but he saw no fire under it."
"""Well, I should just like to know if it's hot,"" thought the lad, and struck his finger down into the broth, and when he pulled it out again, lo! it was gilded all over. So the lad scraped and scrubbed it, but the gilding wouldn't go off, so he bound a piece of rag round it; and when the man came back, and asked what was the matter with his finger, the lad said he'd given it such a bad cut. But the man tore off the rag, and then he soon saw what was the matter with the finger."
"First he wanted to kill the lad outright, but when he wept, and begged, he only gave him such a thrashing that he had to keep his bed three days. After that the man took down a pot from the wall, and rubbed him over with some stuff out of it, and so the lad was as sound and fresh as ever."
"So after a while the man started off again, and this time he was to be away a month. But before he went, he said to the lad, if he went into the fourth room he might give up all hope of saving his life."
"Well, the lad stood out for two or three weeks, but then he couldn't hold out any longer; he must and would go into that room, and so in he stole. There stood a great black horse tied up in a stall by himself, with a manger of red-hot coals at his head and a truss of hay at his tail. Then the lad thought this all wrong, so he changed them about, and put the hay at his head. Then said the Horse:"
"""Since you are so good at heart as to let me have some food, I'll set you free, that I will. For if the Troll comes back and finds you here, he'll kill you outright. But now you must go up to the room which lies just over this, and take a coat of mail out of those that hang there; and mind, whatever you do, don't take any of the bright ones, but the most rusty of all you see, that's the one to take; and sword and saddle you must choose for yourself just in the same way."""
So the lad did all that; but it was a heavy load for him to carry them all down at once.
"When he came back, the Horse told him to pull off his clothes and get into the cauldron which stood and boiled in the other room, and bathe himself there. ""If I do,"" thought the lad, ""I shall look an awful fright;"" but for all that, he did as he was told. So when he had taken his bath, he became so handsome and sleek, and as red and white as milk and blood, and much stronger than he had been before."
"""Do you feel any change?"" asked the Horse."
"""Yes,"" said the lad."
"""Try and lift me, then,"" said the Horse."
"Oh yes! he could do that, and as for the sword, he brandished it like a feather."
"""Now saddle me,"" said the Horse, ""and put on the coat of mail, and then take the bramble-bush rod, and the stone, and the pitcher of water, and the pot of ointment, and then we'll be off as fast as we can."""
"So when the lad had got on the horse, off they went at such a rate, he couldn't at all tell how they went. But when he had ridden awhile, the Horse said, ""I think I hear a noise; look round! can you see anything?"""
"""Yes; there are ever so many coming after us, at least a score,"" said the lad."
"""Aye, aye, that's the Troll coming,"" said the Horse; ""now he's after us with his pack."""
"So they rode on a while, until those who followed were close behind them."
"""Now throw your bramble-bush rod behind you, over your shoulder,"" said the Horse; ""but mind you throw it a good way off my back."""
"So the lad did that, and all at once a close, thick bramblewood grew up behind them. So the lad rode on a long, long time, while the Troll and his crew had to go home to fetch something to hew their way through the wood. But at last the Horse said again:"
"""Look behind you! can you see anything now?"""
"""Yes, ever so many,"" said the lad, ""as many as would fill a large church."""
"""Aye, aye, that's the Troll and his crew,"" said the Horse; ""now he's got more to back him; but now throw down the stone, and mind you throw it far behind me."""
"And as soon as the lad did what the Horse said, up rose a great black hill of rock behind him. So the Troll had to be off home to fetch something to mine his way through the rock; and while the Troll did that, the lad rode a good bit further on. But still the Horse begged him to look behind him, and then he saw a troop like a whole army behind him, and they glistened in the sunbeams."
"""Aye, aye,"" said the Horse, ""that's the Troll, and now he's got his whole band with him, so throw the pitcher of water behind you, but mind you don't spill any of it upon me."""
"The drummer did not reflect long; he sprang into the midst of the flames, but they did not hurt him, and could not even singe a hair of his head. He carried the log out, and laid it down. Hardly, however, had the wood touched the earth than it was transformed, and the beautiful maiden who had helped him in his need stood before him, and by the silken and shining golden garments which she wore, he knew right well that she was the King’s daughter. But the old woman laughed venomously, and said, “Thou thinkest thou hast her safe, but thou hast not got her yet!” Just as she was about to fall on the maiden and take her away, the youth seized the old woman with both his hands, raised her up on high, and threw her into the jaws of the fire, which closed over her as if it were delighted that an old witch was to be burnt."
"Then the King’s daughter looked at the drummer, and when she saw that he was a handsome youth and remembered how he had risked his life to deliver her, she gave him her hand, and said, “Thou hast ventured everything for my sake, but I also will do everything for thine."
"Promise to be true to me, and thou shalt be my husband. We shall not want for riches, we shall have enough with what the witch has gathered together here.” She led him into the house, where there were chests and coffers crammed with the old woman’s treasures. The maiden left the gold and silver where it was, and took only the precious stones. She would not stay any longer on the glass-mountain, so the drummer said to her, “Seat thyself by me on my saddle, and then we will fly down like birds.” “I do not like the old saddle,” said she, “I need only turn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home.” “Very well, then,” answered the drummer, “then wish us in front of the town-gate.” In the twinkling of an eye they were there, but the drummer said, “I will just go to my parents and tell them the news, wait for me outside here, I shall soon be back.” “Ah,” said the King’s daughter, “I beg thee to be careful. On thy arrival do not kiss thy parents on the right cheek, or else thou wilt forget everything, and I shall stay behind here outside, alone and deserted.” “How can I forget thee?” said he, and promised her to come back very soon, and gave his hand upon it. When he went into his father’s house, he had changed so much that no one knew who he was, for the three days which he had passed on the glass-mountain had been three years. Then he made himself known, and his parents fell on his neck with joy, and his heart was so moved that he forgot what the maiden had said, and kissed them on both cheeks. But when he had given them the kiss on the right cheek, every thought of the King’s daughter vanished from him. He emptied out his pockets, and laid handfuls of the largest jewels on the table. The parents had not the least idea what to do with the riches. Then the father built a magnificent castle all surrounded by gardens, woods, and meadows as if a prince were going to live in it, and when it was ready, the mother said, “I have found a maiden for thee, and the wedding shall be in three days. The son was content to do as his parents desired.”"
"The poor King’s daughter had stood for a long time without the town waiting for the return of the young man. When evening came, she said, “He must certainly have kissed his parents on the right cheek, and has forgotten me.” Her heart was full of sorrow, she wished herself into a solitary little hut in a forest, and would not return to her father’s court. Every evening she went into the town and passed the young man’s house; he often saw her, but he no longer knew her. At length she heard the people saying, “The wedding will take place to-morrow.” Then she said, “I will try if I can win his heart back.”"
"On the first day of the wedding ceremonies, she turned her wishing-ring, and said, “A dress as bright as the sun.” Instantly the dress lay before her, and it was as bright as if it had been woven of real sunbeams. When all the guests were assembled, she entered the hall. Every one was amazed at the beautiful dress, and the bride most of all, and as pretty dresses were the things she had most delight in, she went to the stranger and asked if she would sell it to her. “Not for money,” she answered, “but if I may pass the first night outside the door of the room where your betrothed sleeps, I will give it up to you.” The bride could not overcome her desire and consented, but she mixed a sleeping-draught with the wine her betrothed took at night, which made him fall into a deep sleep, When all had become quiet, the King’s daughter crouched down by the door of the bedroom, opened it just a little, and cried,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thou heldest me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"But it was all in vain, the drummer did not awake, and when morning dawned, the King’s daughter was forced to go back again as she came. On the second evening she turned her wishing-ring and said, “A dress as silvery as the moon.” When she appeared at the feast in the dress which was as soft as moonbeams, it again excited the desire of the bride, and the King’s daughter gave it to her for permission to pass the second night also, outside the door of the bedroom. Then in the stillness of the night, she cried,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thy heldest me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"But the drummer, who was stupefied with the sleeping-draught, could not be aroused. Sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest."
"But the people in the house had heard the lamentation of the stranger-maiden, and told the bridegroom about it. They told him also that it was impossible that he could hear anything of it, because the maiden he was going to marry had poured a sleeping-draught into his wine."
"On the third evening, the King’s daughter turned her wishing-ring, and said, “A dress glittering like the stars.” When she showed herself therein at the feast, the bride was quite beside herself with the splendour of the dress, which far surpassed the others, and she said, “I must, and will have it.” The maiden gave it as she had given the others for permission to spend the night outside the bridegroom’s door."
"The bridegroom, however, did not drink the wine which was handed to him before he went to bed, but poured it behind the bed, and when everything was quiet, he heard a sweet voice which called to him,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thou held me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"Suddenly, his memory returned to him. “Ah,” cried he, “how can I have acted so unfaithfully; but the kiss which in the joy of my heart I gave my parents, on the right cheek, that is to blame for it all, that is what stupefied me!” He sprang up, took the King’s daughter by the hand, and led her to his parents’ bed. “This is my true bride,” said he; “if I marry the other, I shall do a great wrong.” The parents, when they heard how everything had happened, gave their consent. Then the lights in the hall were lighted again, drums and trumpets were brought, friends and relations were invited to come, and the real wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. The first bride received the beautiful dresses as a compensation, and declared herself satisfied."
194 The Ear of Corn
"In former times, when God himself still walked the earth, the fruitfulness of the soil was much greater than it is now; then the ears of corn did not bear fifty or sixty, but four or five hundred-fold."
"Then the corn grew from the bottom to the very top o f the stalk, and according to the length of the stalk was the length of the ear. Men however are so made, that when they are too well off they no longer value the blessings which come from God, but grow indifferent and careless. One day a woman was passing by a corn-field when her little child, who was running beside her, fell into a puddle, and dirtied her frock. On this the mother tore up a handful of the beautiful ears of corn, and cleaned the frock with them."
"Heretofore among the politicians a platform, like that on the railway cars, ""is made for the purpose of helping the party to get aboard, but not to ride on."""
"The Columbian Exposition and World's Fair at Chicago in the summer of 1893 eclipsed all former Exhibitions, costing more and showing greater artistic taste, especially in its buildings, than anything preceding it."
"Some gentle warfare resulted from a struggle over the question of opening the ""White City"" on Sunday, and a great deal of bitterness was shown by those who opposed the opening and who had for years favored the Sunday closing of Niagara. A doubtful victory was obtained by the Sunday openers, for so many of the exhibitors closed their departments that visitors did not attend on Sunday in paying quantities."
"Against a thousand odds and over a thousand obstacles, especially the apprehension of Asiatic cholera and the actual sudden appearance of a gigantic money panic, Chicago, heroic and victorious, carried out her mighty plans and gave to the world an exhibition that won golden opinions from her friends and stilled in dumb wonder the jealousy of her enemies."
"In the mean time, the author begs leave to thank his readers for the rapt attention shown in perusing these earnest pages, and to apologize for the tears of sympathy thoughtlessly wrung from eyes unused to weep, by the graphic word-painting and fine education shown by the author."
"It was not the intention of the writer to touch the fountain of tears and create wash-outs everywhere, but sometimes tears do one good."
"In closing, would it be out of place to say that the stringency of the money market is most noticeable and most painful, and for that reason would it be too much trouble for the owner of this book to refuse to loan it, thereby encouraging its sale and contributing to the comfort of a deserving young man?"
THE END.
THE Velveteen Rabbit
"Here was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really splendid. He was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was spotted brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears were lined with pink sateen. On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged in the top of the Boy's stocking, with a sprig of holly between his paws, the effect was charming."
"There were other things in the stocking, nuts and oranges and a toy engine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but the Rabbit was quite the best of all. For at least two hours the Boy loved him, and then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner, and there was a great rustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of parcels, and in the excitement of looking at all the new presents the Velveteen Rabbit was forgotten."
Christmas Morning
"For a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor, and no one thought very much about him. He was naturally shy, and being only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive toys quite snubbed him. The mechanical toys were very superior, and looked down upon every one else; they were full of modern ideas, and pretended they were real. The model boat, who had lived through two seasons and lost most of his paint, caught the tone from them and never missed an opportunity of referring to his rigging in technical terms. The Rabbit could not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn't know that real rabbits existed; he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust like himself, and he understood that sawdust was quite out-of-date and should never be mentioned in modern circles. Even Timothy, the jointed wooden lion, who was made by the disabled soldiers, and should have had broader views, put on airs and pretended he was connected with Government. Between them all the poor little Rabbit was made to feel himself very insignificant and commonplace, and the only person who was kind to him at all was the Skin Horse."
The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others.
"He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it."
"""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?"""
"""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real."""
"""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit."
"""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt."""
"""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?"""
"""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept."
"Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."""
"""I suppose you are real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled."
The Skin Horse Tells His Story
"""The Boy's Uncle made me Real,"" he said. ""That was a great many years ago; but once you are Real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always."""
"The Rabbit sighed. He thought it would be a long time before this magic called Real happened to him. He longed to become Real, to know what it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad. He wished that he could become it without these uncomfortable things happening to him."
"There was a person called Nana who ruled the nursery. Sometimes she took no notice of the playthings lying about, and sometimes, for no reason whatever, she went swooping about like a great wind and hustled them away in cupboards. She called this ""tidying up,"" and the playthings all hated it, especially the tin ones. The Rabbit didn't mind it so much, for wherever he was thrown he came down soft."
"One evening, when the Boy was going to bed, he couldn't find the china dog that always slept with him. Nana was in a hurry, and it was too much trouble to hunt for china dogs at bedtime, so she simply looked about her, and seeing that the toy cupboard door stood open, she made a swoop."
"""Here,"" she said, ""take your old Bunny! He'll do to sleep with you!"""
"""Quite,"" said the Princess. ""I only wish I were half as sure that he wouldn't hurt you."""
"""My Princess,"" he said tenderly, ""two great powers are on our side: the power of Love and the power of Arithmetic. Those two are stronger than anything else in the world."""
"So when the tide began to go down, Nigel and the Princess ran out on to the sands, and there, in full sight of the terrace where the dragon kept watch, Nigel took his Princess in his arms and kissed her. The griffin was busy sweeping the stairs of the Lone Tower, but the dragon saw, and he gave a cry of rage and it was like twenty engines all letting off steam at the top of their voices inside Cannon Street Station."
"And the two lovers stood looking up at the dragon. He was dreadful to look at. His head was white with age and his beard had grown so long that he caught his claws in it as he walked. His wings were white with the salt that had settled on them from the spray of the sea. His tail was long and thick and jointed and white, and had little legs to it, any number of them far too many so that it looked like a very large fat silkworm; and his claws were as long as lessons and as sharp as bayonets."
"""Good-bye, love!"" cried Nigel, and ran out across the yellow sand toward the sea. He had one end of a cord tied to his arm."
"The dragon was clambering down the face of the cliff, and next moment he was crawling and writhing and sprawling and wriggling across the beach after Nigel, making great holes in the sand with his heavy feet and the very end of his tail, where there were no legs, made, as it dragged, a mark in the sand such as you make when you launch a boat; and he breathed fire till the wet sand hissed again, and the water of the little rock pools got quite frightened, and all went off in steam."
"Still Nigel held on and the dragon after him. The Princess could see nothing for the steam, and she stood crying bitterly, but still holding on tight with her right hand to the other end of the cord that Nigel had told her to hold; while with her left she held the ship's chronometer, and looked at it through her tears as he had bidden her look, so as to know when to pull the rope."
"On went Nigel over the sand, and on went the dragon after him. And the tide was low, and sleepy little waves lapped the sand's edge."
"Now at the lip of the water, Nigel paused and looked back, and the dragon made a bound, beginning a scream of rage that was like all the engines of all the railways in England. But it never uttered the second half of that scream, for now it knew suddenly that it was sleepy it turned to hurry back to dry land, because sleeping near whirlpools is so unsafe. But before it reached the shore sleep caught it and turned it to stone. Nigel, seeing this, ran shoreward for his life and the tide began to flow in, and the time of the whirlpools' sleep was nearly over, and he stumbled and he waded and he swam, and the Princess pulled for dear life at the cord in her hand, and pulled him up on to the dry shelf of rock just as the great sea dashed in and made itself once more into the girdle of Nine Whirlpools all around the island."
"But the dragon was asleep under the whirlpools, and when he woke up from being asleep he found he was drowned, so there was an end of him."
"""Now, there's only the griffin,"" said Nigel. And the Princess said:"
"""Yes only "" And she kissed Nigel and went back to sew the last leaf of the last lily on the bosom of her wedding gown. She thought and thought of what was written on the stone about the griffin being artificial and next day she said to Nigel: ""You know a griffin is half a lion and half an eagle, and the other two halves when they've joined make the leo-griff. But I've never seen him. Yet I have an idea."""
So they talked it over and arranged everything.
"When the griffin fell asleep that afternoon at teatime, Nigel went softly behind him and trod on his tail, and at the same time the Princess cried: ""Look out! There's a lion behind you."""
"And the griffin, waking suddenly from his dreams, twisted his large neck around to look for the lion, saw a lion's flank, and fastened its eagle beak in it. For the griffin had been artificially made by the King-enchanter, and the two halves had never really got used to each other. So now the eagle half of the griffin, who was still rather sleepy, believed that it was fighting a lion, and the lion part, being half asleep, thought it was fighting an eagle, and the whole griffin in its deep drowsiness hadn't the sense to pull itself together and remember what it was made of. So the griffin rolled over and over, one end of it fighting with the other, till the eagle end pecked the lion end to death, and the lion end tore the eagle end with its claws till it died. And so the griffin that was made of a lion and an eagle perished, exactly as if it had been made of Kilkenny cats."
"""Poor griffin,"" said the Princess, ""it was very good at the housework. I always liked it better than the dragon: It wasn't so hot-tempered."""
"At that moment there was a soft, silky rush behind the Princess, and there was her mother, the Queen, who had slipped out of the stone statue at the moment the griffin was dead, and now came hurrying to take her dear daughter in her arms. The witch was clambering slowly off her pedestal. She was a little stiff from standing still so long."
"When they had all explained everything over and over to each other as many times as was good for them, the witch said: ""Well, but what about the whirlpools?"""
"And Nigel said he didn't know. Then the witch said: ""I'm not a witch anymore. I'm only a happy old woman, but I know some things still. Those whirlpools were made by the enchanter-King's dropping nine drops of his blood into the sea. And his blood was so wicked that the sea has been trying ever since to get rid of it, and that made the whirlpools. Now you've only got to go out at low tide."""
"So Nigel understood and went out at low tide, and found in the sandy hollow left by the first whirlpool a great red ruby. That was the first drop of the wicked King's blood. The next day Nigel found another, and next day another, and so on till the ninth day, and then the sea was as smooth as glass."
"The nine rubies were used afterwards in agriculture. You had only to throw them out into a field if you wanted it plowed. Then the whole surface of the land turned itself over in its anxiety to get rid of something so wicked, and in the morning the field was found to be plowed as thoroughly as any young man at Oxford. So the wicked King did some good after all."
"When the sea was smooth, ships came from far and wide, bringing people to hear the wonderful story. And a beautiful palace was built, and the Princess was married to Nigel in her gold dress, and they all lived happily as long as was good for them."
"The dragon still lies, a stone dragon on the sand, and at low tide the little children play around him and over him. But the pieces that were left of the griffin were buried under the herb-bed in the palace garden, because it had been so good at housework, and it wasn't its fault that it had been made so badly and put to such poor work as guarding a lady from her lover."
"I have no doubt that you will wish to know what the Princess lived on during the long years when the dragon did the cooking. My dear, she lived on her income and that is a thing that a great many people would like to be able to do."
THE DRAGON TAMERS]
VI. The Dragon Tamers
"There was once an old, old castle it was so old that its walls and towers and turrets and gateways and arches had crumbled to ruins, and of all its old splendor there were only two little rooms left; and it was here that John the blacksmith had set up his forge. He was too poor to live in a proper house, and no one asked any rent for the rooms in the ruin, because all the lords of the castle were dead and gone this many a year. So there John blew his bellows and hammered his iron and did all the work which came his way. This was not much, because most of the trade went to the mayor of the town, who was also a blacksmith in quite a large way of business, and had his huge forge facing the square of the town, and had twelve apprentices, all hammering like a nest of woodpeckers, and twelve journeymen to order the apprentices about, and a patent forge and a self-acting hammer and electric bellows, and all things handsome about him. So of course the townspeople, whenever they wanted a horse shod or a shaft mended, went to the mayor. John the blacksmith struggled on as best he could, with a few odd jobs from travelers and strangers who did not know what a superior forge the mayor's was. The two rooms were warm and weather-tight, but not very large; so the blacksmith got into the way of keeping his old iron, his odds and ends, his fagots, and his twopence worth of coal in the great dungeon down under the castle. It was a very fine dungeon indeed, with a handsome vaulted roof and big iron rings whose staples were built into the wall, very strong and convenient for tying captives to, and at one end was a broken flight of wide steps leading down no one knew where."
"Even the lords of the castle in the good old times had never known where those steps led to, but every now and then they would kick a prisoner down the steps in their lighthearted, hopeful way, and sure enough, the prisoners never came back. The blacksmith had never dared to go beyond the seventh step, and no more have I so I know no more than he did what was at the bottom of those stairs."
"John the blacksmith had a wife and a little baby. When his wife was not doing the housework she used to nurse the baby and cry, remembering the happy days when she lived with her father, who kept seventeen cows and lived quite in the country, and when John used to come courting her in the summer evenings, as smart as smart, with a posy in his buttonhole."
"And now John's hair was getting gray, and there was hardly ever enough to eat."
"All at once he saw in the distance two giants, who made a sign to him with their hands, and when he came to them they said, “We are quarrelling about a cap, and which of us it is to belong to, and as we are equally strong, neither of us can get the better of the other. The small men are cleverer than we are, so we will leave the decision to thee.” “How can you dispute about an old cap?” said the youth. “Thou dost not know what properties it has! It is a wishing-cap; whosoever puts it on, can wish himself away wherever he likes, and in an instant he will be there.” “Give me the cap,” said the youth, “I will go a short distance off, and when I call you, you must run a race, and the cap shall belong to the one who gets first to me.” He put it on and went away, and thought of the King’s daughter, forgot the giants, and walked continually onward. At length he sighed from the very bottom of his heart, and cried, “Ah, if I were but at the Castle of the Golden Sun,” and hardly had the words passed his lips than he was standing on a high mountain before the gate of the castle."
"He entered and went through all the rooms, until in the last he found the King’s daughter. But how shocked he was when he saw her. She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles, blear eyes, and red hair. “Are you the King’s daughter, whose beauty the whole world praises?” cried he."
"“Ah,” she answered, “this is not my form; human eyes can only see me in this state of ugliness, but that thou mayst know what I am like, look in the mirror it does not let itself be misled it will show thee my image as it is in truth.” She gave him the mirror in his hand, and he saw therein the likeness of the most beautiful maiden on earth, and saw, too, how the tears were rolling down her cheeks with grief. Then said he, “How canst thou be set free? I fear no danger.” She said, “He who gets the crystal ball, and holds it before the enchanter, will destroy his power with it, and I shall resume my true shape. Ah,” she added, “so many have already gone to meet death for this, and thou art so young; I grieve that thou shouldst encounter such great danger.”"
"“Nothing can keep me from doing it,” said he, “but tell me what I must do.” “Thou shalt know everything,” said the King’s daughter; “when thou descendest the mountain on which the castle stands, a wild bull will stand below by a spring, and thou must fight with it, and if thou hast the luck to kill it, a fiery bird will spring out of it, which bears in its body a burning egg, and in the egg the crystal ball lies like a yolk. The bird will not, however, let the egg fall until forced to do so, and if it falls on the ground, it will flame up and burn everything that is near, and melt even ice itself, and with it the crystal ball, and then all thy trouble will have been in vain.”"
"The youth went down to the spring, where the bull snorted and bellowed at him. After a long struggle he plunged his sword in the animal’s body, and it fell down. Instantly a fiery bird arose from it, and was about to fly away, but the young man’s brother, the eagle, who was passing between the clouds, swooped down, hunted it away to the sea, and struck it with his beak until, in its extremity, it let the egg fall. The egg did not, however, fall into the sea, but on a fisherman’s hut which stood on the shore and the hut began at once to smoke and was about to break out in flames. Then arose in the sea waves as high as a house, they streamed over the hut, and subdued the fire. The other brother, the whale, had come swimming to them, and had driven the water up on high. When the fire was extinguished, the youth sought for the egg and happily found it; it was not yet melted, but the shell was broken by being so suddenly cooled with the water, and he could take out the crystal ball unhurt."
"When the youth went to the enchanter and held it before him, the latter said, “My power is destroyed, and from this time forth thou art the King of the Castle of the Golden Sun. With this canst thou likewise give back to thy brothers their human form.” Then the youth hastened to the King’s daughter, and when he entered the room, she was standing there in the full splendour of her beauty, and joyfully they exchanged rings with each other."
198 Maid Maleen
"There was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty King; she was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful."
"As her father wished to give her to another, the prince was rejected; but as they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, “I can and will take no other for my husband.” Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter. When it was finished, he said, “Therein shalt thou be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if thy perverse spirit is broken.” Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower, and then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth. There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began. The King’s son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls."
"What else could they do but lament and complain? Meanwhile the time passed, and by the diminution of the food and drink they knew that the seven years were coming to an end. They thought the moment of their deliverance was come; but no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen that her father had forgotten her. As they only had food for a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said, “We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.” She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn. With great labour they succeeded in getting out one stone, and then a second, and a third, and when three days were over the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out. The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how melancholy everything looked all around! Her father’s castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible. When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed. But where were they to go? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the King, and slain all the inhabitants."
"They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread, and their need was so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettles. When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere; but wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them. At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace. There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions."
"The son of the King in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen. His father had chosen another bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked."
"The wedding was fixed, and the maiden had already arrived; but because of her great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen. When the day came for the bride and the bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people. Then said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen thee. I have sprained my foot, and cannot well walk through the streets; thou shalt put on my wedding-clothes and take my place; a greater honour than that thou canst not have!” Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honour which is not suitable for me.” It was in vain, too, that the bride offered her gold. At last she said angrily, “If thou dost not obey me, it shall cost thee thy life. I have but to speak the word, and thy head will lie at thy feet.” Then she was forced to obey, and put on the bride’s magnificent clothes and all her jewels. When she entered the royal hall, every one was amazed at her great beauty, and the King said to his son, “This is the bride whom I have chosen for thee, and whom thou must lead to church.” The bridegroom was astonished, and thought, “She is like my Maid Maleen, and I should believe that it was she herself, but she has long been shut up in the tower, or dead.” He took her by the hand and led her to church. On the way was a nettle-plant, and she said,"
"“Oh, nettle-plant, Little nettle-plant, What dost thou here alone?"
"I have known the time When I ate thee unboiled, When I ate thee unroasted.”"
"“What art thou saying?” asked the King’s son. “Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” He was surprised that she knew about her, but kept silence. When they came to the foot-plank into the churchyard, she said,"
"“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"“What art thou saying there?” asked the King’s son. “Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” “Dost thou know Maid Maleen?” “No,” she answered, “how should I know her; I have only heard of her.” When they came to the church-door, she said once more,"
"“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"“What art thou saying there?” asked he. “Ah,” she answered, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” Then he took out a precious chain, put it round her neck, and fastened the clasp. Thereupon they entered the church, and the priest joined their hands together before the altar, and married them. He led her home, but she did not speak a single word the whole way. When they got back to the royal palace, she hurried into the bride’s chamber, put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed herself in her gray gown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck, which she had received from the bridegroom."
"When the night came, and the bride was to be led into the prince’s apartment, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not observe the deception. As soon as every one had gone away, he said to her, “What didst thou say to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside?”"
“To which nettle-plant?” asked she; “I don’t talk to nettle-plants.”
"“If thou didst not do it, then thou art not the true bride,” said he."
"So she bethought herself, and said,"
"“I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me.”"
"She went out and sought Maid Maleen. “Girl, what hast thou been saying to the nettle?” “I said nothing but,"
"“Oh, nettle-plant, Little nettle-plant, What dost thou here alone?"
"I have known the time When I ate thee unboiled, When I ate thee unroasted.”"
"The bride ran back into the chamber, and said, “I know now what I said to the nettle,” and she repeated the words which she had just heard."
“But what didst thou say to the foot-bridge when we went over it?”
asked the King’s son. “To the foot-bridge?” she answered. “I don’t talk to foot-bridges.” “Then thou art not the true bride.”
"She again said,"
"said he; “and we can gnaw at a bare bone again.” “Ah,” said the woman, “I had rather not have riches if I am not to know from whom they come, for then I have no peace.”"
"The man went back to fish, and after a while he chanced to draw out the gold fish for a third time. “Listen,” said the fish, “I see very well that I am fated to fall into your hands, take me home and cut me into six pieces; give your wife two of them to eat, two to your horse and bury two of them in the ground, then they will bring you a blessing.”"
"The fisherman took the fish home with him, and did as it had bidden him. It came to pass, however, that from the two pieces that were buried in the ground two golden lilies sprang up, that the horse had two golden foals, and the fisherman’s wife bore two children who were made entirely of gold. The children grew up, became tall and handsome, and the lilies and horses grew likewise. Then they said, “Father, we want to mount our golden steeds and travel out in the world.” But he answered sorrowfully, “How shall I bear it if you go away, and I know not how it fares with you?” Then they said, “The two golden lilies remain here. By them you can see how it is with us; if they are fresh, then we are in health; if they are withered, we are ill; if they perish, then we are dead.” So they rode forth and came to an inn, in which were many people, and when they perceived the gold-children they began to laugh, and jeer. When one of them heard the mocking he felt ashamed and would not go out into the world, but turned back and went home again to his father. But the other rode forward and reached a great forest. As he was about to enter it, the people said, It is not safe for you to ride through, the wood is full of robbers who would treat you badly. You will fare ill, and when they see that you are all of gold, and your horse likewise, they will assuredly kill you.’"
"But he would not allow himself to be frightened, and said, “I must and will ride through it.” Then he took bear-skins and covered himself and his horse with them, so that the gold was no more to be seen, and rode fearlessly into the forest. When he had ridden onward a little he heard a rustling in the bushes, and heard voices speaking together. From one side came cries of, “There is one,” but from the other, “Let him go, ’tis an idle fellow, as poor and bare as a church-mouse, what should we gain from him?”"
"So the gold-child rode joyfully through the forest, and no evil befell him. One day he entered a village wherein he saw a maiden, who was so beautiful that he did not believe that any more beautiful than she existed in the world. And as such a mighty love took possession of him, he went up to her and said, “I love thee with my whole heart, wilt thou be my wife?” He, too, pleased the maiden so much that she agreed and said, “Yes, I will be thy wife, and be true to thee my whole life long.” Then they were married, and just as they were in the greatest happiness, home came the father of the bride, and when he saw that his daughter’s wedding was being celebrated, he was astonished, and said, “Where is the bridegroom?” They showed him the gold-child, who, however, still wore his bear-skins. Then the father said wrathfully, “A vagabond shall never have my daughter!” and was about to kill him. Then the bride begged as hard as she could, and said, “He is my husband, and I love him with all my heart!” until at last he allowed himself to be appeased. Nevertheless the idea never left his thoughts, so that next morning he rose early, wishing to see whether his daughter’s husband was a common ragged beggar. But when he peeped in, he saw a magnificent golden man in the bed, and the cast-off bear-skins lying on the ground."
"Then he went back and thought, “What a good thing it was that I restrained my anger! I should have committed a great crime.” But the gold-child dreamed that he rode out to hunt a splendid stag, and when he awoke in the morning, he said to his wife, “I must go out hunting.”"
"She was uneasy, and begged him to stay there, and said, “You might easily meet with a great misfortune,” but he answered, “I must and will go.”"
"Thereupon he got up, and rode forth into the forest, and it was not long before a fine stag crossed his path exactly according to his dream. He aimed and was about to shoot it, when the stag ran away. He gave chase over hedges and ditches for the whole day without feeling tired, but in the evening the stag vanished from his sight, and when the gold-child looked round him, he was standing before a little house, wherein was a witch. He knocked, and a little old woman came out and asked, “What are you doing so late in the midst of the great forest?”"
"“Have you not seen a stag?” “Yes,” answered she, “I know the stag well,” and thereupon a little dog which had come out of the house with her, barked at the man violently. “Wilt thou be silent, thou odious toad,” said he, “or I will shoot thee dead.” Then the witch cried out in a passion, “What! will you slay my little dog?” and immediately transformed him, so that he lay like a stone, and his bride awaited him in vain and thought, “That which I so greatly dreaded, which lay so heavily on my heart, has come upon him!” But at home the other brother was standing by the gold-lilies, when one of them suddenly drooped."
"“Good heavens!” said he, “my brother has met with some great misfortune! I must away to see if I can possibly rescue him.” Then the father said, “Stay here, if I lose you also, what shall I do?” But he answered, “I must and will go forth!”"
"Then he mounted his golden horse, and rode forth and entered the great forest, where his brother lay turned to stone. The old witch came out of her house and called him, wishing to entrap him also, but he did not go near her, and said, “I will shoot you, if you will not bring my brother to life again.” She touched the stone, though very unwillingly, with her forefinger, and he was immediately restored to his human shape. But the two gold-children rejoiced when they saw each other again, kissed and caressed each other, and rode away together out of the forest, the one home to his bride, and the other to his father. The father then said, “I knew well that you had rescued your brother, for the golden lily suddenly rose up and blossomed out again.” Then they lived happily, and all prospered with them until their death."
86 The Fox and the Geese
"The fox once came to a meadow in which was a flock of fine fat geese, on which he smiled and said, “I come in the nick of time, you are sitting together quite beautifully, so that I can eat you up one after the other.” The geese cackled with terror, sprang up, and began to wail and beg piteously for their lives. But the fox would listen to nothing, and said, “There is no mercy to be had! You must die.” At length one of them took heart and said, “If we poor geese are to yield up our vigorous young lives, show us the only possible favour and allow us one more prayer, that we may not die in our sins, and then we will place ourselves in a row, so that you can always pick yourself out the fattest.” “Yes,” said the fox, “that is reasonable, and a pious request. Pray away, I will wait till you are done.” Then the first began a good long prayer, for ever saying, “Ga! Ga!” and as she would make no end, the second did not wait until her turn came, but began also, “Ga! Ga!” The third and fourth followed her, and soon they were all cackling together."
"When they have done praying, the story shall be continued further, but at present they are still praying without stopping.”"
87 The Poor Man and the Rich Man
"In olden times, when the Lord himself still used to walk about on this earth amongst men, it once happened that he was tired and overtaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn. Now there stood on the road before him two houses facing each other; the one large and beautiful, the other small and poor. The large one belonged to a rich man, and the small one to a poor man."
"Then the Lord thought, “I shall be no burden to the rich man, I will stay the night with him.” When the rich man heard some one knocking at his door, he opened the window and asked the stranger what he wanted."
"The Lord answered, “I only ask for a night’s lodging.”"
"Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, “No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself."
"Go somewhere else for a lodging,” and with this he shut down the window and left the Lord standing there."
"So the Lord turned his back on the rich man, and went across to the small house and knocked. He had hardly done so when the poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler come in. “Pass the night with me, it is already dark,” said he; “you cannot go any further to-night.”"
"This pleased the Lord, and he went in. The poor man’s wife shook hands with him, and welcomed him, and said he was to make himself at home and put up with what they had got; they had not much to offer him, but what they had they would give him with all their hearts. Then she put the potatoes on the fire, and while they were boiling, she milked the goat, that they might have a little milk with them. When the cloth was laid, the Lord sat down with the man and his wife, and he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces at the table. When they had had supper and it was bed-time, the woman called her husband apart and said, “Hark you, dear husband, let us make up a bed of straw for ourselves to-night, and then the poor traveler can sleep in our bed and have a good rest, for he has been walking the whole day through, and that makes one weary.” “With all my heart,” he answered, “I will go and offer it to him;” and he went to the stranger and invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly."
"But the Lord was unwilling to take their bed from the two old folks; however, they would not be satisfied, until at length he did it and lay down in their bed, while they themselves lay on some straw on the ground."
"Next morning they got up before daybreak, and made as good a breakfast as they could for the guest. When the sun shone in through the little window, and the Lord had got up, he again ate with them, and then prepared to set out on his journey."
"But as he was standing at the door he turned round and said, “As you are so kind and good, you may wish three things for yourselves and I will grant them.” Then the man said, “What else should I wish for but eternal happiness, and that we two, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day our daily bread; for the third wish, I do not know what to have.” And the Lord said to him, “Will you wish for a new house instead of this old one?” “Oh, yes,” said the man; “if I can have that, too, I should like it very much.” And the Lord fulfilled his wish, and changed their old house into a new one, again gave them his blessing, and went on."
"The sun was high when the rich man got up and leaned out of his window and saw, on the opposite side of the way, a new clean-looking house with red tiles and bright windows where the old hut used to be. He was very much astonished, and called his wife and said to her, “Tell me, what can have happened? Last night there was a miserable little hut standing there, and to-day there is a beautiful new house. Run over and see how that has come to pass.”"
"So his wife went and asked the poor man, and he said to her, “Yesterday evening a traveler came here and asked for a night’s lodging, and this morning when he took leave of us he granted us three wishes—eternal happiness, health during this life and our daily bread as well, and besides this, a beautiful new house instead of our old hut.”"
"When the rich man’s wife heard this, she ran back in haste and told her husband how it had happened. The man said, “I could tear myself to pieces! If I had but known that! That traveler came to our house too, and wanted to sleep here, and I sent him away.” “Quick!” said his wife, “get on your horse. You can still catch the man up, and then you must ask to have three wishes granted to you.”"
"The rich man followed the good counsel and galloped away on his horse, and soon came up with the Lord. He spoke to him softly and pleasantly, and begged him not to take it amiss that he had not let him in directly; he was looking for the front-door key, and in the meantime the stranger had gone away, if he returned the same way he must come and stay with him. “Yes,” said the Lord; “if I ever come back again, I will do so.” Then the rich man asked if might not wish for three things too, as his neighbor had done? “Yes,” said the Lord, he might, but it would not be to his advantage, and he had better not wish for anything; but the rich man thought that he could easily ask for something which would add to his happiness, if he only knew that it would be granted."
"So the Lord said to him, “Ride home, then, and three wishes which you shall form, shall be fulfilled.”"
"The rich man had now gained what he wanted, so he rode home, and began to consider what he should wish for. As he was thus thinking he let the bridle fall, and the horse began to caper about, so that he was continually disturbed in his meditations, and could not collect his thoughts at all. He patted its neck, and said, “Gently, Lisa,” but the horse only began new tricks. Then at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, “I wish your neck was broken!” Directly he had said the words, down the horse fell on the ground, and there it lay dead and never moved again. And thus was his first wish fulfilled. As he was miserly by nature, he did not like to leave the harness lying there; so he cut it off, and put it on his back; and now he had to go on foot. “I have still two wishes left,” said he, and comforted himself with that thought."
"And now as he was walking slowly through the sand, and the sun was burning hot at noon-day, he grew quite hot-tempered and angry. The saddle hurt his back, and he had not yet any idea what to wish for. “If I were to wish for all the riches and treasures in the world,” said he to himself, “I should still to think of all kinds of other things later on, I know that, beforehand. But I will manage so that there is nothing at all left me to wish for afterwards.” Then he sighed and said, “Ah, if I were but that Bavarian peasant, who likewise had three wishes granted to him, and knew quite well what to do, and in the first place wished for a great deal of beer, and in the second for as much beer as he was able to drink, and in the third for a barrel of beer into the bargain.”"
"While she was seeking, she saw the old woman and how she was stealing away, and wanting to get off with a bird-cage which she had in her hand. So she went after her and took the cage out of her hand, and when she raised it up and looked into it, a bird was inside which had the plain ring in its bill. Then she took the ring, and ran quite joyously home with it, and thought the little white dove would come and get the ring, but it did not. Then she leant against a tree and determined to wait for the dove, and, as she thus stood, it seemed just as if the tree was soft and pliant, and was letting its branches down. And suddenly the branches twined around her, and were two arms, and when she looked round, the tree was a handsome man, who embraced and kissed her heartily, and said, “Thou hast delivered me from the power of the old woman, who is a wicked witch. She had changed me into a tree, and every day for two hours I was a white dove, and so long as she possessed the ring I could not regain my human form.” Then his servants and his horses, who had likewise been changed into trees, were freed from the enchantment also, and stood beside him. And he led them forth to his kingdom, for he was a King’s son, and they married, and lived happily."
124 The Three Brothers
"There was once a man who had three sons, and nothing else in the world but the house in which he lived. Now each of the sons wished to have the house after his father’s death; but the father loved them all alike, and did not know what to do; he did not wish to sell the house, because it had belonged to his forefathers, else he might have divided the money amongst them. At last a plan came into his head, and he said to his sons, “Go into the world, and try each of you to learn a trade, and, when you all come back, he who makes the best masterpiece shall have the house.”"
"The sons were well content with this, and the eldest determined to be a blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master. They fixed a time when they should all come home again, and then each went his way."
"It chanced that they all found skilful masters, who taught them their trades well. The blacksmith had to shoe the King’s horses, and he thought to himself, “The house is mine, without doubt.” The barber only shaved great people, and he too already looked upon the house as his own. The fencing-master got many a blow, but he only bit his lip, and let nothing vex him; “for,” said he to himself, “If you are afraid of a blow, you’ll never win the house.”"
"When the appointed time had gone by, the three brothers came back home to their father; but they did not know how to find the best opportunity for showing their skill, so they sat down and consulted together. As they were sitting thus, all at once a hare came running across the field. “Ah, ha, just in time!” said the barber. So he took his basin and soap, and lathered away until the hare came up; then he soaped and shaved off the hare’s whiskers whilst he was running at the top of his speed, and did not even cut his skin or injure a hair on his body."
"“Well done!” said the old man. “Your brothers will have to exert themselves wonderfully, or the house will be yours.”"
"Soon after, up came a nobleman in his coach, dashing along at full speed. “Now you shall see what I can do, father,” said the blacksmith; so away he ran after the coach, took all four shoes off the feet of one of the horses whilst he was galloping, and put him on four new shoes without stopping him. “You are a fine fellow, and as clever as your brother,” said his father; “I do not know to which I ought to give the house.”"
"Then the third son said, “Father, let me have my turn, if you please;”"
"and, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword, and flourished it backwards and forwards above his head so fast that not a drop fell upon him. It rained still harder and harder, till at last it came down in torrents; but he only flourished his sword faster and faster, and remained as dry as if he were sitting in a house. When his father saw this he was amazed, and said, “This is the master-piece, the house is yours!”"
"His brothers were satisfied with this, as was agreed beforehand; and, as they loved one another very much, they all three stayed together in the house, followed their trades, and, as they had learnt them so well and were so clever, they earned a great deal of money. Thus they lived together happily until they grew old; and at last, when one of them fell sick and died, the two others grieved so sorely about it that they also fell ill, and soon after died. And because they had been so clever, and had loved one another so much, they were all laid in the same grave."
125 The Devil and his Grandmother
"There was a great war, and the King had many soldiers, but gave them small pay, so small that they could not live upon it, so three of them agreed among themselves to desert. One of them said to the others, “If we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows; how shall we manage it?” Another said, “Look at that great cornfield, if we were to hide ourselves there, no one could find us; the troops are not allowed to enter it, and to-morrow they are to march away.” They crept into the corn, only the troops did not march away, but remained lying all round about it. They stayed in the corn for two days and two nights, and were so hungry that they all but died, but if they had come out, their death would have been certain. Then said they, “What is the use of our deserting if we have to perish miserably here?” But now a fiery dragon came flying through the air, and it came down to them, and asked why they had concealed themselves there? They answered, “We are three soldiers who have deserted because the pay was so bad, and now we shall have to die of hunger if we stay here, or to dangle on the gallows if we go out.” “If you will serve me for seven years,” said the dragon, “I will convey you through the army so that no one shall seize you.” “We have no choice and are compelled to accept,” they replied. Then the dragon caught hold of them with his claws, and carried them away through the air over the army, and put them down again on the earth far from it; but the dragon was no other than the Devil. He gave them a small whip and said, “Whip with it and crack it, and then as much gold will spring up round about as you can wish for; then you can live like great lords, keep horses, and drive your carriages, but when the seven years have come to an end, you are my property.” Then he put before them a book which they were all three forced to sign. “I will, however, then set you a riddle,” said he, “and if you can guess that, you shall be free, and released from my power.” Then the dragon flew away from them, and they went away with their whip, had gold in plenty, ordered themselves rich apparel, and travelled about the world. Wherever they were they lived in pleasure and magnificence, rode on horseback, drove in carriages, ate and drank, but did nothing wicked. The time slipped quickly away, and when the seven years were coming to an end, two of them were terribly anxious and alarmed; but the third took the affair easily, and said, “Brothers, fear nothing, my head is sharp enough, I shall guess the riddle.” They went out into the open country and sat down, and the two pulled sorrowful faces. Then an aged woman came up to them who inquired why they were so sad? “Alas!” said they, “how can that concern you? After all, you cannot help us.” “Who knows?” said she. “Confide your trouble to me.” So they told her that they had been the Devil’s servants for nearly seven years, and that he had provided them with gold as plentifully as if it had been blackberries, but that they had sold themselves to him, and were forfeited to him, if at the end of the seven years they could not guess a riddle. The old woman said, “If you are to be saved, one of you must go into the forest, there he will come to a fallen rock which looks like a little house, he must enter that, and then he will obtain help.” The two melancholy ones thought to themselves, “That will still not save us,” and stayed where they were, but the third, the merry one, got up and walked on in the forest until he found the rock-house. In the little house, however, a very aged woman was sitting, who was the Devil’s grandmother, and asked the soldier where he came from, and what he wanted there? He told her everything that had happened, and as he pleased her well, she had pity on him, and said she would help him. She lifted up a great stone which lay above a cellar, and said, “Conceal thyself there, thou canst hear everything that is said here; only sit still, and do not stir. When the dragon comes, I will question him about the riddle, he tells everything to me, so listen carefully to his answer.” At twelve o’clock at night, the dragon came flying thither, and asked for his dinner. The grandmother laid the table, and served up food and drink, so that he was pleased, and they ate and drank together. In the course of conversation, she asked him what kind of a day he had had, and how many souls he had got? “Nothing went very well to-day,” he answered, “but I have laid hold of three soldiers, I have them safe.” “Indeed! three soldiers, that’s something like, but they may escape you yet.” The Devil said mockingly, “They are mine! I will set them a riddle, which they will never in this world be able to guess!” “What riddle is that?”"
"she inquired. “I will tell you. In the great North Sea lies a dead dog-fish, that shall be your roast meat, and the rib of a whale shall be your silver spoon, and a hollow old horse’s hoof shall be your wine-glass.” When the Devil had gone to bed, the old grandmother raised up the stone, and let out the soldier. “Hast thou paid particular attention to everything?” “Yes,” said he, “I know enough, and will contrive to save myself.” Then he had to go back another way, through the window, secretly and with all speed to his companions. He told them how the Devil had been overreached by the old grandmother, and how he had learned the answer to the riddle from him. Then they were all joyous, and of good cheer, and took the whip and whipped so much gold for themselves that it ran all over the ground. When the seven years had fully gone by, the Devil came with the book, showed the signatures, and said, “I will take you with me to hell. There you shall have a meal! If you can guess what kind of roast meat you will have to eat, you shall be free and released from your bargain, and may keep the whip as well.” Then the first soldier began and said, “In the great North Sea lies a dead dog-fish, that no doubt is the roast meat.” The Devil was angry, and began to mutter, “Hm! hm! hm!” And asked the second, “But what will your spoon be?” “The rib of a whale, that is to be our silver spoon.” The Devil made a wry face, again growled, “Hm! hm! hm!”"
"and said to the third, “And do you also know what your wine-glass is to be?” “An old horse’s hoof is to be our wineglass.” Then the Devil flew away with a loud cry, and had no more power over them, but the three kept the whip, whipped as much money for themselves with it as they wanted, and lived happily to their end."
126 Ferdinand the Faithful
"Once on a time lived a man and a woman who so long as they were rich had no children, but when they were poor they had a little boy. They could, however, find no godfather for him, so the man said he would just go to another place to see if he could get one there. As he went, a poor man met him, who asked him where he was going. He said he was going to see if he could get a godfather, that he was poor, so no one would stand as godfather for him. “Oh,” said the poor man, “you are poor, and I am poor; I will be godfather for you, but I am so ill off I can give the child nothing. Go home and tell the nurse that she is to come to the church with the child.”"
"When they all got to the church together, the beggar was already there, and he gave the child the name of Ferdinand the Faithful."
"When he was going out of the church, the beggar said, “Now go home, I can give you nothing, and you likewise ought to give me nothing.” But he gave a key to the nurse, and told her when she got home she was to give it to the father, who was to take care of it until the child was fourteen years old, and then he was to go on the heath where there was a castle which the key would fit, and that all which was therein should belong to him. Now when the child was seven years old and had grown very big, he once went to play with some other boys, and each of them boasted that he had got more from his godfather than the other; but the child could say nothing, and was vexed, and went home and said to his father, “Did I get nothing at all, then, from my godfather?” “Oh, yes,”"
"said the father, “thou hadst a key if there is a castle standing on the heath, just go to it and open it.” Then the boy went thither, but no castle was to be seen, or heard of."
"After seven years more, when he was fourteen years old, he again went thither, and there stood the castle. When he had opened it, there was nothing within but a horse, a white one. Then the boy was so full of joy because he had a horse, that he mounted on it and galloped back to his father. “Now I have a white horse, and I will travel,” said he. So he set out, and as he was on his way, a pen was lying on the road. At first he thought he would pick it up, but then again he thought to himself, “Thou shouldst leave it lying there; thou wilt easily find a pen where thou art going, if thou hast need of one.” As he was thus riding away, a voice called after him, “Ferdinand the Faithful, take it with thee.” He looked around, but saw no one, then he went back again and picked it up. When he had ridden a little way farther, he passed by a lake, and a fish was lying on the bank, gasping and panting for breath, so he said, “Wait, my dear fish, I will help thee get into the water,” and he took hold of it by the tail, and threw it into the lake."
"Then the fish put its head out of the water and said, “As thou hast helped me out of the mud I will give thee a flute; when thou art in any need, play on it, and then I will help thee, and if ever thou lettest anything fall in the water, just play and I will reach it out to thee.”"
"Then he rode away, and there came to him a man who asked him where he was going. “Oh, to the next place.” Then what his name was? “Ferdinand the Faithful.” “So! then we have got almost the same name, I am called Ferdinand the Unfaithful.” And they both set out to the inn in the nearest place."
"Now it was unfortunate that Ferdinand the Unfaithful knew everything that the other had ever thought and everything he was about to do; he knew it by means of all kinds of wicked arts. There was, however, in the inn an honest girl, who had a bright face and behaved very prettily. She fell in love with Ferdinand the Faithful because he was a handsome man, and she asked him whither he was going. “Oh, I am just travelling round about,” said he. Then she said he ought to stay there, for the King of that country wanted an attendant or an outrider, and he ought to enter his service. He answered he could not very well go to any one like that and offer himself. Then said the maiden, “Oh, but I will soon do that for you.” And so she went straight to the King, and told him that she knew of an excellent servant for him. He was well pleased with that, and had Ferdinand the Faithful brought to him, and wanted to make him his servant. He, however, liked better to be an outrider, for where his horse was, there he also wanted to be, so the King made him an outrider. When Ferdinand the Unfaithful learnt that, he said to the girl, “What! Dost thou help him and not me?” “Oh,” said the girl, “I will help thee too.” She thought, “I must keep friends with that man, for he is not to be trusted.” She went to the King, and offered him as a servant, and the King was willing."
"Now when the King met his lords in the morning, he always lamented and said, “Oh, if I had but my love with me.” Ferdinand the Unfaithful was, however, always hostile to Ferdinand the Faithful. So once, when the King was complaining thus, he said, “You have the outrider, send him away to get her, and if he does not do it, his head must be struck off.” Then the King sent for Ferdinand the Faithful, and told him that there was, in this place or in that place, a girl he loved, and that he was to bring her to him, and if he did not do it he should die."
"Ferdinand the Faithful went into the stable to his white horse, and complained and lamented, “Oh, what an unhappy man I am!” Then someone behind him cried, “Ferdinand the Faithful, why weepest thou?” He looked round but saw no one, and went on lamenting; “Oh, my dear little white horse, now must I leave thee; now must I die.” Then some one cried once more, “Ferdinand the Faithful, why weepest thou?” Then for the first time he was aware that it was his little white horse who was putting that question. “Dost thou speak, my little white horse; canst thou do that?” And again, he said, “I am to go to this place and to that, and am to bring the bride; canst thou tell me how I am to set about it?”"
"Then answered the little white horse, “Go thou to the King, and say if he will give thou what thou must have, thou wilt get her for him. If he will give thee a ship full of meat, and a ship full of bread, it will succeed. Great giants dwell on the lake, and if thou takest no meat with thee for them, they will tear thee to pieces, and there are the large birds which would pick the eyes out of thy head if thou hadst no bread for them.” Then the King made all the butchers in the land kill, and all the bakers bake, that the ships might be filled. When they were full, the little white horse said to Ferdinand the Faithful, “Now mount me, and go with me into the ship, and then when the giants come, say,"
"“Peace, peace, my dear little giants, I have had thought of ye, Something I have brought for ye;”"
"and when the birds come, thou shalt again say,"
"“Peace, peace, my dear little birds, I have had thought of ye, Something I have brought for ye;”"
"then they will do nothing to thee, and when thou comest to the castle, the giants will help thee. Then go up to the castle, and take a couple of giants with thee. There the princess lies sleeping; thou must, however, not awaken her, but the giants must lift her up, and carry her in her bed to the ship.” And now everything took place as the little white horse had said, and Ferdinand the Faithful gave the giants and the birds what he had brought with him for them, and that made the giants willing, and they carried the princess in her bed to the King."
"And when she came to the King, she said she could not live, she must have her writings, they had been left in her castle. Then by the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, Ferdinand the Faithful was called, and the King told him he must fetch the writings from the castle, or he should die. Then he went once more into the stable, and bemoaned himself and said, “Oh, my dear little white horse, now I am to go away again, how am I to do it?” Then the little white horse said he was just to load the ships full again. So it happened again as it had happened before, and the giants and the birds were satisfied, and made gentle by the meat. When they came to the castle, the white horse told Ferdinand the Faithful that he must go in, and that on the table in the princess’s bed-room lay the writings. And Ferdinand the Faithful went in, and fetched them. When they were on the lake, he let his pen fall into the water; then said the white horse, “Now I cannot help thee at all.” But he remembered his flute, and began to play on it, and the fish came with the pen in its mouth, and gave it to him. So he took the writings to the castle, where the wedding was celebrated."
"His courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order. The stone began to give way under his feet, and sank slowly down into the depths. When it was once more firm, and the tailor looked round, he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the former. Here, however, there was more to look at and to admire. Hollow places were cut in the walls, in which stood vases of transparent glass which were filled with colored spirit or with a bluish vapour. On the floor of the hall two great glass chests stood opposite to each other, which at once excited his curiosity. When he went to one of them he saw inside it a handsome structure like a castle surrounded by farm-buildings, stables and barns, and a quantity of other good things. Everything was small, but exceedingly carefully and delicately made, and seemed to be cut out by a dexterous hand with the greatest exactitude."
"He might not have turned away his eyes from the consideration of this rarity for some time, if the voice had not once more made itself heard."
"It ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was standing opposite. How his admiration increased when he saw therein a maiden of the greatest beauty! She lay as if asleep, and was wrapped in her long fair hair as in a precious mantle. Her eyes were closely shut, but the brightness of her complexion and a ribbon which her breathing moved to and fro, left no doubt that she was alive. The tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly opened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him in joyful terror. “Just Heaven!” cried she, “my deliverance is at hand! Quick, quick, help me out of my prison; if thou pushest back the bolt of this glass coffin, then I shall be free.” The tailor obeyed without delay, and she immediately raised up the glass lid, came out and hastened into the corner of the hall, where she covered herself with a large cloak. Then she seated herself on a stone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had imprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said, “My long-desired deliverer, kind Heaven has guided thee to me, and put an end to my sorrows. On the self-same day when they end, shall thy happiness begin. Thou art the husband chosen for me by Heaven, and shalt pass thy life in unbroken joy, loved by me, and rich to overflowing in every earthly possession. Seat thyself, and listen to the story of my life:"
"“I am the daughter of a rich count. My parents died when I was still in my tender youth, and recommended me in their last will to my elder brother, by whom I was brought up. We loved each other so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution never to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives. In our house there was no lack of company; neighbors and friends visited us often, and we showed the greatest hospitality to every one. So it came to pass one evening that a stranger came riding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to get on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night. We granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation intermingled with stories. My brother liked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us, to which, after some hesitation, he consented. We did not rise from table until late in the night, the stranger was shown to room, and I hastened, as I was tired, to lay my limbs in my soft bed. Hardly had I slept for a short time, when the sound of faint and delightful music awoke me. As I could not conceive from whence it came, I wanted to summon my waiting-maid who slept in the next room, but to my astonishment I found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown force. I felt as if a mountain were weighing down my breast, and was unable to make the very slightest sound. In the meantime, by the light of my night-lamp, I saw the stranger enter my room through two doors which were fast bolted. He came to me and said, that by magic arts which were at his command, he had caused the lovely music to sound in order to awaken me, and that he now forced his way through all fastenings with the intention of offering me his hand and heart. My repugnance to his magic arts was, however, so great, that I vouchsafed him no answer. He remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with the idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as I continued to keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself and find means to punish my pride, and left the room. I passed the night in the greatest disquietude, and only fell asleep towards morning. When I awoke, I hurried to my brother, but did not find him in his room, and the attendants told me that he had ridden forth with the stranger to the chase by daybreak."
"“I at once suspected nothing good. I dressed myself quickly, ordered my palfrey to be saddled, and accompanied only by one servant, rode full gallop to the forest. The servant fell with his horse, and could not follow me, for the horse had broken its foot. I pursued my way without halting, and in a few minutes I saw the stranger coming towards me with a beautiful stag which he led by a cord. I asked him where he had left my brother, and how he had come by this stag, out of whose great eyes I saw tears flowing. Instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly. I fell into a great rage at this, pulled out a pistol and discharged it at the monster; but the ball rebounded from his breast and went into my horse’s head. I fell to the ground, and the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of consciousness."
"“When I came to my senses again I found myself in this underground cave in a glass coffin. The magician appeared once again, and said he had changed my brother into a stag, my castle with all that belonged to it, diminished in size by his arts, he had shut up in the other glass chest, and my people, who were all turned into smoke, he had confined in glass bottles. He told me that if I would now comply with his wish, it was an easy thing for him to put everything back in its former state, as he had nothing to do but open the vessels, and everything would return once more to its natural form. I answered him as little as I had done the first time. He vanished and left me in my prison, in which a deep sleep came on me. Amongst the visions which passed before my eyes, that was the most comforting in which a young man came and set me free, and when I opened my eyes to-day I saw thee, and beheld my dream fulfilled. Help me to accomplish the other things which happened in those visions. The first is that we lift the glass chest in which my castle is enclosed, on to that broad stone.”"
"As soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with the maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening of the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could easily reach the open air. Here the maiden opened the lid, and it was marvellous to behold how the castle, the houses, and the farm buildings which were enclosed, stretched themselves out and grew to their natural size with the greatest rapidity. After this, the maiden and the tailor returned to the cave beneath the earth, and had the vessels which were filled with smoke carried up by the stone. The maiden had scarcely opened the bottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into living men, in whom she recognized her servants and her people. Her joy was still more increased when her brother, who had killed the magician in the form of the bull, came out of the forest towards them in his human form, and on the self-same day the maiden, in accordance with her promise, gave her hand at the altar to the lucky tailor."
164 Lazy Harry
"Harry was lazy, and although he had nothing else to do but drive his goat daily to pasture, he nevertheless groaned when he went home after his day’s work was done. “It is indeed a heavy burden,” said he, “and a wearisome employment to drive a goat into the field this way year after year, till late into the autumn! If one could but lie down and sleep, but no, one must have one’s eyes open lest it hurts the young trees, or squeezes itself through the hedge into a garden, or runs away altogether. How can one have any rest, or peace of one’s life?” He seated himself, collected his thoughts, and considered how he could set his shoulders free from this burden. For a long time all thinking was to no purpose, but suddenly it was as if scales fell from his eyes. “I know what I will do,” he cried, “I will marry fat Trina who has also a goat, and can take mine out with hers, and then I shall have no more need to trouble myself.”"
"So Harry got up, set his weary legs in motion, and went right across the street, for it was no farther, to where the parents of fat Trina lived, and asked for their industrious and virtuous daughter in marriage. The parents did not reflect long. “Birds of a feather, flock together,” they thought, and consented."
"So fat Trina became Harry’s wife, and led out both the goats. Harry had a good time of it, and had no work that he required to rest from but his own idleness. He only went out with her now and then, and said, “I merely do it that I may afterwards enjoy rest more, otherwise one loses all feeling for it.”"
"But fat Trina was no less idle. “Dear Harry,” said she one day, “why should we make our lives so toilsome when there is no need for it, and thus ruin the best days of our youth? Would it not be better for us to give the two goats which disturb us every morning in our sweetest sleep with their bleating, to our neighbor, and he will give us a beehive for them. We will put the beehive in a sunny place behind the house, and trouble ourselves no more about it. Bees do not require to be taken care of, or driven into the field; they fly out and find the way home again for themselves, and collect honey without giving the very least trouble.” “Thou hast spoken like a sensible woman,” replied Harry. “We will carry out thy proposal without delay, and besides all that, honey tastes better and nourishes one better than goat’s milk, and it can be kept longer too.”"
"The neighbor willingly gave a beehive for the two goats. The bees flew in and out from early morning till late evening without ever tiring, and filled the hive with the most beautiful honey, so that in autumn Harry was able to take a whole pitcherful out of it."
"They placed the jug on a board which was fixed to the wall of their bed-room, and as they were afraid that it might be stolen from them, or that the mice might find it, Trina brought in a stout hazel-stick and put it beside her bed, so that without unnecessary getting up she might reach it with her hand, and drive away the uninvited guests. Lazy Harry did not like to leave his bed before noon. “He who rises early,” said he, “wastes his substance.”"
"One morning when he was still lying amongst the feathers in broad daylight, resting after his long sleep, he said to his wife, “Women are fond of sweet things, and thou art always tasting the honey in private; it will be better for us to exchange it for a goose with a young gosling, before thou eatest up the whole of it.” “But,” answered Trina, “not before we have a child to take care of them! Am I to worry myself with the little geese, and spend all my strength on them to no purpose.” “Dost thou think,” said Harry, “that the youngster will look after geese? Now-a-days children no longer obey, they do according to their own fancy, because they consider themselves cleverer than their parents, just like that lad who was sent to seek the cow and chased three blackbirds.” “Oh,” replied Trina, “this one shall fare badly if he does not do what I say! I will take a stick and belabour his skin for him with more blows than I can count. Look, Harry,” cried she in her zeal, and seized the stick which she had to drive the mice away with, “Look, this is the way I will fall on him!” She reached her arm out to strike, but unhappily hit the honey-pitcher above the bed. The pitcher struck against the wall and fell down in fragments, and the fine honey streamed down on the ground. “There lie the goose and the young gosling,” said Harry, “and want no looking after. But it is lucky that the pitcher did not fall on my head. We have all reason to be satisfied with our lot.” And then as he saw that there was still some honey in one of the fragments he stretched out his hand for it, and said quite gaily, “The remains, my wife, we will still eat with a relish, and we will rest a little after the fright we have had. What matters if we do get up a little later the day is always long enough.”"
"“Yes,” answered Trina, “we shall always get to the end of it at the proper time. Dost thou know that the snail was once asked to a wedding and set out to go, but arrived at the christening. In front of the house it fell over the fence, and said, ‘Speed does no good.’”"
165 The Griffin
"There was once upon a time a King, but where he reigned and what he was called, I do not know. He had no son, but an only daughter who had always been ill, and no doctor had been able to cure her. Then it was foretold to the King that his daughter should eat herself well with an apple. So he ordered it to be proclaimed throughout the whole of his kingdom, that whosoever brought his daughter an apple with which she could eat herself well, should have her to wife, and be King. This became known to a peasant who had three sons, and he said to the eldest, “Go out into the garden and take a basketful of those beautiful apples with the red cheeks and carry them to the court; perhaps the King’s daughter will be able to eat herself well with them, and then thou wilt marry her and be King.” The lad did so, and set out."
"When he had gone a short way he met a little iron man who asked him what he had there in the basket, to which replied Uele, for so was he named, “Frogs’ legs.” On this the little man said, “Well, so shall it be, and remain,” and went away. At length Uele arrived at the palace, and made it known that he had brought apples which would cure the King’s daughter if she ate them. This delighted the King hugely, and he caused Uele to be brought before him; but, alas! when he opened the basket, instead of having apples in it he had frogs’ legs which were still kicking about. On this the King grew angry, and had him driven out of the house. When he got home he told his father how it had fared with him. Then the father sent the next son, who was called Seame, but all went with him just as it had gone with Uele. He also met the little iron man, who asked what he had there in the basket. Seame said, “Hogs’"
"bristles,” and the iron man said, “well, so shall it be, and remain.”"
"When Seame got to the King’s palace and said he brought apples with which the King’s daughter might eat herself well, they did not want to let him go in, and said that one fellow had already been there, and had treated them as if they were fools. Seame, however, maintained that he certainly had the apples, and that they ought to let him go in. At length they believed him, and led him to the King. But when he uncovered the basket, he had but hogs’ bristles. This enraged the King most terribly, so he caused Seame to be whipped out of the house. When he got home he related all that had befallen him, then the youngest boy, whose name was Hans, but who was always called Stupid Hans, came and asked his father if he might go with some apples. “Oh!” said the father, “thou wouldst be just the right fellow for such a thing! If the clever ones can’t manage it, what canst thou do?” The boy, however, did not believe him, and said, “Indeed, father, I wish to go.” “Just get away, thou stupid fellow, thou must wait till thou art wiser,” said the father to that, and turned his back. Hans, however, pulled at the back of his smock-frock and said, “Indeed, father, I wish to go.” “Well, then, so far as I am concerned thou mayst go, but thou wilt soon come home again!” replied the old man in a spiteful voice. The boy, however, was tremendously delighted and jumped for joy. “Well, act like a fool!"
"thou growest more stupid every day!” said the father again. Hans, however, did not care about that, and did not let it spoil his pleasure, but as it was then night, he thought he might as well wait until the morrow, for he could not get to court that day. All night long he could not sleep in his bed, and if he did doze for a moment, he dreamt of beautiful maidens, of palaces, of gold, and of silver, and all kinds of things of that sort. Early in the morning, he went forth on his way, and directly afterwards the little shabby-looking man in his iron clothes, came to him and asked what he was carrying in the basket. Hans gave him the answer that he was carrying apples with which the King’s daughter was to eat herself well. “Then,” said the little man, “so shall they be, and remain.” But at the court they would none of them let Hans go in, for they said two had already been there who had told them that they were bringing apples, and one of them had frogs’ legs, and the other hogs’ bristles. Hans, however, resolutely maintained that he most certainly had no frogs’ legs, but some of the most beautiful apples in the whole kingdom. As he spoke so pleasantly, the door-keeper thought he could not be telling a lie, and asked him to go in, and he was right, for when Hans uncovered his basket in the King’s presence, golden-yellow apples came tumbling out. The King was delighted, and caused some of them to be taken to his daughter, and then waited in anxious expectation until news should be brought to him of the effect they had. But before much time had passed by, news was brought to him: but who do you think it was who came? it was his daughter herself! As soon as she had eaten of those apples, she was cured, and sprang out of her bed. The joy the King felt cannot be described! but now he did not want to give his daughter in marriage to Hans, and said he must first make him a boat which would go quicker on dry land than on water. Hans agreed to the conditions, and went home, and related how it had fared with him. Then the father sent Uele into the forest to make a boat of that kind. He worked diligently, and whistled all the time. At mid-day, when the sun was at the highest, came the little iron man and asked what he was making? Uele gave him for answer, “Wooden bowls for the kitchen.” The iron man said, “So it shall be, and remain.” By evening Uele thought he had now made the boat, but when he wanted to get into it, he had nothing but wooden bowls. The next day Seame went into the forest, but everything went with him just as it had done with Uele. On the third day Stupid Hans went. He worked away most industriously, so that the whole forest resounded with the heavy strokes, and all the while he sang and whistled right merrily. At mid-day, when it was the hottest, the little man came again, and asked what he was making? “A boat which will go quicker on dry land than on the water,” replied Hans, “and when I have finished it, I am to have the King’s daughter for my wife.” “Well,”"
"said the little man, “such an one shall it be, and remain.” In the evening, when the sun had turned into gold, Hans finished his boat, and all that was wanted for it. He got into it and rowed to the palace. The boat went as swiftly as the wind. The King saw it from afar, but would not give his daughter to Hans yet, and said he must first take a hundred hares out to pasture from early morning until late evening, and if one of them got away, he should not have his daughter. Hans was contented with this, and the next day went with his flock to the pasture, and took great care that none of them ran away."
"Before many hours had passed came a servant from the palace, and told Hans that he must give her a hare instantly, for some visitors had come unexpectedly. Hans, however, was very well aware what that meant, and said he would not give her one; the King might set some hare soup before his guest next day. The maid, however, would not believe in his refusal, and at last she began to get angry with him. Then Hans said that if the King’s daughter came herself, he would give her a hare. The maid told this in the palace, and the daughter did go herself. In the meantime, however, the little man came again to Hans, and asked him what he was doing there? He said he had to watch over a hundred hares and see that none of them ran away, and then he might marry the King’s daughter and be King. “Good,” said the little man, “there is a whistle for thee, and if one of them runs away, just whistle with it, and then it will come back again.” When the King’s daughter came, Hans gave her a hare into her apron; but when she had gone about a hundred steps with it, he whistled, and the hare jumped out of the apron, and before she could turn round was back to the flock again. When the evening came the hare-herd whistled once more, and looked to see if all were there, and then drove them to the palace. The King wondered how Hans had been able to take a hundred hares to graze without losing any of them; he would, however, not give him his daughter yet, and said he must now bring him a feather from the Griffin’s tail. Hans set out at once, and walked straight forwards. In the evening he came to a castle, and there he asked for a night’s lodging, for at that time there were no inns. The lord of the castle promised him that with much pleasure, and asked where he was going? Hans answered, “To the Griffin.” “Oh! to the Griffin! They tell me he knows everything, and I have lost the key of an iron money-chest; so you might be so good as to ask him where it is.” “Yes, indeed,” said Hans, “I will do that.” Early the next morning he went onwards, and on his way arrived at another castle in which he again stayed the night. When the people who lived there learnt that he was going to the Griffin, they said they had in the house a daughter who was ill, and that they had already tried every means to cure her, but none of them had done her any good, and he might be so kind as to ask the Griffin what would make their daughter healthy again? Hans said he would willingly do that, and went onwards. Then he came to a lake, and instead of a ferry-boat, a tall, tall man was there who had to carry everybody across. The man asked Hans whither he was journeying?"
"“To the Griffin,” said Hans. “Then when you get to him,” said the man, “just ask him why I am forced to carry everybody over the lake.” “Yes, indeed, most certainly I’ll do that,” said Hans. Then the man took him up on his shoulders, and carried him across. At length Hans arrived at the Griffin’s house, but the wife only was at home, and not the Griffin himself. Then the woman asked him what he wanted? Thereupon he told her everything;—that he had to get a feather out of the Griffin’s tail, and that there was a castle where they had lost the key of their money-chest, and he was to ask the Griffin where it was?—that in another castle the daughter was ill, and he was to learn what would cure her?—and then not far from thence there was a lake and a man beside it, who was forced to carry people across it, and he was very anxious to learn why the man was obliged to do it. Then said the woman, “But look here, my good friend, no Christian can speak to the Griffin; he devours them all; but if you like, you can lie down under his bed, and in the night, when he is quite fast asleep, you can reach out and pull a feather out of his tail, and as for those things which you are to learn, I will ask about them myself.” Hans was quite satisfied with this, and got under the bed. In the evening, the Griffin came home, and as soon as he entered the room, said, “Wife, I smell a Christian.”"
"“Yes,” said the woman, “one was here to-day, but he went away again;”"
and on that the Griffin said no more.
"In the middle of the night when the Griffin was snoring loudly, Hans reached out and plucked a feather from his tail. The Griffin woke up instantly, and said, “Wife, I smell a Christian, and it seems to me that somebody was pulling at my tail.” His wife said, “Thou hast certainly been dreaming, and I told thee before that a Christian was here to-day, but that he went away again. He told me all kinds of things that in one castle they had lost the key of their money-chest, and could find it nowhere.” “Oh! the fools!” said the Griffin; “the key lies in the wood-house under a log of wood behind the door.” “And then he said that in another castle the daughter was ill, and they knew no remedy that would cure her.” “Oh! the fools!” said the Griffin; “under the cellar-steps a toad has made its nest of her hair, and if she got her hair back she would be well.” “And then he also said that there was a place where there was a lake and a man beside it who was forced to carry everybody across.” “Oh, the fool!” said the Griffin; “if he only put one man down in the middle, he would never have to carry another across.” Early the next morning the Griffin got up and went out. Then Hans came forth from under the bed, and he had a beautiful feather, and had heard what the Griffin had said about the key, and the daughter, and the ferry-man. The Griffin’s wife repeated it all once more to him that he might not forget it, and then he went home again. First he came to the man by the lake, who asked him what the Griffin had said, but Hans replied that he must first carry him across, and then he would tell him. So the man carried him across, and when he was over Hans told him that all he had to do was to set one person down in the middle of the lake, and then he would never have to carry over any more. The man was hugely delighted, and told Hans that out of gratitude he would take him once more across, and back again. But Hans said no, he would save him the trouble, he was quite satisfied already, and pursued his way."
"Then he came to the castle where the daughter was ill; he took her on his shoulders, for she could not walk, and carried her down the cellar-steps and pulled out the toad’s nest from beneath the lowest step and gave it into her hand, and she sprang off his shoulder and up the steps before him, and was quite cured. Then were the father and mother beyond measure rejoiced, and they gave Hans gifts of gold and of silver, and whatsoever else he wished for, that they gave him. And when he got to the other castle he went at once into the wood-house, and found the key under the log of wood behind the door, and took it to the lord of the castle. He also was not a little pleased, and gave Hans as a reward much of the gold that was in the chest, and all kinds of things besides, such as cows, and sheep, and goats. When Hans arrived before the King, with all these things—with the money, and the gold, and the silver and the cows, sheep and goats, the King asked him how he had come by them. Then Hans told him that the Griffin gave every one whatsoever he wanted. So the King thought he himself could make such things useful, and set out on his way to the Griffin; but when he got to the lake, it happened that he was the very first who arrived there after Hans, and the man put him down in the middle of it and went away, and the King was drowned. Hans, however, married the daughter, and became King."
166 Strong Hans
"There were once a man and a woman who had an only child, and lived quite alone in a solitary valley. It came to pass that the mother once went into the wood to gather branches of fir, and took with her little Hans, who was just two years old. As it was spring-time, and the child took pleasure in the many-coloured flowers, she went still further onwards with him into the forest. Suddenly two robbers sprang out of the thicket, seized the mother and child, and carried them far away into the black forest, where no one ever came from one year’s end to another. The poor woman urgently begged the robbers to set her and her child free, but their hearts were made of stone, they would not listen to her prayers and entreaties, and drove her on farther by force. After they had worked their way through bushes and briars for about two miles, they came to a rock where there was a door, at which the robbers knocked and it opened at once. They had to go through a long dark passage, and at last came into a great cavern, which was lighted by a fire which burnt on the hearth. On the wall hung swords, sabres, and other deadly weapons which gleamed in the light, and in the midst stood a black table at which four other robbers were sitting gambling, and the captain sat at the head of it. As soon as he saw the woman he came and spoke to her, and told her to be at ease and have no fear, they would do nothing to hurt her, but she must look after the house-keeping, and if she kept everything in order, she should not fare ill with them. Thereupon they gave her something to eat, and showed her a bed where she might sleep with her child."
"The woman stayed many years with the robbers, and Hans grew tall and strong. His mother told him stories, and taught him to read an old book of tales about knights which she found in the cave. When Hans was nine years old, he made himself a strong club out of a branch of fir, hid it behind the bed, and then went to his mother and said, “Dear mother, pray tell me who is my father; I must and will know.” His mother was silent and would not tell him, that he might not become home-sick; moreover she knew that the godless robbers would not let him go away, but it almost broke her heart that Hans should not go to his father. In the night, when the robbers came home from their robbing expedition, Hans brought out his club, stood before the captain, and said, “I now wish to know who is my father, and if thou dost not at once tell me I will strike thee down.” Then the captain laughed, and gave Hans such a box on the ear that he rolled under the table. Hans got up again, held his tongue, and thought, “I will wait another year and then try again, perhaps I shall do better then.” When the year was over, he brought out his club again, rubbed the dust off it, looked at it well, and said, “It is a stout strong club.” At night the robbers came home, drank one jug of wine after another, and their heads began to be heavy. Then Hans brought out his club, placed himself before the captain, and asked him who was his father? But the captain again gave him such a vigorous box on the ear that Hans rolled under the table, but it was not long before he was up again, and beat the captain and the robbers so with his club, that they could no longer move either their arms or their legs. His mother stood in a corner full of admiration of his bravery and strength. When Hans had done his work, he went to his mother, and said, “Now I have shown myself to be in earnest, but now I must also know who is my father.” “Dear Hans,” answered the mother, “come, we will go and seek him until we find him.” She took from the captain the key to the entrance-door, and Hans fetched a great meal-sack and packed into it gold and silver, and whatsoever else he could find that was beautiful, until it was full, and then he took it on his back. They left the cave, but how Hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness into daylight, and saw the green forest, and the flowers, and the birds, and the morning sun in the sky. He stood there and wondered at everything just as if he had not been very wise. His mother looked for the way home, and when they had walked for a couple of hours, they got safely into their lonely valley and to their little house. The father was sitting in the doorway. He wept for joy when he recognized his wife and heard that Hans was his son, for he had long regarded them both as dead. But Hans, although he was not twelve years old, was a head taller than his father. They went into the little room together, but Hans had scarcely put his sack on the bench by the stove, than the whole house began to crack the bench broke down and then the floor, and the heavy sack fell through into the cellar. “God save us!” cried the father, “what’s that? Now thou hast broken our little house to pieces!” “Don’t grow any grey hairs about that, dear father,” answered Hans; “there, in that sack, is more than is wanting for a new house.” The father and Hans at once began to build a new house; to buy cattle and land, and to keep a farm. Hans ploughed the fields, and when he followed the plough and pushed it into the ground, the bullocks had scarcely any need to draw. The next spring, Hans said, “Ke"

Francesco looked at the duke through a mist of tears.
"""You know?"" he faltered."
"""For this I came!"" replied the duke, extending his hand. ""You will"
find her whom your heart seeks. Like a golden dawn shall she rise out
"of the past. Blow your horn! Let us not tarry!"""
CHAPTER VIII
THE ANCHORESS OF NARNI
Six days had passed. Once more the sun had tossed night from the sky
and kindled hope in the hymning east. The bleak wilderness barriered
by sea and crag had mellowed into the golden silence of the autumnal
woods. The very trees seemed tongued with prophetic flame. The world
leaped radiant out of the dawn.
"Through the reddened woods rode Francesco, the Duke of Spoleto silent"
"by his side. Gloom still reigned on the pale, haggard face and there"
was no lustre in the eyes that challenged ever the lurking shade of
Death. Six nights and six days had the quest been baffled. Near and
far armor glimmered in the reddened sanctuaries of the woods. Not a
disappeared as he closed upon it.
There was a great wrath in his eyes.
"""We ride at sun-rise!"""
"""Our goal?""--"
"""To Naples!""--"
"The dawn was streaking the east with faint gold, and transient"
"sunshafts touched the woods, when Francesco stood before the doorway"
of his lodge of pine boughs. The men of the Duke of Spoleto were
"gathering in on every side, some girding their swords, others"
"tightening their shield-straps, as they came."
The duke ordered a single horn to sound the rally.
"The glade was full of stir and action. Companies were forming up,"
shoulder to shoulder; spears danced and swayed; horses steamed in the
brisk morning air.
"At last the tents sank down, and, as the sun cleared the trees, the"
"armed array rolled out from the woods into a stretch of open land,"
that sloped towards the bold curves of a river.
"On that morning Francesco felt almost happy, as his fingers gripped"
his sword and he cantered along by the side of the duke. The great
heart of the world seemed to beat with his.
"""The day of reckoning has come at last!"" he said to the leader of the"
free lances.
"“I don’t understand,” she began feebly. And then the darkness fell upon"
"her, and her limbs relaxed. She swayed sideways and would have fallen,"
but he caught her in his arms and laid her on the couch.
"“Thank you,” she murmured faintly."
"She hid her face in her hands and remained, crouched up, quite still, in"
"a stupor of misery. The Canon stood over her helplessly, unable to find"
a word of comfort.
The sight of her prostration did not move him. He had been wounded to
"the very depths of his being. His pride, his honour, his dignity were"
lacerated in their vitals. He burned with the sense of unpardonable
wrong.
"“It is self-evident,” he said at last, “that we must part. Our remaining"
together would be a sin against God and an outrage upon Society.”
"She rased herself wearily, with one hand on the couch, and shook her"
head slowly.
“Such things are beyond me. No one will ever know.”
"“There is One who will always know, Yvonne.”"
"She pondered over the saying, as far as her tired, bewildered brain"
allowed. It conveyed very little meaning to her. Theology had not
altered her child-like conception of the benevolence of the Creator.
After a long time she was able to disentangle an idea from the
confusion.

These saddle bags are most fascinating. They are coarsely woven in bands
"of raw black-rusty wool, with varying bands of raw white wool or hemp or"
cotton--the bands and stripes of varying widths going cross-wise. And on
"the pale bands are woven sometimes flowers in most lovely colours,"
"rose-red and blue and green, peasant patterns--and sometimes fantastic"
"animals, beasts, in dark wool again. So that these striped zebra bags,"
"some wonderful gay with flowery colours on their stripes, some weird"
"with fantastic, griffin-like animals, are a whole landscape in"
themselves.
The train has only first and third class. It costs about thirty francs
"for the two of us, third class to Mandas, which is some sixty miles. In"

"""I'm not done with the first yet,"" Linus Brein said quietly. ""There"
remains the random search group. Therein lies the eight-oughts-one
"positive probability."""
"Viggon snorted. ""I call ten to the minus ten chances rather hopeless."
"But go on, Linus."""
"""The other has a sixty-forty chance,"" he said. ""If the infrawave"
detector locates the space rift that lies along our coordinate three
"seventy-six, when the ship is near seven sixty-seven, then the scout"
craft will pass within magnetic detection range of the lifeship. That's
"a lot of 'ifs', I know, but they add up to a sixty-forty chance. I"
say this because space rifts tend to produce strong responses in any
of the primitive detecting gear. They've certainly been busy running
"down space warps, which indicates that they've been getting a lot"
"of spurious responses."" He smiled. ""If space were entirely clear of"
"foreign matter and space rifts, they'd find their new detector vaguely"
"inefficient. I--"""
Viggon waved a hand to indicate he had heard enough.
"""Gentlemen,"" he said quietly. ""I've been criticized for waiting, but"
what one man calls study the other man calls timidity. We'll continue
"to wait for the final factor. Then we'll know...."""

There was the basic aggregate of nine full squadrons spread out flat in
a space lattice that ran back and forth from narrow end to wide end of
the cone of probability. There was one full squadron of roving ships
"that went aimlessly back and forth across the pattern, just to cope"
with the happenstance factor.
One squadron was parked at either end of the search grid as space
"markers, with a computer ship at either end to maintain a constant"
check on their space coordinates. The big search pattern shuttled from
"one end to the other, and if they came back to miss the marker ships,"
they retraced their path so that no space went uncombed.

The tiny sun had leaped up over Jupiter's horizon; and with its
appearance they had sent the ship planing toward their mysterious
"destination. Beneath them the fog banks were thinning, and ahead of"
them were no clouds. For some reason there was a clarity unusual to
Jupiter's atmosphere in the air above the red section.

Brand.
He and Dex peered intently through the port glass panel. Ahead and far
"below, their eyes caught an odd metallic sheen. It was as though the"
ground there were carpeted with polished steel that reflected red
firelight.
"Tense, filled with an excitement that set their pulses pounding"
"wildly, they angled slowly down, nearer to the edge of the vast"
"crimson area, closer to the ground. The radio keened its monotonous"
signal.
"Brand crawled to the transmitter, laboriously, for his body tipped the"
scales here at nearly four hundred pounds.
"""We can see the metallic glitter that Journeyman spoke of,"" he said."
"""No sign of life of any kind, though. The red glow seems to flicker a"

Closer the ship floated. Closer. To right and left of them for vast
distances stretched the red area. Ahead of them for hundreds of miles
they knew it extended.

COPYRIGHT
On the reverse of the title-page is ordinarily placed the copyright
"notice of the volume,[46] usually a little above the center, set in"
"caps and small caps, or in small caps alone. At the foot of this same"
page the printer usually places his imprint.[47]
DEDICATION
"The dedication is a page set in the monumental style, generally in"
"small capitals. This must always be a right-hand page, and the reverse"
must always be blank.
PREFACE
Ordinarily the preface is set in the same size of type as the body. If
"it is written by some one other than the author, it is frequently set"
in italic to mark the distinction. This is particularly true in case
the book contains an introduction as well. If the preface is of unusual
"importance, it is sometimes customary to have it set in type one size"
"larger than the body, or double-leaded."
TABLE OF CONTENTS
After the preface and before the list of illustrations comes the
"contents, occupying whatever number of pages may be necessary. The"
style of its composition is dependent entirely upon the subject-matter
and the typographical arrangement of the volume.

cheek glared at the duke from under his upreared arm. So close were
they that blood spattered in the duke's face as the Frangipani blew
the red stream from his mouth and beard.
"[Illustration: ""'They lied,' he cried. 'Give me but life.'""]"
"The duke broke away, wheeled and came again. He lashed home, split the"
Frangipani's collar-bone even through the rags of his hauberk. The
"Frangipani yelped like a gored hound. Rabid, dazed, he began to make"
blind rushes that boded ill for him. The swords began to leap and to
"sing, while blinding flashes of lightning followed each other in quick"
succession and thunder rolled in deafening echoes through the heavens.
"Cut and counter-cut rang through the night, like the cry of axes,"
whirled by woodmen's hands.
Suddenly the Frangipani parried an upper cut and stabbed at the duke.
The sword point missed him a hair's breadth. Before he could guard the
"duke was upon him like a leopard. Both men smote together, both swords"
met with a sound that seemed to shake the rocks. The Frangipani's
blade snapped at the hilt.
"He stood still for a moment as one dazed, then plucked out his poniard"
"and made a spring. A merciless down cut beat him back. His courage,"
"his assurance seemed to ebb from him on a sudden, as though the blow"
"had broken his soul. He fell on his knees and held up his hands, with"
"a thick, choking cry."
"""Mercy! God's mercy!"""
"""Curse you! Had you pity on your victims?"""
Thunder crashed overhead; the girdles of the sky were loosed. A
"""Hello, white folks! Here we are, all together again."""
They turned to behold a villanous-looking man beaming benignly upon
"them. He was dirty, his clothes were in rags, and through a riotous"
bristle of beard that hid his thin features a mangy patch showed on
"either cheek. It was undeniably ""Fingerless"" Fraser, but how changed,"
how altered from that radiant flower of indolence they had known! He
"was pallid, emaciated, and bedraggled; his attitude showed hunger and"
"abuse, and his bony joints seemed about to pierce through their"
"tattered covering. As they stood speechless with amazement, he made his"
identification complete by protruding his tongue from the corner of his
mouth and gravely closing one eye in a wink of exceeding wisdom.
"""Fraser!"" they cried in chorus, then fell upon him noisily, shaking his"
grimy hands and slapping his back until he coughed weakly. Summoned by
"their shouts, Big George broke in upon the incoherent greeting, and at"
sight of his late comrade began to laugh hoarsely.
"""Glad to see you, old man!"" he cried, ""but how did you get here?"""
"Fraser drew himself up with injured dignity, then spoke in dramatic"
"accents. ""I worked my way!"" He showed the whites of his eyes,"
tragically.
"""You look like you'd walked in from Kansas,"" George declared."
"""Yes, sir, I _worked! Me!""_"

THE ART OF PRESCRIBING
The prescription should be as brief and simple as possible. It should be
explicit and clearly written. It may be expressed either in Latin or in
English. The manner in which the medicine is to be used should be
"specified. Important instructions as to the rule, systematic regulations"
or diet of the patient are sometimes necessary.
Prescriptions usually contain two or more of the following four
representative constituents: (1) The _basis_ or active ingredients. The
practice of conjoining several active medicines has wisely been
"abandoned. Occasionally, however, it may be advantageous to give"
together two medicines producing their effects in somewhat different
"ways. Thus, spasms of the bowels are more often effectually controlled"
by the conjunction of a stimulant like ether and an anodyne like opium
than by either given alone. Pain which is not alleviated by either
morphine or atropine is sometimes abated by giving them together. (2)
"The _adjuvant_ is introduced in order to increase, moderate or modify"
the action of the basis. Frequently its chief object is to insure
solubility and ready absorption. (3) A _corrective_ is occasionally
The duke ignited a pine-wood torch. The blue resinous light spluttered
in the wind.
"Three times he circled it above his head, then he flung it into the"
sea.
"""Bernardo Sarriano and the Pisan galleys,"" he turned to Francesco."
"""They are heading for the Cape of Circé."""
A shout of command rang through the woods.
As with phantom cohorts the forest-aisles teemed with moving shadows.
A ride of some five miles lay between them and the Cape of Circé. Much
of that region was wild forest land and moor; bleak rocky wastes let
"into woods and gloom. Great oaks, gnarled, vast, terrible, held giant"
sway amid the huddled masses of the underbrush. Here the wild boar
lurked and the wolf hunted. But for the most it was dark and
"calamitous, a ghostly wilderness forsaken by man."
As they rode along they struck the occasional trail of the Crusaders
"of the Church. A burnt hamlet, a smoking farmhouse with a dun mist"
"hanging over it like a shroud, and once they stumbled upon the body of"
a dead girl. They halted for a brief space to give her burial. The
duke's men dug a shallow grave under an oak and they left her there
and went on their way with greater caution.
"""There is one man on earth to whom I owe a debt,"" the duke, leading"
"the van beside Francesco, turned to the latter, ""a debt that shall be"
"paid this night, principal and interest."""
"Francesco looked up into the duke's face, and by the glare of the now"
"Lampert, as it breezed up again."
"And five minutes' later, while Lampert was lighting his pipe half-way"
"down the cabin stairs, he heard a bellow forward which made him drop"
thoughts of tobacco.
"""Breakers ahead!"""
The watch came out on deck and ran aft; and were followed by the
"watch below in various articles of attire, not calculated to keep"
them very warm.
The _Potluck_ had been running with the wind nearly dead aft.
"""Starboard, starboard!"" roared Lampert.  ""Oh, steady; hold her there!"""
The vessel ran off to port at a sharp angle to her wake.
"""Up here some,"" yelled the mate, ""and set the spanker!  Stand by"
"the----  My God!"""
"And, as old Jones and Simcox came on deck, the _Potluck_ was hard and"
fast ashore.  With one simultaneous crack the three topmasts went
"over the side, and as the men and officers jumped under the shelter"
"of the weather rail, Lampert and those of the watch who were with him"
came tumbling down from the poop.  They reckoned on a boiling sea
coming after and sweeping them away.  But though the malignity native
"to matter had set the _Potluck_ ashore, by good luck she was hard and"
fast in the one sheltered cove on the island.  When Lampert by
"instinct altered her course to port, as he heard the coast breakers"
"at the starboard bow, he had run her in between two ledges of rock,"
of which the outer or more westerly one acted as a complete
himself outside.
There was little to be discerned clearly when he emerged into the cool
"damp darkness, only a dim heap of writhing bodies as in some combat of"
hounds or of the denizens of the midnight forest. But Rollo once and
again saw a flash of steel and a hand uplifted to strike. Without
waiting to think he gripped that which was topmost and therefore nearest
"to him, and finding it unexpectedly light, he swung the thing clear by"
the garment he had clutched. As he did so he felt a pain in his right
"shoulder, which at the time appeared no more than the bite of a squirrel"
"or the sting of a bee. With one heave he threw the object, human or not"
"he could not for the moment determine, behind him into the blackness of"
the hall.
"""Take hold there, somebody!"" he cried, for by this time he could hear"
the clattering of the feet of his followers on the stairs and flagged
"where to find Vance and the woman. Now."""
"""Were they responsible?"""
"""With deepest apologies, that need not trouble you."" He stood ramrod"
straight.
"""With deepest apologies, Sato-sama, it troubles me very much."" Nogami"
"examined his cigar. ""This entire affair is very troublesome. In times"
past I remember a certain prejudice in favor of civility on the part of
"Tokyo. Have things really changed that much?"""
"""The moment for soft words is past. Tonight ended that."""
"Nogami drew on his cigar. ""Assuming you locate Vance, what action do"
"you propose taking?"""
"defenders, roused from their feast of blood, had poured all their"
"defences towards the point of attack, leaving the northern slope to"
look to itself.
As they rode down the ravine there came from the bottom of the valley
the sharp yelp of a dog. It was instantly answered by a similar bark
from the very top of the castello.
"""No two dogs ever had the same voice,"" the duke turned to Francesco."
"""They must be hell-hounds, whom the fiend has trained to one tune. But"
"what is that yonder? A goat picking its way?"""
"""A goat walking on its hind legs!"""
"""Are there horns on its head?"""
"""No!""--"
"""Then it is not the Evil One! Forward, my men!"""
The pause that preceded the breaking of the storm had been unnaturally
"long. Save for the gleam of the lightnings, the waters had grown to an"
"inky blackness. There came one long moment, when the atmosphere sank"
under the weight of a sudden heat. Then the ever increasing thunder
"rushed upon the silence with a mighty roar and out of the west, driven"
"by the hurricane, came a long line of white waves, that rose as they"
"advanced, till the very Tritons beat their heads and the nymphs"
scurried down to greener depths.
"And now a sudden streak of fire hissed from the clouds, followed by a"
crash as if all the bolts of heaven had been let off at once. From the
"ramparts of Astura came cries of alarm, the din of battle, the blaring"
"""Yes, we were fortunate in getting such good ones."""
"""You were fortunate in many ways. In fact you are a very lucky young"
"man."""
"""Indeed! How?"""
"""Well, don't you think you were lucky to beat that strike?"""
"""It wasn't altogether luck. However, I do consider myself fortunate in"
"escaping at the last moment,"" Boyd laughed easily. ""By the way, what"
"happened to the man they mistook for me?"""
"""Let him go, I believe. I didn't pay much attention to the matter."""
"Marsh had been using his eyes to good advantage, and, seeing the work"
"even better in hand than he had supposed, he was moved by irritation"
and the desire to goad his opponent to say more than he had intended:
"""I rather think you will have a lot to explain, one of these days,"" he"
"said, with deliberate menace."
"""With fifty thousand cases of salmon aboard _The Bedford Castle_ I will"
"explain anything. Meanwhile the police may go to the devil!"" The cool"
assurance of the young man's tone roused his would-be tormentor like a
personal affront.
"""You got away from Seattle, but there is a commissioner at Dutch"
"Harbor, also a deputy marshal, who may have better success with a"
"warrant than those policemen had."" The Trust's manager could not keep"
"down the angry tremor in his voice, and the other, perceiving it,"
replied in a manner designed to inflame him still more:
"""Yes, I have heard of those officers. I understand they are both in"
a prolonged war.
But the immediate reality became too overwhelming. Grey multitudes were
"sweeping khaki multitudes before them. High-explosives, shrapnel,"
"grenades, bombs, bullets were rending, piercing, and shattering the"
living flesh and muscle and bone. Towns and villages were being turned
"into heaps of brick and wreckage. Hordes of old men, women, and children"
"were thronging the roads, and fleeing from approaching disaster."
"We went to work as usual although we worked less than usual, for we now"
had something to talk about. Would the Germans reach the coast? If they
"did, then the northern armies would be cut off and destroyed. A general"
retreat from our front might be ordered at any moment. We stood in
groups and discussed these problems hour by hour.
One day we were returning from work and passing through the village. A
"crowd of civilians was standing round the window of the Mairie, where a"
"written notice was exposed. An old woman dressed in black was moaning,"
"""Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, mon Dieu."" The '19, '20, and '21 classes had been"
called up.
Then the German advance came to an end. A French army had arrived and
saved the situation. The shelling of the back areas had ceased. The
danger was over for a time.
Had the Germans assembled all their strength for one supreme attempt at
breaking through the Western Front? Or was it only the beginning of a
whole series of operations?
"One morning, as we woke up, we heard the roar and rumble of a"
"bombardment. We did not take much notice of it, for we had heard the"
sound so often.
"""Don't waste your breath on them,"" Boyd advised. ""We're lucky enough as"
"it is. If that tug hadn't sheered off she would have cut us down, sure."""
"""That fellow done it a-purpose,"" George swore. ""Seamen ain't that"
"careless. He tried to tell me he was rattled, but I rattled _him_."""
"""If that's the case they may try it again,"" said the younger man."
"""Huh! I'll pack a 'thirty-thirty' from now on, and I bet they don't get"
"within hailing distance without an iron-clad."""
"The more calmly Emerson regarded the incident, the more he marvelled at"
"the good-fortune that had saved him. ""We had better wake up,"" he said."
"""We have been asleep so far. If Marsh planned this, he will plan"
"something more."""
"""Yes, and if he puts one wallop over we're done for,"" George agreed,"
"pessimistically. ""I'll keep a watchman aboard the scows hereafter."
"That's our vital spot."""
"But the days sped past without further interference, and the"
"construction of the plant progressed by leaps and bounds, while _The"
"Bedford Castle_, having discharged her cargo, steamed away to return in"
August.
"The middle of June brought the first king salmon, scouts sent on ahead"
"of the ""sockeyes;"" but Boyd made no effort to take advantage of this"
"run, laboring manfully to prepare for the advance of the main army,"
"that terrific horde that was soon to come from the mysterious depths,"
"either to make or ruin him. Once the run proper started, there would be"
no more opportunity for building or for setting up machinery. He must
be ready and waiting by the first of July.
'Therefore I refuse to regard as hopeless the idea of an
"American-Anglo-Japanese alliance, guaranteeing the peaceful development"
of the vast resources of the Far East. Such an alliance exists
"essentially now--an alliance springing from cognate ideas, wishes,"
purposes and principles. This is the best possible foundation for that
formal compact which the evolution of industry and commerce seems to me
unmistakably to foreshadow.'

NOTE TO DIALOGUE V.

following communication printed in the _Outlook_. I take the liberty of
"subjoining it herewith, without any vain intention of flaunting the"
virtues of my countrymen.--K.S.
JAPANESE CHARACTER
_To the Editor of the_ OUTLOOK
"SIR,--I have received during the last few weeks letters bearing such"
eloquent testimony to the nobility of Japanese character that I am
sending you some extracts in the hope of your publishing them. The
"letters are from a friend of mine, who with her husband has lived in"
"Yokohama for many years, and can therefore speak with considerable"
authority. The first extract is about the soldiers themselves--
"Mine you know is a busy life, and I found work among the military"
forward.
"“Stop!” he roared. “You young whelp, if you----”"
"He broke off with a gurgling sound, and the color left his face. With a"
"final swing, Bob loosened his hold on the bundle, which curved in a"
"perfect arc over the rear of the jam, over the jagged crest, and dropped"
swiftly out of sight amid the massive timbers upended in confusion along
the face and close to the spot where protruded the freshly driven spiles
which had caused all the trouble.
An instant later the whole throng of men hustled frantically for cover.
CHAPTER X. THE POWER BEHIND IT ALL
In less than sixty seconds--so close had been Bob’s calculations--came a
"detonation which shook the earth, making several of the running men"
"stagger and lose their stride. Up spurted a great mass of water,"
carrying with it massive logs leaping like agonized things alive. They
"fell back again, followed by a shower of débris mingled with fine spray,"
"which the wind sifted down on the heads of the ducking, dodging men."
"From his place behind a stump Bainbridge rose swiftly, shielding his"
face with one crooked arm from the rain of chips and splinters and bits
"of bark, and stared eagerly toward the jam. It took but a moment to see"
"that the spiles had disappeared, and the boom was shattered. Moreover,"
the key logs of the jam were so loosened that the whole drive was again
on its way downstream. Bob turned to Peters with a gesture of
satisfaction.
"“She’s off, Jack,” he said. “Get a wiggle on, now, and rush her along."
radar signature immediately disappeared off the tracking monitors at
"Katsura."""
"""It met the specifications?"""
"Ikeda nodded. ""Yesterday I ordered a computer analysis of the data"
"tapes. The preliminary report suggests it may even have exceeded them."""
Tanzan Mino listened in silence. He was sitting at his desk in the
command sector wing of the North Quadrant at the Hokkaido facility.
"Although the sector was underground, like the rest of the facility,"
"behind his desk was a twenty-foot-long ""window"" with periscope double"
mirrors that showed the churning breakers of La Perouse Strait.
His jet had touched down on the facility's runway at 6:48 A.M. and been
promptly towed into the hangar. Tanzan Mino intended to be in personal
"command when _Daedalus I_ went hypersonic, in just nineteen hours. The"
video monitors in his office were hard-wired directly to the main
"console in Flight Control, replicating its data displays, and all"
decisions passed across his desk.
"""Leave the pilot to me,"" he said without emotion, revolving to gaze out"
"the wide window, which displayed the mid-afternoon sun catching the"
"crests of whitecaps far at sea. ""What he knows or doesn't know will not"
"disrupt the schedule."""
"Once again, he thought, I've got to handle a problem personally. Why?"
Because nobody else here has the determination to make the scenario
"succeed. First the protocol, and then the money. I had to intervene to"
resolve both.
"But, he reflected with a smile, it turned out that handling those"
"were so, why should we make the least objection? But in the hypothesis"
that the introduction of civilisation has in view neither amelioration
"of the condition of the natives nor progress of commerce and industry,"
we might then conceive a sort of suspicion. Supposing that you augment
"the garrisons, the fortifications, the naval forces, one would see in it"
nothing but an expansion of your military power and not an introduction
of civilisation in the sense understood in France. Even in that case we
"would not raise objections, unless it were done with a view to menace"
us; but here I shall offer you a suggestion. Is it really worth your
while to develop there incessantly your military and naval forces in
order to oppose Japan? Would not the enterprise be rather costly? Would
it not be infinitely better to employ your energy in cultivating a good
understanding between your country and ours instead of rivalling each
other by crossing armaments?

THE AUSTRALIAN QUESTION[1]
AN INTERVIEW
Baron Suyematsu gave a _Daily News_ representative his opinion of the

"burly, cheerful man, laughed heartily as he dealt with the alarmist"
fears of the 'Yellow Peril.'
the identity of the woman and the reason of her presence alone with
Marsh in such a place. Again he thought of that mysterious third person
"whose movements had been so swift and furious, but his conjectures left"
him more at sea than ever. Of one thing he felt sure. It was not enmity
alone that prompted Marsh to accuse him of the stabbing. The man was
"concealing something, in deadly fear of the truth, for rather than"
submit to questioning he had let his enemy go scot-free.
"Suddenly Boyd paused in his walk, recalling again the shadowy outlines"
of the figure with whom he had so nearly collided on his way up from
"the beach. There was something familiar about it, he mused; then, with"
"a low whistle of surprise, he smote his palms together. He began to see"
dimly.
For more than an hour the young man paced back and forth before the
"door of his sleeping-quarters, so deeply immersed in thought that only"
"the breaking storm drove him within. When at last he retired, it was"
with the certainty that this night had placed a new weapon in his hand;
"but of what tremendous value it was destined to prove, he little knew."
CHAPTER XXII
THE SILVER HORDE
The main body of salmon struck into the Kalvik River on the first day
"of July. For a week past the run had been slowly growing, while the"
"canneries tested themselves, but on the opening day of the new month"
Mr. Jobling sank still lower in his seat.
"""In return for that,"" Slyne went on, ""he must sign a clear deliverance"
"from any further claim on any of us, subject, of course, to due payment"
of the note.
"""Then, I want a document drawn up to confirm my engagement to the girl"
and granting me the fullest possible power of attorney on her behalf
both before and after our marriage. She's so simple and inexperienced
that I must do everything for her.
"""And, lastly, you'd better make out a brief private agreement between"
"yourself and me--just as a matter of form, you know--to the effect that"
"you are willing to act in my interests throughout, in return for a"
commission of ten per cent. on the accumulated revenues of the Jura
"estates at the date of my marriage."""
Mr. Jobling looked at him for a time as a man suddenly bereft of his
spine might.
"""There's no time to spare,"" Slyne mentioned. ""I want all that sort of"
thing settled right off the reel--before lunch.
"""If the old man makes any kick about anything, you must back me up in"
all I say. Although if he tries to raise his price by a few thousand
"dollars, we needn't stick at that. The great thing is to get him to sign"
"the deliverance in return for our note. The girl has already agreed--"""
"""And what if _I_ refuse?"" croaked his companion with the courage of"
desperation. It was evident that Mr. Jobling saw through his daring
"scheme. ""What if I insist on my fair share? What if I--"""
lacked the strength that was needed to run counter to all. I was no
"knight-errant, but a plain man, and I reeled on through the last hour"
"of the night and the first grey streaks of dawn, with my head on my"
breast and sobs of despair in my throat.

NUREMBERG.
If it had been our fate after that to continue our flight in the same
"weary fashion we had before devised, lying in woods by day, and all"
"night riding jaded horses, until we passed the gates of some free"
"city, I do not think that I could have gone through with it. Doubtless"
it was my duty to go with my lady. But the long hours of daylight
"inaction, the slow brooding tramp, must have proved intolerable. And"
"at some time or other, in some way or other, I must have snapped the"
ties that bound me.
"But, as if the loss of my heart had rid us of some spell cast over us,"
"by noon of that day we stood safe. For, an hour before noon, while we"
"lay in a fir-wood not far from Weimar, and Jacob kept watch on the"
"road below, and the rest slept as we pleased, a party of horse came"
"along the way, and made as if to pass below us. They numbered more"
"than a hundred, and Jacob's heart failed him, lest some ring or buckle"
of our accoutrements should sparkle and catch their eyes. To shift the
"burden he called us, and we went to watch them."
'Do they go north or south?' I asked him as I rose.
"""Sunderland"" than it had hitherto been, since the distance between"
the two airships was less than a thousand yards and was visibly
decreasing.
"""They're going to take her in tow, by Jove!"" ejaculated Aubyn, who"
had brought his binoculars to play upon the scene.
Oswestry gave a snort that implied disbelief in his brother-officer's
"assertion, but presently he exclaimed:--"
"""Well, blest if you aren't right, old man. And a deuced smart move,"""
"he added, with a true sailor's admiration for a smart manoeuvre,"

"quarry. By Jove, they've established communication!"""
The undamaged Zeppelin had circled round her consort and was now
forging gently ahead. An upward jerk of the other's bows announced
that the strain on the towing hawser was beginning to be felt.
"Gradually the hitherto uncontrollable airship began to gather way,"
both vessels rolling sluggishly in the light air-currents.
"The aerial searchlight had now been switched off, but by means of the"
rays directed from the British ships the progress of the two

"transverse slit); _exit_, in right buttock, on a level with the"

was received immediately after breakfast had been eaten. There
"was retention of urine and constipation for three days, but no"
"sickness. Local pain and tenderness were severe, and at the end"
"of three weeks there was still local tenderness, slight"
"induration, and dragging pain on defæcation. The patient"
"returned to England at the end of a month well, except for"
slight local tenderness.

The injury was followed by pain in the left half of the abdomen

small quantity of water was allowed. No further symptoms were

CHAPTER IV
RISE OF COMEDY AND TRAGEDY
"No great discernment is required to see that, after the appearance of"
"_Johan Johan_, all that was needed for the complete development of"
comedy was the invention of a well-contrived plot. For reasons already
"indicated, Interludes were naturally deficient in this respect. Nor were"
the Moralities and Bible Miracles much better: their length and
"comprehensive themes were against them. There were the Saint Plays, of"
which some still lingered upon the stage; these offered greater
"possibilities. But here, again, originality was limited; the"
"_dénouement_ was more or less a foregone conclusion. Clearly, one of two"
things was wanted: either a man of genius to perceive the need and to
"supply it, or the study of new models outside the field of English"
"drama. The man of genius was not then forthcoming, but by good fortune"
the models were stumbled upon.
"We say stumbled upon, because the absence of tentative predecessors and"
"of anything approaching an eager band of successors, suggests an"
unpreparedness for the discovery when it came. Thus _Calisto and
"Melibaea_ (1530), an imitation of a Spanish comedy of the same name,"
"Kennedy went to look at a picture by Sassoferrato, which is in one of"
"the chapels, and meanwhile the rosary-seller showed the church door to"
"Cæsar and explained the different bas-reliefs, cut in cypress wood by"
"Greek artists of the V Century, and representing scenes from the Old and"
New Testaments.
"Kennedy came back, they got into the carriage again, and they drove to"
the Benedictine abbey.
“Is the abbot Hildebrandus here?” asked Kennedy.
"Out came the abbot, a man of about fifty, with a gold cross on his"
"breast. They exchanged a few friendly words, and the superior showed"
them the convent.
The refectory was clean and very spacious; the long table of shining
"wood; the floor made of mosaic. The crypt held a statue, which Cæsar"
"assumed must be of Sant’ Anselmo. The church was severe, without"
"ornaments, without pictures; it had a primitive air, with its columns of"
"fine granite that looked like marble. A monk was playing the harmonium,"
"and in the opaque veiled light, the thin music gave a strange impression"
of something quite outside this life.
Afterwards they crossed a large court with palm-trees. They went up to
"the second story, and down a corridor with cells, each of which had on"
the lintel the name of the patron saint of the respective monk. Each
door had a card with the name of the occupant of the room.
It looked more like a bath-house than a monastery. The cells were
"comfortable inside, without any air of sadness; each held a bed, a"
"divan, and a small bookcase."

CHAPTER VI
GUESSWORK
"Cary tried to shake my resolution, but I was obdurately silent. While"
"he canvassed the whole position, bringing to bear his really profound"
knowledge of naval equipment and routine--and incidentally helping me
greatly to realise the improbability of my own guesswork solution--I
was able to maintain an air of lofty superiority. I must have
"aggravated him intensely, unpardonably, for I was his guest. He ought"
to have kicked me out. Yet he bore with me like the sweet-blooded
"kindly angel that he is, and when at the end it appeared that I was"
"right after all, Cary was the first to pour congratulations and honest"
admiration upon me. If he reads this book he will know that I am
repentant--though I must confess that I should behave in just the same
abominable way if the incident were to occur again. There is no great
value in repentance such as this.
"We reached Dawson's office in the early afternoon, and found his chief"
"assistant there, but no Dawson. ""The old man,"" remarked that officer,"
"a typical, stolid, faithful detective sergeant, ""is out on the"
rampage. He ought by rights to sit here directing the staff and leave
"the outside investigations to me. He is a high-up man, almost a deputy"
"assistant commissioner, and has no call to be always disguising"
himself and playing his tricks on everybody. I suppose you know that
"white-haired old gent down here ain't a bit like Bill Dawson, who's"
"seize them in my strong arms, I will bear them harmless through the"
falling rafters and the blazing beams.’ Then the sad thought came
to him that the children were romping and ignorant. ‘If I say the
"house is on fire, they will not understand me. If I try to seize"
"them, they will romp about and try to escape. Alas! not a moment to"
be lost!’ Suddenly a bright thought flashed across the old man's
"mind. ‘My children are ignorant,’ he said; ‘they love toys and"
glittering playthings. I will promise them playthings of unheard-of
beauty. Then they will listen.’
"So the old man shouted: ‘Children, come out of the house and see"
"these beautiful toys! Chariots with white oxen, all gold and"
tinsel. See these exquisite little antelopes. Whoever saw such
"goats as these? Children, children, come quickly, or they will all"
be gone!’
Forth from the blazing ruin the children came in hot haste. The
word ‘plaything’ was almost the only word they could understand.
"Then the Father, rejoiced that his offspring was freed from peril,"
procured for them one of the most beautiful chariots ever seen:
the chariot had a canopy like a pagoda: it had tiny rails and
balustrades and rows of jingling bells. Milk-white oxen drew the
chariot. The children were astonished when they were placed inside.”
(_From the “Thabagata.”_)
"Perhaps, as a compromise, one might give the gentler superstitions to"
"very small children, and leave such a blood-curdling story as Bluebeard"
to a more robust age.
There is one modern method which has always seemed to me much to be
"condemned, and that is the habit of changing the end of a story, for"
"difficulties, for the seaplane was rocking violently, and in spite of"
a dangerous tilt of the elevating planes was appreciably descending.
"Suddenly the frail craft plunged, literally on end, towards the sea,"
"the force of gravity, acting with the pull of the propeller, greatly"
increasing its velocity.
When within two hundred feet of the surface the seaplane made a
"complete loop, then after climbing a hundred feet or so, began to"
side-slip.
"""By Jove! He'll be drowned for a dead cert,"" exclaimed Terence, for"
he knew for a fact that the aviator had not been thrown from the
"chassis when the seaplane ""looped the loop,"" and in consequence must"
be strapped to his seat.
"""Away sea-boat,"" ordered the captain, at the same time giving"
directions for both engines to be reversed.
"The ""Sunderland"" was considerably the nearest warship to the"
"descending airman. Already the ""Livingstone"" and her two sister-ship"
"destroyers were a mile or so away, and wearing at full speed to"
investigate a suspicious swirl in the water.
Shells were again dropping unpleasantly near to the cruiser as Aubyn
"hurried towards the boat which was, owing to being cleared for"
"action, secured inboard, abreast the after funnel."
Before he reached this spot the seaplane had struck the surface of
"the water. Falling obliquely and at a sharp angle, the impact had"
shattered one of the floats. When the cascade of spray had subsided
the wrecked craft could be seen still afloat but listing acutely. The

"If an ewe gives birth to a lion with fatty flesh on the nose, the"

"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, and the right temple is covered with"
"fatty flesh, the land will be richly blessed."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, and the left temple is covered with"
"fatty flesh,--rivalry."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, and it is covered all over with"

From texts like these it would appear that the phrase of 'an ewe giving
birth to a lion' had acquired a purely conventional force to describe a
lamb whose head or general features suggested those of a lion. It may have
come to be used indeed for a newly born lamb of unusually large
proportions. Hence one could combine with the description of a lion-lamb
exclaimed aloud and covered their eyes for a moment to shut out the
hideous sight of them. Now they examined them closely.
Manlike they were: and yet like no human being conceivable to an Earth
mind. They were tremendously tall--twelve feet at least--but as thin
as so many animated poles. Their two legs were scarce four inches
"through, taper-less, boneless, like lengths of pipe; and like two"
flexible pipes they were joined to a slightly larger pipe of a torso
that could not have been more than a foot in diameter. There were four
"arms, a pair on each side of the cylindrical body, that weaved feebly"
about like lengths of rubber hose.
"Set directly on the pipe-like body, as a pumpkin might be balanced on"
"a pole, was a perfectly round cranium in which were glassy, staring"
"eyes, with dull pupils like those of a sick dog. The nose was but a"
"tab of flesh. The mouth was a minute, circular thing, soft and flabby"
"looking, which opened and shut regularly with the creature's"
"breathing. It resembled the snout-like mouth of a fish, of the sucker"
"variety; and fish-like, too, was the smooth and slimy skin that"
covered the beanpole body.

"Hundreds of the repulsive things, there were. And all of them shoved"
"and crowded, as a disorderly mob on Earth might do, to get close to"
the Earthmen's ship. Their big dull eyes peered in through the glass
"panels, and their hands--mere round blobs of gristle in the palms of"
which were set single sucker disks--pattered against the metal hull of
the shell.

were on the other side of the invisible screen.
"Determined however, to remove this invisible screen, I said"
"Good-evening, and it was very cold. They muttered Good-evening, and yes,"
it was fresh. An Italian never says it is cold: it is never more than
_fresco_. But this hint that it was cold they took as a hint at their
"caps, and they became very silent, till the woman came in with the"
"soup-bowl. Then they clamoured at her, particularly the _maialino_, what"
was there to eat. She told them--beef-steaks of pork. Whereat they
"pulled faces. Or bits of boiled pork. They sighed, looked gloomy,"
"cheered up, and said beef-steaks, then."
"And they fell on their soup. And never, from among the steam, have I"
heard a more joyful trio of soup-swilkering. They sucked it in from
"their spoons with long, gusto-rich sucks. The _maialino_ was the"
"treble--he trilled his soup into his mouth with a swift, sucking"
"vibration, interrupted by bits of cabbage, which made the lamp start to"
"dither again. Black-cap was the baritone; good, rolling spoon-sucks. And"
the one in spectacles was the bass: he gave sudden deep gulps. All was
"led by the long trilling of the _maialino_. Then suddenly, to vary"
"matters, he cocked up his spoon in one hand, chewed a huge mouthful of"
"bread, and swallowed it down with a smack-smack-smack! of his tongue"
"against his palate. As children we used to call this ""clapping""."
"""Mother, she's clapping!"" I would yell with anger, against my sister."
The German word is schmatzen.
"So the _maialino_ clapped like a pair of cymbals, while baritone and"
bass rolled on. Then in chimed the swift bright treble.
"At this rate however, the soup did not last long. Arrived the"
beef-steaks of pork. And now the trio was a trio of castanet smacks and

"of Greece appeared in the world. Remote, always remote, as if the"
"intelligence lay deep within the cave, and never came forward. One"
"searches into the gloom for one second, while the glance lasts. But"
"without being able to penetrate to the reality. It recedes, like some"
"unknown creature deeper into its lair. There is a creature, dark and"
potent. But what?
"Sometimes Velasquez, and sometimes Goya gives us a suggestion of these"
"large, dark, unlighted eyes. And they go with fine, fleecy black"
hair--almost as fine as fur. I have not seen them north of Cagliari.

The q-b spies some of the blue-and-red stripe-and-line cotton stuff of
which the peasants make their dress: a large roll in the doorway of a
"dark shop. In we go, and begin to feel it. It is just soft, thickish"
"cotton stuff--twelve francs a metre. Like most peasant patterns, it is"
much more complicated and subtle than appears: the curious placing of
"the stripes, the subtle proportion, and a white thread left down one"
"side only of each broad blue block. The stripes, moreover, run _across_"
"the cloth, not lengthwise with it. But the width would be just long"
enough for a skirt--though the peasant skirts have almost all a band at
the bottom with the stripes running round-ways.
"The man--he is the esquimo type, simple, frank and aimiable--says the"

"the old, old pattern, quite correct--but the material not _quite_ so"

"prone position. _Entry_ (Mauser), over ninth rib in line of"
"right linea semilunaris; _exit_, in right buttock, just below"
and behind the top of the great trochanter.
"The injury was followed by little abdominal pain, but a strange"
sensation of local gurgling was noted. The bowels acted as soon
"as the patient reached camp, some hours after being wounded."
There was no sickness and nothing abnormal was noted in the
"motions, except that they were loose and light-coloured."
On the evening of the third day the patient came under
observation in the ambulance train for Capetown. He looked
"somewhat anxious and ill, but he complained of little pain; the"
"temperature was 102°, pulse 88, fair strength, soft and"
"regular. There was local dulness, tenderness, and deficiency of"
"movement in the right iliac region. As it was night, he was"
removed from the train and an operation was performed the next
morning.
"Prior to operation the condition was as follows: Pulse 84,"
"temperature 100°; respiration easy, 20. Tongue moist, but"
"thickly coated in centre. Abdomen moves fairly, and is"
"resonant, except in right lower quadrant. No distension."
"Dulness, tenderness, and rigidity in right iliac region, marked"
to outer side of cæcum. Entry wound nearly and exit quite
healed. Cannot flex right thigh. The following operation was
"inevitable, the conviction of the uselessness of sorrow, the vanity and"
selfishness of grief.
There is no meeting again with the dead. Nowhere in the recurring
"centuries shall we meet again those whom we have loved, whom we love,"
"who seem to us to be parts of our very soul. That which survives of us,"
"the part which is incarnated again and again, until it be fit for"
"heaven, has nothing to do with love and hate."
Even if in the whirlpool of life our paths should cross again the paths
"of those whom we have loved, we are never told that we shall know them"
again and love them.
"A friend of mine has just lost his mother, and he is very much"
"distressed. He must have been very fond of her, for although he has a"
"wife and children, and is happy in his family, he is in great sorrow. He"
"proposes even to build a pagoda over her remains, a testimony of respect"
which in strict Buddhism is reserved to saints. He has been telling me
"about this, and how he is trying to get a sacred relic to put in the"
"pagoda, and I asked him if he never hoped again to meet the soul of his"
"mother on earth or in heaven, and he answered:"
"'No. It is very hard, but so are many things, and they have to be borne."
Far better it is to face the truth than to escape by a pleasant
falsehood. There is a Burmese proverb that tells us that all the world
is one vast burial-ground; there are dead men everywhere.'
"'One of our great men has said the same,' I answered."
He was not surprised.
"'As it is true,' he said, 'I suppose all great men would see it.'"

"pumps, which transferred hydrogen to the scramjets after it was"
converted from liquid to gaseous phase for combustion. He'd been
worrying about their pulse rating and couldn't sleep.
He'd gone on to explain that although static testing had shown they
would achieve operating pressure in twenty milliseconds if they were
"fully primed in advance, that was static testing, not flight testing,"
and he'd been unable to sleep wondering about the adhesive around the

"""The name I can no doubt give you, but not the address."""
"""Give us any address where he lived, even if it were ten years ago,"
and we will track him down in three days. That is just routine police

on his way.
The glen continued to narrow overhead. The sunshine was entirely shut
out. The jaws of the precipice closed in upon the wayfarer as if to
"crush him, but Sergeant Cardono advanced with the steady stride of a"
"mountaineer, and the aplomb of one who is entirely sure of his"
reception.
The mountain silence grew stiller all about. None had passed that way
(so it seemed) since the beginning of time. None would repass till time
should be no more.
"Suddenly through the utter quiet there rang out, repeated and"
"reduplicated, the loud report of a rifle. The hills gave back the"
challenge. A moment before the dingy bedrabbled snow at Cardono's feet
"had been puffed upwards in a white jet, yet he neither stopped for this"
"nor took the least notice. Loyal or disloyal, true or false, he was a"
brave man this Sergeant Cardono. I dare say that any one close to him
might have discerned his beady eyes glitter and glance quickly from side
"to side, but his countenance was turned steadfastly as ever upon the"
snow at his feet.
Again came the same startling challenge out of the vague emptiness of
"space, the bullet apparently bursting like a bomb among the snow. And"
again Cardono took as much notice as if some half-dozen of village
loungers had been playing ball among the trees.
Only when a third time the _whisk_ of the bullet in the snow a yard or
"two to the right preceded the sound of the shot, Cardono shook his head"
"and muttered, ""Too long range! The fools ought to be better taught than"
"that!"" Then he continued his tramp steadily, neither looking to the"
CHAPTER IX
HALF-LIGHT
"Once before she had placed herself in his path, trusting to her skill,"
"her daring, above all, her beauty. With laughter in her heart and"
cold-blooded coquetry she had chosen out the spot before the altar
where the sunlight struck burnished gold from her waving hair and lent
"deeper, softening shades to her eyes. With cruel satisfaction, not"
"unmixed with admiration, she had seen her power successful and the"
awe-struck wonder and veneration creep into his face. In the silence
and peace of the temple she had plunged reckless hands into the woven
"threads of his life. Amidst the shriek of war, face to face with"
"death, she sought to save him. It was another woman who stood opposite"
"the yielding, cracking door, past whose head a half-spent bullet spat"
"its way, burying itself in the wall behind her,--another woman,"
"disheveled, forgetful of her wan beauty, trusting to no power but that"
which her heart gave her to face the man she had betrayed and ruined.
Yet both in an instantaneous flash remembered that first meeting. The
"drawn sword sank, point downward. He stood motionless in the shattered"
"doorway, holding out a hand which commanded, and obtained, a"
"petrified, waiting silence from the armed horde whose faces glared"
hatred and the lust of slaughter in the narrow space behind. Whatever
"had been his resolution, whatever the detestation and contempt which"
"had filled him, all sank now into an ocean of reborn pain."
"""Why are you here?"" he asked sternly. ""Why have you not fled?"""
"into balls at the approach of danger. It is in this attitude,"
"taken at the approach of death, that trilobites are often found in"
the Ordovician and later rocks. The gigantic crustaceans called
the EURYPTERIDS were also present in this period.
The arthropods had now seized upon the land. Centipedes and
"insects of a low type, the earliest known land animals, have been"
discovered in strata of this system.
BRYOZOANS. No fossils are more common in the limestones of the
time than the small branching stems and lacelike mats of the
"bryozoans,--the skeletons of colonies of a minute animal allied in"
structure to the brachiopod.
"BRACHIOPODS. These multiplied greatly, and in places their shells"
formed thick beds of coquina. They still greatly surpassed the
mollusks in numbers.
CEPHALOPODS. Among the mollusks we must note the evolution of the
cephalopods. The primitive straight Orthoceras has now become
abundant. But in addition to this ancestral type there appears a
"succession of forms more and more curved and closely coiled, as"
"illustrated in Figure 285. The nautilus, which began its course in"
"this period, crawls on the bottom of our present seas."
VERTEBRATES. The most important record of the Ordovician is that
"of the appearance of a new and higher type, with possibilities of"
development lying hidden in its structure that the mollusk and the
insect could never hope to reach. Scales and plates of minute
"fishes found in the Ordovician rocks near Canon City, Colorado,"
show that the humblest of the vertebrates had already made its
appearance. But it is probable that vertebrates had been on the

and yet there be moments when he repels me too.  He is a good friend—I

bitter and an unscrupulous enemy; and those who have lost his favour
"withdraw themselves as speedily as possible from his notice, fearful"
"lest some evil may befall them."""
"""Is he then cruel and rancorous?"""
"""I can believe that he might be, were his passions roused.  He has that"
forceful nature which tends to vehement liking and bitter hatred.  I
"have experienced the one; I have not tasted of the other.  For the rest,"
"he is a man of parts, and can do all well to which he puts his hand."
Methinks he would be strong enough to break off his reckless and vicious
"habits, had he but motive sufficient to make him! desire to do so.  But"
"for the nonce he floats with the current, and lives as the world lives."

"At that moment a swift, firm tread was heard approaching along the dim"

arm.

towering figure of Lord Sandford beside them.

"your mother in search of you, Lady Geraldine.  The court of beauty has"
sat.  To her has been adjudged the prize.  She now desires the presence

And then he had gone his way to those who needed him more.
Mrs. Berry knelt by the bedside. Her hands were folded. She had been
"praying, but exhaustion had overcome her, and her quiet, peaceful"
breathing contrasted strangely with the other sounds that filled the
"bungalow. Mrs. Carmichael and Beatrice sat huddled close together,"
listening. They could do nothing--not even help the wounded men who
"lay so close to them. Everything was in pitch darkness, and no lights"
"were allowed. They could not go out and help in the stern, relentless"
struggle that was going on about them. They bore the woman's harder
"lot of waiting, inactive, powerless, fighting the harder battle"
against uncertainty and all the horrors of the imagination.
"""I am sorry the regiment has come,"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered. ""There"
is no doubt they will be massacred with the rest of us. What are a few
"hundreds against thousands? It is a pity. They are such fine fellows."""
"Her rough, tired voice had a ring of unconquerable pride in it. She"
was thinking of the gallant charge her husband's men had made only two
"weeks before; how they had broken through the wall of the enemy, and,"
"cheering, had rushed to meet the besieged garrison. That had been a"
"moment of rejoicing, transitory and deceptive. Then the wall closed in"
"about them again, and they knew that they were trapped."
"""Perhaps we can hold out till help comes,"" Beatrice said."
She tried not to be indifferent. For the sake of her companions she
"would gladly have felt some desire for life, but in truth it had no"
value for her. She could think of nothing but the evil she had done
and of the atonement that had been denied her. It was to no purpose
that she worked unceasingly for the wounded. The sense of
"responsibility never left her. Each moan, each death-sigh brought the"
"""It were better,"" she cried--""better that I had died yesterday than"
"suffer like this.  You rescued me from death only to torture me."""
Her words aroused within me a distinct suspicion that her strange
"illness had been brought to pass because, using some mysterious means,"
she had made an attempt against her own life.  I believed that she had
"suffered, and was still suffering, from the effects of some poison, the"
exact nature of which neither Deane nor Trepard could as yet determine.
"""I do not seek to torture you, dearest,"" I protested.  ""Far from it.  I"
"merely want to know the truth, in order that I may share your"
"unhappiness, as your betrothed ought to do."""
"""But you are not my betrothed."""
"""I was once."""
"""But not now.  You taunt me with breaking that promise which I made"
"three years ago, yet you yourself it was who played me false--who left"
"me for your prim, strait-laced English miss!"""
In an instant the truth was plain.  She was aware that I had transferred
my affections to Edith!  Someone had told her--no doubt with a good many
"embellishments, or perhaps some scandalous story.  In the salons through"
"which we of the diplomatic circle are compelled to move, women's tongues"
are ever at work match-making and mischief-making.  On the Continent
love and politics run always hand-in-hand.  That is the reason why the
"most notorious of the demi-monde in Paris, in Vienna, and in Berlin are"
the secret agents of their respective Governments; and many are the
honest men innocently denounced through jealousy and kindred causes.  A
false declaration of one or other of these unscrupulous spies has before
now caused the downfall of a Ministry or the disgrace of a noble and
"""It is hardly worth while to begin now,"" Beatrice observed, and this"
simple acknowledgment that the end was at hand received no
contradiction.
"Once again the silence was unbroken, save for the soft swish of the"
"fan and Mrs. Cary's heavy, irregular breathing. Yet the five women who"
in the full swing of their life had been diametrically opposed to one
"another were now united in a common sympathy. Death, far more than a"
"leveler of class, is the melting-pot into which are thrown all"
"antagonisms, all violent discords of character. The one great fact"
"overshadows everything, and the petty stumbling-blocks of daily life"
are forgotten. More than that still--it is the supreme moment in man's
existence when the innermost treasures or unsuspected hells are
"revealed beyond all denial. And in these five women, hidden in two"
"cases at least beneath a mass of meanness, selfishness and"
"indifference, there lay an unusual power of self-sacrifice and pity."
"Death was drawing near to them all, and their one thought was how to"
make his coming easier for the other. When the silence grew
"unbearable, it was Mrs. Carmichael who had the courage to break it"
with a trivial criticism respecting the manner in which Lois was
making the sandwiches.
"""You should put the butter on before you cut them,"" she said tartly,"
"""and as little as possible. I'm quite sure it has gone rancid, and"
"then George won't touch them. He is so fussy about the butter."""
Mrs. Berry looked up. The perspiration of physical fear stood on her
"cold forehead, but her roused will-power fought heroically and"
conquered.
"""And, please, would you mind making one or two without butter?"" she"
be a crucial node where he could attach the device he'd brought.
"It had taken some doing, but he'd managed to assemble an item that"
should take care of his problem beautifully when the moment came. It
"was a radio-controlled, electrically operated blade that, when clamped"
"onto a strand of wires, could sever them in an instant. The radio range"
"was fifty meters, which would be adequate; the transmitter, no larger"
"than a small tape recorder, was going to be with him in his flight"
suit. The instant he switched the turboramjets over to the scramjet
"mode, he was going to activate it and blow their fucking AI module out"
of the system. Permanently.
He figured he had ten minutes before one of the security team came
looking to see what he was doing; he'd timed this moment to coincide
with their regular tea break. Even the Japanese didn't work around the
clock.
"Now, holding the penlight and shivering from the cold, he began"
"carefully checking the wires. Carefully, so very carefully. He didn't"
"have a diagram of their computer linkages, and he had to make sure he"
"didn't accidentally interrupt the main power source, since the one"
thing he didn't want to do was disconnect any of the other flight
control systems. He wanted to cut in somewhere between the AI module's
power supply and its central processor. The power source led in here .
". . and then up the side over to there, a high-voltage transformer . ."
. and then out from . . .
There. Just after the step-up transformer and before the motherboard
with the dedicated CPU and I/O. That should avoid any shorting in the
main power system and keep the interruption nice and localized.
"The line was almost half an inch thick, double-stranded, copper"
"state of defence as is possible, since the attack of the gipsies may be"
"expected at any moment!"""
"Rollo stepped to the window to summon his company, but found them"
already assembled on the balcony. It was no time for formal
"introductions, yet, as each entered, Rollo, like a true herald,"
delivered himself of a brief statement of the position of the individual
"in the company. But when La Giralda entered, the stout waiting-maid rose"
with a shriek from the floor where she had been sitting.
"""Oh, my lady,"" she cried, ""do not trust these wicked people. They have"
come to murder us all. That woman is the very old goatherdess with whom
the Princess Isabel was so bewitched this morning! I knew some evil
"would come of such ongoings!"""
"""Hush, Susana,"" said her mistress with severity; ""when you are asked for"
"any information, be ready to give it. Till then hold your peace."""
"Which having said she turned haughtily back again to the strangers,"
without vouchsafing a glance at her husband or the trembling handmaiden.
"""I can well believe,"" she said, ""that you have come here to do us a"
"service in our present temporary difficulty, and for that, if I find you"
"of approved fidelity, you shall not fail to be rewarded. Meantime, I"
"accept your service, and I place you and the whole of your men under the"
"immediate command of his Excellency the Duke of Rianzares!"""
She turned to the tall exquisite who still continued to comb his
whiskers by the chimney-piece. Up till now he had not spoken a word.
"Rollo scarcely knew what to reply to this, and as for the Sergeant, he"
had the hardest work to keep from bursting into a loud laugh.
"loves. Death, he says, and life are one; not antagonistic, but the same;"
and the only way to escape from one is to escape from the other too.
"Only in the Great Peace, when we have found refuge from the passion and"
"tumult of life, shall we find the place where death cannot come. Life"
and death are one.
"This is the teaching of the Buddha, repeated over and over again to his"
"disciples when they sorrowed for the death of Thariputra, when they"
were in despair at the swift-approaching end of the great teacher
"himself. Hear what he says to Ananda, the beloved disciple, who is"
mourning over Thariputra.
"'Ananda,' he said, 'often and often have I sought to bring shelter to"
your soul from the misery caused by such grief as this. There are two
"things alone that can separate us from father and mother, from brother"
"and sister, from all those who are most cherished by us, and those two"
"things are distance and death. Think not that I, though the Buddha, have"
not felt all this even as any other of you; was I not alone when I was
seeking for wisdom in the wilderness?
'And yet what would I have gained by wailing and lamenting either for
myself or for others? Would it have brought to me any solace from my
loneliness? Would it have been any help to those whom I had left? There
"is nothing that can happen to us, however terrible, however miserable,"
that can justify tears and lamentations and make them aught but a
weakness.'
"And so, we are told, in this way the Buddha soothed the affliction of"
"Ananda, and filled his soul with consolation--the consolation of"
resignation.
"For there is no other consolation possible but this, resignation to the"
"""I did not express that opinion,"" he hastened to protest.  ""Before we"
discuss the matter further it will be best for me to see her.  Death may
"have been due to natural causes, for aught we know."""
I stood motionless.  His suggestion that my sweetheart of the old days
had committed suicide because I had forsaken her was a startling one.
Surely that could not be so?
"""Come,"" my friend said, ""let us lose no time.  Which is the room?"""
"I led him along the corridor, and opened the door of the chamber in"
which she was lying so cold and still.  The light of the afterglow fell
"full upon her, tipping her auburn hair with crimson and illuminating her"
face with a warm radiance that gave her back the appearance of life.
"But it was only for a few moments.  The slanting ray was lost, and the"
pallor of that beautiful countenance became marked against the gold of
her wondrous hair.
"In silence I stood at the foot of the bed watching my friend, who was"
now busy with his examination.  He opened her eyes and closed them
"again, felt her heart, raised her arms, and examined her mouth, uttering"
no word.  His serious face wore a look as though he were infinitely
puzzled.
One after the other he examined the palms of her hands long and
"carefully, then, bending until his eyes were close to her face, he"
"examined her lips, brow, and the whole surface of her cheeks.  Upon her"
"neck, below the left ear, was a mark to which he returned time after"
"time, as though not satisfied as to its cause.  Upon her lower lip, too,"
"was a slight yellow discoloration, which he examined several times,"
comparing it with the mark upon the neck.  He was unable to account for
For the Burman's life and belief is one great whole.
"I thought before I began to write, and I have become more and more"
"certain of it as I have taken up subject after subject, that to all the"
great differences of thought between them and us there is one key. And
"this key is that they believe the world is governed by eternal laws,"
"that have never changed, that will never change, that are founded on"
"absolute righteousness; while we believe in a personal God, altering"
"laws, and changing moralities according to His will."
"If I were to rewrite this book, I should do so from this standpoint of"
"eternal laws, making the book an illustration of the proposition."
"Perhaps it is better as it is, in that I have discovered the key at the"
end of my work instead of at the beginning. I did not write the book to
"prove the proposition, but in writing the book this truth has become"
apparent to me.
"The more I have written, the clearer has this teaching become to me,"
"until now I wonder that I did not understand long ago--nay, that it has"
not always been apparent to all men.
Surely it is the beginning of all wisdom.
"Not until we had discarded Atlas and substituted gravity, until we had"
"forgotten Enceladus and learned the laws of heat, until we had rejected"
"Thor and his hammer and searched after the laws of electricity, could"
science make any strides onward.
An irresponsible spirit playing with the world as his toy killed all
science.
It was time to give the almost overheated starboard guns a chance to
"cool, so orders were given for the helm to be starboarded. Seeing the"
"cruiser in the act of turning, a destroyer tore across her bows,"
purposely throwing out huge volumes of black smoke from her four
"funnels in order to mask the ""Sunderland"" as she circled."
"Terence recognized the destroyer as his old ship the ""Livingstone,"""
"as she darted swiftly round the turning cruiser, then, leaving a"
"thick pall of smoke in her wake, hastened off to assist another"
destroyer that was evidently in difficulties.
"The ""Livingstone's"" manoeuvre undoubtedly saved the ""Sunderland"" from"
"destruction, for a fifty-two centimetre shell, aimed to hit the exact"
position where the cruiser would have been had she not altered
"course, struck the water with a tremendous splash not fifty yards on"
her beam.
"Before the ""Sunderland"" had drawn clear of the friendly cloud of"
smoke she had increased her distance from shore by nearly five
"cables' lengths; while, until the German gunners had found the range"
"anew, she was able to enjoy a brief respite."
"""Seaplanes returning,"" announced the gunnery-lieutenant on the"
"fire-control platform, who from his elevated post could command a"
wide and almost uninterrupted view.
"Their task done, the seaplanes, which had been engaged in dropping"
"bombs on the railway stations in the rear of the German batteries,"
were on their homeward way. Anxiously Terence counted them. Thank
heaven! Not one was missing.
Apparently the last but one of the aerial procession was in
"dogs, 2 to 5 ms.; amyl nitrite is very seldom given internally;"
"hypodermically, one-half this dose. By inhalation, same as given"
internally. It should be fresh as it rapidly deteriorates.
"ACTIONS.--It stimulates the heart’s action, greatly dilates the"
arterioles by paralyzing their muscular coats; causes a sense of
"fullness in the brain with vertigo, fall of blood pressure due to"
"dilation of the arterioles, lowering of temperature; when the vapor is"
applied direct to muscular or nerve tissues it suspends or completely
arrests its functional activity; it depresses the nervous system and
unstriped muscular fiber. Overdoses cause death by respiratory failure.
USES.--Epileptic attacks may be warded off by its being inhaled;
"spasmodic asthma, used either internally, hypodermically or best by"
"inhalation; in strychnine poisoning, angina pectoris in tetanus, and as"
a heart stimulant. It is useful as an inhalation in bringing about
recovery from deep chloroform and anesthesia.
ANISUM--ANISE
"ORIGIN.--The anise plant is a native of Egypt and the Levant, but has"
been introduced in various parts of that continent. It is also
cultivated occasionally in the gardens of this country. The fruit is
"abundantly produced in Malta and Spain; in Romagna, in Italy, whence it"
"is largely exported through Leghorn, and in Central and Southern Russia."
"DESCRIPTION.--Ovoid, laterally compressed, 4 to 5 m. m. long; carpels"
usually cohering and attached to a slender pedicel; grayish or
"Isthmus, and even a request from the chief that the war vessel that"
brought the negotiator on his fruitless errand should leave was acceded
"to. It is quite unlikely, however, that the Indians will be able to"
maintain their isolation much longer. Already there are signs of its
breaking down. While I was in Panama they sent a request that a
"missionary, a woman it is true, who had been much among them, should"
come and live with them permanently. They also expressed a desire that
"she should bring her melodeon, thus giving new illustration to the"
"poetic adage, “Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast”. Perhaps"
the phonograph may in time prove the open sesame to many savage bosoms.
Among this people it is the women who cling most tenaciously to the
"primitive customs, as might be expected, since they have been so"
assiduously guarded against the wiles of the world. But Catholic
"missionaries have made some headway in the country, and at Narganá"
schools for girls have been opened under auspices of the church. It is
probably due to the feminine influence that the San Blas men return so
unfailingly to primitive customs after the voyages that have made them
familiar with civilization. If the women yield to the desire for novelty
the splendid isolation of the San Blas will not long endure. Perhaps
"that would be unfortunate, for all other primitive peoples who have"
surrendered to the wiles of the white men have suffered and disappeared.

persons at all hazards.
Verily the whole situation was remarkably complex.
The briefest look around convinced Rollo that it would be impossible for
so small a party to hold the long range of iron palisades which
"surrounded the palace. These were complete, indeed, but their extent was"
far too great to afford any hope of keeping out the gipsies without
"finding themselves taken in the rear. They must hold La Granja itself,"
"that was clear. There remained, therefore, only the problem of finding"
entrance.
Between the porter's lodge and the great gates near the _Colegiata_ they
discovered a ladder left somewhat carelessly against a wall where
"whitewashing had been going on during the day, some ardent royal"
"tradesman having ventured back, preferring the chance of the plague to"
the abandonment of his contract.
"This they at once appropriated, and Rollo and the Sergeant, being the"
"two most agile of the company, prepared to mount."
"If the time had been less critical, and a disinterested observer had"
"been available, it would at this moment have been interesting to observe"
the demeanour of Concha. Feeling that in a manner she was present on
"sufferance, she could not of course make any objection to the plan of"
"escalade, nor could she offer to accompany Rollo and the Sergeant, but"
"with clasped hands and tightly compressed lips she stood beneath,"
repeating under her breath quick-succeeding prayers for the safety of
one (or both) of the adventurers.
So patent and eager was her anxiety even in the gloom of the night that
"La Giralda, to whom her agitation was manifest, laid her hand on the"
pretending that there is none within the palace. As if a Queen of Spain
"could not have all the milk she wanted! Ridiculous!"""
By this time the little girl had mounted the parapet and was clinging
"with all her might to the iron railings, while a fat motherly person had"
"waddled out of the underbrush in search of her, and with many"
exclamations of pretended anger and indignation was endeavouring to
entice her away.
"But the more the nurse scolded and pulled, the more firmly did the"
"little maid cling to the golden bars. At last the elderly woman, quite"
"out of breath, sat down on the stone ledge and addressed to her charge"
the argument which in such cases betokens unconditional surrender.
"""My lady Isabel, what would your noble and royal mother say,"" she"
"gasped, ""thus to forget all the counsels and commands of those put in"
authority over you and run to the railings to chatter with a gipsy wife?
"Go away, goatherdess, or I will call the attendants and have you put in"
"prison!"""
"La Giralda had stopped her flock, obedient to the wishes of the little"
"maid, but now, with a low curtsey to both, she gathered them together"
"with her peculiar whistling cry, and prepared to continue her way down"
into the village.
But this the little girl would in nowise permit. She let go the iron
"rail, and with both hands clenched fell upon her attendant with"
concentrated fury.
"""Bad, wicked Susana,"" she cried, ""I will have you whipped and sent about"
"your business. Nay, I myself will beat you. I will kill you, do you"
hear? I have had nothing to eat and no one to play with for a week--not
advantage of the fact that the attention of the British seaplanes and
"destroyers was centred on the fugitive Taubes, these giant airships,"
"by reason of their altitude, were able to manoeuvre immediately above"
the flotilla.
"It was an opportunity too good to be missed, for although the"
objective of the Zeppelins was a raid on London--they having decided
upon a circuitous course over Kent and Sussex borders in order to
avoid the air-stations at the Isle of Grain--the chance of raining a
shower of bombs upon the British cruiser and her attendant destroyers
was too tempting.
"For once, at least, the German Admiralty had not been kept well"
"posted as to the details of armament of the cruisers of the ""Town"
"Class,"" for the ""Sunderland"" and her consorts had recently been"
equipped with a couple of 12-pounder anti-aircraft guns. These
weapons fired a shell of unique character. Somewhat resembling a
"shrapnel, the missile was packed with short lengths of chain and"
charged with a high explosive.
Almost as soon as the Zeppelins were discovered both guns barked
venomously. From the point of view of the observers on the
"""Sunderland's"" bridge the shells appeared to burst close to the frail"
"targets. Both airships were observed to pitch violently, while one,"
"with her nose tilted downwards, began to descend."
"""She's done for!"" exclaimed Terence."
A round of cheering burst from the throats of the crew. It seemed as
if nothing could arrest the seaward plunge of one of the Kaiser's
gas-bags. Not only had her bow compartments been holed but the
nacelle containing the propelling machinery was completely wrecked.
"temperature normal, pulse 72, respirations 24, tongue moist,"
bowels confined. Rigidity of abdominal wall and deficient
"mobility of nearly whole right half of belly, the whole lower"
half of which moves little with respiration. No track palpable
"in abdominal parietes. No dulness, no distension. The"
temperature rose to 99.5° at night. On the fourth day the
"bowels acted freely, the pulse fell to 60, the respirations"
"were 24, and the temperature normal."
Tenderness and rigidity persisted in the right flank to the end
"of a week, after which time no further signs persisted."

"500 yards. Walked 400 yards after injury. _Entry_ (Mauser), at"
the junction of the posterior and middle thirds of the right
"iliac crest; _exit_, 3 inches to right of and 1/2 inch below"
the level of the umbilicus. The injury was followed by no signs
of intra-abdominal lesion; on the third day the temperature was
"normal, pulse 80, and the tongue clean and moist. Some soreness"
"at times and tenderness on pressure were complained of, but the"
man was discharged well at the end of one month.

"_Entry_ (Mauser), immediately above the junction of the"

"inch below costal margin (eighth rib), 3 inches to the right of"
"the median line. The bullet was lying in the anterior wound,"
whence it was removed by the orderly who applied the first
dressing on the field. The patient remained on the field seven
"and a half hours, and when brought into hospital at once"
"commenced to vomit. The ejected matter, at first green in"
"colour, during the next forty-eight hours changed to a dirty"
"But a moment later his superiority turned to consternation, and he"
was burying his head in the bowels of the car.
After a moment's inspection he showed a face of such utter dismay
that it would have been comical had not the situation been so serious.
"""Great Scott, sir! I must have left the petrol tap turned on, and the"
"tank is nearly empty."""
"Here, I'm afraid, my language was violent, and it was some minutes"
before Allan was able to ascertain exactly how much petrol we had
left. His calculations established the fact that we had lost some
fourteen gallons. This meant that we should have to walk the greater
part of the last two hundred miles of our journey. A pleasant
"prospect in that forbidding country. But orders were to go on, and go"
on we did.
"That day we made good time, and before evening had done the ninety"
"miles set as a day's march. But, as we had lost so much ground the"
"previous day, I determined to go on as long as Allan could stick at"
"the driving wheel, and we went on--to a post called Yadgar."
"I should explain that in this barren, townless, roadless district"
"there are occasional small rest-houses, very modest types of Dâk"
"bungalows, established by the Indian Government for the benefit of"
"travellers, or soldiers on their way to frontier duty. They are quite"
"bare except for a camp bed or two, a tub, a table, a few chairs and a"
"wash-hand basin, with a _chokidar_, or keeper, in charge."
"Such a rest-house we found at Yadgar, and being not only very tired"
"and dusty, but filthily dirty, as the result of our struggles with"
"the car, we pulled up to try and get a superficial wash."
"tenth 103°. The man was very ill, and an exploring needle was"
"inserted, by which about an ounce of blood was evacuated. The"
signs of fluid in the left pleura were accompanied by those of
"consolidation over the lower fourth of the right lung, and the"
sputa were rusty. Evidence of perforation of the left axillary
artery existed in feebleness of the radial pulse; and there was
musculo-spiral paralysis.
"After the preliminary puncture, the man refused any further"
"operative treatment, although a second rise of temperature"
"commenced on the fifteenth day, culminating in a temperature of"
103.2° on the eighteenth. The further treatment of the patient
consisted in the ensurance of rest and the alleviation of pain.
A steady fall in the temperature extended over another three
"weeks, together with diminution in the signs of fluid in the"
"pleura. At the end of seventy-four days the man was sent home,"
"some slight dulness at the left base, and contraction of the"
chest sufficient to influence the spine in the way of lateral
"curvature, being the only remaining signs."

"and the little Queen of Spain!"""
"She subsided on a stone, dropped her head into her hands, and took no"
"further notice of the Sergeant, who stood awhile with his hand resting"
"on her shoulder in deep meditation. There was, he thought, no more to be"
said or done. He knew all there was to know. The men had not asked him
"to join them, so he would venture no further questions as to the time"
and the manner of attack. They were still jealous of him with that
easily aroused jealousy of south and north which in Spain divides even
the clannish gipsy.
Nevertheless he went the round of the men. They were mostly busy with
"their games, and some of them even snatched the stakes in to them, lest"
he should demand a percentage of the winnings after the manner of
Sevilla. The Sergeant smiled at the reputation which distance and many
"tongues had given him. Then, with a few words of good fellowship and"
"the expression of a wish for success and abundant plunder, he bade them"
farewell. It was a great deed which they designed and one worthy of his
"best days. He was now old, he said, and must needs choose easier"
courses. He did not desire twice to feel the grip of the collar of iron.
"But young blood--oh, it would have its way and run its risks!"
Here the Sergeant smiled and raised his Montera cap. The men as
"courteously bade him good-day, preserving, however, a certain respectful"
"distance, and adding nothing to the information he had already obtained."
"But Chica, seated on her stone, with her scarlet-bound head on her hand,"
neither looked up nor gave him any greeting as his feet went slowly down
the rocky glen and crunched over the begrimed patches of last year's
"snow, now wide-pored and heavy with the heat of noonday."
now churned to milky foam by the ever-growing throng of prisoners; and
"all the time the big plants gulped the sea harvest, faster and faster,"
"clanking and gnashing their metal jaws, while the mounds of salmon lay"
hip-deep to the crews that fed the butchering machines.
The time had come for man to take his toll.
Now dawned a period of feverish activity wherein no one might rest
"short of actual exhaustion. Haste became the cry, and comfort fled."
"At Emerson's cannery there fell a sudden panic, for fifty fishermen"
"quit. Returning from the banks on the night before the run started,"
they stacked their gear and notified Boyd Emerson of their
"determination. Then, despite his utmost efforts to dissuade them, they"
took their packs upon their shoulders and marched up the beach to
"Willis Marsh's plant. Larsen, the day-foreman, acted as their"
So the real size and bounds of the Republic must be set down as somewhat
indeterminate.
The circumstances under which Panama became an independent nation have
been set forth in an earlier chapter. It is safe to say that with the
"heavy investment made by the United States in the Canal Zone, on the"
"strength of a treaty with the infant republic, the sovereignty of Panama"
will be forever maintained against all comers--except the United States
itself. There are political philosophers who think that the Isthmus
state may yet be the southern boundary of the Great Republic of the
North. For the present however Uncle Sam is quite content with the Canal
Zone and a certain amount of diplomatic influence over the government of
Panama.
[Illustration: THE GORGE OF SALAMANCA]
far from _The Bedford Castle_.
"To Marsh, already furious at the trick the ice had played him, this"
forced proximity to his rival brought home with added irony the fact
"that he had been forestalled, while it emphasized his knowledge that"
henceforth the conflict would be carried on at closer quarters. It
"would be a contest between two men, both determined to win by fair"
means or foul.
"Emerson was a dream-dazzled youth, striving like a knight-errant for"
"the love of a lady and the glory of conquest, but he was also a born"
"fighter, and in every emergency he had shown himself as able as his"
experienced opponent.
As Marsh looked about and saw how much Boyd's well-directed energy was
"accomplishing, he was conscious of a slight disheartenment. Still, he"
"was on his own ground, he had the advantage of superior force, and"
though he was humiliated by his failure to throttle the hostile
"enterprise in its beginning, he was by no means at the end of his"
"expedients. He was curious to see his rival in action, and he decided"
to visit him and test his temper.
"It was on the afternoon following his arrival that Marsh, after a tour"
"of inspection, landed from his launch and strolled up to where Boyd"
"Emerson was at work. He was greeted courteously, if a bit coolly, and"
"found, as on their last meeting, that his own bearing was reflected"
"exactly in that of Boyd. Both men, beneath the scant politeness of"
"their outward manner, were aware that the time for ceremony had passed."
Here in the Northland they faced each other at last as man to man.
"""I see you have a number of my old fishermen,"" Marsh observed."
"suddenly turned back, with a quick warning cry to her cavalcade. The"
"donkey instantly stood still, patient amid its fagots as an image in a"
"church. The goats scattered like water poured on flat ground, and began"
"to crop stray blades of grass, invisible to any eyes but their own, amid"
wastes of cracked earth and deserts of grey water-worn pebbles.
"As she looked back, Sergeant Cardono was disappearing up among the"
"tumbled foot-hills and dry beds of winter torrents, which render the"
"lower spurs of the Guadarrama such a puzzle to the stranger, and such a"
paradise for the smuggler and _guerrillero_. In another moment he had
disappeared. With a long quiet sigh La Giralda stole back to the
"farmhouse. In spite of her race, and heathenish lack of creed, the spark"
of humanity was far from dead in her bosom. The thought of the open eyes
"of the little girl, which gazed even in death with fixed rapture upon"
"her wooden treasure, remained with her."
"""The woman is as old as I--she can bide her time!"" she muttered to"
"herself. ""But the child--these arms are not yet so shrunken that they"
"cannot dig up a little earth to lay the babe thereunder."""
"And at the chamber door La Giralda paused. Like her people, she was"
neither a good nor yet a bad Catholic. Consciously or unconsciously she
"held a more ancient faith, though she worshipped at no shrine, told no"
"beads, and uttered no prayers."
"""They have not been long dead,"" she said to herself, as she entered;"
"""the window is open and the air is sweet. Yet the plague, which snatches"
"away the young and strong, may look askance at old Giralda's hold on"
"life, which at the best is no stronger than the strength of a"
"basting-thread!"""
"Having said these words she advanced to the low trundle-bed, and,"
interest in normal stories is difficult to rouse. I will not here dwell
"on the deleterious effects of over dramatic stimulation, which has been"
"known to lead to crime, since I am keener to prevent the telling of too"
many sensational stories than to suggest a cure when the mischief is
done. Kate Douglas Wiggin has said:
"“Let us be realistic, by all means, but beware, O Story-teller, of"
being too realistic. Avoid the shuddering tale of ‘the wicked boy who
"stoned the birds,’ lest some hearer should be inspired to try the"
dreadful experiment and see if it really does kill.”
"I must emphasise the fact, however, that it is only the excess of"
this dramatic element which I deplore. A certain amount of excitement

"subject, and I shall deal with it later on."
V.--_Stories presenting matters quite outside the plane of the child_
"(unless they are wrapped in mystery, which is of great educational"
value).
The element I wish to eliminate is the one which would make children
world-wise and old before their time.
A small American child who had entertained a guest in her mother's
"absence, when questioned as to whether she had shown all the"
"hospitality the mother would have considered necessary, said: “Oh! yes."
And I talked to her in the kind of ‘dressy’ tone _you_ use on your ‘At
Home’ days.”
"On one occasion I was lecturing in the town of Cleveland, and was to"
"stay in the house of a lady whom I had met only once, in New York, but"
with true American hospitality she had begged me to make her house my
"Brand had been to Jupiter on four different trips; and, as he walked"
"toward his quarters from Stone's office, he reviewed what he had"
learned on those trips.
"Jupiter, as he knew it, was a vast globe of vague horror and sharp"
contrasts.
"Distant from the sun as it was, it received little solar heat. But,"
"with so great a mass, it had cooled off much more slowly than any of"
"the other planets known, and had immense internal heat. This meant"
that the air--which closely approximated Earth's air in density--was
"cool a few hundred yards up from the surface of the planet, and dankly"
"hot close to the ground. The result, as the cold air constantly sank"
"into the warm, was a thick steamy blanket of fog that covered"
everything perpetually.
"Because of the recent cooling, life was not far advanced on Jupiter."
Too short a time ago the sphere had been but a blazing mass. Tropical
"marshes prevailed, crisscrossed by mighty rivers at warmer than blood"
"heat. Giant, hideous fernlike growths crowded one another in an"
"everlasting jungle. And among the distorted trees, from the blanket of"
"soft white fog that hid all from sight, could be heard constantly an"
ear-splitting chorus of screams and bellows and whistling snarls. It
made the blood run cold just to listen--and to speculate on what
gigantic but tiny-brained monsters made them.
"Now and then, when Brand had been flying dangerously low over the"
"surface, a wind had risen strong enough to dispel the fog banks for an"
"instant; and he had caught a flash of Jovian life. Just a flash, for"
"example, of a monstrous lizard-like thing too great to support its own"
"bulk: or a creature all neck and tail, with ridges of scale on its"
"Huge as a primitive nuclear reactor, the great electronic brain loomed"
above the knot of hush-voiced men. It almost filled a two-story room in
"the Thinkers' Foundation. Its front was an orderly expanse of controls,"
"indicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair"
on a boom.
"Although, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information"
"and questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not"
resist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great
"cryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its"
own controls--the permissible ones--and could doubtless improvise a
hearing apparatus if it wanted to.
For this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and
Maniacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.
This was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human
"brain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the"
rims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney
Island shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had
given instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This
"was the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased"
human judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.
_This was the machine that really thought--a million-plus!_
This was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy
professional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the
"machine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push, _had_"
"built. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and"
"girl-fondness, ""Maizie."""
"Gazing up at it, the President of the United States felt a chord"
"it, along the line of shivering women, and, pulling myself heavily"
"into the branches, managed to scramble up a few feet. The tree swayed"
"under my weight, but it bore me."
"The first dawn was whitening the sky and casting a faint, reflected"
"light on the glistening sea of osiers, that seemed to my eyes--for I"
was not high enough to look beyond it--to stretch far and away on
"every side. Here and there a large willow, rising in a round, dark"
"clump, stood out above the level; and in one place, about a hundred"
"paces away on the riverside of us, a group of these formed a shadowy"
"mound. I marked the spot, and dropped gently into the water."
"'I have found it,' I said. 'I will go first, and do you bring my lady,"
Steve. And mind the stumps. It will be rough work.'
"It was rough work. We had to wind in and out, leading and coaxing the"
"frightened horses, that again and again stumbled to their knees. Every"
minute I feared that we should find the way impassable or meet with a
"mishap. But in time, going very patiently, we made out the willows in"
"front of us. Then the water grew more shallow, and this gave the"
"animals courage. Twenty steps farther, and we passed into the shadow"
"of the trees. A last struggle, and, plunging one by one up the muddy"
"bank, we stood panting on the eyot."
It was such a place as only despair could choose for a refuge. In
"shape like the back of some large submerged beast, it lay in length"
"about forty paces, in breadth half as many. The highest point was a"
poor foot above the water. Seven great willows took up half the space;
"it was as much as our horses, sinking in the moist mud to the fetlock,"
could do to find standing-room on the remainder. Coarse grass and
reeds covered it; and the flotsam of the last flood whitened the
"trunks of the willows, and hung in squalid wisps from their lower"

The obstacles in the path of the fuller development of the national
resources of Panama have sprung wholly from the nature of its
"population. The Indian is, of course, not primarily an agriculturist,"
not a developer of the possibilities of the land he inhabits. The
Spanish infusion brought to the native population no qualities of
"energy, of well-directed effort, of the laborious determination to build"
up a new and thriving commonwealth. Spanish ideals run directly counter
"to those involved in empire building. Such energy, such determination as"
built up our great northwest and is building in British Columbia the
"greatest agricultural empire in the world, despite seven months annually"
"of drifting snow and frozen ground, would make of the Panama savannas"
and valleys the garden spot of the world. That will never be
"accomplished by the present agrarian population, but it is incredible"
that with population absorbing and overrunning the available
"agricultural lands of other zones, the tropics should long be left"
dormant in control of a lethargic and indolent people.

"Benjamin Kidd, in his stimulative book, “Social Evolution”, says on this"
subject:
“With the filling up to the full limit of the remaining territories
"suitable for European occupation, and the growing pressure of population"
"therein, it may be expected that the inexpediency of allowing a great"
tightened and I stopped breathing altogether. But the explosion that
"followed was fainter than the last. Then there was another, still"
further off. All my muscles gradually relaxed and a delicious feeling of
relief pervaded my whole being. The buzzing noise became more and more
"feeble. I got up and walked back to the marquee, trembling and weak at"
the knees. The others followed.
"Most of us went to bed, but a few continued to pace up and down in great"
agitation. One man picked up his blankets in a bundle and went off in
"order to sleep in the open fields, far away from the camp."
An hour had hardly passed before distant anti-aircraft fire broke out
"again. Anxiety began to renew its tortures. We heard the dull, sullen"
roar of bombs exploding at intervals. Then fourteen burst in rapid
succession as though a gigantic ball of solid iron had bounced fourteen
times with thundering reverberations on a resonant surface. But the
sound of firing died down and soon all was quiet. And then sleep came
upon us and our troubles were over for a time.
The next morning was windless and clear. All day we kept looking at the
"sky, but not a cloud was to be seen."
"The evening approached, darkness fell, and the stars shone. ""Lights Out"""
"was sounded and we extinguished our candles. None of us said a word, but"
everybody knew what everybody else was thinking of. And soon we heard
"the familiar buzz. At first it only came from one propeller, but others"
"arrived and the sound multiplied and increased in volume, and at the"
same time it rose and fell in irregular gusts and regular pulsations.
Anti-aircraft firing burst out suddenly and for a few minutes there was
"a blending of whining, whistling, rushing sounds overhead punctuated by"
"faint reports. The firing ceased, but the droning noises continued"
louder than ever. The German aeroplanes seemed to be above us like a
"The man was placed in a tent by himself, and to my surprise was"
alive and better the next morning; the expression was still
"anxious, but the face brighter and not sweating; the pulse"
"only numbered 100, but was very weak, and the hands and feet"
"were cold. The condition of the abdomen was unaltered, but the"
thoracic respiration had decreased in rapidity from 48 to 28.
His condition still seemed to preclude any chance of successful
"intervention, but none the less life was retained until the"
"morning of the seventh day, the state alternating between a"
moribund one and one of slight improvement. He was lucid at
"times, although for the most part wandering, and was so"
restless that no covering could be kept upon him. Vomiting was
"continuous, so that no nourishment could be retained; the"
"bowels acted frequently involuntarily, and little or no urine"
"was passed. Meanwhile, the abdomen became flat, then sunken, an"
area of induration and tenderness about 6 inches in diameter
developing around the wound of entry. Slight variations in the
"pulse, and from normal to subnormal in the temperature, were"
"noted, and death eventually occurred from septicæmia and"
inanition.
"(168*) Wounded at Driefontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), above the"
"posterior third of the left iliac crest, at the margin of the"
last lumbar transverse process (probably through ilio-lumbar
"ligament); _exit_, 1 inch below and to the left of the"
umbilicus.
"The patient was wounded at 3 P.M., but not brought into the"
"Field hospital until 9 P.M., when the temperature of the tents"
"was below 28°F. He was considerably collapsed, suffering much"
"pain, and vomited freely. The abdomen was flat, but very"
distended that little white beads were forcing themselves from the
"teats, and they expressed their desire for relief by plaintive"
whimperings and by laying their rough heads caressingly against La
Giralda's short and primitive skirt and leather-cased legs.
In a few moments after they had reached the pavilion the Princess came
"shouting back. She was certainly a most jovial little person, Spanish at"
"all points, with great dark eyes and cheeks apple-red with good health"
and the sharp airs of the Guadarrama. Doña Susana had walked a little in
"front of La Giralda and her flock, to show the superiority of her"
"position, and also, it may be, to display the amplitude of her several"
"chins, by holding them in the air in a manner as becoming as it was"
dignified.
"""Milk them! Milk them quickly! Let me see!"" the Princess shouted,"
clanging the pails joyously together. The walls of the pavilion in which
La Giralda found herself were decorated with every kind of household
"utensil, but not such as had ever been used practically. Everything was"
of silver or silver-gilt. There was indeed a complete _batterie de
"cuisine_--saucepans, patty-pans, graters, a mincing machine with the"
"proper screws and handles, shining rows of lids, and a complete"
graduated series of cooking spoons stuck in a bandolier. Salad dishes of
"sparkling crystal bound with silver ornamented the sideboard, while"
various earthen pots and pans of humbler make stood on a curiously
designed stove under whose polished top no fire had ever burned. At
"least so it appeared to La Giralda, who, much impressed by the"
"magnificence of the installation, would promptly have driven her goats"
out again.
But this the little Isabel would by no means permit.
"""Here--here!"" she commanded, ""this is mine--my very own. My mother has a"
"""Thanks for the compliment, Breck, but I'm your computer for this trip,"
"anyway. Newton, the good old egg, knows what you fellows are up against"
"and is going to do something about it, if he has to lick all the rest of"
the directors to do it. He knew that I was loose for a couple of weeks
and asked me to come along this trip to see what I could see. I'm to
check the observatory data--they don't know I'm aboard--take the peaks
"and valleys off your acceleration curve, if possible, and report to"
Newton just what I find out and what I think should be done about it.
"How early am I?"" While the newcomer was talking, he had stripped the"
covers from a precise scale model of the solar system and from a large
and complicated calculating machine and had set to work without a wasted
motion or instant--scaling off upon the model the positions of the
various check-stations and setting up long and involved integrals and
equations upon the calculator.
"The older man studied the broad back of the younger, bent over his"
"computations, and a tender, almost fatherly smile came over his careworn"
face as he replied:
"""Early? You? Just like you always were--plus fifteen seconds on the"
"deadline. The final dope is due right now."" He plugged the automatic"
"recorder and speaker into a circuit marked ""Observatory,"" waited until"
"a tiny light above the plug flashed green, and spoke."
"""IPV _Arcturus_; Breckenridge, Chief Pilot; trip number forty-three"

the plane of the ecliptic. The ether will be clear for you along route
"would be a further reduction. That was quite true. Bob knew, because he"
had had a vast deal of experience with the trust’s method of doing
"business. They would ruin him, no matter how great the cost, because he"
was dangerous to their continued well-being. With Bainbridge in the
"ring, and fighting vigorously against the graft and wholesale theft of"
"timberlands, those juicy melon cuttings which had been so pleasing to"
the stockholders would cease--therefore Bainbridge must go.
"Presently Bob’s eyes fell again to the letter, and somehow that single"
sentence seemed to stand out as if written in capitals: “It hurts like
"sin to say it, boy, but there’s nothing left to do but give in and make"
the best terms we can.”
"For a second Bob stared, the blood rushing into his face, a crimson"
"flood. Make terms with Crane? Go on his knees to that scoundrel, who had"
long ago parted with the last shred of decency and self-respect? Not
much!
"They must have resources enough to meet that note, at least. The trust"
could not keep the price of lumber down indefinitely. They must weather

"to be cut into lumber, they would have the laugh on Elihu Crane."
"Oblivious to the men about him, even to the fact that the cook had some"
"time ago announced supper, Bainbridge began to search his mind for means"
of staving off the evil day. Most of the stocks and bonds constituting
his private fortune had been already pledged as collateral for loans to
the firm. He still had a few thousand dollars’ worth of Steel Preferred
"which could be sold; and there was Pinecrest, the beautiful and costly"
"home on the outskirts of Bangor, which had been left him by his father."
"It should not be difficult to raise a mortgage of ten thousand, at"
"least, on the place."
moment that he was indeed the thrice-famous José Maria of Ronda. None
"asked a question as to his whence or whither. He was José Maria, and"
therefore entitled not only to be taken at once into the secrets of
"Egypt, but also, and it pleased him, to keep his own."
And very desperate and bloody some of 'his own' were. In the present
"instance, plunder and bloodshed were to proceed hand in hand. No quarter"
was to be given to old or young. The plague-stricken sick man and the
"watcher by the bed, the woman feeding her fire of sticks under her"
"_puchero_, the child asleep on its pillow, the Queen in the palace, the"
"Princess in her nursery--all were to die, quickly and suddenly. These"
men had sworn it. The dead were no tale-tellers. That was the way of
Egypt--the ancient way of safety. Were they not few and feeble in the
midst of innumerable hordes of the _Busne_? Had they not been driven
"like cattle, abused like dogs, sent guiltless to the scaffold, shot in"
"batches by both warring parties? Now in this one place at least, they"
would do a deed of vengeance at which the ears of the world would
tingle.
The Sergeant sat and smoked and listened. He was no stranger to such
talk. It was the way of his double profession of Andalucian bandit and
"Carlist _guerrilero_, to devise and execute deeds of terror and death."
But nothing so cold-blooded as this had José Maria ever imagined. He had
indeed appropriated the governmental mails till the post-bags almost
"seemed his own property, and the guards handed them down without"
"question as to a recognised official. He had, in his great days,"
captured towns and held them for either party according to the good the
matter was likely to do himself. But there was something revolting in
this whole business which puzzled him.
"""Whose idea was all this?"" he asked at last. ""I would give much to see"
"the _Gitano_ who could devise such a stroke."""
"Thus, even at the beginning of the Paleozoic, the continental"
plateau of North America had already been left by crustal
movements in relief above the abysses of the great oceans on
"either side. The mediterraneans which lay upon it were shallow, as"
"their sediments prove. They were EPICONTINENTAL SEAS; that is,"
"they rested UPON (Greek, EPI) the submerged portion of the"
continental plateau. We have no proof that the deep ocean ever
occupied any part of where North America now is.
The Middle and Upper Cambrian strata are found together with the
Lower Cambrian over the area of both the eastern and the western
"mediterraneans, so that here the sea continued during the entire"
period. The sediments throughout are those of shoal water. Coarse
cross-bedded sandstones record the action of strong shifting
currents which spread coarse waste near shore and winnowed it of
finer stuff. Frequent ripple marks on the bedding planes of the
strata prove that the loose sands of the sea floor were near
enough to the surface to be agitated by waves and tidal currents.
Sun cracks show that often the outgoing tide exposed large muddy
"flats to the drying action of the sun. The fossils, also, of the"
strata are of kinds related to those which now live in shallow
waters near the shore.
The sediments which gathered in the mediterranean seas were very
"thick, reaching in places the enormous depth of ten thousand feet."
"Hence the bottoms of these seas were sinking troughs, ever filling"
with waste from the adjacent land as fast as they subsided.

Cambrian are found resting unconformably on the pre-Cambrian rocks
from New York westward into Minnesota and at various points in the
"“Thank you,” said the girl, softly but heartily. “I am sure you need"
not trouble yourself any further. It was so awkward of me. And my shoe
heels are horridly common-sense; I can’t blame them at all.”
Chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest.
She was pretty in a refined way; and her eye was both merry and kind.
She was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a
sort of uniform such as shop girls wear. Her glossy dark-brown hair
showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament
was a velvet ribbon and bow. She could have posed as a model for the
self-respecting working girl of the best type.
A sudden idea came into the head of the young architect. He would ask
this girl to dine with him. Here was the element that his splendid but
solitary periodic feasts had lacked. His brief season of elegant luxury
would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady’s society. This
"girl was a lady, he was sure—her manner and speech settled that. And in"
spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to
sit at table with her.
"These thoughts passed swiftly through his mind, and he decided to ask"
"her. It was a breach of etiquette, of course, but oftentimes"
wage-earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind. They
were generally shrewd judges of men; and thought better of their own
"judgment than they did of useless conventions. His ten dollars,"
"discreetly expended, would enable the two to dine very well indeed. The"
dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull
routine of the girl’s life; and her lively appreciation of it would add
to his own triumph and pleasure.
"“I think,” he said to her, with frank gravity, “that your foot needs a"
"longer rest than you suppose. Now, I am going to suggest a way in which"
branches.
"For the first time we saw one another's faces, and how pale and"
"woe-begone, mudstained and draggled we were! The cold, grey light,"
"which so mercilessly unmasked our refuge, did not spare us. It helped"
even my lady to look her worst. Fraulein Anna sat a mere lifeless lump
in her saddle. The waiting-women cried softly; they had cried all
"night. The Waldgrave looked dazed, as if he barely understood where he"
was or why he was there.
"To think over-much in such a place was to weep. Instead, I hastened to"
"get them all off their horses, and with Steve's help and a great"
"bundle of osiers and branches which we cut, I made nests for them in"
"the lower boughs of the willows, well out of reach of the water. When"
"they had all taken their places, I served out food and a dram of"
"Dantzic waters, which some of us needed; for a white mist, drawn up"
"from the swamp by the rising sun, began to enshroud us, and, hanging"
"among the osiers for more than an hour, prolonged the misery of the"
night.
"Still, even that rolled away at last--about six o'clock--and let us"
see the sun shining overhead in a heaven of blue distance and golden
"clouds. Larks rose up and sang, and all the birds of the marsh began"
to twitter and tweet. In a trice our mud island was changed to a
bower--a place of warmth and life and refreshment--where light and
"shade lay on the dappled floor, and the sunshine fell through green"
leaves.
"Then I took the cloaks, and the saddles, and everything that was wet,"
and spread them out on branches to dry; and leaving the women to make
themselves comfortable in their own way and shift themselves as they
"pleased, we two, with the Waldgrave and the two servants, went away to"
"of all virtue. The type is well-known, and can be found at resorts and"
"boarding-houses, where it grows and flourishes."
"In spite of her wasted adolescence, her examination and her"
"""independence,"" she has been coming home from her office stool or her"
teacher's desk more or less exhausted; suddenly she finds herself in the
"midst of a sweet and unlimited idleness, with quantities of tinned food"
"for her meals. The company round her is continually changing, tourists"
"come and go, and she passes from hand to hand for walks and talks; the"
"tone is ""country informality."" This is sheer loose living; this is a life"
stripped of all purpose. She does not even sleep enough because she hears
"through the thin wall every sound made by her neighbor in the next room,"
while arriving or departing Englishmen bang doors all night. In a short
"time she has become a neurotic, sated with company, surfeited with herself"
and the place. She is ready to go off with the next halfway respectable
organ grinder that happens along. And so she pairs off with the most
"casual visitors, flirts with the guide, hovering about him and making"
"bandages for his fingers, and at last throws herself into the arms of a"
nameless nobody who has arrived at the house today.
This is the Torsen type.
"And now, at this very moment, she retires to her room to collect the"
"fragments of herself, in preparation for her departure--at the end of the"
"summer. It takes time; there are so many fragments, one in every corner."
But perhaps it consoles her to think that she knows the genitive of
_mensa_.
"Things are not quite so bad for the actor. He has staked nothing, is"
"committed to nothing. No part of his life is destroyed, nor anything"
"within him. As he came, so he goes, cheerful, empty, nice. In fact he is"
even something more of a man because he has really made a conquest. He has
"""It _has_ been a pleasant evening,"" she said, inanely."
"""I saw you for the first time to-night, Cherry. I think I have begun to"
"know you."""
"Again she felt her heart leap. Reaching out to say good-bye, his hand"
"slipped down over her arm, like a caress, until her palm lay in his."
"With trembling, gentle hands she pushed him from her; but even when the"
"sound of his footsteps had died away, she stood with eyes straining"
"into the gloom, in her breast a gladness so stifling that she raised"
her hands to still its tumult.
"Emerson, with the glow still upon him, felt a deep contentment which he"
did not trouble to analyze. It has been said that two opposite impulses
"may exist side by side in a man's mind, like two hostile armies which"
"have camped close together in the night, unrevealed to each other until"
the morning. To Emerson the dawn had not yet come. He had no thought of
"disloyalty to Mildred, but, after his fashion, took the feeling of the"
"moment unreflectively. His mood was averse to thought, and, moreover,"
the darkness forced him to give instant attention to his path. While
"the waters of the bay out to his right showed a ghostly gray, objects"
beneath the bluff where he walked were cloaked in impenetrable shadow.
"The air was damp with the breath of coming rain, and at rare intervals"
he caught a glimpse of the torn edges of clouds hurrying ahead of a
wind that was yet unfelt.
"When the black bulk of Marsh's cannery loomed ahead of him, he left the"
"gravel beach and turned up among the buildings, seeking to retrace his"
"former course. He noticed that once he had left the noisy shingle, his"
"feet made no sound in the soft moss. Thus it was that, as he turned the"
"corner of the first building, he nearly ran against a man who was"

our day--“_This is the lowest rate recorded in any quarter since civil
registration began._”
Now and again a blue-book upon the subject of the birth-rate is
dissected by a journalist and the result appears in his newspaper as a
series of startling figures. The story of England’s decadence is set
out in the plainest language for every one to read.
"At rarer intervals still, some prominent clergyman or sociologist"
"writes or lectures in order to call attention to what is going on, and"
thus to bring home the spiritual and economic dangers of our racial
suicide.
A few people read or listen and are convinced. A good many other
people are too utterly ignorant of either the Philosophy of
Christianity or the Science of Sociology to understand in the least
what the point of view of the protesters is. According to their
"temperament, they smile quietly and dismiss the subject, or bellow"
their disgust at such a subject being mentioned at all.

And all the time

money--in order that the dishonest men may not get it all.

Cabrera felt that he had wasted a great deal of time on a fine morning
"without shooting somebody, and it would certainly have gone ill with Don"
Luis or his brother if either of them had been compelled by the flames
to issue forth from the burning mill-house of Sarria.
But they were not there. The cur dogs of the village and a few
half-starved mongrels that followed the troops had great sport worrying
the rats which darted continually from the burning granaries. But of the
"more important human rats, no sign."
"All the inhabitants of the village were there likewise, held back from"
plundering by the bayonets of the Carlist troops. They stood recounting
"to each other, wistfully, the stores of clothes, the silk curtains, the"
"uncut pieces of broadcloth, the household linen, the great eight-day"
clocks in their gilt ormolu cases. Every woman had something to add to
the catalogue. Every householder felt keenly the injustice of
permitting so much wealth to be given to the crackling flames.
"""Yes, it was very well,"" they said; ""doubtless the Fernandez family were"
"vermin to be burned up--smoked out. But they possessed much good gear,"
the gathering of many years. These things have committed no treason
against either Don Carlos or the Regent Cristina. Why then are we not
permitted to enter and remove the valuables? It is monstrous. We will
"represent the matter to General Cabrera--to Don Carlos himself!"""
"But one glance at the former, as he sat his horse, nervously twisting"

"home needs, and the industry is as yet largely prosecuted in an"
unsystematic and haphazard manner. It is claimed that sample shipments
"of coffee brought high prices in New York, but as yet not enough is"
"grown to permit exportation. Cacao, which thrives, is grown chiefly by"
"English and German planters, but as yet in a small way only. Cotton,"
tobacco and fiber plants also grow readily in this region but are little
cultivated.

"A curious industry of the Chiriqui country, now nearly abandoned, was"
the collection of gold ornaments which the Guaymi Indians formerly
"buried with their dead. These images sometimes in human form, more often"
"in that of a fish, sometimes like frogs and alligators, jointed and"
"flexible, were at one time found in great quantities and formed a"
conspicuous feature of the Panama curiosity shops. In seeking these the
hunters walked back and forth over the grounds known to be Indian burial
"places, tapping the ground with rods. When the earth gave forth a hollow"
"sound the spade was resorted to, and usually a grave was uncovered. Jars"
"which had contained wine and food were usually found in the graves,"
which were in fact subterranean tombs carefully built with flat stones.
The diggers tell of finding skulls perfectly preserved apparently but
which crumbled to pieces at a touch. Evidently the burial places which
"can be identified through local tradition have been nearly exhausted,"
for the ancient trinkets cannot longer be readily found in the Panama
shops.

"interior, as in Missouri and in Texas. Hence after earlier"
"Cambrian time the central land subsided, with much the same effect"
"as if the Mississippi valley were now to lower gradually, and the"
Gulf of Mexico to spread northward until it entered Lake Superior.
The Cambrian seas transgressed the central land and strewed far
and wide behind their advancing beaches the sediments of the later
Cambrian upon an eroded surface of pre-Cambrian rocks.
The succession of the Cambrian formations in North America records
many minor oscillations and varying conditions of physical
geography; yet on the whole it tells of widening seas and lowering
lands. Basal conglomerates and coarse sandstones which must have
"been laid near shore are succeeded by shaly sandstones, sandy"
"shales, and shales. Toward the top of the series heavy beds of"
"limestone, extending from the Blue Ridge to Missouri, speak of"
"clear water, and either of more distant shores or of neighboring"
lands which were worn or sunk so low that for the most part their
waste was carried to the sea in solution.
"In brief, the Cambrian was a period of submergence. It began with"
the larger part of North America emerged as great land masses. It
closed with most of the interior of the continental plateau
covered with a shallow sea.
THE LIFE OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD
It is now for the first time that we find preserved in the
offshore deposits of the Cambrian seas enough remains of animal
life to be properly called a fauna. Doubtless these remains are
"only the most fragmentary representation of the life of the time,"
for the Cambrian rocks are very old and have been widely
metamorphosed. Yet the five hundred and more species already
"have been splendid and of some use.” Given the character of the lady,"
"we might, as adults, question the last part of the boy's statement, but"
this is pure cynicism and fortunately does not enter into the child's
calculations.
In my own personal experience (and I have told this story often in the
German ballad form to girls of ten and twelve in the High Schools in
England) I have never found one girl who sympathised with the lady or
who failed to appreciate the poetic justice meted out to her in the end
by the dignified renunciation of the knight.
"Chesterton defines sentimentality as “a tame, cold, or small and"
inadequate manner of speaking about certain matters which demand very
large and beautiful expression.”
"I would strongly urge upon young teachers to revise, by this"
"definition, some of the stories they have included in their repertory,"
and see whether they would stand the test or not.
IV.--_Stories containing strong sensational episodes._ The danger is
"all the greater because many children delight in it, and some crave for"
"it in the abstract, but fear it in the concrete.[19]"
"An affectionate aunt, on one occasion, anxious to curry favour with"
"a four-year-old nephew, was taxing her imagination to find a story"
suitable for his tender years. She was greatly startled when he
"suddenly said, in a most imperative tone: “Tell me the story of a"
_bear_ eating a small boy.” This was so remote from her own choice
"of subject that she hesitated at first, but coming to the conclusion"
that as the child had chosen the situation he would feel no terror
"in the working up of its details, she began a most thrilling and"
"blood-curdling story, leading up to the final catastrophe. But just as"
"the fibula. While being carried off the field, a second bullet"
(Lee-Metford) entered immediately outside the left posterior
"superior iliac spine, perforated the pelvis, and emerged 1-1/2"
inch within the left anterior superior spine. The patient was
then put down and left on the field ten hours; later he was
"carried to shelter for the night, and arrived at Orange River"
"on the second day. He suffered with some pain in the abdomen,"
"especially during the journey in the train, but was not sick;"
the bowels were confined.
"When seen on the third day at 6 P.M., some pain was complained"
"of in the abdomen, which moved freely in the upper part, but"
was motionless below the umbilicus. No distension. Tenderness
around wound of exit and some rigidity. The bowels had acted
"four times during the day; motions loose, dark brown, and"
"containing no blood. Face not anxious, eyes bright, temperature"
"102°. Pulse 96, regular, and of good strength. Tongue moist and"
little furred.
"The abdomen was opened at 5 A.M. on the fourth day, as the"
"local signs had become more pronounced, and the patient had"
passed a restless night in great abdominal pain. A local
"incision was chosen, as the wound was presumably in the sigmoid"
flexure. The sigmoid flexure was adherent to the abdominal wall
"opposite the wound of exit, and a dark ecchymosed patch was"
"found, but no perforation could be detected. Foul pus and gas"
"escaped freely from the pelvis, but no wound of the large bowel"
could be discovered here. On enlarging the incision upwards
"three openings were found in a coil of jejunum, probably that"
about five feet from the duodenal junction usually provided
with the longest mesentery. No fourth opening could be found.
"The openings were circular, about 1/3 inch in diameter, clean"
"hollow beneath Segovia. Others, breaking up into parties of from a dozen"
"to a hundred, had betaken themselves over the mountains in the direction"
of Madrid.
So the Queen-Regent and the handsome Señor Muñoz remained perforce at La
"Granja, for the two-fold reason that the palace of Madrid was reported"
"to be in the hands of a rebellious mob, and that the disbanding troops"
"had removed with them every sort and kind of conveyance, robbed the"
"stables of the horses, and plundered the military armoury of every"
useful weapon.
"They had not, however, meddled with the treasures of the palace, nor"
"offered any indignity to the Queen-Regent, or to any of the inmates of"
"La Granja. But as the Sergeant well knew, not thus would these be"
"treated by the roving bands of gipsies, who in a few hours would be"
"storming about the defenceless walls. No resource of oriental torture,"
no refinement of barbarity would be omitted to compel the Queen and her
consort to give up the treasures without which it was well known that
"they never travelled. Obviously, therefore, there was no time to be"
lost.
"They went swiftly round the angle of the palace, their feet making no"
sound on the clean delicious sward of those lawns which make the place
"such a marvel in the midst of tawny, dusty, burnt-up Spain. In a brief"
space the party arrived unnoted and unchecked under the wall of the
northern part.
"Lights still burnt in two or three windows on the second floor, though"
all was dark on the face which the palace turned towards the south and
the town of San Ildefonso.
"""These are the windows of the rooms occupied by my lady the"
"village. She assured the king that he was loyal and good, and would do"
no evil.
"The king was rather abashed that his design had been discovered, but he"
was firm in his purpose. He assured the queen that the blacksmith should
"come to no harm, but rather good; and he ordered the queen to obey him,"
threatening her that if she refused he would be sure that she was
"disloyal also, and there would be no alternative but to send and arrest"
"the blacksmith by force, and punish her, the queen, too. Then the queen"
said that if the king swore to her that her brother should come to no
"harm, she would write as ordered. _And the king swore._"
"So the queen wrote to her brother, and adjured him by his love to her to"
"come down to the Golden City. She said she had dire need of him, and she"
told him that the king had sworn that no harm should come to him.
The letter was sent off by a king's messenger. In due time the
"blacksmith arrived, and he was immediately seized and thrown into prison"
to await his trial.
"When the queen saw that she had been deceived, she was in despair. She"
"tried by every way, by tears and entreaties and caresses, to move the"
"king, but all without avail. Then she tried by plotting and bribery to"
"gain her brother's release, but it was all in vain. The day for trial"
"came quickly, and the blacksmith was tried, and he was condemned and"
sentenced to be burnt alive by the river on the following day.
On the evening of the day of trial the queen sent a message to the king
"to come to her; and when the king came reluctantly, fearing a renewal of"
"entreaties, expecting a woman made of tears and sobs, full of grief, he"
found instead that the queen had dried her eyes and dressed herself
"still more beautifully than ever, till she seemed to the king the very"
between the Governing Class and the People. Curiously enough the
respective responsive characteristics of the Anglo Saxon and the Indians
are paralleled by the two types of responses seen in all living matter.
In the one type the response is slow but proportionate to the stimulus
that excites it. The response grows with the strength of external force.
In the other it is quite different--here it is an all-or-none principle.
It either responds to the utmost or nothing at all. This is also
illustrated in the different racial characteristics. The Anglo Saxon has
"even by his rights by struggle, step by step. The insignificant little"
"has, by accumulation, became large, and which has been gained, has been"
gained for all time. But in the Indian the ideal and the emotional are
"the only effective stimulus. The ideal of his King is Rama, who"
renounced his kingdom and even his beloved for an idea. One day a king
and another day a bare-footed wanderer in the forest! Who cares? All or
nothing!
The concessions made by a modern form of Government safeguarded by
necessary limitations may appear almost as grudging gifts. The Indian
wants something which comes with unhesitating frankness and warmth and
strikes his ideality and imagination. But ancient and modern kingship
are sometimes at one in direct and spontaneous pronouncement of the
royal sympathy. Such was the Proclamation of Queen Victoria which
stirred to its depths the popular heart.
"""In the Prosperity of Our subjects will be our strength, in their"
"contentment Our security, in their Gratitude Our best Reward."""
That there are increasingly frequent reflexes in our Government to
popular needs and wishes is happily illustrated at a most opportune
moment from the statements in the recent _Gazette of India_ and cables
received from London. In the former we find that the Viceroy and his
council had recommended the abolition of the system of indentured
Of children such as this you may find any number. Only you have to look
"for them, as they are not brought forward spontaneously. The Burmese,"
"like other people, hate to have their beliefs and ideas ridiculed, and"
from experience they have learned that the object of a foreigner in
inquiring into their ways is usually to be able to show by his contempt
how very much cleverer a man he is than they are. Therefore they are
very shy. But once they understand that you only desire to learn and to
"see, and that you will always treat them with courtesy and"
"consideration, they will tell you all that they think."
"A fellow officer of mine has a Burmese police orderly, a young man about"
"twenty, who has been with him since he came to the district two years"
ago. Yet my friend only discovered accidentally the other day that his
orderly remembers his former life. He is very unwilling to talk about
"it. He was a woman apparently in that former life, and lived about"
"twenty miles away. He must have lived a good life, for it is a step of"
promotion to be a man in this life; but he will not talk of it. He
"forgets most of it, he says, though he remembered it when he was a"
child.
Sometimes this belief leads to lawsuits of a peculiarly difficult
"nature. In 1883, two years before the annexation of Upper Burma, there"
"was a case that came into the local Court of the oil district, which"
depended upon this theory of transmigration.
Opposite Yenangyaung there are many large islands in the river. These
"islands during the low water months are joined to the mainland, and are"
covered with a dense high grass in which many deer live.
"When the river rises, it rises rapidly, communication with the mainland"
"is cut off, and the islands are for a time, in the higher rises,"
entirely submerged. During the progress of the first rise some hunters
"“The note’s for ten thousand, so that’s all straightened out,”"
"Bainbridge murmured, with a snap of his fingers. “The money from the"
stock can go for current expenses. I’ll fix it up this very night.”
He did. Fortunately Tweedy held his power of attorney with the right to
"sign checks and execute papers of any sort, so it was possible for him"
to put through these deals without his returning to Bangor. That another
note for nearly as much as the first fell due in little more than a
"fortnight Bainbridge knew quite well. By that time, however, he fully"
"intended to have the drive down as far as their mill at Lancaster, fifty"
miles or so above Bangor. And it is always possible to raise money on
"timber, even in the rough."
"Of course, if the trust continued their campaign of cutting prices Bob’s"
"plans would be materially affected. He could not believe, however, that"
they would do such a thing for any great length of time. A dollar meant
"as much to them as to any one, and even the pleasure of ruining a"
competitor would scarcely compensate for the loss of so much money.
A long letter of instruction and explanation was written to Tweedy that
"night, and despatched the first thing in the morning by the trusty hand"
"of Joe Moose, the Indian. That off his mind, Bob returned to his drive"
"with renewed vigor, for the necessity for haste was now even greater"
than before. It was a question of getting the logs down in double-quick
time or being dragged into the bankruptcy court; and that sort of
notoriety did not appeal in the least to the young man.
It was this feeling of necessity which got Bob up next morning before
the blackness of the night was more than faintly tinged by streaks of
pale gray in the east. He wanted to be off and doing; even necessary
inaction chafed. It seemed an eternity before the men had finished
is proud of it.
"""It comes from my home."" And then he asks about the bread of Sicily. Is"
"it any whiter than _this_--the Mandas rock. Yes, it is a little whiter."
"At which they gloom again. For it is a very sore point, this bread."
Bread means a great deal to an Italian: it is verily his staff of life.
"He practically lives on bread. And instead of going by taste, he now,"
"like all the world, goes by eye. He has got it into his head that bread"
"should be white, so that every time he fancies a darker shade in the"
loaf a shadow falls on his soul. Nor is he altogether wrong. For
"although, personally, I don't like white bread any more, yet I do like"
"my brown bread to be made of pure, unmixed flour. The peasants in"
"Sicily, who have kept their own wheat and make their own natural brown"
"bread, ah, it is amazing how fresh and sweet and _clean_ their loaf"
"seems, so perfumed as home-bread used all to be before the war. Whereas"
"the bread of the commune, the regulation supply, is hard, and rather"
"coarse and rough, so rough and harsh on the palate. One gets tired to"
death of it. I suspect myself the maize meal mixed in. But I don't know.
"And finally the bread varies immensely from town to town, from commune"
to commune. The so-called just and equal distribution is all my-eye. One
"place has abundance of good sweet bread, another scrapes along, always"
"stinted, on an allowance of harsh coarse stuff. And the poor suffer"
"bitterly, really, from the bread-stinting, because they depend so on"
this one food. They say the inequality and the injustice of distribution
comes from the Camorra--la grande Camorra--which is no more nowadays
"than a profiteering combine, which the poor hate. But for myself, I"
"don't know. I only know that one town--Venice, for example--seems to"
"have an endless supply of pure bread, of sugar, of tobacco, of"
salt--while Florence is in one continual ferment of irritation over the
"stinting of these supplies--which are all government monopoly, doled out"
accordingly.
although the dream might be said to lend itself to such suggestions.
The idea of moral retribution and eternal punishment may also be present
in dreams. This may be illustrated by the dream of a lady who had an ill
"and restless girl companion sleeping with her, and was disturbed as well"
by a yelping and howling terrier outside. She had also lately heard that
a friend had brought over a python from Africa. 'I dreamed last night I
had a basket of cold squirming snakes beside me; they just touched me all
"over, but did not hurt; I felt mad with loathing and hate of them, and"
"the beasts would not kill me. That, I thought, was my eternal punishment"
for my sins.' In her waking moments the dreamer was not apprehensive of
"eternal punishment, and it may be in such a case that, as Freud suggests,"
an unfamiliar moral idea emerges in sleep in much the same way as an
unfamiliar or 'forgotten' fact may emerge.
"On the whole, it may be said that while the moral attitude of the dreaming"
"state is not usually identical with that of the waking state, there still"
nearly always is a moral attitude. It could not well be otherwise. Our
emotional states are intimately bound up with moral relationships; we
"could not display such highly emotional states as we experience in dreams,"
"with all their tragic accompaniments, in the absence of any sense of"
morality.

“From the above one might conclude that cleanliness and modesty are not
"the rule among the Chocos. As a matter of fact, the first thing they do"
"in the morning is to jump into the near-by river, and these ablutions"
are repeated several times in the course of the day.
"“The kitchen utensils are always thoroughly washed before using, and,"
"contrary to our former experience, their simple dishes, prepared mostly"
"in our presence, looked almost always inviting. During our stay among"
these good people nothing was noticed that would hurt the most delicate
sense of decency.
"“The Chocoes seem to be exclusively monogamist, and both parents"
"surround their babies with tender care, being mindful, however, to"
prepare them early for the hard and struggling life ahead of them.
"Small bows and arrows, dexterously handled by tiny hands, are the"
"favorite toys of the boys, while the girls spend more time in the water"
"playing with miniature dugouts, washing, and swimming. The only dolls"
"seen among them were imported ones, and they seemed to be as much in"
favor among grown women as among children. These latter go naked until
"they are about five years old, when the girls receive a large"
"handkerchief to be used as a ‘paruma’, or skirt, and the boys a strip of"
some old maternal dress for an ‘antia’ or clout.
"“The Chocoes are very industrious. During the dry spells their life, of"
"course, is an out-of-door one, planting and watching their crops,"
"hunting, fishing and canoeing. But when the heavy rains come they stay"
"at home, weaving baskets of all kinds--a work in which the women are"
"proficient--making ropes and hammocks, carving dishes, mortars, stools,"
and other objects out of tree trunks”.

There was one point that puzzled me for a time in some of these stories
"of transmigration, such as the one I told about the man and wife being"
"reborn twins. It was this: A man dies and leaves behind children, let us"
"say, to whom he is devoutly attached. He is reborn in another family in"
"the same village, maybe. It would be natural to suppose that he would"
"love his former family as much as, or even more than, his new one."
Complications might arise in this way which it is easy to conceive would
cause great and frequent difficulties.
"I explained this to a Burman one day, and asked him what happened, and"
"this is what he said: 'The affection of mother to son, of husband to"
"wife, of brother to sister, belongs entirely to the body in which you"
"may happen to be living. When it dies, so do these affections. New"
"affections arise from the new body. The flesh of the son, being of one"
"with his father, of course loves him; but as his present flesh has no"
"sort of connection with his former one, he does not love those to whom"
he was related in his other lives. These affections are as much a part
of the body as the hand or the eyesight; with one you put off the
other.'
"Thus all love, to the learned, even the purest affection of daughter to"
"mother, of man to his friend, is in theory a function of the body--with"
"the one we put off the other; and this may explain, perhaps, something"
"of what my previous chapter did not make quite clear, that in the"
hereafter[2] of Buddhism there is no affection.
"When we have put off all bodies, when we have attained Nirvana, love and"
"hate, desire and repulsion, will have fallen from us for ever."
"Meanwhile, in each life, we are obliged to endure the affections of the"
"""Come,--let us go!"" she said gently. ""We twain, made one in love and"
"faith, must hasten to begin our work!--darkness gathers and deepens"

"Away in a sheltered mountainous retreat, apart from the louder clamor"
"of the world, the Poet and his heavenly companion dwell in peace"
"together. Their love, their wondrous happiness, no mortal language can"
"define,--for spiritual love perfected as far exceeds material passion"
as the steadfast glory of the sun outshines the nickering of an earthly
"taper. Few, very few, there are who recognize, or who attain, such"
"joy,--for men chiefly occupy themselves with the SEMBLANCES of things,"
and therefore fail to grasp all high realities. Perishable

But for those whose pleasure it is to doubt and deny all spiritual life
"and being, the history of Theos Alwyn can be disposed of with much"
"languid ease and cold logic, as a foolish chimera scarce worth"

it can all be traced to a powerful exertion of magnetic skill. Tranced
"into a dream bewilderment by the arts of the mystic Chaldean,"
"Heliobas,--tricked into visiting the Field of Ardath, what more likely"
"than that a real earth-born maiden, trained to her part, should have"
"met the dreamer there, and, with the secret aid of the hermit Elezar,"
continued his strange delusion? What more fitting as a sequel to the
"whole, than that the same maiden should have been sent to him again in"
"the great Rhine Cathedral, to complete the deception and satisfy his"
"must soon! It is a short start, and half of us on foot!'"
"No one answered, but in a moment we had the Waldgrave, my lady,"
"Fraulein, and one of the women mounted. Then we put up Marie, who was"
"no heavier than a feather, and the lighter of the women on the"
"remaining horse; and Steve hurrying beside the leader, and I, Ernst,"
"and Jacob bringing up the rear, we were well on the road within two"
minutes of the appearance of the horses. Those who rode had only
sacking for saddles and loops of rope for stirrups; but no one
"complained. Even Fraulein Max began to recover herself, and to dwell"
more upon the peril of capture than on aching legs and chafed knees.
"The road was good, and we made, as far as I could judge, about six"
miles in the first hour. This placed us nine miles from the camp; the
"time, a little after midnight. At this point the clouds, which had"
"aided us so far by increasing the darkness of the night, fell in a"
"great storm of rain, that, hissing on the road and among the trees, in"
a few minutes drenched us to the skin. But no one complained. Steve
muttered that it would make it the more difficult to track us; and for
"another hour we plodded on gallantly. Then our leader called a halt,"
and we stood listening.
"The rain had left the sky lighter. A waning moon, floating in a wrack"
"of watery clouds to westward, shed a faint gleam on the landscape. To"
"the right of us it disclosed a bare plain, rising gradually as it"
"receded, and offering no cover. On our left, between us and the river,"
it was different. Here a wilderness of osiers--a grey willow swamp
that in the moonlight shimmered like the best Utrecht--stretched as
"far as we could see. The road where we stood rose a few feet above it,"
so that our eyes were on a level with the highest shoots; but a
hundred yards farther on the road sank a little. We could see the
"water standing on the track in pools, and glimmering palely."
"""Oh, if I could only save him, Lois! He was the first man I had ever"
"met whom I trusted, the first to trust me. I owe him everything, the"
little that is good in me. It had to come to life when he believed in

"Lois made no answer. With a warm, impulsive gesture she put her arms"
"about the taller woman's neck and, drawing the beautiful face down to"
"her own, kissed her. Beatrice responded, and thus a friendship was"
"sealed--not for life but for death, whose grim cordon was with every"
moment being drawn closer about them.
The sound of firing had now grown incessant. One report followed
"another at swift, irregular intervals, and each sounded like a clap of"
"thunder in the silent room. Mrs. Cary stirred uneasily in her sleep, a"
"low, scarcely audible groan escaped the parted lips, as though even in"
her dreams she was being pursued by fear's pitiless phantom. Her
"self-appointed nurse continued to fan her with the energy of despair,"
the poor livid face twitching at every fresh threatening sound. Mrs.
"Carmichael still pretended to be absorbed in her pinafore, but the"
"revolver lay on the table, ready to hand, and there was a look in the"
steady eyes which boded ill for the first enemy who should confront
her. Lois and Beatrice continued their fruitless task.
A woman's courage is the supreme victory of mind over matter. It is no
easy thing for a hero to sit still and helpless while death rattles
his bullet fingers against the walls and screams in voices of hate and
fury from a distance which every minute diminishes. For a woman
"burdened with the disability of a high-strung nervous system, it is a"
"martyrdom. Yet these women, brought up on the froth of an enervating,"
"pleasure-seeking society, held out--held out with a martyr's courage"
"and constancy--against the torture of inactivity, of an imagination"
"""Go down a hundred yards or so,"" she said, ""and there you will find a"
gate. Open it with that key and bring over your animals to the little
"pavilion among the trees by the fountain."""
Upon hearing this the Princess instantly changed her tune. She had got
"her own way, and now it was ""Beautiful Doña Susana! Precious and"
"loveliest companion, when I am Queen you shall have the greatest and"
"handsomest grandee in the kingdom to be your husband, and walk in"
"diamonds and rubies at our court balls! Yes, you shall. I promise it by"
my royal oath. And now I will run to the house kitchen for basins to
"catch the goats' milk in, and my little churn to churn the butter"
"in--and--and----"""
But before she had catalogued half the things that she meant to find and
"bring she departed at the top of her speed, making the air ring with her"
shouts of delight.
"Slowly, and with the meekest dignity, La Giralda did as she was bidden."
"She found the little gate, which, indeed, proved so narrow that she"
could not get her donkey to pass through with his great side-burdens of
"fagots. But as these were not at all heavy, La Giralda herself detached"
"them, and, laying them carefully within the railings, she unhaltered the"
"patient beast and, tying him only with a cord about his neck, left him a"
generous freedom of browsing upon the royal grass-plots and undergrowth.
"The goats, however, perhaps alarmed by the trim daintiness of the place"
"and the unwonted spectacle of unlimited leaves and forage, kept close"
"together. One or two of them, indeed, smelt doubtfully at luxuriant"
"tufts, but as they had only previously seen grass in single blades, and"
"amid Saharas of gravel and sand, the experiment of eating an entire"
mouthful at a time appeared too hazardous and desperate. They were of a
"cautious turn of mind, in addition to which their udders had become so"
love and was dominated by a passion for this man.
"So that, with no reason whatever in her mind to question the sincerity"
"of Johnson's love for her, it would seem as if nothing were wanting to"
make the Girl perfectly happy; that there could be no room in her heart
"for any feeling other than elation. And yet, curiously enough, the Girl"
could not doze off to sleep. Some mysterious force--a vague foreboding
of something about to happen--impelled her to open her eyes again and
again.
"It was an odd and wholly new sensation, this conjuring up of distressing"
"spectres, for no girl was given less to that sort of thing; all the"
"same, it was with difficulty that she checked an impulse to cry out to"
"her lover--whom she believed to be asleep--and make him dissipate, by"
"renewed assurances, the mysterious barrier which she felt was hemming"
her in.
"As for Johnson, the moment that his head had touched the pillows, he"
"fell to thinking of the awkward situation in which he was placed, the"
"many complications in which his heart had involved him and, finally, he"
found himself wondering whether the woman whom he loved so dearly was
also lying sleepless in her rug on the floor.
And so it was not surprising that he should spring up the moment that he
heard cries from outside.
"""Who's that knockin', I wonder?"""
"Although her voice showed no signs of distress or annoyance, the"
"question coming from her in a calm tone, the Girl was upon her feet"
almost before she knew it. In a trice she removed all evidences that she
"had been lying upon the floor, flinging the pillows and silk coverlet to"
in the course of a few days he became a raving lunatic.
"Often the keepers, although only condemned to imprisonment for a"
"certain period at a time, have to tolerate a longer stay, owing to"
the relief-boat being unable to approach them. In some instances the
delay may run into five weeks or more. During the winter the relief of
"the Eddystone, Longships, Wolf, Fastnet, Skerryvore, and Dhu-Heartach"
lights is always a matter of extreme uncertainty. Although the men
"have to provide themselves with supplies, a reserve is maintained at"
the station by the authorities for such emergencies. Even some of the
land stations are not approachable readily. There is the Punta Gorda
"light-station on the Californian coast, the situation of which is wild"
"and forbidding. There is a landing about eight miles above the station,"
"but it is extremely precarious. Still, unless a certain element of risk"
"is accepted in coming ashore here, it is necessary to face a tramp or"
stage journey of nearly fifty miles across country in order to gain the
lighthouse.
"The lighthouses in the Red Sea are, perhaps, among the most unenviable"
"and trying in the world. This stretch of water, lying between two"
"blistered coasts of sand, is no more or less than an oven, where even"
the strongest constitution finds it difficult to hold out for long.
"Moreover, the absence of civilization, owing to the extreme aridity of"
"the country, renders the life exceptionally depressing. In the summer"
the heat is wellnigh intolerable. The thermometer hovers between 95°
"and 110° F. in the shade throughout the twenty-four hours, so that"
night brings no relief to the oppressiveness.
"At some of the stations the men seek a little diversion, and"
"incidentally add occasionally to their pocket-money, by shark-catching,"
"which is a tolerably profitable pursuit, since these waters are thickly"
infested with this fish. The jawbone and backbone invariably find ready
hospitals and also among the brave wives of the soldiers so
fascinating that from the New Year till early June I let all social
"duties slip, so much so that I had a nervous breakdown in June, and"
since then have had to go very slow.
We had a splendid time at our seaside cottage at Negishi this
"afternoon, any amount of our dear brown soldiers round us. There"
are five hundred quartered in that fishing village just now; they
"were resting, bathing, boating, washing their clothes or cooking"
"their chow, but never a rude word or an uncouth action; no"
"rowdyism, but all as civil, quiet, good-tempered, and alert as"
possible; they are a marvel; and my children go in and out among
"them and love them, like I do! I could _kill_ white idiots when I"
hear them speak of those fine fellows as 'an inferior race.' Ye
"gods! 'inferior' with never a camp follower to their name, and"
rapine unknown even after the fiercest fight! What European race
can show a record like that? I wish I could be home for six months
and tell what the soldiers and their wives are--what miracles of
cheerful patience and manly dignity the wounded men are as they lie
"hacked and maimed, sometimes till almost all semblance of manhood"
"is gone, yet never a murmur does any one hear from their lips--no,"
"not if they are armless, legless, and even _blind_. And you would"
not dare condole with them! They say and believe they 'are greatly
"honoured.' When they embrace Christianity, they shame the brightest"
"Christian among us, and I come away from visiting the hospitals"
"feeling so small, so humble, yet at peace with all the world. We"
"have very, very much to learn from this great people."
"This second extract, about a soldier's wife, may come home to your"
readers even more:--
I allow two families a small sum of money every week. One case is
"""We must take the rough and the smooth of life as we find it,"" answered"
"the other.  ""I have had my moments of rebellion—I have them still; but I"
seek the consolations of philosophy; and I have never yet wanted for
bread or shelter.  But there be times when the future looks dark before
"me.  Those who remember me, and pity my misfortunes, drop away one by"
one.  I lacked not for patrons at the first. When I could not longer
"tread the boards, I was ofttimes engaged to make men laugh or weep at"
"some gay rout at a nobleman’s house.  Then, too, my jests and quips were"
"in request at gay supper-parties, and I was paid to set the table in a"
"roar, which in all sooth was not difficult when the wine-bottle was"
"going round and round.  Oh, I knew gay times for many a year after my"
stage career closed. But patrons have died off one by one.  I am more
"crippled than I was, and the young wits are pushing to the front, whilst"
the Old Lion has been crowded out.  My pen still serves me in a measure.
"I can turn an epigram, or write a couplet, or even make shift to pen a"
"sonnet that lacks not the true ring.  Grist yet comes to the mill, but"
more and more slowly.  There come moments when I wonder what will be the
"end of the Old Lion’s career—the poorhouse, or a death by slow"
"starvation in some garret!"""
"""No, no,"" cried Grey almost fiercely; ""that would be shame indeed."
"Surely, if nothing better turn up, there must be places of refuge for"
"fallen genius. Have not almshouses been built, again and again, by the"
"well-disposed for such men as sickness has laid aside?  You smile, but"
"in sooth it is so."""
"""Ay, and how many are there to claim the benefits of pious founders?"
"Yet no matter.  I brought you not here to talk of my troubles, but of"
"yours.  That romance of which you speak—"""
"""It would seem the world cares little for such things.  I did hear the"
"same tale everywhere.  Was it a pamphlet I had to give them, a lampoon"
which will certainly remain as the most lasting monument raised to the
memory of the poet on this occasion. This troubled peace cannot make
him deviate from the path of his appointed labour any more than the war
"could; in peace as in war, his duty is his daily task, here and to-day,"
and his confidence in the morality and usefulness of that work which is
"his work is as little shaken by the prophets of despair in peace, as"
it was by the messiahs of the promised land who were so loud above the
turmoil of war. He is probably now noting with a smile that the same
"men who talked of the war to end all wars, are now very busy preventing"
"our civilization from dying away; that is, building a peace in the"
"abstract, with programs and words, as they fought a war which was not"
"the war, but a phantasm of their imagination."

II. THE THEORY OF HISTORY
Two meanings of the word history--History as contemporary history--
"History and chronicle--The spirit as history--Philology, and"
philological history--Poetical and rhetorical history--Universal
history--The universality of history: history and philosophy--The
unity of thought--Philosophy as methodology--The positivity of
history--The humanity of history--Distinctions and divisions--The
history of nature.
"There are two meanings to the word history, in English as well as in"
"breakfast, and were ready for the day’s work. As a matter of fact, they"
"took less time than usual, for something of Bainbridge’s intense"
eagerness for speed seemed to have made itself felt.
All morning Bob worked like a Trojan getting the drive out into the
"Katahdin River. He did not storm and swear at his men, as many bosses"
do. Instead he had a way of jollying them along in a manner which might
"sound superficially like fun, but which held more than an undercurrent"
"of seriousness. He treated them as human beings, not as if they were"
"slaves from whom every last atom of work was to be extracted. And yet,"
"when the need arose, he could hand out a rebuke, the caustic sting of"
which was enough to make a man’s hair stand on end. The result was that
"the crew soon admired him, and when they found how urgent was the need"
"for haste they fell to with a will, and gave the best that was in them."
"Bainbridge was not long in perceiving their attitude, and it gratified"
him intensely. He had never actually had charge of a drive before. He
"knew the theory, of course, but that is very different from the"
practical operation; and the discovery that he could handle a
rough-and-ready crowd like this in a manner so totally different from
that generally practiced by bosses of crews gave him no small
satisfaction.
"By dint of constant labor, at which Bob spared neither himself nor his"
"men, the drive was successfully swung into the slightly larger river by"
two o’clock. There was no real respite even then. The stream was almost
"as difficult as the Megantic, and constant watchfulness was necessary to"
prevent fresh jams at a number of points. Consequently the men snatched
a hurried dinner in relays and hustled back to work again.
"It was about three, and Bob had just left the spot where only the most"
strenuous personal labor on the part of himself and four river jacks had
"examined it, but there was no writing upon it.  Apparently it was her"
"reserve store of paper, to be used as wanted.  In the French Ministry of"
"Foreign Affairs everything is methodical, especially the preparation of"
"the dossiers.  A certain dossier had once fallen into Kaye's hands, and"
it contained sheets of exactly similar paper to that which I held in my
hand.
"Eagerly I continued my search, striving to discover some writing which"
"might lead me to a knowledge of the truth, but I found nothing.  I had"
"completed an examination of the whole of the contents of the drawers,"
when it occurred to me that there might be some other drawer concealed
there.  Years ago I had been offered an escritoire of this pattern in
"Genoa, and the sun-tanned fellow who endeavoured to induce me to"
purchase it had shown behind the centre drawer in the table a cunningly
contrived cavity where private correspondence might be concealed.
"Therefore I drew out the drawer, sounded the interior at the back, and,"
"finding it hollow, searched about for the spring by which it might be"
"opened.  At last I found it, and next moment drew forth a bundle of"
letters.  They were bound with a blue ribbon that time had faded.  I
"glanced at the superscription of the uppermost, and a thrill of sympathy"
went through me.
Those carefully preserved letters were my own--letters full of love and
"tenderness, which I had written in the days that were dead.  I stood"
"holding them in my hand, my heart full of the past."
"In this narrative, my reader, it is my intention to conceal nothing, but"
"to relate to you the whole, undisguised truth, even though this chapter"
of England's secret history presents a seemingly improbable combination
of strange facts and circumstances.  Therefore I will not hide from you
"the truth that in those moments, as I drew forth one of the letters I"
"for the erudite, who are few; we shall bark to stir up the people. After"
1520 he writes again and again: 'I am stoned every day'.
"But Erasmus, however much he might see himself, not without reason, at"
"the centre, could, in 1519 and 1520, no longer be blind to the fact that"
the great struggle did not concern him alone. On all sides the battle
"was being fought. What is it, that great commotion about matters of"
spirit and of faith?
The answer which Erasmus gave himself was this: it is a great and wilful
conspiracy on the part of the conservatives to suffocate good learning
and make the old ignorance triumph. This idea recurs innumerable times
"in his letters after the middle of 1518. 'I know quite certainly', he"
"writes on 21 March 1519 to one of his German friends, 'that the"
barbarians on all sides have conspired to leave no stone unturned till
they have suppressed _bonae literae_.' 'Here we are still fighting with
the protectors of the old ignorance'; cannot Wolsey persuade the Pope to
stop it here? All that appertains to ancient and cultured literature is
called 'poetry' by those narrow-minded fellows. By that word they
"indicate everything that savours of a more elegant doctrine, that is to"
"say all that they have not learned themselves. All the tumult, the whole"
tragedy--under these terms he usually refers to the great theological
struggle--originates in the hatred of _bonae literae_. 'This is the
source and hot-bed of all this tragedy; incurable hatred of linguistic
"study and the _bonae literae_.' 'Luther provokes those enemies, whom it"
"is impossible to conquer, though their cause is a bad one. And meanwhile"
"envy harasses the _bonae literae_, which are attacked at his (Luther's)"
"instigation by these gadflies. They are already nearly insufferable,"
when things do not go well with them; but who can stand them when they
"triumph? Either I am blind, or they aim at something else than Luther."
They are preparing to conquer the phalanx of the Muses.'
their kids.
"Then, as if in a very vexing dream, she could almost but never quite"
"see, through the thickening mist of the years, once-familiar"
"faces--white men, with swords, in ragged uniforms, and big brown ones"
"with wicked eyes and long, thin guns, glaring down at her over a high"
"wall, through smoke and fire, and fighting, and the acrid reek of"
powder....
"And there remembrance grew blank altogether, until it connected with"
"Captain Dove, on the deck of a slaving-dhow far out of sight of any"
land. She had been only a little child when he had carried her up the
"side of his own ship in his arms, while she laughed gleefully in his"
"face and pulled at his shaggy moustache, but she could still remember"
some of the incidents of that day.
"She had lived on board his successive ships ever since. And ever since,"
"until recently, he had always been very good to her, in his own queer,"
gruff way. He had always treated her as though she were a child of his
"own, shielding her, in so far as he could, from even the knowledge of"
all the evil which he had done up and down the world. She had grown up
in the belief that his despotic guardianship was altogether for her good
and not to be disputed.
"But now--she was no longer a child. And all her old, unquestioning faith"
"in his inherent good intentions, toward her at least, was finally"
shattered. She knew now that he really looked upon her as a mere
"chattel, with a cash value--just as if she had been one of the hapless"
cargo of human cattle confined in the pestiferous hold of the dhow on
whose deck he had found her at play. She knew now that he had bought and
"paid for them as well as her, and sold them again at a fat profit, far"
"across the seas--all but the dumb, deformed black woman whom he had"
CHAPTER III
PHILOSOPHY BEFORE FERRIER'S DAY
In attempting to give some idea of philosophy as it was in Scotland in
"the earlier portion of the present century, we shall have to go back"
"two hundred years or thereabout, in order to find a satisfactory basis"
"from which to start. For philosophy, as no one realised more than"
"Ferrier, is no arbitrary succession of systems following one upon"
another as their propounders might decree; it is a development in the
truest and highest significance of that word. It means the gradual
working out of the questions which reason sets to be answered; and
"though it seems as if we had sometimes to turn our faces backwards, and"
"to revert to systems of bygone days, we always find, when we look more"
"closely, that in our onward course we have merely dropped some thread"
"in our web, the recovery of which is requisite in order that it may be"
duly taken up and woven with the rest.
"At the time of which we write the so-called 'Scottish School' of Reid,"
"Stewart, and Beattie reigned supreme in orthodox Scotland; it had"
"undisputed power in the Universities, and besides this obtained a very"
"reputable place in the estimation of Europe, and more especially of"
France. As it was this school more especially that Ferrier spent much
"of his time in combating, it is its history and place that we wish"
"shortly to describe. To do so, however, it is needful to go back to its"
"real founder, Locke, in order that its point of view may fairly be set"
forth.
"policeman into a skilled worker at a moment's notice. How is it done?"""
"""He begins at the other end. All his skilled workmen are the best he"
can pick out of their various trades. They have served their full time
as apprentices and journeymen. They are recommended to him by their
"employers after careful testing and sounding. Most of them, I believe,"
come from the Government dockyards and ordnance factories. They are
"given a course of police training at Scotland Yard, and then dropped"
"down wherever they may be wanted. Dawson, and inspectors like him,"
"have these men everywhere--in shipyards, in shell shops, in gun"
"factories, in aeroplane sheds, everywhere. They take a leading part in"
"the councils of the unions wherever they go, for they add to their"
"skill as workmen a pronounced, even blatant parade of loyalty to the"
interests of trade unions and a tasty flavour of socialist principles.
"Dawson is perfectly cynically outspoken to me over the business which,"
"I confess, appals me. In his female agents--of which he has many--he"
favours what he calls a 'judicious frailty'; in his male agents he
favours a subtle skill in the verbal technique of anarchism. And this
"man Dawson is by religion a Peculiar Baptist, in private life a"
"faithful husband and a loving father, and in politics a strict Liberal"
"of the Manchester School! As a man he is good, honest, and rather"
"narrow; as a professional detective he is base and mean, utterly"
"without scruple, and a Jesuit of Jesuits. With him the end justifies"
"the means, whatever the means may be."""
"""And yet you admit that his value to the country is beyond payment."
Dawson--our remarkable Dawson of the double life in the two
"compartments, professional and private, which never are allowed to"
overlap--Dawson is an instrument of war. We do not like using gas or
"liquid fire, but we are compelled to use them. We do not like"
"espionage, but we must employ it. As one who loves this fair land of"
"England beyond everything in the world, and as one who would do"
deeply agitated. The priests were rousing the people against the newly
decreed Civil Constitution of the Clergy; and one of these
disturbances endangered the life of Napoleon himself. He and his
brother Joseph chanced to pass by when one of the processions of
priests and devotees was exciting the pity and indignation of the
"townsfolk. The two brothers, who were now well known as partisans of"
"the Revolution, were threatened with violence, and were saved only by"
their own firm demeanour and the intervention of peacemakers.
"Then again, the concession of local self-government to the island, as"
"one of the Departments of France, revealed unexpected difficulties."
Bastia and Ajaccio struggled hard for the honour of being the official
"capital. Paoli favoured the claims of Bastia, thereby annoying the"
"champions of Ajaccio, among whom the Buonapartes were prominent. The"
"schism was widened by the dictatorial tone of Paoli, a demeanour which"
"ill became the chief of a civic force. In fact, it soon became"
apparent that Corsica was too small a sphere for natures so able and
masterful as those of Paoli and Napoleon Buonaparte.
The first meeting of these two men must have been a scene of deep
interest. It was on the fatal field of Ponte Nuovo. Napoleon doubtless
came there in the spirit of true hero-worship. But hero-worship which
"can stand the strain of actual converse is rare indeed, especially"
when the expectant devotee is endowed with keen insight and habits of
trenchant expression. One phrase has come down to us as a result of
the interview; but this phrase contains a volume of meaning. After
Paoli had explained the disposition of his troops against the French
"at Ponte Nuovo, Buonaparte drily remarked to his brother Joseph, ""The"
"result of these dispositions was what was inevitable."" [13]"
"For the present, Buonaparte and other Corsican democrats were closely"
"concerned with the delinquencies of the Comte de Buttafuoco, the"
"mongrel château. His force was scattered out of sight, though for the"
"most part not out of hearing of each other. It was indeed true that,"
"owing to his excellent dispositions, and the fortunate situation of the"
"balconies, he was able to command every part of the castle enclosure,"
and especially the doors by which it was most likely that the chief
attempt would be made.
"So occupied had Rollo been with his affairs, both private and of a"
"military character, that he had actually wholly forgotten the presence"
"of the Queen-Regent, her daughter and husband, within the palace of La"
Granja. And this though he had come all that way across two of the
wildest provinces of Spain for the sole purpose of securing their
persons and transporting mother and daughter to the camp of Don Carlos.
"Nevertheless so instant was the danger which now overhung every one,"
that their intended captor had ceased to think of anything but how to
preserve these royal lives and to keep them from the hands of the
ruthless gipsies of the hills.
But circumstances quickly recalled the young man to his primary
"purpose, and taught him that he must not trust too much to those whose"
interests were opposed to his own.
"Rollo, as we have said, had reserved no station for himself, but"
"constantly circulated round all the posts of his little army, ready at"
any time to add himself to the effective forces of the garrison at any
threatened point. It was while he was thus passing from balcony to
balcony on the second or defending storey that his quick ear caught the
sound of a door opening and shutting on the floor beneath.
"""Ah,"" thought Rollo to himself, suspiciously, ""the Queen and her people"
are safe in their chambers on this floor. No person connected with the
defence ought to be down there. This is either treachery or the enemy
"of the laxity of morals in the time of Julius II. (1503-'13), that her"
friends did not hesitate to bury the famous Aspasia of that age in
"this church (St. Gregorio), and to inscribe upon her tomb: 'Imperia,"
"cortisana Romana, quæ digna tanto nomine, raræ inter homines formæ"
"specimen dedit.'... But this monument has now been removed.""[18]"
"Most of the facts above cited, especially those concerning the legends"
"and the Popes, except where specific acknowledgment is made to other"
"writers, have been drawn from Hare's invaluable _Walks in Rome_. Let us"
conclude the list with the testimonies of a few eminent men of
unimpeachable competence and veracity as to the character and influence
of the Roman Catholic Church as a system.
"[Sidenote: Macaulay, Dickens and Gladstone on the Influence of"
Romanism.]
"In the first chapter of his _History of England_, Lord Macaulay says:"
"""From the time when the barbarians overran the Western Empire to the"
"time of the revival of letters, the influence of the Church of Rome"
"had been generally favorable to science, to civilization, to good"
"government. But during the last three centuries, to stunt the growth"
"of the human mind has been her chief object. Throughout Christendom,"
"whatever advance has been made in knowledge, in freedom, in wealth,"
"and in the arts of life, has been made in spite of her, and has"
everywhere been in inverse proportion to her power. The loveliest and
"most fertile provinces of Europe have, under her rule, been sunk in"
"poverty, in political servitude, and in intellectual torpor, while"
"Protestant countries, once proverbial for sterility and barbarism,"
"have been turned by skill and industry into gardens, and can boast of"
"a long list of heroes and statesmen, philosophers and poets. Whoever,"
"knowing what Italy and Scotland naturally are, and what, four hundred"
"years ago, they actually were, shall now compare the country round Rome"
Till a few weeks ago it seemed that I shall have to look to the future
for securing the necessary expansion of scope and for permanence of the
Institute. But response is being awakened in answer to the need. The
Government have most generously intimated their desire to sanction
grants towards placing the Institute on a permanent basis the extent of
which will be proportionate to the public interest in this national
undertaking. Out of many who would feel an interest in securing adequate
"Endowment, the very first donations have come from two of the merchant"
"princes of Bombay, to whom I had been personally unknown."
A note that touched me deeply came from some girl students of the
"Western Province, enclosing their little contribution ""for the service"
"of our common motherland."" It is only the instinctive mother-heart that"
can truly realise the bond that draws together the nurselings of the
common homeland. There can be no real misgiving for the future when at
the country's call man offers the strength of his life and woman her
"active devotion, she most of all, who has the greater insight and larger"
faith because of the life of austerity and self-abnegation. Even a
solitary wayfarer in the Himalayas has remembered to send me message of
cheer and good hope. What is it that has bridged over the distance and
blotted out all differences? That I will come gradually to know; till
then it will remain enshrined as a feeling. And I go forward to my
"appointed task, undismayed by difficulties, companioned by the kind"
"thoughts of my well-wishers, both far and near."
INDIA'S SPECIAL APTITUDES IN CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE
The excessive specialisation of modern science in the West has led to
the danger of losing sight of the fundamental fact that there can be but
"one truth, one science which includes all the branches of knowledge. How"
You never struck your flag to _us_; you'll go to England free.'[43]
"'Twas the sixth day of October, Seventeen-hundred-seventy-nine,"
"A year when nations ventured against us to combine,"
"_Quebec_ was burned and Farmer slain, by us remembered not;"
But thanks be to the French book wherein they're not forgot.
"And you, if you've to fight the French, my youngster, bear in mind"
Those seamen of King Louis so chivalrous and kind;
"Think of the Breton gentlemen who took our lads to Brest,"
And treat some rescued Breton as a comrade and a guest.”
This poem is specially to be commended because it is another example of
the finer qualities which are developed in war.[44]
"Now, such a ballad as this, which, being pure narrative, could"
"easily be introduced into the story-hour, would do as much to foster"
"“_L'entente cordiale_” as any processions or civic demonstrations,"
or lavish international exchange of hospitality. It has also a great
practical application now that we are encouraging visits between
English and foreign children. Let us hope the _entente cordiale_ will
not stop at France. There must be many such instances of magnanimity
"and generosity displayed to us by other nations, and it might be"
well to collect them and include them among stories for the school
curriculum.
"But in all our stories, in order to produce desired effects we must"
"refrain from holding, as Burroughs says, “a brief for either side,” and"
we must leave the decision of the children free in this matter.[45]
"In a review of Ladd's _Psychology_ in the “Academy,” we find a passage"
which refers as much to the story as to the novel:
"to the trust, but their owners were bound at all times to allow a normal"
"head of water when it was called for. Instead of doing this now, they"
played all sorts of tricks on Bainbridge. When he particularly needed
"plenty of water to float his drive past a shallow or narrow spot, the"
"gates were arbitrarily shut down, and the drive hung up. Again, at one"
point where the middle part of the drive had jammed and the crew were
"occupied in picking it instead of using dynamite, the gates which Bob"
"had personally closed were raised without warning, letting down a flood"
"of water which struck the jam with terrific force. It gave instantly,"
"carrying three men with it. Two managed to escape by a miracle, and were"
dragged ashore with broken limbs; the other was crushed and drowned.
After that Bainbridge placed guards at the various dams with
instructions to shoot any one who attempted to interfere with them. This
"resulted in a terrific outcry on the part of Crane’s underlings, an"
"appeal to the law, injunctions, and all that sort of thing. To which"
"Bainbridge paid no attention whatever. He went on his way calmly,"
"knowing well that they could not stop him in this manner, and willing to"
put up with the inconvenience that would follow when it was all over and
he had returned to civilization.
Mr. Wolcott Sears continued his fishing trip along the route the
"lumbermen were following, and began frequently to appear in camp for an"
"evening pipe with Bainbridge. One evening they had a private conference,"
"which lasted until the small hours, and the Boston capitalist finally"
"departed, leaving Bainbridge apparently much gratified."
The crew was with Bob to a man. By this time they had gathered an
"inkling of the plot against the firm, and of the stakes involved. Men"
had strayed into camp telling of the extraordinary reductions made by
the trust in the price of manufactured lumber. Large sales had resulted
"to various parties, report said, thus preventing Bainbridge & Tweedy, as"
meet with reward in life and that they end in establishing a habit of
"drudgery, but, after all, we must have poetic justice in a Fairy Story,"
"occasionally, at any rate."
"Another such story is “Jesper and the Hares.” Here, however, it is"
"not at first resourcefulness that helps the hero, but sheer kindness"
"of heart, which prompts him first to help the ants, and then to"
"show civility to the old woman, without for a moment expecting any"
"material benefit from such actions. At the end, he does win by his own"
"ingenuity and resourcefulness, and if we regret that his _trickery_"
"has such wonderful results, we must remember that the aim was to win"
"the princess for herself, and that there was little choice left him. I"
consider the end of this story to be one of the most remarkable I have
found in my long years of browsing among Fairy Tales. I should suggest
"stopping at the words: “The Tub is full,” as any addition seems to"
destroy the subtlety of the story.[28]
"Another story of this kind, admirable for children from six years and"
"upwards, is “What the Old Man does is always Right.” Here, perhaps,"
the entire lack of common sense on the part of the hero would serve
"rather as a warning than a stimulating example, but the conduct of"
the wife in excusing the errors of her foolish husband is a model of
resourcefulness.
In the story of “Hereafter--this”[29] we have just the converse: a
perfectly foolish wife shielded by a most patient and forbearing
"husband, whose tolerance and common sense save the situation."
One of the most important elements to seek in our choice of stories is
"that which tends to develop, eventually, a fine sense of humour in a"
"child. I purposely use the word “eventually,” because I realise first"
"that humour has various stages, and that seldom, if ever, can you"
It is true that to all Orientals death is a less fearful thing than it
"is to us. I do not know what may be the cause of this, courage certainly"
has little to do with it; but it is certain that the purely physical
"fear of death, that horror and utter revulsion that seizes the majority"
"of us at the idea of death, is absent from most Orientals. And yet this"
"cannot explain it all. For fear of death, though less, is still there,"
"is still a strong influence upon their lives, and it would seem that no"
religion which ignored this great fact could become a great living
religion.
"Religion is made for man, to fit his necessities, not man for religion,"
and yet the faith of Buddhism is not concerned with death.
"Consider our faith, how much of its teaching consists of how to avoid"
"the fear of death, how much of its consolation is for the death-bed. How"
we are taught all our lives that we should live so as not to fear death;
"how we have priests and sacraments to soothe the dying man, and give"
"him hope and courage, and how the crown and summit of our creed is that"
we should die easily. And consider that in Buddhism all this is
"absolutely wanting. Buddhism is a creed of life, of conduct; death is"
"the end of that life, that is all."
"We have all seen death. We have all of us watched those who, near and"
"dear to us, go away out of our ken. There is no need for me to recall"
"the last hours of those of our faith, to bring up again the fading eye"
"and waning breath, the messages of hope we search for in our Scriptures"
"to give hope to him who is going, the assurances of religion, the cross"
held before the dying eyes.
"Many men, we are told, turn to religion at the last after a life of"
"wickedness, and a man may do so even at the eleventh hour and be saved."
commons by various municipalities. Much of this land lies along the line
"of the railroad from Panama to David, and is of varying grades suitable"
"for grazing, forestry or agriculture. A fixed price of 50 cents per"
"hectare is charged, a hectare being practically 2¹⁄₂ acres. The"
government has gone quite efficiently into the task of disposing of
"these lands, and pamphlets explanatory of methods of securing titles,"
"terms, etc., can be obtained by addressing the Administrator-General at"
"Panama. The Pan-American Union, of Washington, D. C., has issued a"
pamphlet giving a summary in English of the Panamanian law bearing upon
the subject.

"By pulling up the bamboo ladder, or turning it, communication with the"

"With the lack of labor, and the uncertainty of land titles, the final"
impediment to the general development of the interior of Panama is to be
found in the lack of roads. It is not that the roads are bad--that is
the case in many of our own commonwealths. But in a great part of Panama
"there are literally no roads at all. Trails, choked by the jungle and so"
"washed by the rains that they are merely lanes floored with boulders,"
are the rule. The heavy ox-cart is the only vehicle that will stand the
"going, and our light American farm wagons would be speedily racked to"
pieces. In the Canal Zone the Commission has built some of the best
"roads in the world, utilizing the labor of employees convicted of minor"
offenses. Stimulated by this example the Panama government has built one
excellent road from the chief city across the savannas to Old Panama and
thence onward into the interior. It is hoped that the spectacle of the
admirable roads in the Zone will encourage the authorities of the
Republic to go into road building on a large scale in their own country.
In no other way can its possibilities be realized. At present the rivers
Destiny had already linked the fortunes of the young Napoleon
Buonaparte with those of France. After the downfall of Genoese rule in
"Corsica, France had taken over, for empty promises, the claims of the"
hard-pressed Italian republic to its troublesome island possession. It
"was a cheap and practical way of restoring, at least in the"
Mediterranean the shattered prestige of the French Bourbons. They had
previously intervened in Corsican affairs on the side of the Genoese.
Yet in 1764 Paoli appealed to Louis XV. for protection. It was
"granted, in the form of troops that proceeded quietly to occupy the"
"coast towns of the island under cover of friendly assurances. In 1768,"
"before the expiration of an informal truce, Marbeuf, the French"
"commander, commenced hostilities against the patriots[4]. In vain did"
Rousseau and many other champions of popular liberty protest against
this bartering away of insular freedom: in vain did Paoli rouse his
"compatriots to another and more unequal struggle, and seek to hold the"
"mountainous interior. Poor, badly equipped, rent by family feuds and"
"clan schisms, his followers were no match for the French troops; and"
"after the utter break-up of his forces Paoli fled to England, taking"
with him three hundred and forty of the most determined patriots. With
"these irreconcilables Charles Buonaparte did not cast in his lot, but"
accepted the pardon offered to those who should recognize the French
sway. With his wife and their little child Joseph he returned to
"Ajaccio; and there, shortly afterwards, Napoleon was born. As the"
"patriotic historian, Jacobi, has finely said, ""The Corsican people,"
"when exhausted by producing martyrs to the cause of liberty, produced"
"Napoleon Buonaparte[5]."""
"Seeing that Charles Buonaparte had been an ardent adherent of Paoli,"
his sudden change of front has exposed him to keen censure. He
certainly had not the grit of which heroes are made. His seems to have
"been an ill-balanced nature, soon buoyed up by enthusiasms, and as"
"Occasionally, their dancing is really remarkably interesting, when a"
large amount of pantomime enters into it and they develop the story of
"some primitive action, as, for instance, the drawing of the water,"
"cutting the wood, making the fire, cooking the food, etc., ending in a"
burst of song symbolizing the joys of the new prepared feast. In an
extremely crude form it reminds one of the old opera ballets and seems
"to be a composite of the original African and the ancient Spanish, which"
is very probably the case.

“The Orientals of the Isthmus deserve a word in passing. They are
chiefly Chinese coolies and form a large part of the small merchant
"class. Others, in the hill districts, cultivate large truck gardens,"
bringing their produce swinging over the shoulders on poles to the city
"markets. Their houses and grounds are very attractive, built of reed or"
"bamboo in the eastern fashion and marked everywhere by extreme neatness,"
contrasting so strikingly with the homes and surroundings of their negro
"neighbors. Many cultivate fields of cane or rice as well, and amidst the"
"silvery greens, stretching for some distance, the quaint blue figures of"
the workmen in their huge hats make a charming picture. Through the
rubber sections Chinese ‘middlemen’ are of late frequently found buying
"that valuable commodity for their fellow countrymen in Panama City, who"
are now doing quite a large business in rubber. These people live much
"as in their native land, seldom learning more than a few words of"
"Spanish (except those living in the towns), and they form a very"
substantial and good element of the population”.

To enumerate even by names the aboriginal tribes would be tedious and
"unavailing. Among the more notable are the Doracho-Changuina, of"
faith. It was a world that had never existed as such. For with the
historical reality which the times of Constantine and the great fathers
of the Church had manifested--that of declining Latinity and
"deteriorating Hellenism, the oncoming barbarism and the oncoming"
Byzantinism--it had nothing in common. Erasmus's imagined world was an
"amalgamation of pure classicism (this meant for him, Cicero, Horace,"
Plutarch; for to the flourishing period of the Greek mind he remained
"after all a stranger) and pure, biblical Christianity. Could it be a"
"union? Not really. In Erasmus's mind the light falls, just as we saw in"
"the history of his career, alternately on the pagan antique and on the"
Christian. But the warp of his mind is Christian; his classicism only
"serves him as a form, and from Antiquity he only chooses those elements"
which in ethical tendency are in conformity with his Christian ideal.
[Illustration: XVI. ERASMUS AT THE AGE OF 57]
"And because of this, Erasmus, although he appeared after a century of"
"earlier Humanism, is yet new to his time. The union of Antiquity and the"
"Christian spirit which had haunted the mind of Petrarch, the father of"
"Humanism, which was lost sight of by his disciples, enchanted as they"
"were by the irresistible brilliance of the antique beauty of form, this"
union was brought about by Erasmus.
What pure Latinity and the classic spirit meant to Erasmus we cannot
"feel as he did because its realization does not mean to us, as to him, a"
difficult conquest and a glorious triumph. To feel it thus one must have
"acquired, in a hard school, the hatred of barbarism, which already"
during his first years of authorship had suggested the composition of
the _Antibarbari_. The abusive term for all that is old and rude is
"already Gothic, Goths. The term barbarism as used by Erasmus comprised"
much of what we value most in the medieval spirit. Erasmus's conception
of the great intellectual crisis of his day was distinctly dualistic. He
"fashionable world was well aware, because the young duchess is a great"
"lady in London as well as elsewhere, and all her doings are chronicled"
in advance. The fashionable world had promptly decided to dine there
"too, and telephoned in breathless haste for tables. It filled the"
"restaurant at an unusually early hour, and a disappointed overflow"
displayed itself in the _foyer_.
The Duchess of Dawn is one of the most beautiful women in England. The
"eyes of the fashionable world were focussed on her and her guests, among"
whom were a minor European prince and a famous field-marshal who had not
"been on show in London for long, until there appeared from the crowded"
"_foyer_, upon the arm of an old-young man of distinguished appearance"
"and faultless _tenue_, a tall, slender girl, at whom, as she passed,"
"every one turned to gaze, with undisguised admiration or envy, according"
to sex and temperament.
"She was gowned to distraction, and by an artist in women's wear. Her"
beautiful bare arms and shoulders and bosom were free of superfluous
"ornament. Her pure, proud, sensitive features were faintly flushed,--as"
"though, if that were conceivable, she was wearing evening dress for the"
"first time, and found it trying,--but her curved crimson lips were"
"slightly parted in a most bewitching smile, and, from under their"
"drooping lashes, her radiant eyes looked a demure, amused, impersonal"
defiance at the frankly curious faces upturned toward her. The shaded
"lights made most enchanting lights and shadows among her hair, red-gold"
"and heaped about her head in heavy coils, as she moved modestly through"
"the thronged room toward a corner where, about a beautifully decorated"
"table, four motionless waiters were standing guard over four empty"
chairs.
"She sat down there, her back to the bulk of the company, and her escort"
"took the seat opposite. A portly, prosperous-looking, elderly man, with"
THE HISTORY OF A FAILURE THAT WAS GREAT
At the invitation of the President and the committee of the Faridpore
"Industrial Exhibition, Dr. J. C. Bose gave a lecture on the life of his"
"father, the late Babu Bhugwan Chunder Bose, who founded the Exhibition"
"at Faridpore, where he was the sub-divisional officer, 50 years ago. It"
"was published in the Modern Review for February 1917--volume xxi, p."
"221. In course of his address, said Dr. Bose:--"
"It is the obvious, the insistent, the blatant that often blinds us to"
"the essential. And in solving the mystery that underlies life, the"
"enlightenment will come not by the study of the complex man, but through"
"the simpler plant. It is the unsuspected forces, hidden to the eyes of"
"men,--the forces imprisoned in the soil and the stimuli of alternating"
flash of light and the gloomings of darkness these and many others will
be found to maintain the ceaseless activity which we know as the fulness
of throbbing life.
This is likewise true of the congeries of life which we call a society
or a nation. The energy which moves this great mass in ceaseless effort
"to realise some common aspiration, often has its origin in the unknown"
"solitudes of a village life. And thus the history of some efforts, not"
"forgotten, which emanated from Faridpore, may be found not unconnected"
with which India is now meeting her problems to-day. How did these
problems first dawn in the minds of some men who forecast themselves by
"half a century? How fared their hopes, how did their dreams become"
buried in oblivion? Where lies the secret of that potency which makes
"certain efforts apparently doomed to failure, rise renewed from beneath"
"the smouldering ashes? Are these dead failures, so utterly unrelated to"
some great success that we may acclaim to day? When we look deeper we
"shall find that this is not so, that as inevitable as in the sequence of"
"bloodiest persecution against the priests of Isis that they ever suffered,"
"in consequence of a scandalous affair in which a matron, a noble and some"
priests of Isis were implicated.
"All these police measures, however, were strangely ineffectual. The"
Egyptian worship was excluded from Rome and her immediate neighborhood in
"theory if not in fact, but the rest of the world remained open to its"
propaganda.[27]
With the beginning of the empire it slowly invaded the center and the north
"of Italy and spread into the provinces. Merchants, sailors, slaves,"
"artisans, Egyptian men of letters, even the discharged soldiers of the"
three legions cantoned in the valley of the Nile contributed to its
"diffusion. It entered Africa by way of Carthage, and the Danubian countries"
through the great emporium of Aquileia. The new province of Gaul was
invaded through the valley of the Rhone. At that period many Oriental
emigrants went to seek their fortunes in these new countries. Intimate
"relations existed between the cities of Arles and Alexandria, and we know"
"that a colony of Egyptian Greeks, established at Nimes by Augustus, took"
the gods of their native country thither.[28] At the beginning of our era
there set in that great movement of conversion that soon established the
worship of Isis and Serapis from the outskirts of the Sahara to the vallum
"of Britain, and from the mountains of Asturias to the mouths of the Danube."
The resistance still offered by the central power could not last much
longer. It was impossible to dam in this overflowing stream whose
thundering waves struck the {84} shaking walls of the _pomerium_ from every
side. The prestige of Alexandria seemed invincible. At that period the city
"was more beautiful, more learned, and better policed than Rome. She was the"
"model capital, a standard to which the Latins strove to rise. They"
"translated the works of the scholars of Alexandria, imitated her authors,"
invited her artists and copied her institutions. It is plain that they had

quartermaster.
"""Is it certain that no one is listening to us? It seemed to me as though"
"some one were smoking in the forward cabin."""
"""But you know we looked in every corner. They just forgot to let the"
"fire go out in the caboose, and that is why there's smoke,"" said the"
"quartermaster's wife, ""so tell away."""
"""If they buy three cords of birch-wood,"" said the witch,--""but it must"
"be full measure, and they must not bargain for it--and throw the first"
"cord into the water, billet by billet, when the first breaker strikes,"
"and the second cord, billet by billet, when the second breaker strikes,"
"and the third cord, billet by billet, when the third breaker strikes,"
"then it is all up with us!"""
"""Yes, that's true, sister, then it is all up with us! Then it is all up"
"with us!"" said the wives of the quartermasters; ""but there is no one who"
"knows it,"" they cried, and laughed loudly, and with that they flew out"
"of the hatchway, screaming and croaking like ravens."
"When it came time to sail, the cabin-boy would not go along for anything"
"in the world; and all the captain's coaxing, and all his promises were"
"useless, nothing would tempt him to go. At last they asked him whether"
"he were afraid, because fall was at hand, and said he would rather hide"
"behind the stove, hanging to mother's apron strings. No, said the youth,"
"he was not afraid, and they could not say that they had ever seen him"
show a sign of so land-lubberly a thing as fear; and he was willing to
"prove it to them, for now he was going along with them, but he made"
"it a condition that three cords of birch-wood were to be bought, full"
"measure, and that on a certain day he was to have command, just as"
"upon some great man, an attack against the Tories, the Whigs, the"
"Dissenters?  If so, they would read it; for there was great eagerness"
"amongst the people to read such things, and no matter what side was"
"attacked, there were hundreds eager to buy and to read.  But a"
romance—no; that was a mistake altogether.  A writer of successful
"pamphlets might perhaps find readers for a merry tale, or even a"
"romance; but for an unknown aspirant to fame—no, that was another"
matter.  No one would buy it; no one would even read it; though there
"were one or two who took it and glanced through some pages, praised the"
"style and the easy flow of words, and advised me to take to"
"pamphleteering, promising that they would read anything like that."""

ACTIONS.--Phenol in large and undiluted doses is an irritant and
"narcotic poison; it is used as an antiseptic, parasiticide, antiferment"
and sometimes used as a local anaesthetic or anodyne in a 2 to 5 per
"cent solution; also as a caustic, but should not be used as a caustic as"
a burn from it heals very slowly.
USES.--Internally as a gastric sedative in small doses for vomiting in
dogs; is administered in various contagious and infectious diseases with
the view of preventing or arresting the development of micro-organisms;
"it coagulates albumen, is not nearly so active as bichloride of mercury;"
1 part to 500 parts of water prevents the growth of anthrax and other
"bacilli. Full doses produce gastro-enteritis, and collapse, which may"
"end fatally; it is a muscular and nerve paralyzer, both internally and"
"externally, it kills by paralyzing the muscles of respiration and the"
"heart. It is chiefly eliminated from the system by the kidneys, giving"
the urine a brownish color.
IN SURGERY.--A three to five per cent solution is used for washing out
"wounds, a two to three per cent for hands, and for itching of the skin,"
"carbolic acid three or four drachms, glycerine two ounces to one pint of"
water. Do not use over large surface on dogs and not at all on cats.
"Phenol treatment for Tetanus, which has given very good results and I"
"would recommend one drachm in three ounces of water, injected"
hypodermically in the region of neck and shoulder every two or three
hours until twelve injections were given and less frequently thereafter.
"DOSES.--Of the phenol: Horses and cattle, 10 to 40 grs.; sheep and pigs,"
"5 to 10 grs.; dogs, ¹⁄₂ to 1 gr., well diluted."

"hours after Congress declared war. At the same moment, indeed, all of"
"Kentucky was turning to a greater tradition than that of ""horses and"

county searched it from end to end without finding a man to

"dependents or otherwise, had previously rushed to the Colors. This, and"
"the fact that his state, with three others, headed the nation with the"
"highest percentage in physical examinations, added luster to the shield"
of his old Commonwealth--though he roundly insisted that 'twas not
"Kentucky's manhood, but her womanhood, who deserved the credit. After"

policy which opposed the rival house of Saxony. The Pope granted the
"dispensation in return for a great sum of money, but to facilitate its"
payment he accorded to the archbishop a liberal indulgence for the whole
"archbishopric of Mayence, Magdeburg and the Brandenburg territories."

"When in December 1517, Erasmus answered the archbishop, Luther's"
"propositions against indulgences, provoked by the Archbishop of"
"Mayence's instructions regarding their colportage, had already been"
"posted up (31 October 1517), and were circulated throughout Germany,"
rousing the whole Church. They were levelled at the same abuses which
"Erasmus combated, the mechanical, atomistical, and juridical conception"
"of religion. But how different was their practical effect, as compared"
with Erasmus's pacific endeavour to purify the Church by lenient means!
'Lives of saints?' Erasmus asked replying to the archbishop. 'I have
tried in my poor way to add a little light to the prince of saints
"himself. For the rest, your endeavour, in addition to so many difficult"
"matters of government, and at such an early age, to get the lives of the"
"saints purged of old women's tales and disgusting style, is extremely"
laudable. For nothing should be suffered in the Church that is not

of the excellent prelate.
"During the greater part of 1518, Erasmus was too much occupied by his"
"own affairs--the journey to Basle and his red-hot labours there, and"
afterwards his serious illness--to concern himself much with Luther's
"business. In March he sends Luther's theses to More, without comment,"
"and, in passing, complains to Colet about the impudence with which Rome"
"disseminates indulgences. Luther, now declared a heretic and summoned to"

all at once the sound of beating drums and martial trumpets struck
loudly on the quiet morning air. A brilliant regiment of mounted Uhlans
"emerged from an opposite street, and cantered sharply across the Platz"
"and over the Rhine-bridge, with streaming pennons, burnished helmets"
"and accoutrements glistening in a long compact line of silvery white,"
"that vanished as speedily as it had appeared, like a winding flash of"
"meteor flame. Alwyn drew a deep, quick breath; the sight of those armed"
soldiers roused him to the fact that he was actually in the turmoil of
"present daily events,--that his supernal happiness was no vision, but"
"REALITY,--that Edris, his Spirit-love, was with him in tangible human"
"guise of flesh and blood,--though how such a mysterious marvel had been"
"accomplished, he knew no more than scientists know how the lovely life"
of green leaf and perfect flower can still be existent in seeds that
have lain dormant and dry in old tombs for thousands of years! And as
"he looked at her proudly,--adoringly,--she raised her beautiful,"

"serve each other?"""

exposed elsewhere several technical errors therein which would never
appear in an authentic official document. But whether it is authentic or
"not, I do not attach any importance to the matter, from a political"
point of view at least. It is the duty of all the military and naval
"authorities to keep themselves ready for any emergency. For example,"
France ought to keep herself always prepared for any possible
"difficulties which may arise on her frontiers in the east, and in the"

"with Italy, even with the United States."
"It appears to me that, if the general staff-office of France or of"
"Germany, or the military or naval authorities of any country whatever,"
were to remain without the least knowledge as to what measure should be
"taken in case of a danger, they would be neglecting their duty to their"
"country. I can then say that all the Japanese officers, both in the army"
and in the navy ought to study constantly the measures which Japan
should take in any emergency. I believe it is the same in every country
"in Europe. This, however, does not belong to the sphere of practical"
politics. It is the duty of statesmen and politicians to maintain a
"friendly relationship with all other countries as far as possible; and,"
"consequently, to keep absolute control over their armies and navies. The"
"army and navy ought to serve as instruments and machines in their hands,"
"and not they, the civilians, become the instruments of the army and"
navy. You may be quite assured that in Japan the army and navy are the
"machines of the statesmen, and that the statesmen are not their"
machines.

"stern islanders. In his charming romance, ""Colomba,"" M. Prosper"
"Mérimée has depicted the typical Corsican, even of the towns, as"
"preoccupied, gloomy, suspicious, ever on the alert, hovering about his"
"dwelling, like a falcon over his nest, seemingly in preparation for"
"attack or defence. Laughter, the song, the dance, were rarely heard in"
"the streets; for the women, after acting as the drudges of the"
"household, were kept jealously at home, while their lords smoked and"
"watched. If a game at hazard were ventured upon, it ran its course in"
"silence, which not seldom was broken by the shot or the stab--first"
warning that there had been underhand play. The deed always preceded
the word.
"In such a life, where commerce and agriculture were despised, where"
"woman was mainly a drudge and man a conspirator, there grew up the"
"typical Corsican temperament, moody and exacting, but withal keen,"
"brave, and constant, which looked on the world as a fencing-school for"
the glorification of the family and the clan[2]. Of this type Napoleon
was to be the supreme exemplar; and the fates granted him as an arena
a chaotic France and a distracted Europe.
Amidst that grim Corsican existence the Buonapartes passed their lives
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Occupied as advocates
and lawyers with such details of the law as were of any practical
"importance, they must have been involved in family feuds and the"
"oft-recurring disputes between Corsica and the suzerain Power, Genoa."
"As became dignitaries in the municipality of Ajaccio, several of the"
Buonapartes espoused the Genoese side; and the Genoese Senate in a
"document of the year 1652 styled one of them, Jérome, ""Egregius"
"Hieronimus di Buonaparte, procurator Nobilium."" These distinctions"
they seem to have little coveted. Very few families belonged to the
"Corsican _noblesse_, and their fiefs were unimportant. In Corsica, as"
"in the Forest Cantons of Switzerland and the Highlands of Scotland,"
"Chiriqui, light of color, believing that the Great Spirit lived in the"
"volcano of Chiriqui, and occasionally showing their displeasure with him"
"by shooting arrows at the mountain. The Guaymies, of whom perhaps 6000"
"are left, are the tribe that buried with their dead the curious golden"
"images that were once plentiful in the bazaars of Panama, but are now"
hard to find. They have a pleasant practice of putting a calabash of
water and some plantains by a man they think dying and leaving him to
"his fate, usually in some lonesome part of the jungle. The Cunas or"
"Caribs are the tribes inhabiting the Darien. All were, and some are,"
believed still to be cannibals. Eleven lesser tribes are grouped under
this general name. As a rule they are small and muscular. Most of them
"have abandoned their ancient gaudy dress, and so far as they are clothed"
at all wear ordinary cotton clothing. Painting the face and body is
still practiced. The dead often are swung in hammocks from trees and
supplied with fresh provisions until the cords rot and the body falls to
the ground. Then the spirit’s journey to the promised land is held to be
ended and provisions are no longer needed. Sorcery and soothsaying are
"much in vogue, and the sorcerers who correspond to the medicine men of"
our North American Indians will sometimes shut themselves up in a small
"hut shrieking, beating tom-toms and imitating the cries of wild animals."
When they emerge in a sort of self-hypnotized state they are held to be
peculiarly fit for prophesying.

"usually the old ones, who sit in a circle chewing yam roots or cassava"

ferments and is made the basis of a highly intoxicating drink. Curiously
enough the same drink is similarly made in far-away Samoa. The dutiful

"and only partially succeed; the machine is partially geared, in a state"
intermediate between deep sleep and the waking condition.]

Indeed the hour for the contest had well-nigh come.  Grey could see that
"the other horses were assembling, their riders decked in every colour of"
"the rainbow, quite eclipsing the quiet and workmanlike suit of buff"
which he wore.  But Grey’s taste had always disinclined him to gaudy
"colours.  The soft leather, finely chased and stamped in gold, pleased"
his eye more than rich-hued cloths or velvets.  His breeches were of
"white buckskin cut by Lord Sandford’s own tailor, and he wore long boots"
"fitted with silver spurs, albeit he scarcely ever had need of the latter"
when he bestrode Don Carlos.  His scarf was of white silk fringed with
"gold, and his only adornment was a cravat of fine lace, fastened with a"
"diamond clasp.  His cocked hat matched his buff coat, and was adorned"
"with a white plume.  Altogether, as he rode forward to his place, it"
would have been hard to find a fault with his dress or person; and the
"ladies behind their fans audibly praised his elegant figure, graceful"
"seat, and distinguished and handsome face."
"Grey, all unconscious of the favour bestowed upon him, rode up and"
saluted courteously the gentlemen who were to meet him and each other in
"rivalry. Lord Sandford, splendidly mounted, was to act as judge at the"
winning post.  Another of his friends was to be starter; and gentlemen
were posted at various points along the course to see that all the rules
"laid down were observed, and that no rider deviated from the"
well-pegged-out route prescribed for all.  The spectators scattered
"hither and thither, taking up stations wherever their fancy prompted."
The course seemed marked out by a glittering border extending down both
"sides.  The sun shone brilliantly in the sky, and all nature seemed in"
gladsome mood.
Grey cast a keen look at the seven rival steeds as they were brought
into line for the start.  He picked out in a moment the two of whom
"Dicon had spoken, and saw that he had judged well.  Then he gave his"
"whole mind to the task in hand, checked with hand and voice the prancing"
But here Grey stood firm.  Nothing would induce him to cumber his head
with one of those mountains of hair.  In vain the perruquiers displayed
"their wares; in vain Lord Sandford bantered and laughed, and made out"
that he would be reckoned as a mad fellow by the young bloods of the
city.  Grey would not yield an inch.  He had always found his own hair
"sufficient and comfortable, and he would wear it to the end.  And as the"
"discomfited perruquier at last departed, Lord Sandford broke into"
another of his great laughs.
"""I’ faith you are right, man.  I like you the better that you have the"
"courage of your opinions, and care no whit for fashion.  You’ll be a"
match for more than the perruquiers yet.  There’s a fighting strain in
"your blood.  I can see it in the glint of your eye. Well, you shall not"
lack opportunity to fight as well as to laugh here in London town; but
we’ll not have cold steel or hot lead again.  I’ve seen enough of that
"cursed duelling to last me for a lifetime."""
Grey was quickly to discover the nature of the battles in which he was
"to take a part, and at the first he shrank from them with an instinctive"
"aversion he could not well have defined, being no grave moralist or"
philosopher.  Contests of skill or of luck at the gaming tables were all
"the rage of the day with the young dandies of the town, and the man who"
"could keep a steady head, and in some cases a steady hand, was certain"
in the long run to obtain advantage over his fellows.  At one club a
"game something like our modern billiards was all the rage; and, of"
"course, a man who was moderate in his cups could score heavily over the"
"reckless, dissipated bloods, who were seldom sober after sundown.  Dice"
and cards had their vogue at other places; and though some of the games
"played were those purely of chance, others required no small skill and a"
"clear head to ensure success, and it was here that Lord Sandford’s"
strong head and Grey’s cool blood and temperate habits gave them the
advantage.
of the governor and appeals to the National Assembly of France for
some guarantee of civil liberty. His name is at the head of this
"petition, a sufficiently daring step for a junior lieutenant on"
furlough. But his patriotism and audacity carry him still further. He
"journeys to Bastia, the official capital of his island, and is"
concerned in an affray between the populace and the royal troops
"(November 5th, 1789). The French authorities, fortunately for him, are"
nearly powerless: he is merely requested to return to Ajaccio; and
"there he organizes anew the civic force, and sets the dissident"
islanders an example of good discipline by mounting guard outside the
house of a personal opponent.
Other events now transpired which began to assuage his opposition to
"France. Thanks to the eloquent efforts of Mirabeau, the Corsican"
patriots who had remained in exile since 1768 were allowed to return
and enjoy the full rights of citizenship. Little could the friends of
"liberty at Paris, or even the statesman himself, have foreseen all the"
consequences of this action: it softened the feelings of many
"Corsicans towards their conquerors; above all, it caused the heart of"
Napoleon Buonaparte for the first time to throb in accord with that of
the French nation. His feelings towards Paoli also began to cool. The
conduct of this illustrious exile exposed him to the charge of
ingratitude towards France. The decree of the French National
"Assembly, which restored him to Corsican citizenship, was graced by"
acts of courtesy such as the generous French nature can so winningly
"dispense. Louis XVI. and the National Assembly warmly greeted him, and"
"recognized him as head of the National Guard of the island. Yet,"
"amidst all the congratulations, Paoli saw the approach of anarchy, and"
"behaved with some reserve. Outwardly, however, concord seemed to be"
"assured, when on July 14th, 1790, he landed in Corsica; but the hatred"
long nursed by the mountaineers and fisherfolk against France was not
"to be exorcised by a few demonstrations. In truth, the island was"
"now, or turned his ideas from the task before him. It was no ordinary"
"speech, and no ordinary occasion. He spoke only to five men out of all"
"his audience--the rest were his, or were beyond the power of his charm;"
"on those five important-looking, unhappy-feeling men he bent every"
"effort of his will, and played every device of his mind and his tongue."
"Now and then he distantly threatened them, oftener he made as though to"
convince their cool judgment; again he would invoke the sentiment of old
"alliance in them, or stir their pity for the men whose cause he pleaded."
"Once he flashed out in bitter mockery at Coxon, then jested in mild"
"irony at Puttock and his ""rich man's revolution."" Returning to his text,"
"he minutely dissected his own measure, insisting on its promise,"
"extenuating its fancied danger, claiming for it the merits of a"
courageous and well-conceived scheme. Through all the changes that he
"rang, he was heard with close attention, broken only by demonstrations"
of approval or of dissent. At last one of his periods extorted a cheer
from a waverer. It acted on him as a spur to fresh exertions. He raised
"his voice till it filled the chamber, and began his last and most"
elaborate appeal.
Suddenly a change came over his hearers. The breathless silence of
engrossed attention gave place to a subdued stir; whispers were heard
"here and there. Men were handing a newspaper about, accompanying its"
"transfer with meaning looks. He was not surprised, for members made no"
"scruple of reading their papers or writing their letters in the House,"
"but he was vexed to see that he had not gripped them closer. He went on,"
but that ever-circulating paper had half his attention now. He noticed
Kilshaw come in with it and press it on Sir Robert's notice. Sir Robert
"at first refused, but when Kilshaw urged, he read and glanced up at him,"
"so Medland thought, with a look of sadness. Coxon had got a paper now,"
"and left biting his nails to pore over it; he passed it to Puttock, and"
"the fat man bulged his cheeks in seeming wonder. Even his waverer, the"
"one who had cheered, was deep in it. Only Norburn was unconscious of it."
Lady Blount sighed. What with imperial governments that wrecked the
"career of men for shooting a few murderous and fire-raising blacks, and"
"with lowborn vixens of women who ruined men's careers in other ways,"
"life was a desperate puzzle. She was fond of her cousin John Risca. She,"
"too, before she married Sir Oliver, had borne the name, and the disgrace"
that had fallen upon it affected her deeply. It was horrible to think
"of John's wife, locked up that night in the stone cell of a gaol. She"
"leaned back in her chair in silence while the men talked--Sir Oliver,"
"by way of giving Risca hints on the conduct of life in Melbourne, was"
narrating his experiences of forty years ago in the West Indies--and
"stared into the fire. Her face, beneath the front of red hair that"
"accused so pitifully the reddish gray that was her own, looked very old"
"and faded. What was a prison like? She shuddered. As governor's wife,"
she had once or twice had occasion to visit a colonial prison. But the
"captives were black, and they grinned cheerily; their raiment, save for"
"the unæsthetic decoration of the black arrow, was not so very different"
"from that which they wore in a state of freedom; neither were food,"
"bedding, and surroundings so very different; and the place was flooded"
with air and blazing sunshine. She could never realize that it was
a real prison. It might have been a prison of musical comedy. But an
"English prison was the real, unimaginable abode of grim, gray horror."
She had heard of the prison taint. She conceived it as a smell--that of
mingled quicklime and the corruption it was to destroy--which lingered
physically forever after about the persons of those who had been
"confined within prison-walls. A gaol was a place of eternal twilight,"
"eternal chill, eternal degradation for the white man or woman; and a"
"white woman, the wife of one of her own race, was there. It was almost"
"as if the taint hung about her own lavender-scented self. She shivered,"
and drew her chair a few inches nearer the fire.
"Was it so preposterous, after all, on John Risca's part to fly from the"
"shame into a wider, purer air? Her cry had been unthinking, instinctive,"
which has a genuine religious motive often fails. Most of the great
"artists in fiction, when they have taken in hand a subject which is of"
"religious interest, have written in a spirit of detachment. George"
"Eliot’s _Romola_ is an example, and the result is that men are more"
interested in Tito Melema than in Savonarola. Novels in which religion
is necessarily much in evidence have been written either by literary
artists who have studiously endeavoured to lay aside their own
"personal convictions, or if the books have been written with a"
distinctly religious purpose the hero and heroine have been
"unconvincing, the people in the story have not been alive."
When Cardinal Newman had abandoned prematurely his hope of maintaining
"the Catholic character of the Church of England, he did not disdain to"
employ his pen in the production of a novel with a religious purpose;
but we are amazed to find that the exquisite grace of style which is
one of the charms of the _Apologia_ could not render Charles Riding
"interesting, or the novel _Loss and Gain_, of which he is the hero,"
readable.
It is perhaps dangerous to give another example from contemporary
"fiction, but those who justly admire Mrs. Humphry Ward’s subtle"
discernment of character and great and increasing mastery of form and
"style, will not be inclined to dispute the opinion that when, in"
"_Robert Elsmere_, she undertook the defence of the modern Unitarian"
"position, her hero was hardly a “Man’s man.”"
The reason is not far to seek. The average man knows too much of the
darker side of life; and the necessary effort made by the author of
"religious novels to depict that of which they, fortunately for their"
"own souls, have had no experience, is not successful. Charles"
Kingsley’s undergraduate days were perhaps not without knowledge of
"the shadows, but he is happier in the Schools of Alexandria, or in the"
and to wonder into what manner of company he had thrust himself.  He had
"never before been inside this house, though he had, in the first days of"
"his new career, taken his meals in some of the numerous coffee or"
"chocolate houses, or the taverns which abounded throughout the town."
"Latterly he had generally bought his food at the cheapest market, and"
had eaten it in the attic to which he had removed himself and his few
belongings.  He was beginning to wonder how long he should be able even
to retain that humble abode as his own.  Dame Fortune’s smiles seemed
"quite to have deserted him, and abject poverty stared him grimly in the"
face.
"A smoking lamp had been brought in, and hung overhead, lighting up the"
faces of the company with its yellow glare.  There was something strange
and Rembrandt-like in the effect of the picture upon which Grey’s eyes
"rested.  Leaning back dreamily with his head against the wall, he could"
"almost fancy himself back in one of those foreign picture galleries, in"
"which heretofore he had delighted, and where so many hours of his time"
had been spent.
"But this was a living picture, shifting, changing, breaking up into"
"groups and re-forming again; and the hum of talk went on unceasingly, as"
"one after another took up the word and launched forth his opinions,"
"generally in florid and flowery language, and with much gesticulation"
and indignation.
What first struck Grey as strange was the anger which seemed to possess
all these men.  That they were in no good case was well-nigh proved by
"the shabbiness of their dress, and by the fact of their being gathered"
"in this very humble and cheap place of resort, which would not tempt any"
"but those in adverse circumstances.  But over and above their poverty,"
"they seemed to be railing at neglect or injustice of some sort, and ever"
"and anon would break out into virulent abuse of some person or persons,"
his must necessarily be in direct and absolute opposition! At the same
"time, he remembered that those who were sure of their faith never lost"
"their temper about it,--and as he glanced at his friend's perfectly"
"serene and coldly smiling countenance, he saw there was no danger of"
"his letting slip, even for a moment, his admirable power of"
"self-command. The Duc de la Santoisie, meanwhile, settling his"
"mustache, and gracefully waving one hand, on which sparkled a large"
"diamond ring, bent forward a little with a courteous, deprecatory"
gesture.
"""I think""--he said, in soft, purring accents,--""that my friend, Dr."
"Mudley""--here he bowed toward the saturnine looking individual who had"
"entered into conversation with Alwyn--""takes a very proper, and indeed"
"a very lofty, view of the whole question. The moral sense""--and he laid"
"a severely weighty emphasis on these words,--""the moral sense of each"
"man, if properly trained, is quite sufficient to guide him through"
"existence, without any such weakness as reliance on a merely"
"supposititious Deity."""
The Duke's French way of speaking English was charming; he gave an
"expressive roll to his r's, especially when he said ""the moral sense,"""
that of itself almost carried conviction. His wife smiled as she heard
"him, and her smile was not altogether pleasant. Perhaps she wondered by"
"what criterion of excellence he measured his own ""moral sense,"" or"
"whether, despite his education and culture, he had any ""moral sense"" at"
"all, higher than that of the pig, who eats to be eaten! But Alwyn"
"spoke, and she listened intently, finding a singular fascination in the"
"soft and quiet modulation of his voice, which gave a vaguely delicious"
suggestion of music underlying speech.
"""To guide people by their moral sense alone""--he said--""you must first"
"prove plainly to them that the moral sense exists, together with moral"
"Many canoes were anchored along the coast beyond the village beach,"
"some tucked away into small coves, others moored in sheltered"
"shallows. The men sat on the shore round fires, preparing their food,"
which they took out of the provisions carried on the canoes. Only the
"water did they obtain from the island, filling their coco-nut-made"
water vessels from the springs. About a dozen canoes were actually
"moored at the village beach. Late at night, I walked along the shore"
"to observe their sleeping arrangements. In the clear, moonlit night,"
"the small fires burnt with a red, subdued glow; there was always one"
"of them between each two sleepers, consisting of three burning sticks,"
"gradually pushed in as they were consumed. The men slept with the big,"
"stiff pandanus mats over them; each mat is folded in the middle, and"
"when put on the ground, forms a kind of miniature prismatic tent. All"
"along the beach, it was almost a continuous row of man alternating with"
"fire, the dun-coloured mats being nearly invisible against the sand in"
the full moonlight. It must have been a very light sleep for every now
"and then, a man stirred, peeping up from under his shell, re-adjusting"
"the fire, and casting a searching glance over the surroundings. It"
would be difficult to say whether mosquitoes or cold wind or fear of
"sorcery disturbed their sleep most, but I should say the last."
"The next morning, early, and without any warning, the whole fleet"
sailed away. At about 8 o'clock the last canoe punted towards the
"offing, where they stepped their mast and hoisted their sail. There"
"were no farewell gifts, no conch shell blowing, and the Dobuans this"
"time left their resting place as they had come, without ceremony or"
"display. The morning after, the Nabwagetans followed them. I was left"
"in the village with a few cripples, the women and one or two men who"
"had remained perhaps to look after the village, perhaps specially to"
keep watch over me and see that I did no mischief. Not one of them was
"a good informant. Through a mistake of mine, I had missed the cutter"
which had come two days before to the island of Gumasila and left
"Italy_, says: ""The Bambino is a doll about three feet high, and it"
stands on a cushion in a glass case. It is clad in rich robes with
"a crown on its head, a regal order across its breast, and embroidered"
slippers on its feet. From head to foot it is one mass of dazzling
"jewelry, gold chains, strings of pearls, and diamond bracelets and"
"rings, which not only cover the neck, arms and fingers, but are"
"suspended, intermixed with crosses, stars, hearts, monograms, and"
"every kind of precious stone, to all parts of its body. The only part"
"unweighted with gems is its round, priest-like, wax face. But all this"
"display of wealth, great in itself, is really only suggestive of that"
"untold quantity which it has brought, and is still daily bringing,"
into the coffers of the church. People are continually kneeling before
"this dumb idol, offering petitions and leaving gifts, whilst letters"
"containing requests, accompanied with post-office orders and checks to"
"pay for the granting of the same, arrive by post for it from various"
"parts of the globe."""
Hare's _Walks in Rome_ gives the following account of the Bambino and
one of its most remarkable experiences:
"""It has servants of its own, and a carriage in which it drives"
"out with its attendants, and goes to visit the sick; for, though"
"an infant, it is the oldest medical practitioner in Rome. Devout"
peasants always kneel as the blessed infant passes. Formerly it was
"taken to sick persons and left on their beds for some hours, in the"
hope that it would work a miracle. Now it is never left alone. In
"explanation of this, it is said that an audacious woman formed the"
design of appropriating to herself the holy image and its benefits.
She had another doll prepared of the same size and appearance as the
"Santissimo, and having feigned sickness and obtained permission to have"
"it left with her, she dressed the false image in its clothes, and sent"
"it back to Ara Coeli. The fraud was not discovered till night, when the"
"everyone of them was murdered, including the negro hangman, with the"
"exception of one man, who was sent with a written message to the Governor"
to tell him that in future L'Ollonais would kill every Spaniard he met
with.
"Joining with a famous filibuster, Michael de Basco, L'Ollonais soon"
"organized a more important expedition, consisting of a fleet of eight"
"vessels and 400 men. Sailing to the Gulf of Venezuela in 1667, they"
"entered the lake, destroying the fort that stood to guard the entrance."
Thence sailing to the city of Maracaibo they found all the inhabitants had
fled in terror. The filibusters caught many of the inhabitants hiding in
"the neighbouring woods, and killed numbers of them in their attempts to"
force from the rest the hiding-places of their treasure. They next marched
"upon and attacked the town of Gibraltar, which was valiantly defended by"
"the Spaniards, until the evening, when, having lost 500 men killed, they"
"surrendered. For four weeks this town was pillaged, the inhabitants"
"murdered, while torture and rape were daily occurrences. At last, to the"
"relief of the wretched inhabitants, the buccaneers, with a huge booty,"
"sailed away to Corso Island, a place of rendezvous of the French"
"buccaneers. Here they divided their spoil, which totalled the great sum of"
"260,000 pieces of eight, which, when divided amongst them, gave each man"
"above one hundred pieces of eight, as well as his share of plate, silk,"
and jewels.
"Also, a share was allotted for the next-of-kin of each man killed, and"
extra rewards for those pirates who had lost a limb or an eye. L'Ollonais
"had now become most famous amongst the ""Brethren of the Coast,"" and began"
to make arrangements for an even more daring expedition to attack and
"plunder the coast of Nicaragua. Here he burnt and pillaged ruthlessly,"
committing the most revolting cruelties on the Spanish inhabitants. One
example of this monster's inhuman deeds will more than suffice to tell of.
It happened that during an attack on the town of San Pedros the buccaneers
thus given and received is equivalent to that given by the Pope in
"person in St. Peter's. Truly a novel way of turning an honest penny!"""
"We hear that a rash churchman, not liking the facts just stated,"
"undertook to deny them in the public prints, when up spoke some English"
"gentlemen, who had been in Rome recently, and bowled the churchman over"
with the statement that they had themselves seen this blessing machine
on the Corso.
One never touches this subject of the vast wealth of the papacy without
"calling to mind the well-known rejoinder of the great theologian,"
"Thomas Aquinas, when the Pope was showing him all his money and riches,"
"and said, ""You see, Thomas, the church cannot now say what it said in"
"early times, 'Silver and gold have I none.'"" ""No,"" answered Aquinas,"
"""nor can it say, 'Rise up and walk'"" (Acts iii. 6). This loss of"
"spiritual power, this loss of ability to minister salvation to others,"
is one of the most melancholy results of the corruption of the papacy.

"Dr. Alexander Robertson, in his recent book on _The Roman Catholic"
"Church in Italy_, which has received the hearty approval of the King"
"of Italy and his Prime Minister, says: ""There are few, I daresay,"
"who have looked into the history of the popes, no matter what their"
"religious faith may be, who will not agree with me when I say that it"
does not afford pleasant reading. One's intellect rebels against their
"preposterous claims and pretensions, and one's moral sense against"
"their character and lives. Amongst them there were some good men, some"
"learned men, and some really able men; but, taking them all in all,"
"they were, beyond doubt, amongst the lowest class of men to be found"
on the pages of history. To wade through their lives is to cross a
"pestiferous moral swamp of worldliness, simony, nepotism, concubinage,"
"personal animosities, sanguinary feuds, forged decretals, plunderings,"
have been brought from very far away; and in explanation he was told a
curious story.
It appeared that in the old days there used to be only a bamboo and
"grass monastery there, such a monastery as most jungle villages have;"
and the then monk was distressed at the smallness of his abode and the
little accommodation there was for his school--a monastery is always a
school. So one rainy season he planted with great care a number of teak
"seedlings round about, and he watered them and cared for them. 'When"
"they are grown up,' he would say, 'these teak-trees shall provide"
timber for a new and proper building; and I will myself return in
"another life, and with those trees will I build a monastery more worthy"
"than this.' Teak-trees take a hundred years to reach a mature size, and"
"while the trees were still but saplings the monk died, and another monk"
"taught in his stead. And so it went on, and the years went by, and from"
"time to time new monasteries of bamboo were built and rebuilt, and the"
"teak-trees grew bigger and bigger. But the village grew smaller, for the"
"times were troubled, and the village was far away in the forest. So it"
happened that at last the village found itself without a monk at all:
"the last monk was dead, and no one came to take his place."
"It is a serious thing for a village to have no monk. To begin with,"
there is no one to teach the lads to read and write and do arithmetic;
and there is no one to whom you can give offerings and thereby get
"merit, and there is no one to preach to you and tell you of the sacred"
teaching. So the village was in a bad way.
"Then at last one evening, when the girls were all out at the well"
"drawing water, they were surprised by the arrival of a monk walking in"
"from the forest, weary with a long journey, footsore and hungry. The"
"villagers received him with enthusiasm, fearing, however, that he was"
"but passing through, and they furbished up the old monastery in a hurry"
"Of these towns David is the capital of the Chiriqui province, the"
portion of the republic in which cattle growing and agriculture have
"been most developed. Bocas del Toro is a banana port, dependent upon"
"that nutritious fruit for its very existence, and the center of the"
business of the United Fruit Company in Panama. At present the former
town is reached by a 300 mile water trip from Panama City; the latter by
boat from Colon. The government has under way plans for a railroad from
Panama to David which give every indication of being consummated.

"The soil of the Republic differs widely in its varying sections, from"
"the rich vegetable loam of the lowlands along the Atlantic Coast, the"
outcome of years of falling leaves and twigs from the trees to the swamp
"below, to the high dry lands of the savannas and the hillsides of the"
"Chiriqui province. All are undeniably fertile, that is demonstrated by"
the rapid and rank growth of the jungle. But opinions differ as to the
extent to which they are available for useful agriculture. Some hold
that the jungle soil is so rich that the plants run to wood and leaves
to the exclusion of fruits. Others declare that on the hillsides the
heavy rains of the rainy seasons wash away the surface soil leaving only
the harsh and arid substratum. This theory seems to be overthrown by the
fact that it is rare to see a hillside in all Panama not covered with
dense vegetation. A fact that is well worth bearing in mind is that
there has never been a systematic and scientific effort to utilize any
part of the soil of Panama for productive purposes that has not been a
success. The United Fruit Company in its plantations about Bocas del
Toro has developed a fruitful province and created a prosperous town. In
"the province of Cocle a German company has set out about 75,000 cacao"
"trees, 50,000 coffee bushes and 25,000 rubber trees, all of which have"
made good progress.
He did not try to analyze the strange feelings which possessed him.  For
a time he did not even consciously think.  He seemed to be drifting
"along a shining pathway—drifting, he scarce knew whither, and did not"
"care to ask.  His heart was strangely heavy, and yet strangely light.  A"
curious loathing and shame at himself was blended with a sense of
"exultant triumph, which held him in a mood of ecstasy.  For a long while"
"he drifted onwards, scarce thinking or knowing whither he went, till a"
sudden consciousness that he was passing Lord Sandford’s house brought
him to himself with a sense of shock. He had left that house only two
hours before; yet it might have been as many years that had rolled over
"his head, so different were his feelings, so changed was his outlook"
upon life.
"He moored his boat, and went up to his room. Before long he would be"
"expected to drink coffee or chocolate at his friend’s levee, meet all"
those of his comrades who had energy to pay their customary _devoirs_ to
"their patron, and discuss the plans for the ensuing day and night.  Grey"
"dashed some cold water over his hot head, and sat down to think."
What would Lord Sandford say if he suddenly expressed his intention of
"giving up gambling in all its many insidious forms, in order to enter"
upon a life totally different from that of the past weeks? It was not as
though he had any alternative plan to unfold to him.  He was as ignorant
"how his fortune was to be made now, after several weeks in gay London"
"town, as he had been on his first approach to that city.  He could"
almost hear the great guffaw of laughter with which Lord Sandford would
greet his confession.  He half feared the powerful personality and the
"imperious temper of the man who had been a good friend to him, and who"
had the reputation of being a dangerous enemy when his will was crossed.
Grey knew that this man liked him—went near to loving him—would not
easily let him go.  He knew that he would appear both ungrateful and
capricious; and the young man writhed at the thought of seeming either
which fronts the Champ de Mars had less effect than might have
been expected in a youth of fifteen years. Not yet did he become
French in sympathy. His love of Corsica and hatred of the French
monarchy steeled him against the luxuries of his new surroundings.
Perhaps it was an added sting that he was educated at the expense of
the monarchy which had conquered his kith and kin. He nevertheless
"applied himself with energy to his favourite studies, especially"
"mathematics. Defective in languages he still was, and ever remained;"
for his critical acumen in literature ever fastened on the matter
rather than on style. To the end of his days he could never write
"Italian, much less French, with accuracy; and his tutor at Paris not"
inaptly described his boyish composition as resembling molten granite.
The same qualities of directness and impetuosity were also fatal to
his efforts at mastering the movements of the dance. In spite of
lessons at Paris and private lessons which he afterwards took at
"Valence, he was never a dancer: his bent was obviously for the exact"
"sciences rather than the arts, for the geometrical rather than the"
"rhythmical: he thought, as he moved, in straight lines, never in"
curves.
The death of his father during the year which the youth spent at Paris
sharpened his sense of responsibility towards his seven younger
brothers and sisters. His own poverty must have inspired him with
disgust at the luxury which he saw around him; but there are good
reasons for doubting the genuineness of the memorial which he is
alleged to have sent from Paris to the second master at Brienne on
this subject. The letters of the scholars at Paris were subject to
"strict surveillance; and, if he had taken the trouble to draw up a"
"list of criticisms on his present training, most assuredly it would"
"have been destroyed. Undoubtedly, however, he would have sympathized"
with the unknown critic in his complaint of the unsuitableness of
sumptuous meals to youths who were destined for the hardships of the
The opinion was universal. The Burmans preferred to spend twice or
"thrice the money and hire a bullock-cart and go slowly, while the coach"
"flashed past them in a whirl of dust, or they preferred to walk. Many"
and many times have I seen the roadside rest-houses full of travellers
halting for a few minutes' rest. They walked while the coach came by
empty; and nearly all of them could have afforded the fare. It was a
"very striking instance of what pure kind-heartedness will do, for there"
would have been no religious command broken by going in the coach. It
was the pure influence of compassion towards the beasts and refusal to
"be a party to such hard-heartedness. And yet, as I have said, I do not"
think the law could have interfered with success. Surely a people who
"could act like this have the very soul of religion in their hearts,"
although the act was not done in the name of religion.
"All the animals--the cattle, the ponies, and the buffaloes--are so tame"
that it is almost an unknown thing for anyone to get hurt.
The cattle are sometimes afraid of the white face and strange attire of
"a European, but you can walk through the herds as they come home in the"
evening with perfect confidence that they will not hurt you. Even a cow
with a young calf will only eye you suspiciously; and with the Burmans
even the huge water buffaloes are absolutely tame. You can see a herd of
"these great beasts, with horns six feet across, come along under the"
command of a very small boy or girl perched on one of their broad backs.
"He flourishes a little stick, and issues his commands like a general. It"
is one of the quaintest imaginable sights to see this little fellow get
"off his steed, run after a straggler, and beat him with his stick. The"
"buffalo eyes his master, whom he could abolish with one shake of his"
"head, submissively, and takes the beating, which he probably feels about"
"as much as if a straw fell on him, good-humouredly. The children never"
"seem to come to grief. Buffaloes occasionally charge Europeans, but the"
only place where I have known of Burmans being killed by buffaloes is in
"definitely noble descent, and came of families which combined the"
intellectual gifts of Tuscany with the vigour of their later island
"home[3]. From her mother's race, the Pietra Santa family, Letizia"
"imbibed the habits of the most backward and savage part of Corsica,"
where vendettas were rife and education was almost unknown. Left in
"ignorance in her early days, she yet was accustomed to hardships, and"
often showed the fertility of resource which such a life always
"develops. Hence, at the time of her marriage, she possessed a firmness"
of will far beyond her years; and her strength and fortitude enabled
"her to survive the terrible adversities of her early days, as also to"
meet with quiet matronly dignity the extraordinary honours showered on
her as the mother of the French Emperor. She was inured to habits of
"frugality, which reappeared in the personal tastes of her son. In"
"fact, she so far retained her old parsimonious habits, even amidst the"
"splendours of the French Imperial Court, as to expose herself to the"
charge of avarice. But there is a touching side to all this. She seems
ever to have felt that after the splendour there would come again the
"old days of adversity, and her instincts were in one sense correct."
"She lived on to the advanced age of eighty-six, and died twenty-one"
years after the break-up of her son's empire--a striking proof of the
vitality and tenacity of her powers.
A kindly Providence veiled the future from the young couple. Troubles
fell swiftly upon them both in private and in public life. Their first
"two children died in infancy. The third, Joseph, was born in 1768,"
when the Corsican patriots were making their last successful efforts
"against their new French oppressors: the fourth, the famous Napoleon,"
"saw the light on August 15th, 1769, when the liberties of Corsica were"
being finally extinguished. Nine other children were born before the
"outbreak of the French Revolution reawakened civil strifes, amidst"
which the then fatherless family was tossed to and fro and finally
whirled away to France.

"France. In a letter written on January 23rd, 1791, Buonaparte"
overwhelms this man with a torrent of invective.--He it was who had
betrayed his country to France in 1768. Self-interest and that alone
"prompted his action then, and always. French rule was a cloak for his"
"design of subjecting Corsica to ""the absurd feudal _régime_"" of the"
barons. In his selfish royalism he had protested against the new
"French constitution as being unsuited to Corsica, ""though it was"
exactly the same as that which brought us so much good and was wrested
"from us only amidst streams of blood.""--The letter is remarkable for"
"the southern intensity of its passion, and for a certain hardening of"
tone towards Paoli. Buonaparte writes of Paoli as having been ever
"""surrounded by enthusiasts, and as failing to understand in a man any"
"other passion than fanaticism for liberty and independence,"" and as"
duped by Buttafuoco in 1768.[14] The phrase has an obvious reference
"to the Paoli of 1791, surrounded by men who had shared his long exile"
"and regarded the English constitution as their model. Buonaparte, on"
"the contrary, is the accredited champion of French democracy, his"
furious epistle being printed by the Jacobin Club of Ajaccio.
After firing off this tirade Buonaparte returned to his regiment at
"Auxonne (February, 1791). It was high time; for his furlough, though"
"prolonged on the plea of ill-health, had expired in the preceding"
"October, and he was therefore liable to six months' imprisonment. But"
the young officer rightly gauged the weakness of the moribund
monarchy; and the officers of his almost mutinous regiment were glad
to get him back on any terms. Everywhere in his journey through
"Provence and Dauphiné, Buonaparte saw the triumph of revolutionary"
principles. He notes that the peasants are to a man for the
Revolution; so are the rank and file of the regiment. The officers
"are aristocrats, along with three-fourths of those who belong to ""good"
"society"": so are all the women, for ""Liberty is fairer than they, and"
"And, in fine, though we trembled at the thought of the open road, and"
"my heart for one grew sick as I looked from Marie to my lady, and"
"reckoned the long tale of leagues which lay between us and Cassel, the"
risk had to be run.
Steve had discovered a more easy though longer way out of the
"willow-bed, and two hours before midnight on the second night, he and"
I mounted the women and prepared to set out. He arranged that we
should go in the same order in which we had come: that he should lead
"the march, and I bring up the rear, while the Waldgrave, who was still"
"far from well, and whose continued lack of vigour troubled us the more"
"as we said little about it, should ride with my lady."
"The night seemed likely to be fine, but the darkness, the sough of the"
"wind as it swept over the plain, and the melancholy plashing of the"
"water as our horses plodded through it, were not things of a kind to"
"allay our fears. When we at last left our covert, and reaching the"
"road stood to listen, the fall of a leaf made us start. Though no"
sounds but those of the night came to our ears--and some of these were
"of a kind to reassure us--we said 'Hush!' again and again, and only"
moved on after a hundred alarums and assurances.
"I walked by Marie, with my hand on the withers of her horse, but we"
"did not talk. The two waiting-women riding double were before us, and"
their muttered fears alone broke the silence which prevailed at the
"end of the train. We went at the rate of about two leagues an hour,"
"Steve and I and the men running where the roads were good, and"
everywhere and at all times urging the horses to do their best. The
"haste of our movements, the darkness, our constant alarm, and the"
occasional confusion when the rear pressed on the van at an awkward
"place, had the effect of upsetting the balance of our minds; so"
that the most common impulse of flight--to press forward with
performed by Sts. Cosmo and Damian upon a man who was praying in the
"church dedicated to them, and who had a diseased leg amputated without"
"pain by the good saints while he slept; and not only so, but had a"
"sound leg, which they had taken from the body of a man just buried,"
substituted for the diseased one. Nor can I dwell on the miraculous
blindness with which the guard sent to seize Pope St. Martin I. was
stricken the moment he caught sight of the pontiff in St. Maria
"Maggiore, or the miraculous tears shed by an image of the Virgin"
attached to a neighboring wall when she saw a cruel murder committed in
"the street below, or the madonnas and crucifixes that spoke to saints"
"on various occasions. One of these, however, is too significant to be"
omitted altogether. There is in the Church of St. Agostino a sculptured
"image of the Madonna and child. ""It is not long since the report was"
spread that one day a poor woman called upon this image of the Madonna
"for help; it began to speak, and replied, 'If I had only something,"
"then I could help thee, but I myself am so poor!' This story was"
"circulated, and very soon throngs of credulous people hastened hither"
"to kiss the foot of the Madonna, _and to present her with all kinds of"
"gifts_."" (Italics mine.)"
"[Sidenote: How the Papal Treasury was Filled, and how it was Emptied.]"
The evil methods employed at various times to replenish the papal
"treasury are known to all readers of history. The best known, perhaps,"
"is the shameless traffic in indulgences by Tetzel, which helped to"
precipitate the Reformation. Hare closes his account of the execution
of Beatrice Cenci for complicity in the murder of her father with the
"statement that ""sympathy will always follow one who sinned under the"
"most terrible of provocations, and whose cruel death was due to the"
avarice of Clement VIII. for the riches which the church acquired by
"the confiscation of the Cenci property,"" and cites the petition of"
"Gaspare Guizza (1601), in which he claims a reward from the Pope for"
"paddling, towards the beach of Sinaketa. When they were within about"
"ten minutes of the shore, all the conch shells began to be sounded,"
and the murmur of recited magic rose from the canoes. I could not come
"sufficiently near the canoes, for reason of etiquette, to be able to"
"see the exact arrangement of the reciters, but I was told that it was"
the same as that observed by the Trobrianders on their approach to
"Dobu, described in Chapter XIII. The general effect was powerful, when"
this wonderfully painted and fully decorated fleet was gliding swiftly
"good citizens, as well as the undesirable class, would either attend the"
hearings or familiarize themselves with the quarterly reports. Thus a
general steal would be impossible. A single Commissioner cannot make all
"of his business public, and much that he does never reaches the light of"
"publicity. In fact, I believe that because the Commissioner cannot take"
"the public into his confidence, abuses are bound to occur. Often it"
"remains for the Indian Rights Association, or other organizations, to"
appeal to the public and do that which the Indian Office should
establish without outside influence. There would be far less incentive
"to dishonesty, were covetous white men compelled to deal with a"
Commission instead of an individual. The publication of the Board’s
hearings and findings would have a deterrent effect on certain men who
otherwise appeal to Senators or Congressmen.
I have often contrasted the work of Dr. W. T. Grenfell in Labrador with
that of organizations laboring among our Indians. We are not responsible
"for the condition of the fishermen in Labrador, and they are numerically"
but a fraction as compared with our total Indian population. Yet Dr.
"Grenfell, through his lectures and publications has aroused such an"
interest in this country that he can collect for his Labrador work a sum
far greater than that expended in support of six Indian missions. People
are interested in him and his work because of the appeal he makes. The
"Labrador fishermen suffer no wrongs compared with our Indians, and their"
condition is far better than that of the average aborigine. Similar
"philosophic system which acted as her handmaid, and was only tolerated"
"as such, was naturally affected in like manner by the change; and to"
"her credit be it said, that instead of with averted eyes looking"
"elsewhere, as might easily have been done, she determined to face the"
"worst, and wisely asked the question whether in her department too she"
had not something she could learn from a sister country across the sea.
Hence a great change was brought about in the mental attitude of
Scotland; but we anticipate.
"Ferrier, after leaving Heidelberg, paid a short visit to Leipzig, and"
then for a few weeks took up his abode at Berlin. From Leipzig he
writes to Miss Wilson again: 'How do you like an _epistola_ dated from
"this great emporium of taste and letters, this culminating point of"
"Germanism, where waggons jostle philosophy, and tobacco-impregnated air"
"is articulated into divinest music? It is fair-time, and I did not"
"arrive, as one usually does, a day _behind_ it, but on the very day it"
"commenced. It will last, I believe, some weeks, and during that time"
"all business is done on the open streets, which are lined on each side"
"with large wooden booths, and are swarming with men and merchandise of"
every description and from every quarter of the world. It very much
"resembles a _Ladies' Sale_ in the Assembly Rooms (what I never saw),"
"only the ladies here are frequently Jews with fierce beards, and have"
always a pipe in their mouths when not eating or drinking. As you walk
along you will find the order of the day to be somewhat as follows. You
"first come to pipes, then shawls, then nails, then pipes, pipes again,"
"pipes, gingerbread, dolls, then pipes, bridles, spurs, pipes, books,"
"warming-pans, pipes, china, writing-desks, pipes again, pipes, pipes,"
"pipes, nothing but pipes--the very pen will write nothing but pipes."
"Pipes, you see, decidedly carry it. I wonder they don't erect public"
"tobacco-smoke works, lay _pipes_ for it along the streets, and smoke"
away--a city at a time. Private families might take it in as we do
gas!'
revolted unsubduably against his son is to be explained in terms of
certain circumstances little stressed in popular historiography. In the
"narratives of the rhetorical historians, no real explanation arises. The"
revolt figures as a stand for personal and religious freedom. But when
"Charles abdicated, after slaying his thousands, the Reformation had been"
in full tide for over thirty years; Calvin had built up Protestant
Geneva to the point of burning Servetus; England had been for twenty
"years depapalised; France, with many scholars and nobles converted to"
"Calvinism, was on the verge of a civil war of Huguenots and Catholics;"
the Netherlands themselves had been drenched in the blood of heretics;
and still no leading man had thought of repudiating either Spain or
"Rome. Yet within thirteen years they were in full revolt, led by William"
"of Orange, now turned Protestant. Seeing that mere popular Protestantism"
"had spread far and gone fast, religious opinion was clearly not the"
determining force.
"In reality, the _conditio sine qua non_ was the psychological reversal"
"effected by Philip when he elected to rule as a Spaniard, where his"
father had in effect ruled as a Fleming. Charles had always figured as a
"native of the Netherlands, at home among his people, friendly to their"
"great men, ready to employ them in his affairs, even to the extent of"
partly ruling Spain through them. After his punishment of Ghent they
were his boon subjects; and in his youth it was the Spaniards who were
jealous of the Flemish and Dutch. This state of things had begun under
"his Flemish-German father, Philip I, who became King of Spain by"
"marriage, and under whom the Netherland nobles showed in Spain a"
rapacity that infuriated the Spaniards against them. It was a question
simply of racial predominance; and had the dynasty chosen to fix its
"capital in the north rather than in the south, it would have been the"
lot of the Netherlanders to exploit Spain--a task for which they were
perfectly ready.
it had to deal with the unravelling of the great mystery that underlies
memory and tracing it backwards to latent impressions even in the
"inorganic bodies which are capable of subsequent revival; and finally,"
the determination of the special characteristic of that vehicle through
which sensiferous impulses are transmitted and the possibility of
changing the intensity and the tone of sensation. All these
"investigations, Dr. Bose said, are to be carried out by new physical"
methods of the utmost delicacy. He had in these years been able to
remove the obstacles in the path and had lifted the veil so as to catch
a glimpse of the ineffable wonder that had hitherto been hidden from
"view. The real work, he said, had only just begun."
A SOCIAL GATHERING
"At the Social Gathering held on the 16th December 1915, in the compound"
"of the Calcutta Presidency College, to meet him after his highly"
"successful tour through Europe, America and Japan, Dr. Bose spoke as"
follows:--
He said that it was his rare good fortune to have been amply rewarded
for the hardships and struggles that he had gone through by the generous
and friendly feelings of his colleagues and the love and trust of his
pupils. He would say a few words regarding his experience in the
"Presidency College for more than three decades, which he hoped would"
serve to bring all who loved the Presidency College--present and past
pupils and their teachers--in closer bonds of union. He would speak to
"them what he had learnt after years of patient labour, that the"
impossible became possible by persistent and determined efforts and
adherence to duty and entire selflessness. The greatest obstacle often
"arises out of foolish misunderstanding of each other's ideals, such as"
"the differing points of view, first of the Indian teacher, then of his"
strongly felt the attraction of a marvelous country where everything was
"mysterious, from the Nile that had created it to the hieroglyphs engraved"
upon the walls of its gigantic edifices.[10] At the same time they were
shocked by the coarseness of its fetichism and by the absurdity of its
superstitions. Above all they felt an unconquerable repulsion at the
"worship of animals and plants, which had always been the most striking"
"feature of the vulgar Egyptian religion and which, like all other archaic"
"devotions, seems to have been practised with renewed fervor after the"
accession of the Saite dynasty. The comic writers and the satirists never
"tired of scoffing at the adorers of the cat, the crocodile, the leek and"
"the onion. Juvenal says ironically: ""O holy people, whose very"
"kitchen-gardens produce gods.""[11] In a general way, this strange people,"
"entirely separated from the remainder of the world, were regarded with"
about the same kind of feeling that Europeans entertained toward the
Chinese for a long time.
A purely Egyptian worship would not have been acceptable to the Greco-Latin
world. The main merit of the mixed creation of the political genius of the
Ptolemies consisted in the rejection or modification of everything
"repugnant or monstrous like the phallophories of Abydos, and in the"
retention of none but {79} stirring or attractive elements. It was the most
civilized of all barbarian religions; it retained enough of the exotic
"element to arouse the curiosity of the Greeks, but not enough to offend"
"their delicate sense of proportion, and its success was remarkable."
It was adopted wherever the authority or the prestige of the Lagides was
"felt, and wherever the relations of Alexandria, the great commercial"
"metropolis, extended. The Lagides induced the rulers and the nations with"
whom they concluded alliances to accept it. King Nicocreon introduced it
"into Cyprus after having consulted the oracle of the Serapeum,[12] and"
"Agathocles introduced it into Sicily, at the time of his marriage with the"
"daughter-in-law of Ptolemy I (298).[13] At Antioch, Seleucus Callinicus"
"If within each of the two ears there are three ears, visible on the"
"outside and the inside, the army of the ruler will forsake him and"
his land will revolt.
"If within each of the two ears there are three ears, visible on the"
"outside and the inside, the army of the ruler will forsake him and"
his land will revolt.
"If the ears of a foetus are choked up[66], in place of a large king a"
small king will be in the land.
"In general, therefore, an excess number of ears points to enlargement,"
"increased power, stability of the government and the like; and this is"
probably due in part to the association of wisdom and understanding with
"the ear in Babylonian[67], for as a general thing an excess of organs or"
"of parts of the body is an unfavorable sign, because a deviation from the"
normal.
"In the same way as in the case of the ears, we have birth-omen texts"
"dealing with the head, lips, mouth, eyes, feet, joints, tail, genital"
"organs, hair, horns and other parts of the body[68]. In many of these"
texts dealing with all kinds of peculiar formations and abnormalities in
"the case of one organ or one part of the body or the other, a comparison"
is instituted between the features or parts of one animal with those of
another and the interpretation is guided by the association of ideas with
the animal compared. A moment's reflection will show the importance of
this feature in extending the field of observation almost =ad infinitum=.
"A lamb born with a large head might suggest a lion, a small long head that"
"of a dog, or a very broad face might suggest the features of a bull. From"
"comparisons of this kind, the step would be a small one to calling a lamb"
"with lion-like features, a lion, or a lamb with features recalling those"
"celestial visitant who, on noiseless pinions, comes flying divinely"
"into the poorest homes, transfiguring common life with ethereal"
"radiance, making toil easy, giving beauty to the plainest faces and"
"poetry to the dullest brains. Love! its tremulous hand-clasp,--its"
"rapturous kiss,--the speechless eloquence it gives to gentle eyes!--the"
"grace it bestows on even the smallest gift from lover to beloved, were"
such gift but a handful of meadow blossoms tied with some silken
threads of hair!
"Not for the poet creator of ""Nourhulma"" such love any more,--had he not"
"drained the cup of Passion to the dregs in the far Past, and tasted its"
mixed sweetness and bitterness to no purpose save self-indulgence? All
"that was over;--and yet, as he walked away from the bridge, back to his"
"hotel in the quiet moonlight, he thought what a transcendent thing Love"
"might be, even on earth, between two whose spirits were SPIRITUALLY"
"AKIN,--whose lives were like two notes played in tuneful"
"concord,--whose hearts beat echoing faith and tenderness to one"
"another,--and who held their love as a sacred bond of union--a gift"
"from God, not to be despoiled by that rough familiarity which surely"
brings contempt. And then before his fancy appeared to float the
"radiant visage of Edris, half-child, half-angel,--he seemed to see her"
"beautiful eyes, so pure, so clear, so unshadowed by any knowledge of"
"sin,--and the exquisite lines of a poet-contemporary, whose work he"
"specially admired, occurred to him with singular suggestiveness:"
"""Oh, thou'lt confess that love from man to maid"
"Is more than kingdoms,--more than light and shade"
"In sky-built gardens where the minstrels dwell,"
And more than ransom from the bonds of Hell.
"Thou wilt, I say, admit the truth of this,"
"And half relent that, shrinking from a kiss,"
"Thou didst consign me to mine own disdain,"
CHAPTER V
"THUS it came to pass that, for the sake of Stellamaris, Risca remained"
in London and fought with beasts in Fenton Square. Sometimes he got the
"better of the beasts, and sometimes the beasts got the better of him. On"
the former occasions he celebrated the victory by doing an extra turn of
work; on the latter he sat idly growling at defeat.
"At this period of his career he was assistant-editor of a weekly review,"
"in charge of the book-column of an evening newspaper, the contributor of"
"a signed weekly article on general subjects to the “Daily Herald,” and"
of a weekly London letter to an American syndicate. From this it will
be seen that for a man not yet thirty he had achieved a position in
journalism envied by many who had grown gray-headed in the game. But as
Risca had written three or four novels which had all been rejected by
"all the publishers in London, he chose to regard himself as a man foiled"
in his ambitions. He saw himself doomed to failure. For him was the
eternal toil of ploughing the sand; the Garden of Delight cultivated by
"the happy Blest--such as Fawcus of the club, who boasted of making over"
"a thousand pounds for every novel he wrote, and of being able to take"
as much holiday as he chose--had its gilded gates closed against him
forever. That the man of nine-and-twenty should grow embittered because
he was not accepted by the world as a brilliant novelist is a matter for
the derision of the middle-aged and for the pitying smile of the hoary;
"but it is a matter of woeful concern to twenty-nine, especially if"
twenty-nine be a young man of a saturnine temperament whom fate has
driven to take himself seriously. In Risca's life there were misfortunes
the reality of the pain of which was independent of age; others which
"were relative, as inseparable from youth as the tears for a bumped head"
are inseparable from childhood. Yet to the man they were all equally
"absolute. It is only in after-years, when one looks back down the vista,"
"Easter lamb, and while it is still a-cooking experience the inevitable"
"effects of plentiful wine on an empty stomach. Again, just as the rites"
"of Eleusis were nocturnal, so the chief services of Holy Week are those"
of the Friday night and the Saturday night; and it may be that the
torch-light processions which close the services on those two nights
are related to the δᾳδουχία of Eleusis. But these are minor details;
it is in the actual services of Good Friday and Easter that the most
"striking resemblance to the Eleusinian mysteries is found, and the"
spirit in which the worshippers approach may still be the same now as
then. Let me briefly describe the festival as I saw it in the island
"of Santorini, or, to give it the old name which has revived in modern"
"times, Thera."
The Lenten fast was drawing to a close when I arrived. For the first
"week it is strictly observed, meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, and"
"even olive-oil being prohibited, so that the ordinary diet is reduced"
"to bread and water, to which is sometimes added a nauseous soup made"
from dried cuttle-fish or octopus; for these along with shellfish
"are not reckoned to be animal food, as being bloodless. During the"
next four weeks some relaxation is allowed; but no one with any
"pretensions to piety would even then partake of fish, meat, or eggs;"
"the last-mentioned are stored up until Easter and then, being dyed"
"red, are either eaten or--more wisely--offered to visitors. Then comes"
"‘the Great Week’ (ἡ μεγάλη ἑβδομάδα), and with it the same strict"
regulations come into force as during the first week of Lent. It was
not hard to perceive that for most of the villagers the fast had been
a real and painful abstinence. Work had almost ceased; for there was
little energy left. Leisure was not enjoyed; for there was little
"spirit even for chatting. Everywhere white, sharp-featured faces told"
of real hunger; and the silence was most often broken by an outburst
of irritability. In a few days time I could understand it; for I too
perforce fasted; and I must own that a daily diet of dry bread for
THE HANSA
"Systematic commerce in the north of Europe, broadly speaking, begins"
"with the traffic of the Hansa towns, whose rise may be traced to the"
sudden development of civic life forced on Germany in the tenth century
"by the emperor Henry I, as a means of withstanding the otherwise"
"irresistible raids of the Hungarians.[711] Once founded, such cities for"
their own existence' sake gave freedom to all fugitive serfs who joined
"them, defending such against former masters, and giving them the chance"
of earning a living.[712] That is by common consent the outstanding
"origin of German civic industry, and the original conditions were such"
"that the cities, once formed, were gradually forced[713] to special"
"self-reliance. _Faustrecht_, or private war, was universal, even under"
emperors who suppressed feudal brigandage; and the cities had to fight
"their own battle, like those of Italy, from the beginning. As compared"
"with the robber baronage and separate princes, they stood for"
"intelligence and co-operation, and supplied a basis for organisation"
without which the long German chaos of the Middle Ages would have been
immeasurably worse. Taking their commercial cue from the cities of
"Italy, they reached, as against feudal enemies, a measure of peaceful"
union which the less differentiated Italian cities could not attain save
momentarily. The decisive conditions were that whereas in Italy the
"enemies were manifold--sometimes feudal nobles, sometimes the Emperor,"
"sometimes the Pope--the German cities had substantially one objective,"
"the protection of trade from the robber-knights. Thus, as early as the"
"year 1284, seventy cities of South Germany formed the Rhenish League, on"
which followed that of the Swabian towns. The league of the Hansa
"cities, like the other early ""Hansa of London,"" which united cities of"
"Flanders and France with mercantile London, was a growth on all fours"
"with these.[714] Starting, however, in maritime towns which grew to"
"commerce from beginnings in fishing, as the earlier Scandinavians had"
"But the cases being so dissimilar, Grey did not see that he need debar"
"himself from this easy highroad to fortunes, as it then seemed.  Nobody"
was dependent upon him.  Nobody was there to grieve over his troubles or
to rejoice over his success.  His honest serving-man was in sooth the
only being in any way deeply attached to him; and Dick was as delighted
"at his master’s brave appearance, and at the golden stream running into"
"his pocket, as though he had achieved some great success or triumph."
There was one way by which Grey had pocketed considerable sums of money
"that was very congenial to him, and had given him some very happy hours."
"This was the speed and strength of his horse, which Lord Sandford had"
"made boast of, vowing in the hearing of some of the smartest dandies of"
the town that Don Carlos would beat any steed against whom he was
"pitted—a challenge eagerly taken up by the young bloods, proud of their"
"own horses and horsemanship, to whom trials of skill and strength, and"
"contests over which wagers might freely be exchanged, were as the very"
salt of life.
"So either out at Hampstead, or at Richmond or Hampton Court, Don Carlos"
"had been set to show the metal of which he was made, and had come off"
"easy victor in every race and every match, whether flat running, or"
"leaping, or a course of the nature of a steeplechase had been elected."
"His strength and speed, sagacity and endurance, had never once failed"
"him, and already he was the talk of the town, and Grey could have sold"
him for a great price had he been willing to part with his favourite.
"Many bright eyes had smiled upon the young centaur, many languishing"
glances had been cast at him.  He had been called up again and again to
"be presented to some high-born dame, or some bevy of laughing maidens,"
"and he had bowed with courtly grace, and received their sugared"
compliments with suitable acknowledgments.  But no face had attracted
"him as that face he had seen once at the water theatre, almost upon his"
"general lines, as a danger which is bound to increase unless very"
definite steps are taken to counteract it. The supreme example of
"economic pressure applied against freedom of thought is Soviet Russia,"
"where, until the trade agreement, the Government could and did inflict"
"starvation upon people whose opinions it disliked—for example,"
Kropotkin. But in this respect Russia is only somewhat ahead of other
"countries. In France, during the Dreyfus affair, any teacher would have"
lost his position if he had been in favour of Dreyfus at the start or
against him at the end. In America at the present day I doubt if a
"university professor, however eminent, could get employment if he were"
"to criticize the Standard Oil Company, because all college presidents"
have received or hope to receive benefactions from Mr. Rockefeller.
"Throughout America Socialists are marked men, and find it extremely"
"difficult to obtain work unless they have great gifts. The tendency,"
"which exists wherever industrialism is well developed, for trusts and"
"monopolies to control all industry, leads to a diminution of the number"
"of possible employers, so that it becomes easier and easier to keep"
secret black books by means of which any one not subservient to the
great corporations can be starved. The growth of monopolies is
introducing in America many of the evils associated with State Socialism
"as it has existed in Russia. From the standpoint of liberty, it makes no"
difference to a man whether his only possible employer is the State or a
Trust.
"In America, which is the most advanced country industrially, and to a"
lesser extent in other countries which are approximating to the American
"condition, it is necessary for the average citizen, if he wishes to make"
"a living, to avoid incurring the hostility of certain big men. And these"
"big men have an outlook—religious, moral, and political—with which"
"they expect their employees to agree, at least outwardly. A man who"
"openly dissents from Christianity, or believes in a relaxation of the"
"marriage laws, or objects to the power of the great corporations, finds"
class distinctions were by no means so coveted as in lands that had
"been thoroughly feudalized; and the Buonapartes, content with their"
civic dignities at Ajaccio and the attachment of their partisans on
"their country estates, seem rarely to have used the prefix which"
implied nobility. Their life was not unlike that of many an old
"Scottish laird, who, though possibly _bourgeois_ in origin, yet by"
"courtesy ranked as chieftain among his tenants, and was ennobled by"
"the parlance of the countryside, perhaps all the more readily because"
he refused to wear the honours that came from over the Border.
But a new influence was now to call forth all the powers of this tough
stock. In the middle of the eighteenth century we find the head of the
"family, Charles Marie Buonaparte, aglow with the flame of Corsican"
patriotism then being kindled by the noble career of Paoli. This
"gifted patriot, the champion of the islanders, first against the"
"Genoese and later against the French, desired to cement by education"
the framework of the Corsican Commonwealth and founded a university.
It was here that the father of the future French Emperor received a
"training in law, and a mental stimulus which was to lift his family"
above the level of the _caporali_ and attorneys with whom its lot had
"for centuries been cast. His ambition is seen in the endeavour,"
"successfully carried out by his uncle, Lucien, Archdeacon of Ajaccio,"
to obtain recognition of kinship with the Buonapartes of Tuscany who
had been ennobled by the Grand Duke. His patriotism is evinced in his
"ardent support of Paoli, by whose valour and energy the Genoese were"
finally driven from the island. Amidst these patriotic triumphs
"Charles confronted his destiny in the person of Letizia Ramolino, a"
"beautiful girl, descended from an honourable Florentine family which"
had for centuries been settled in Corsica. The wedding took place in
"1764, the bridegroom being then eighteen, and the bride fifteen years"
"of age. The union, if rashly undertaken in the midst of civil strifes,"
"was yet well assorted. Both parties to it were of patrician, if not"
"warrant as aforesaid, be deemed to be in the legal custody of the person"
or persons empowered to remove him.

who will investigate it for themselves will see that the same idea of
death being followed by close intercourse with the gods is present
there also. That this was the inner meaning of the peculiarly offensive
"story is shown by a curious comment of Heraclitus upon it, which"
"Clement quotes--ωὐτὸς δε Ἀίδης καὶ Διόνυσος[1468], ‘Hades and Dionysus"
are one’; whence it follows that union with Dionysus is a synonym for
"that ‘marriage with Hades’ which elsewhere, in both ancient and modern"
"times, is a common presentment of death."
"Again in the Sabazian mysteries, which some connect with Dionysus and"
"others with Zeus, the little that is known of the ritual favours the"
view that here also the _motif_ was the marriage of the deity with his
"worshippers. According to Clement[1469], the subject-matter of these"
"mysteries was a story that Zeus, having become by Demeter the father"
"of Persephone, seduced in turn his own daughter, having as a means to"
"that end transformed himself into a snake. That story, it may safely be"
"said, is presented by Clement in its worst light; but the statement,"
"that in the ritual the deity was represented by a snake, obtains some"
"corroboration from Theophrastus, who says of the superstitious man,"
that if he see a red snake in his house he will invoke Sabazius[1470].
Now the token of these mysteries for those who were being initiated
"in them was, according to Clement[1471] again, ‘the god pressed to"
the bosom’ (ὁ διὰ κόλπου θεός); which phrase he explains by saying
"that the god was represented as a snake, which was passed under the"
clothing and drawn over the bosom of the initiated ‘as a proof of the
incontinence of Zeus.’ Clearly then the act of initiation was the
symbolic wedding of the worshipper with the deity worshipped; and it is
probable that the union which was symbolized in this life was expected
to be realised in the next.
Finally in the orgiastic worship of Cybele the same religious doctrine
is revealed. Here to Attis seems to be assigned the same part as to
is one which repeats the idea which we have already seen expressed
"in the formulary of Cybele’s rites, ὑπὸ τὸν παστὸν ὑπέδυν[1506], ‘I"
"was privily admitted to the bridal chamber,’ and in the token of the"
"Sabazian mysteries, ὁ διὰ κόλπου θεός[1507], ‘the god pressed to"
the bosom’; and Lucian’s final phrase in his account of Alexander’s
"mock-mysteries shows a kindred phrase, τὰ ὑπὸ κόλπου[1508], as an"
euphemism of the same kind[1509]. The Orphic therefore no less than
others based his claim to future happiness on the fact that he had
"performed a ritual act, of the nature of a sacrament, which constituted"
a pledge that the wedlock between him and his goddess foreshadowed here
should be consummated hereafter.
Even more abundant evidence is furnished by sepulchral monuments;
and in support of my views I cannot do better than quote two high
authorities who coincide in their verdict upon the meaning of the
scenes represented. In reference to those scenes ‘in which death
is conceived in the guise of a marriage’ Furtwängler writes: ‘The
"monuments belonging to this class are extraordinarily numerous, and"
exhibit very different methods of treating the idea which they carry
out. A relief upon a sarcophagus from the Villa Borghese shows the God
of the dead in the act of carrying down the fair Kore to be his bride
"in the lower world. Above the steeds of his chariot, which are already"
"disappearing into the depths of the earth, flies Eros as guide. The"
bride however appears to be going only under compulsion and after some
struggle; the look of the bridegroom expresses sternness rather than
gentleness; and the mother who sits with face averted seems to exclude
all thoughts of the daughter’s return. Only in the torches which the
"guide carries in his hand, in the snakes which are looking upward, and"
"in the observant attitude of Hecate, can a suggestion of the return be"
found.
‘On another sarcophagus--from Nazzara--which represents the same
"four-and-a-half millions of Dutch are Catholics; while in Belgium, where"
"there are hardly any Protestants, the Flemish-speaking and"
French-speaking populations are nearly equal in numbers.
"Van Kampen, who anticipated Motley in disparaging the Walloons as being"
"Frenchly fickle (_Geschichte_, i, 366), proceeds to contend that even"
the Flemings are more excitable than the Dutch and other Teutons; but he
notes later that as the Dutch poet Cats was much read and imitated in
"Belgium, he was thus proved to have expressed the spirit of the whole"
"Netherlands (ii, 109). Once more, then, the racial theory collapses.]"
"Thus the systematic savagery of the Inquisition under Philip, for which"
"the people at first blamed not at all the king but his Flemish minister,"
"Cardinal Granvelle, served rather to make a basis and pretext for"
organised revolt than directly to kindle it. In so far as the people
"spontaneously resorted to violence, in the image-breaking riots, they"
compromised and imperilled the nationalist movement in the act of
"precipitating it. The king's personal equation, finally, served to make"
"an enemy of the masterly William of Orange, who, financially embarrassed"
"like the lesser nobility,[777] could have been retained as an"
administrator by a wise monarch. A matter so overlaid with historical
declamation is hard to set in a clear light; but it may serve to say of
"William that he was made a ""patriot,"" as was Robert the Bruce, by stress"
of circumstances;[778] and that in the one case as in the other it was
exceptional character and capacity that made patriotism a success;[779]
William in particular having to maintain himself against continual
"domestic enmity, patrician as well as popular. Nothing short of the"
"ferocity and rapacity of the Spanish attack, indeed, could have long"
united the Netherlands. The first confederacy dissolved at the approach
"of Alva, who, strong in soldiership but incapable of a statesmanlike"
"settlement, drove the Dutch provinces to extremities by his cruelty,"
caused a hundred thousand artisans and traders to fly with their
Since then there is good reason to believe that this was in effect the
"secret teaching of the mysteries, it would naturally be expected that"
human marriage should have been reckoned as it were a foretaste of
"that union with the divine which was promised hereafter, and also that"
death should have been counted the hour of its approaching fulfilment;
"in other words, if my view of the mysteries is correct, it would"
almost inevitably follow that the mysteries should have been brought
into close association both with weddings and with funerals. This
expectation is confirmed by the facts.
An ordinary wedding was treated as something akin to initiation into
"the mysteries. An inscription of Cos[1485], relating to the appointment"
"of priestesses of Demeter, mentions among other duties certain services"
"on the occasion of weddings; and the brides, who are the recipients"
"of these services, are divided into two classes, αἱ τελεύμεναι and αἱ"
"ἐπινυμφευόμεναι, the maidens who, are being ‘initiated,’ and the widows"
who are being married again; a woman’s first marriage in fact is called
"by a religious document her initiation, and Demeter’s priestesses"
are charged therewith. Nor was this usage or idea confined to Cos;
Plutarch speaks of services rendered by the priestess of Demeter in
the solemnisation of matrimony as part of an ‘ancestral rite[1486]’;
while the term τέλος was commonly used both of the mystic rites and of
"marriage, and τέλειοι might denote the newly-wed[1487]."
The same thought seems also to have inspired another custom
"associated with marriage. The newly-wed, we hear, sometimes attended"
"a representation of the marriage of Zeus and Hera[1488], an ἱερὸς"
γάμος which formed the subject of mystic drama or legend all over
Greece[1489]. The widely extended cults of Hera under the titles of
Maiden (παρθένος or παῖς) and of Bride (τελεία or νυμφευομένη) appear
to have been closely interwoven; indeed for a full appreciation of the
"If Grey Dumaresq was a man who craved a variety of experiences, and"
"wished to see life under different aspects, he was getting his wish now;"
"for the gay world of fashion, into which he suddenly found himself"
"plunged, differed _in toto_ from any of his former experiences; and so"
"swift was the pace, and so shifting the throng amid which he moved, that"
"he often felt as though his breath were fairly taken away, and as though"
he had suddenly stepped into a new existence.
Lord Sandford had chanced upon the young baronet at a moment when a
blank had been made in his own life by the sudden and violent death of
"one who had been his boon companion and friend.  The gay young man, who"
"had fallen in a foolish duel a few weeks before, had been the inmate of"
"his house and the companion in all his freaks and follies; so much so,"
that without him the young nobleman felt for the moment bewildered and
"lost, and had absented himself from town with a view to ""getting over"
"it,"" as he hoped: for he despised himself for any sign of weakness, and"
would not for worlds have had his comrades and boon companions know how
the loss had affected him.
"Then, as it seemed just by a lucky chance, this young and attractive man"
"had fallen as from the very skies at his feet.  Grey Dumaresq, new to"
"the world of London, curious and speculative, willing to see all, learn"
"all, participate in all, seemed exactly the person to fill the gap in"
"his life.  Grey had no place of abode; why, then, should he not occupy"
the vacant chambers in the wing of the great mansion in the Strand which
"Lord Sandford used as his customary lodging, when he was not spending"
"his time with friends, or making one of a gay party elsewhere?  Grey had"
no valid reason for declining the invitation pressed upon him. Lord
"Sandford was a masterful man, and his strong personality impressed"
"itself upon Grey with something between attraction and repulsion.  But,"
"on the whole, attraction seemed the stronger power, and curiosity to"
and discussing mild platitudes in the most languidly amiable manner
"imaginable, enjoying to the full the mental confusion and discomfort of"
"his guests,--confusion and discomfort which, as he very well knew, was"
the psychological result of their having one in their midst whose life
"and character were totally opposite to, and distinctly separate from,"
"their own. As Emerson truly says, ""Let the world beware when a Thinker"
"comes into it!"".. and here WAS this Thinker,--this type of the Godlike"
"in Man,--this uncomfortably sincere personage, whose eyes were clear of"
"falsehood, whose genius was incontestable, whose fame had taken society"
"by assault, and who, therefore, was entitled to receive every attention"
and consideration.
"Everybody had desired to see him, and here he was,--the great man, the"
"new ""celebrity""--and now that he was actually present, no one knew what"
"to say to him; moreover, there was a very general tendency in the"
company to avoid his direct gaze. People fidgeted on their chairs and
"looked aside or downward, whenever his glance accidentally fell on"
"them,--and to the analytical Voltairean mind of M. le Duc there was"
something grimly humorous in the whole situation. He was a great
"admirer of physical strength and beauty, and Alwyn's noble face and"
"fine figure had won his respect, though of the genius of the poet he"
"knew nothing, and cared less. It was enough for all the purposes of"
"social usage that the author of ""Nourhalma"" was CONSIDERED"
"illustrious,--no matter whether he deserved the appellation or not. And"
"so the Duke, satirically amused at the obvious embarrassment of the"
"other ""notabilities"" assembled, did nothing whatsoever to relieve or to"
"lighten the conversation, which remained so utterly dull and inane that"
"Alwyn, who had been compelled, for politeness' sake, to appear"
interested in the account of a bicycle race detailed to him by a very
"masculine looking lady-doctor whose seat at table was next his own,"
"began to feel a little weary, and to wonder dismally how long this"
"""feast of reason and flow of soul"" was going to last."
legends and of mysteries founded thereon; its settings and its
"harmonies may be different, but the essential melody is the same. At"
"Eleusis Demeter’s daughter was the representative of mankind, for she"
went down to the house of Hades as is the lot of men. But Crete had
another legend wherein Demeter was the representative deity with whom
mankind might hope for union. Was it not told how Iasion even in this
life found such favour in the goddess’ eyes that she was ‘wed with
him in sweet love mid the fresh-turned furrows of the fat land of
Crete[1452]’? And happiness such as was granted to him here was laid
up for all the initiated hereafter; else would there be no meaning in
"those lines, ‘Blessed, methinks, is the lot of him that sleeps, and"
"tosses not, nor turns, even Endymion; and, dearest maiden, blessed I"
"call Iasion, whom such things befell, as ye that be profane shall never"
come to know[1453].’ Surely that which is withheld from the profane is
"by implication reserved to the sanctified, and to them it is promised"
that they shall know by their own experience hereafter the bliss which
"Iasion even here obtained. It was, I think, in this spirit and this"
belief that the Athenians in old time called their dead Δημητρεῖοι
‘Demeter’s folk[1454]’; for the popular belief in the condescension
"of the Mistress, great and reverend goddess though she was, was so"
"firmly rooted, it would seem, that even to this day the folk-stories,"
"as we have seen, still tell how the ‘Mistress of the earth and of the"
"sea,’ she whom men still call Despoina and reverence for her love"
"of righteousness and for her stern punishment of iniquity, has yet"
"admitted brave heroes to her embrace in the mountain-cavern where, as"
"of old in Arcady, she still dwells[1455]."
Nor did the cults of Demeter and Kore monopolise these hopes and
"beliefs. In the religious drama of Aphrodite and Adonis, in the"
"Sabazian mysteries, in the holiest rites of Dionysus, in the wild"
"worship of Cybele, the same thought seems ever to recur. It matters"
little whether these gods and their rites were foreign or Hellenic in
"the inventors of the legend of Icarus onwards, men have firmly cherished"
"the belief that under some circumstances they could fly, and we may well"
"suppose that that belief partly owes its conviction, and the resolve to"
"make it practical, to the experiences that have been gained in dreams."
"No dreams, indeed, are so vivid and so convincing as dreams of flying;"
none leave behind them so strong a sense of the reality of the experience.
"Raffaelli, the eminent French painter, who is subject to the dreaming"
"experience of floating in the air, confesses that it is so convincing that"
he has jumped out of bed on awaking and attempted to repeat it. 'I need
"not tell you,' he adds, 'that I have never been able to succeed.'[102]"
"Herbert Spencer mentions that in a company of a dozen persons, three"
testified that in early life they had had such vivid dreams of flying
"downstairs, and were so strongly impressed by the reality of the"
"experience, that they actually made the attempt, one of them suffering in"
consequence from an injured ankle.[103] The case is recorded of an old
French lady who always maintained that on one occasion she actually had
succeeded for a few instants in supporting herself on the air.[104] No
one who is familiar with these dreaming experiences will be inclined to
"laugh at that old lady. It was during one of these dreams of levitation,"
"in which one finds oneself leaping into the air and able to stay there,"
"that it occurred to me that I would write a paper on the subject, for"
I thought in my dream that this power I found myself possessed of was
"probably much more widespread than was commonly supposed, and that in any"
case it ought to be generally known.
People who dabble in the occult have been so impressed by such dreams
that they have sometimes believed that these flights represented a
real excursion of the 'astral body.' This is the belief of Colonel de
"Rochas.[105] César de Vesme, the editor of the French edition of the"
"_Annals of Psychical Research_, has thought it worth while to investigate"
the matter; and after summarising the results of a _questionnaire_
opposed on speculative questions to carry on an intercourse concerning
"their pursuits which shall be both friendly and unconstrained, as for"
two political opponents to discuss vital questions of policy without
"any undercurrent of self-restraint, when they start from entirely"
opposite principles. Most likely had the two been actually
"contemporaries it might not have been so easy, but as it was, the"
"younger man started with, and preserved, the warmest feelings to his"
senior; and even in his criticisms he expresses himself in the
strongest terms of gratitude: 'He (Hamilton) has taught those who study
"him to _think_, and he must take the consequences, whether they think"
"in unison with himself or not. We conceive, however, that even those"
"who differ from him most, would readily own that to his instructive"
disquisitions they were indebted for at least half of all they know of
"philosophy.' And in the appendix to the _Institutes_, written soon"
"after Sir William's death, Ferrier says: 'Morally and intellectually,"
Sir William Hamilton was among the greatest of the great. A simpler and
a grander nature never arose out of darkness into human life; a truer
and a manlier character God never made. For years together scarcely a
"day passed in which I was not in his company for hours, and never on"
this earth may I expect to live such happy hours again. I have learned
"more from him than from all other philosophers put together; more, both"
as regards what I assented to and what I dissented from.' It was this
open and free discussion of all questions that came before
them--discussion in which there must have been much difference of
"opinion freely expressed on both sides, that made these evenings spent"
"in Manor Place, where the Hamiltons, then a recently married couple,"
"had lately settled, so delightful to young Ferrier. He had"
individuality and originality enough not to be carried away by the
arguments used by so great an authority and so learned a man as his
"friend was reckoned, and then as later he constantly expressed his"
regret that powers so great had been devoted to the service of a
philosophic system--that of Reid--of which Ferrier so thoroughly
"constitutional but an absolute and hereditary monarchy (1660),"
enthroning divine right at the same instant in Denmark and Norway as in
"England. Thereafter, deprived of their old posts and subjected to"
"ruinous taxes, the nobility fell rapidly into poverty;[693] and the"
"merchant class, equally overtaxed, withdrew their capital; the peasantry"
all the while remaining in a state of serfdom.[694] Then came a new
"series of wars with Sweden, recurring through generations, arresting, it"
"is said, literature, law, philosophy, and medicine,[695] but not the"
"natural sciences, then so much in evidence elsewhere: Tycho Brahe being"
"followed in astronomy by Horrebow, while chemistry, mathematics, and"
even anatomy made progress. But to this period belongs the brilliant
"dramatist and historian Holberg, the first great man of letters in"
modern Scandinavia (d. 1754); and in the latter half of the eighteenth
century the two years of ascendency of the freethinking physician
Struensee as queen's favourite (1770-72) served partially to emancipate
"the peasants, establish religious toleration, abolish torture, and"
reform the administration. Nor did his speedy overthrow and execution
"wholly undo his main work,[696] which outdid that of many generations of"
"the old régime. Still, the history of his rise and fall, his vehement"
"speed of reconstruction and the ruinous resistance it set up, is one of"
the most dramatic of the many warnings of history against thinking
suddenly to elevate a nation by reforms imposed wholly from
without.[697]
"Thenceforward, with such fluctuations as mark all culture-history, the"
Scandinavian world has progressed mentally nearly step for step with
"the rest of Europe, producing scholars, historians, men of science,"
"artists, and imaginative writers in more than due proportion. Many names"
which stand for solid achievement in the little-read Scandinavian
"tongues are unknown save to specialists elsewhere; but those of Holberg,"
"Linnæus, Malte-Brun, Rask, Niebuhr, Madvig, Oehlenschläger,"
"Thorwaldsen, and Swedenborg tell of a comprehensive influence on the"
bone--which are devoutly kissed and adored by thousands of pilgrims
to this magnificent church from all the French and Irish portions of
"Canada, and which are said to have wrought miraculous cures of all"
"manner of maladies, cures which are attested by two immense stacks"
"of canes, crutches, wooden legs, and the like, which rise from the"
floor almost to the roof on either side of the entrance. In the store
in another part of the church I had got a clue to it all by seeing
"the poor pilgrims buying all sorts of cheap, tawdry, worthless little"
"images and pictures, and especially little vials of oil of remarkable"
curative virtue because it had stood for a while before the image of
"St. Anne, and for which they paid probably five times as much as the"
oil had cost the priests who were selling it.
[Sidenote: The Iron Crown of Lombardy.]
"These, then, are potent bones and images and oils, but by far the"
most interesting relic I had seen before reaching Rome itself was the
"Iron Crown of Lombardy, at Monza, a little town in Northern Italy."
This is the place where the good King Humbert was assassinated on the
"29th of July, 1900, and it is not without interest for other reasons."
"For instance, it has a cathedral built of black and white marble"
"in horizontal stripes, and containing, besides the tomb of Queen"
"Theodolinda and other interesting objects in the nave and its chapels,"
"a great number of costly articles of gold and silver, set with precious"
"stones, in the treasury, as well as various relics, such as some of the"
"baskets carried by the apostles, a piece of the Virgin Mary's veil,"
and one of John the Baptist's teeth. But we should never have made a
special trip to Monza in such weather as we were having at the time of
"our visit, last November, had it not been for our intense desire to see"
"its chief treasure, the Iron Crown, the most sacred and most celebrated"
"diadem in the world, a relic possessing real historical interest, not"
"because of any probability whatever in the story of its origin, but"
Did I have spare clothes?
I'm back.
Rin will play lacrosse!
But she's not a student.
It's impossible.
She applied for permission.
Can we order now?
please.
Rin will be fine!
She'II play lacrosse.
hello!
It's not working because you're bending your elbow.
"Rin, show us."
Let your force flow forward.
Teacher.
Manager.
Minmin.
Raw power won't do it.
"blend the power of the ball into your power, Iet them flow!"
Wow!
Saw that?
Why are you here?
It's quite an interesting sport.
"Hey, Minmin."
relax!
"With me, you don't have to practice martial arts."
Now I want to play!
Who's he?
Does it matter?
How's my lipstick?
Perfect!
Let him apply for the coach post.
"""Redress,"" that's the sort of word."
And a lot of other words.
- Men have been here for years.
- Why don't they leave?
Leave?
Get caught and flogged like him?
- I won't join a mutiny.
- It's not a mutiny.
- And you're gonna prove it.
- You're taking the oath.
What are they doing there?
- What's this gathering?
- Just making rope.
With these louts lying on it?
Move!
Let's move it!
Don't quit!
Get moving!
Watch out or next time you'll get it.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
- Yours?
"- I pulled on the rope, tripped him."
"Don't have any more accidents, Vizard."
Or I'll have a look at your backbone.
Boatswain?
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
"Vizard, I will join."
Good lad.
You'll be flogged for this.
Sergeant!
This is Park Chun-bae.
He owns this house.
"He killed his wife, too?"
It appears so.
What's that bastard's name?
Park Chun-bae.
Then what?
"What do you mean, what?"
Gotta get rid of it.
"Either banish it, or kill it."
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow at the hour of the dog.
"Yes, sir."
You got the money?
How much?
"About 10 grand, don't you think?"
I'll have it ready.
Good.
Listen.
What I'm doing tomorrow- it's no ordinary ritual.
I'll be casting a death hex.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So you can't do anything that would taint it.
No intercourse.
Watch what you eat and drink.
Or the spell will backfire.
"Yes, sir."
Okay then.
You can go.
Can I ask you something?
What?
That Japanese guy.
You said he's a ghost.
Bless you.
Don't be afraid.
He's a friend.
I need you to take them to the treehouse.
But he's a savage!
"Far from it, madam."
He's my best friend and he's your salvation.
And where are you going?
I've got to find a way onto that boat.
You'll be fine.
"Come on and get this boat out to sea, you lazy lot!"
"All right, all right!"
You'll be kissing the daughter before too long!
We're off to sea while the tide's still with us!
"One, two, heave!"
"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
- We've all had our fill of jacob moore.
- I know.
So I'm ceasing this ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below!
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Hub sheets!
Hands to the jeers!
- Stow the prisoners!
"- Aye-aye, sir!"
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?
This guy didn't want to give you the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order
Sonny.
like I'm a deadbeat.
You're a mutt.
You know the money we spend in this fucking
Don't be like that.
Like what?
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
too.
You're a funny guy.
Henry!
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.
000.
You really are a funny guy.
I'm worried.
I'm hearing bad things.
No.
Old things.
Clothing.
"Hey, he's at the salvation army."
"Nah, they don't got stagecoaches at the salvation army."
"They don't got gold, neither."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
We had one of them nothing school trips.
To the museum.
"Yeah, they got a pile of gold."
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.
We've got to go there.
"Come on, it's over here."
[kids grunting]
[indistinct chatter]
[tires screech]
"Now, Tony."
We're going to create a little diversion.
The stagecoach.
I want you to roll it all around the museum.
[woman gasps] [woman] look out.
[man] watch it.
"[man] watch out for that thing, it's coming this way."
"Hey, where are the horses?"
I...
Don't know.
Now cause total chaos.
[man] watch out.
[yelps]
Short circuit the control system.
[control system buzzes]
Yes.
Has this ever happened before?
No.
You've answered your own question.
But what if this 'Happily ever after'... becomes 'Happy never after' after some time?
You are right.
And you have a great track record too.
What if you get bored?
You are no Ms. Virtuous either.
Correct.
"Okay so the issue is, how do we trust each other?"
"So the issue is, is this feeling enough?"
- No..
- Then..
"The issue is, do we get this feeling with someone else or not."
Oh...
It's like a buffet out here.
So find some new fancy dish for yourself..
..and I'll find someone for myself.
And we'll know.
Hold on.
"Ideal bachelor, great catch."
- What are you doing?
This is too risky.
- Please.
Shiv.
Hi..
I'm leaving.
The things I've to do for her.
Just watch.
Same here.
That was a big mistake.
- It's all that matters.
- It's never all.
It can exist in a happy ship.
"The ideal is always possible, sir."
If the men cooperate.
I'm sure they will.
I'll give you a toast!
To Defiant.
An efficient and happy ship.
An efficient ship.
And death to the French.
Depends on your gun drill.
"Mr. D'Arblay, get them into position!"
Jumping about like jackrabbits!
Fire!
Get back!
"- Oh, sir, I never meant to..."
- Sergeant!
Put this man under arrest.
For making to strike an officer.
You'll be flogged for this.
Six dozen lashes.
"Wheatley, you're under arrest."
- You made to strike an officer?
"- No, sir."
I wouldn't have.
- I've learned that much.
- But you did put up your fists?
"Well, answer me!"
"An impulse, instantly regretted."
- What was that?
"- An impulse, sir."
"I mean, what the hell do they want with us?"
They wanna kill us.
Make sure you don't cancel the broadcasts.
Grab that.
Let's go.
Here.
"That's all the information from the laptop, in case..."
"I don't know, in case we don't get out of here."
Drink that.
"""Of course we'll get out of here, Katherine."
"Don't you worry about a thing."""
You ever get used to it?
Used to what?
Bodies.
Dead people.
Seeing them.
No.
They never seem to stay dead.
How's it going over there?
"There's stuff on here, but it's password protected."
"I know, but can you open it?"
I don't know.
I'm trying.
How do we know all this mayhem hasn't already happened?
We don't.
Good.
Just keep working.
Fuck.
Can you just talk to me?
"Yeah, what do you wanna talk about?"
Anything.
Just regular stuff.
- Good!
Why isn't the sign up?
Hi everyone.
"Well, at least it's finished."
When do I get the money?
When this thing is up.
Tell me Nora.
Wouldn't you rather work over there with us...
Instead of wasting your time over here.
Oh no!
We're wasting our time.
What's going to happen to us.
We won't survive!
He's got a screw loose!
"By the way, does your brother have the money?"
"Yes, he has the money."
You can pick it up right now.
Finally some good news!
"Great, right?"
Maybe something will actually come out of your hotel.
Although I would fire the bellman.
He's got a screw loose.
Tom?
Tom is the way he is.
"But you Toni, how are you?"
I don't have a screw loose.
I'm an entrepreneur.
But I shouldn't say that too loud.
And what else are you?
The sign goes up tonight.
It's taken long enough.
"Hi there, I heard you have my money."
Whatever.
We're probably gonna get arrested.
What do you want me to put?
Like how I said it.
"""I'll poop in your butt hole... and then you will poop it back... into my butt... and we will keep doing it""-"
- Back-
- Back-
- And forth-
- And forth-
With the same poop.
Same poop.
Forever.
"Wow, look at these beds!"
You don't have to make the beds.
I'll make 'em when I get home from work.
Where'd you learn to make corners like that?
It's just the way we like it.
Really?
"I thought you preferred the rumpled, unkempt look."
- We like it this way now.
- Yeah.
"At Mom's house, we have a chore wheel."
- What?
- Nothing.
A chore wheel.
"You put chores on it, and then you can spin it."
There's this metal thing... and it helps it to spin.
It's spinning from the metal.
Okay.
"Well- So, it's just a half shift."
"I'll be back in four hours, and we'll go do something fun, okay?"
Okay.
"Yeah, we are all fine."
Can?
"No, that's not what I meant."
I was going to go to the army recruiting center... a German photographer was studying my art.
Are you a faggot?
Did you apply foran exemption?
Would you like coffee?
I want to take you to Germany.
What would I do there?
You'll stay with me.
My house big.
I'll do everything for you.
The military won't let go of me.
What kind of photos do they want?
Holy shit.
Disgusting.
They must really enjoy this.
"Sukran, could you make tea for us?"
I really don't like what I'm hearing.
You guys will drive me crazy.
"Between my mom, the cops and no job."
We haven't even paid the rent.
Why?
It's been paid.
How?
Here.
Did you pay it?
Don't I live here?
How many times have I told you?
Enough!
I support this house.
I am not a sponger.
- Course west-sou'west.
- West-sou'west!
- Lookout!
- Sail on the starboard quarter!
Sail?
Where?
I see only ships in anchor.
"Deck, there!"
Sail is an enemy frigate!
And another!
The French are out!
The French!
"Weigh anchor, beat to quarters."
The French are on the move.
Make to all ships.
Prepare to engage.
- They used the fog too.
- They're heading for our squadron.
Look.
That red glow.
"A fire ship, set on course in the breeze."
- She'll take the flagship!
- They can't move in time.
- Nor the others.
- They're going to burn!
"Vizard, I'm striking no bargains, and making no promises."
This ship is in your hands.
"There's nothing to stop you from running, but the enemy is there."
- All hands muster aft!
"- Lively, there!"
Sir.
"Well, lads, you see what's happening."
Come.
Arrangements for the night is done
Which is your room?
Situation is somewhat like this.
There's only one room
And we spend the night in the same room?
You presume somewhat like that?
How compelling!
- Not quite so compelling
I'm not staying here one minute.
- You take the bed.
I'll take the sofa
No problems.
- No way.
I'm leaving
I'm not joking.
I'm going away.
- And I'll have the bed all to myself?
So nice... so romantic!
And these curtains... so nice!
And the view!
No horses?
It's so warm in here
There!
You have a fire going
Granted.
You have a great sense of choice
"You couldn't find a better place to spend the night, right?"
We were getting a nice room
But you'd rather spend the night with me in the stables.
Not in the room
Eat
You've had your wishes.
"Now, it's my turn."
And now I'll know when they're coming for me.
"And if I can see them,"
I can kill them.
I bet you didn't see that coming.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I had to use the Tesla.
He's dead.
You killed him.
"- Pete, what's going on?"
- Change of plans.
"What do you think, I'm an idiot?"
Don't answer that.
"Look, just stop, okay?"
Just put down the gun and let's think this through.
- I'm still taking the artifact.
- I can't let you do that.
"Die trying to stop me, Alice."
"Oh, clever boy."
What tipped you?
The real Myka... would never kiss me.
Never!
Not if her life depended on it.
- Which is...
- A shame.
You're a good kisser.
- So Artie hasn't figured this out yet.
"- Well, not yet."
"But when he does, he'll set the real Myka free, and you will... poof... disappear."
"It doesn't work that way, Pete."
What?
- Don't you dare.
- What would you have me do?
- What would you do?
- Not this!
That's not an answer.
That doesn't help me.
I cannot let this fail.
It just has.
You're wrong.
"You've got what you wanted, so you can stop now."
It's OK.
"It's all right, you're all right."
You returned what you stole.
Your sentence is commuted.
Justice and mercy.
This is our law.
"You know, we're totally confident."
I've looked closely at the vaccine research and it's impeccable.
There's nothing at all to worry about.
And I'd like to thank you for your courage.
We're not the only ones.
There are survivors everywhere.
"People live, you know?"
The thought of Davy being alone.
That finishes me.
The rest...
It's a good life.
Thanks.
We'll bring the car back.
"Looking for her son Peter, 12 today."
There's an estate called Waterhouse.
It's displaying that he is just in the car in front of yours.
"Varun, what are you doing?"
- Leave me!
I'll kill her!
Listen.
- Hey!
Don't do anything silly.
Don't move.
Everything will go in vain if you go there now.
We can't prove anything with what we have found out so far.
Have some patience.
She has a new scapegoat.
All we have to do is to catch her red-handed.
At least we have to know what they are talking
Or do you want to sit here and issue parking tickets?
Let's do that also.
Give me the Bluetooth earpiece.
Why?
"- I'll tell you, give it to me."
Wait here.
Where...
Juice will do?
Hello.
"- Yes, Sadhana."
Don't talk.
Stay on line.
"Had you not been here, I would have helpless."
How will I ever repay you Vikram?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- Hey.
Why are you so formal?
"I fall because of that girl, my heat has become candle."
One chance.
Only one chance.
Stand up.
And remember.
Forget about the girl and concentrate on the career.
I give you one more chance.
But keep in mind.
If your bullet would miss him.
Then my bullet will kiss you.
"This time i will shoot on throat, forget it!"
Shoot the rascal.
I am not even married yet.
Next week girl's parents are coming to see me.
Please let me go... i will free you first you free me.
On one condition.
Your every condition is accepted.
I will not kill him.
You will kill him.
No.
"No... don't do this... i have never even killed the bee, how can i kill a man?"
Teach him to kill bee.
You guys look very intelligent.
"Please let me go Sir,"
kill.
"Sir, what?"
Bee.
Bee?
Gently!
Its female.
Female?
Should not hurt.
"Yeah, I know."
He's in the city on important business.
- He'll be back soon.
- Uh-huh.
That's what you think.
Everybody says he quit us for something better.
- That's a lie.
- What did he hang it on a limb for?
He didn't run out on us.
I'll beat up any guy that says he did.
"Well, I was only telling you what everybody's saying."
What's the matter?
Don't you like it?
Stinks.
"What's the difference, if it's a nice room?"
"Besides, you're only gonna be here a little while."
- Get down to that hospital.
Go ahead.
- I'll keep calling you.
Get that mug anything.
I don't want him to die on me.
What's the matter?
Just when I get everything set up at school.
I have to knock off that gorilla.
Don't tell me you're worrying about that joint?
Yeah.
Go on.
Get down to the hospital.
- Go ahead.
Beat it.
Go ahead.
"- Okay, okay."
I would have run away long time back.
To Mauritius...
to white sands... to blue skies...
You are young you will get many chances.
Brother.
Stop for a minute...
You are with me because this is your first night.
From tomorrow you are on your own.
Be tough!
Don't be scared!
Do we wait here?
I'll go first.
How much money should I ask for?
"2,000 rupees don't settle for less."
Drink up!
"Go on, have another swig."
It eases the pain!
Move aside.
Time to get to work!
Looking for fun?
- Yes!
How much will you pay?
- Let's bargain on the way.
There is one!
Standing all by himself!
Back up.
I am tired of whores around here let's try the pretty boys for size!
Three of you?
"Why, you gonna cook for us tonight?"
All three of you will have to pay!
"Sure, but let us see the goods first."
"Go on, he is calling you!"
There may be some tools we can use.
"Okay, I'll try to reach it."
"There'll be a phone line as well, I heard the main house."
"Probably a burglar alarm too, so we need to... we need to get the police here if we can Okay, how're you doing?"
You okay?
"Better than you, babe."
I'll be okay.
I'll be okay.
You think Chris could have sent the postcard?
I don't know.
Maybe.
"But really, I-I-I don't know."
"Can I count on you, Luke?"
Of course.
Might get a little hairy.
I don't want you getting any ideas.
Absolutely not.
I just wanna get through this.
We all do.
Good man.
Luke.
"None of us sent the card, Justin."
Seriously... this hasn't gone too far.
"You can just set us free, walk away."
No one will talk.
You have my word.
Here's the deal...
Someone owns up to sending the postcard
- I let you all go.
- And if no one owns up?
"- Well then, we play Truth or Dare."
"- You're full of shit, man."
"I was shocked too, though."
We're very sorry.
Not at all.
No problem.
So why my computer?
There's this...
This what?
"Amazing stuff, ...you've got here!"
He's sucking up.
Dead right.
Top of the line.
Must be expensive?
"To buy, yes."
But I rent.
"Not including the special stuff, it's about a million a year."
A million!
I invented some stuff in high school.
"Royalties from that... and these games, ...bring in quite a lot."
Know this?
Did you make
The Last Legend?
Just the basic program.
That and Craps and Rappies...
Are they well-known?
Don't you know?
So what are you researching now?
Tempo-spatial applications of gravitational physics.
Or put simply...
Don't laugh.
A time machine.
There's already a way to leap to the future.
Liquid nitrogen.
No!
You gave me your word!
Come on!
There might be more of those bastards inside.
"No, you mustn't go out there."
They'll kill you.
Stay here!
They're going to kill you!
Leave her.
"She doesn't need a priest, she needs an executioner."
Or are you trying to tell me that you hope these bandits will go to heaven?
- Be careful.
- I will be.
Don't worry.
Come on.
Get them all out of there.
- I hoped they'd catch Carrasco too.
- We were told he wasn't among them.
Too bad.
"But if they've got any captives, we'll make them talk."
"We've got the whole gang, Coronel."
- Let me speak to your commander.
- Be quiet.
- You lied to me.
You gave me your word.
- What's all this shouting about?
They were in that hospital over there.
- There.
- Have they been identified?
- Some.
- The corpses must be burnt.
"- You're Padre Julio, aren't you?"
But we're still gonna have to have DMV retest her.
For me.
"Hello, Henry."
That's a boy.
That's a boy.
"See, Daddy?"
Daddy?
Henry.
"You know, I wonder if some kids might have picked up that baby food."
"Maybe, but the way those boxes were bouncing out of that truck they could have gone anywhere."
"Oh, no."
There's that couple.
Remember that couple yesterday with the flat tire?
Of course.
Scavengers.
That's it!
They must have hung around.
I think we're getting senile.
Not me.
"Oh, what happened?"
What did you do now?
- We know where the baby food is.
- Where?
- A gypsy van.
- A school bus.
"- Hey, slow down now."
- Scavengers.
"Slow down, slow down."
Hold it.
"Now, tell me about it."
"After we cited the baby-food truck about half a mile further, we saw a school bus..."
"Converted school bus, gypsy van, loaded like you can't believe."
You know we wanted to be pregnant by now.
I can't take that kind of time off work right now.
"Besides, we need my income."
That's not an issue.
Come on.
I don't know if I'm ready.
What if we lose us?
Jess.
You will never lose me.
So what was it like in prison?
It's actually not so cracked out to be.
"If you could start your life over, what would you do different?"
Be someone else.
"That's sad, Roman."
Anyone can change.
"Change is a choice, you know?"
Change is a choice?
Where'd you read that?
Just made it up.
So when will I see you again?
Hard to say.
You're not going to do anything stupid are you?
"See, right there!"
That's what it's like being me!
Everyone always thinks I'm up to something.
I wonder why.
You're sexy when you work.
Norman.
"Right, hang on."
Lucky coin.
Damn it.
"You know, no one ever died from taking a day off."
"By the end of this, one out of four people in this country will know who you are."
The monkey too.
How does that sound?
What's that going to get me?
That would be great for you!
There's no file.
What do you mean there is no file?
There never was a file.
Then make a file.
"Sure, then tell me where to start."
I will.
Now.
Soon.
Stamps?
- Stamps?
What should I do with those?
I don't write letters.
I don't have anything else.
"I know, I know."
How long can you get by with this here?
"Franz, are you still there?"
Yes!
How long can you get by with this here?
I won't be here for a while you know.
Where will you be?
"Yeah, up north in Scandinavia."
Scandinavia?
That should be nice.
That's what I'm saying.
You have to make sure that you and your comrades here are taken care of.
I gave that poetry book of yours to Roswitha for her birthday.
She was quite delighted.
- Not one stinking customer.
"We had some really great times living at the old Newman Home, until we got pro contracts and our mom made us move back in with her."
Here's the thing.
"We've got a plan to save our home, but we need a sponsor."
And who better than three glorious hockey heroes from Charlestown's past?
- Good idea.
- Smart kid.
Who were you thinking of?
You guys.
- You'd sponsor us?
- I don't know.
Hockey's pretty violent.
We gave that up with the bar fights and the gambling.
Not our path.
"Look, it'd be great advertising."
"We'll be travelling all over the state, playing a new style of hockey."
Just think.
Zenovation on ice.
"Come on get it, boys."
Here you are.
Look at the pads!
- Here we go.
- All right.
You get one of these.
"There you go, guys."
There you go.
Goalie!
Goalie!
Good save.
Nice catch.
"Hey, my name isn't goalie, you know."
It's Henri.
I need to know what happened.
"So... there's no party and it's just us, and what, this is some sort of set up?"
You're his friends.
I thought you might be able to help.
"- Come on, Paul."
We're going.
- I can't drive.
I'm pissed.
There was a party at the end of the summer term.
I think something might have happened there.
"He topped himself, mate."
It's sad but it happens.
I don't see what we can do about it.
And you shouldn't have got us to come here under false pretenses.
That's just out of order.
This was in his pocket.
Did any of you send it?
This is the key.
This is what drove him to it.
"""Truth or Dare, bitch!"""
What does this mean?
"I mean, you're his friends, you must have some idea."
I've heard enough of this.
I'm leaving.
Who's coming?
- But we can't take the cars.
"- Yeah, well, we can take our chances."
"I'm not finish yet, Chris."
"Well, I am."
Step aside.
I can't do that.
"- Oh, my God!"
They're getting very close.
Blake!
How did you get back so soon?
Get ready to leave.
There's a ship coming up on you fast.
You've got about three minutes.
"We have the neutrotope now, nothing else matters."
- I'll get the others.
- I'll be back in a minute.
He's cutting it too fine.
"Come on Blake, get out of there."
"No, no I won't!"
- She must be taken back for trial.
- Agreed.
I won't go!
- Everything set?
"- Yes, ready."
Bring us across Vila.
They're locked on.
[EXPLOSION]
What was that?
I rigged a charge on the entry hatch.
"Right, I think we can get you all home now."
"Zen, set a course for Destiny, speed standard by six."
Confirmed.
Take us round the easy way this time.
Hello?
"You weren't at work today, were you, Elizabeth?"
Waiting for my call?
"Look, you've won"
I'm leaving Don't go
And entered your hot and wet vagina.
Your cherished sexy lips of ardent lust and desire.
And so flush in the springtime of your passion.
Can you feel my cock as your clitoris between your fingers?
"Every stroke of yours, it gets bigger and harder."
"Feel it, love, are you coming?"
"Respond, Rosella, tell me that you can feel it."
"Yes, I am sorry!"
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Slowly!
Gently!
I can't take any more.
No!
Come slowly too.
"Gently, slowly."
What dominating fingers you have!
It makes me crazy.
"Yes, like that, penetrate my yoni, please."
I love you deep iside.
"Take my bushy cunt, I beg you."
Don't stop.
More cock inside.
Stronger please.
Take it.
"Push it, we are getting there, forcefully."
"Yes, that's good."
We are coming together.
"Yes, that's it!"
"More, keep it going!"
"Squeeze my balls, my darling."
That feels so good!
"Well, call me Sister and I'll return it to you."
Yes or no?
- Give it to me!
- Call me Sister!
How can you bite me!
Let go!
"Xiamu,"
I have a question for you.
"You still remember, don't you?"
The last time you saw your mother face?
Good!
"You may cry, scream and hit me!"
You're not a dummy anymore!
I knew you are scared.
"Every night you scared, aren't you?"
But have you even thought about... if the way you are now is what people want to see?
"As of today,"
Sister will accompany you.
You cannot just stay in this house.
You have to try going out.
"To learn about this world again, to feel the sunshine, to feel the wind."
"To feel the crowd,"
to feel how people care about you!
When did you come?
You want to play?
Yes.
- Who is this kid?
- He is my private tutor student.
Superb!
Right?
Sort of.
He is quite good.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Maybe he's wrong.
- Wait a minute.
Let's see that.
- What do you think of that?
"- You know, you're in a hurry and..."
"Garnett, you're wanted on the telephone."
Just a minute.
I'll answer it for you.
It will only take about five minutes.
Let us have your pants.
- Hello.
"- Hello, John."
Will you hurry?
Tell him the minister is here.
Margaret's been ready for an hour.
We're all waiting for him.
"All right, I'll tell him."
- Who was it?
- It was the minister.
He said to take it easy.
He'll be about a half-hour late.
- Good.
"- You see, there's plenty of material."
- I'll take them down and have them fixed.
"- No, you don't."
"Pop, take them to Schmidt's and have them back in five minutes."
- You want two cuffs on them?
"- Yeah, one on each leg."
And hurry up.
Tell him I got to have them back right away.
"While we're waiting, we'll indulge in the famous indoor sport."
"I'm used to it, but you?"
Are you saying you don't want to see me?
I'm saying that I'm scared of losing you.
The people I love all end up turning their back on me.
I won't be able to bear it if you do.
I don't fucking care if the judge can't find me a new home.
I'll manage.
Where will you sleep?
Under a bridge or on a bench.
"Anyway, it's cool you called me."
You'll sleep on a bench.
Or in a squat.
But it's dodgy.
There are always problems.
Sleep at my place.
We'll find a solution tomorrow.
Your place?
Just for tonight.
And don't tell anyone.
I'm not supposed to put you up.
Can I finish my pizza or should we go now?
"Go ahead, finish it."
I'll go and pay.
Your bathroom's so clean.
Don't you ever wash?
Help me with the sheet.
What are those marks?
Nothing.
You live alone?
- Yes.
"- You don't have a girlfriend, a wife?"
- I'm divorced.
"Gentlemen, what do you think of your freedom now?"
"All right, my friend, if we've got to die, you've got to die, too."
"As long as I'm alive, you live."
- What did he say?
- He says he'll be unharmed.
"He says to keep order, be confident, and wait."
"Congratulations, Sergeant... on your knowledge of our humble language."
That's enough.
Get under the shade... before you get sunstroke.
Go on.
Get on back.
"Wounds feel satisfactory, sahib?"
I ain't had a more satisfactory set of welts since I ran away from home.
- Thank you.
- Fall in.
Come on.
- Get down.
Look out.
- Watch your head.
- The gold!
"- Yes, sahib, gold!"
"Look at it, mates!"
Gold!
That's what it is!
- Real solid sunshine!
"- Sit down, you fool!"
See that hand sticking out?
"I bet that little hand's worth £3,000 if it's worth a farthing!"
Who's a blinking idiot now?
"We're rich, mates."
Come on!
"All right, Mr. Wise Man, here's my last offer."
Definitely not.
Day after tomorrow is your engagement.
Go.
Get ready.
What are you talking?
Do you know how badly you cheated me?
The lies you told me.
Cheating?
Lying?
For this simple matter.
Is this a simple matter.
If you know what really happened...
What happened?
I said that I joined the job for you.
I didn't like it.
"So, I quit the job."
You got the information from some idiot.
You got hurt.
Is that all?
Not only that.
Didn't you call my love silly?
"If you keep shouting at me, anyone would say that."
You were no less.
I was after you to make you say I love you.
You said that at the time of our separation.
How would I feel?
Frustrated.
What are you staring at me?
You were trying to make me remember something.
You wanted to say something.
C'mon talk.
You said you don't remember your past.
You're right.
Did you read about the nuns?
The ones who were raped by missionaries in Africa.
The priests themselves!
It's horrible!
"If you can't trust a missionary, what's to become of us?"
- They used to rape the local women.
- Really?
"Because of AIDS, they started raping the nuns."
"Oh, my God!"
And I had the missionaries on a pedestal.
I'm sure not all of them are rapists.
- I hope not.
"- No, some are pedophiles."
- What's that?
- Everybody loves fucking...
"Shut up, Antonio."
You're such a brute.
- How do the bulls look?
"- Good, but heavy."
- What do you reckon?
"- Over 1,000 lbs."
Holy shit!
I'm going to our bar.
"Lydia, remember we're eating at home."
"If the kids don't see their aunt, there'll be hell to pay."
Good luck.
Bull's coming.
"Don't cry, love."
Hello.
How is she?
"Poor thing, very bad."
Play it.
- Will you have a cigarette?
"- No, thank you."
"- Will that be all, sir?"
"- Yes, that's all."
Thank you.
You do that again and I'll take you across my knee.
"Well, are you ready?"
Thanks.
"Well, thanks very much for lunching with me."
- I'll call for you in about an hour.
- Thank you too.
- I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
"- Oh, just a moment!"
- What do you want?
I'm in a hurry.
I wouldn't annoy Miss Lowman again if I were you.
What right have you to interfere?
Are you a relative?
- No.
"- Then I have just as much right... to speak to her as you have, old boy."
"Nevertheless, I'm warning you."
"If you interfere with her, you'll get into trouble."
"Oh, I see then."
You're one of these government fellows.
Clever aren't you?
"Well, just keep away from her."
We Woosters never get enmeshed in the official dragnet.
- No?
"- Oh, no."
Don't come any closer.
"Hauser, just hang on."
We're gonna get you off that thing.
"No, you're not."
Let me help you.
You need anything?
- Water?
- A cigarette.
You don't smoke.
I should never have quit.
- You don't need to be here.
"- Oh, I know."
Just can't see from up there.
"So what I told you on the phone, that help you catch him?"
Windward Elementary.
So I was right.
Yes.
And just this once I will apologize for doubting you.
Not just 'cause you're standing on a bomb.
About another minute down here.
Found the lyrics to that song.
"Last 1960s bomb, ""Twin Tree"" clue, you ever find the place?"
No.
Have you been looking for it this whole time?
I made a promise to a friend.
Gotta go grab something from my pack.
I'll be right back.
Madsen.
"When he tells you the bad news, just give it to me straight."
He modified it.
I'm gonna have to improvise.
Modified it how?
"The AST, the ALT..."
It's eight times over normal.
Yeah.
He was doing so well.
He said his last scan was clear.
I did a flawless job on that glioblastoma.
I can't help it if the damn thing had already spread.
The LFTs suggest metastasis to the liver.
God.
Never even got a chance to start the antiviral protocol.
I just wish I wouldn't have held out that hope.
He's gonna go fast.
"So, uh..."
Who's gonna tell him?
Oh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'll be back to check on you.
"Yeah, I know, I know..."
Low platelets.
I'm surprised it hasn't happened before.
When's the transfusion?
"Well, just say it."
Your LFTs were through the roof.
You're sure?
We'll do an abdominal sonogram just to be certain.
Cancer has spread to my liver.
Yes.
How long do you think I've got?
Not long.
- We'll make you as comfortable as possible.
"- No, no, no, no, no, no,"
- Do what?
You can't kill anyone.
What makes you think they'll let you?
They don't care about Lisa and Charlie now any more than we do.
It's all about Allie.
Then where are they?
We tried to pick up Lisa.
Lisa was helpless.
Allie can take care of herself.
Then what makes you think any of this will work?
I don't know if it's gonna work.
At least I'm not afraid to try.
"Mary, don't do this."
Listen to me.
I-I know this.
Walk away.
"Even if you lose the project, walk away... before you do something you can't walk away from."
MAN:
Here they come.
Why don't you just fade away?
You're a burden to the project.
"You don't have the stomach for it, and you don't have the brains."
You have no idea what I'm capable of?
What I've done?
I won't have any more blood on my hands.
Everybody set?
Get a tight lead on that subject.
Run away!
Take the little girl!
It's a trick!
Run!
It's a trick!
I won't have my decisions questioned.
Go below until I give you permission to come on deck.
Clear?
"Yes, sir."
Quite clear.
Mr. D'Arblay set the gallants.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Set the gallants!
A beating every day for a week.
- Why won't the captain do something?
- What can he do?
- You all right?
- Thank you.
"Come on, then."
We'll go down together.
Easy now.
Muster on the gun deck.
Move!
- These stripes are healing nicely.
"- They're still bloody painful, sir."
"His own son, eh?"
Can't the captain see what's going on?
"Hey, you, come here."
Sit down.
You said captain can't do anything.
What did that mean?
- I was guessing...
- What's it mean?
"If he went for Scott-Padget over this, there'd be a court-martial."
They'd prove he attacked an officer to protect his son.
That'd finish him.
"If Scott-Padget has influence, it'd be easily done."
Like this one here.
I can strap it on my upper thigh and fuck my love slave from behind.
I also really enjoy using the humbler.
Here's the slaves bum.
his upper thighs fit here.
It's worn in a kneeling position.
The scrotum goes in here.
You clamp it in.
and he's unable to stand up.
"He has to follow me on all fours and it pulls back hard on the scrotum, of course."
It's very unpleasant for him.
And I of course enjoy it.
Naturally.
A toast!
A toast!
Let's drink to our well-being!
A meter forward
A meter backward
A meter downward
A meter upward
And bottoms up
Prost.
Prost.
So you think life's shitty?
- It is.
- Just find some place nice.
I like the way things used to be.
What do you mean?
Down here you sense every little thing.
You can really taste the grapes.
It seems to me.
I think so too.
"What we doing, hut?"
!
I pulled you out of shit and so we thank!
He'd be here without me?
The stairwell to sell three grams of hashish!
Do not do that!
What You're pissing?
Talk.
"If come up with a plan, You'll earn more money."
They will not give my brothers just squeeze.
-Which brothers?
"Who's got a fat, your brothers or you?"
I...
That's right!
You've got guts!
You know the market.
We make millions!
Think!
Thanks for the shirt.
"It is still in a coma, but outside dition."
That's better.
But you should have just obiæi neighborhood and find out how much it is.
"I'm sorry it was, but I thought that crime police shoot so bad."
"Squat is closed, all in all good."
It is celebrated?
"Nothing, drink appetizer."
I'll tell you what we are celebrating.
Here I am in the lab.
They found 2 samples DNA on the bag and Cetin head.
When will the results?
Tomorrow.
I told you if you trust in me.
Oh!
Thank you for letting me come with you.
you are so good!
Where are you going?
To find some food.
Stay and rest;
I'll be back.
please bless her.
Lord.
she's very old.
There's no need to apologize.
I know Master Boaz would want to help you.
You see those women there?
They're gleaners.
Many of them are widows like yourself.
Follow them and you can gather up all the loose grain you see.
Daniel?
her.
that you're welcome here.
sir.
When you drink a need... go to the well;
my men will draw it for you.
I am a Moabite; they may not want to.
I've ordered them to treat you kindly.
welcome.
My servants told me how you... how you gave up your home and your own people for the sake of your mother-in-law.
I think that's very kind.
May God bless you for it.
Thank you.
special needs.
Let some extra grain fall for her.
tell her she can just harvest some of her own.
"- Not yakuza, are you?"
- I'm sorry.
I hand out flyers.
So you're a loser.
"I was a real estate broker, but I didn't accept voluntary retirement, so they tried to force me to quit by making me hand out 2,000 flyers a day."
I don't care.
"When I did that, they made me do 3,000."
They know it's impossible.
"They want to make me quit, and I want to quit."
But my kid's still in high school.
I need to send him to college.
Then stay away from drugs.
Some people kill themselves.
If you won't use drugs...
I'll stay.
I hope you cheer up.
Thanks.
Can I see you again?
Were you okay?
You're kind.
I fell bad for him.
Dangerous work.
"Yours, too."
Not like I want to do this.
I wanna work front desk at a top hotel.
"I actually want to open my own boutique store, too."
Thanks.
Take care.
"Hey, no, no, no!"
Can't I just have one?
I always wanted to eat all the nuggets myself.
All the nuggets?
"Wait, wait, wait."
I haven't got it turned up enough.
Basil!
I said I suggest...
"Oh, my head, my head!"
Has it come away?
Did you bang your head?
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, dear."
Let me have a look.
You'd better go and lie down before something else happens.
Shut up!
Why don't you call the police?
"We will, the moment we've searched the rooms."
My money's been taken!
"Yes, yes, I know."
Try not to speak.
Is this a piece of your brain?
£85.
Take my arm.
"I don't need your arm, thank you."
I can get down the stairs perfectly well by myself.
"""Down"" the stairs?"
Don't stop when you get to the basement.
Keep straight on.
Give my regards to the earth's core.
Are you sure you can manage?
"And if you give us any more trouble, I shall visit you in the small hours and put a bat up your nightdress."
"Well, that was fun, wasn't it?"
"The odd moment like that, almost worth staying alive for, isn't it?"
"It's nice to share a moment like that, isn't it?"
Touch me.
"Oh, no."
[whispers]:
Human contact...
that's how you show empathy.
Oh!
How is the back of your hand clammy?
"All right, lightning round."
[buzzer sounds]
So there's no future for us?
"Well, I don't know what you're up to, but I'm going to Burger King after this."
[buzzer sounds]
I thought we had something.
We did have something.
A one-night stand.
[buzzer sounds]
Is there someone else?
There's everyone else.
[buzzer sounds repeatedly]
"Oh, my God!"
"I have been trying to help you for hours, and at best, you have made zero progress."
It is like you are incapable of caring.
Maybe I was right: you are a monster.
Wow.
"I'm sorry, Clark."
I can tell how frustrating this is for you.
"No, I don't think you..."
"Wait, what did you just say?"
"Um, I'm sorry?"
Jack!
You cared about how I felt!
That's empathy!
House owners fear you would sue them.
"- Since you approached me, I'll try."
You have a bike?
- Yes
- Can you take me on it?
- Do you ride well?
- Yes
-Then get your bike.
Too tall.
Only Anushka can ride on this.
It is this house on the left.
Stop.
My back aches.
-This is the 11th house I am showing you.
Please somehow arrange this house for me.
I should say that.
If you don't like this then I must arrange a film set at AVM.
- OK
The house owner is sharp.
Keep your voice down.
This is the best house in the area.
"The house owner has let you use the plants, old newspaper, bucket and everything."
We can fix this if it satisfies you.
The rooms are all very spacious.
But I don't need such big rooms.
How much is the rent?
"20,000 as rent and an advance of 10 months."
Oh!
"I can't afford 20,000."
Ask if he can reduce the rent.
- No its impossible.
- I told you already that he is sharp.
- I shall call the police.
"- No, cos your part's over."
The end of your scene.
Back to the dole for you.
"Five lines, thank you and good night."
"Well, I must say, this looks very interesting."
"She's crying, you know."
"That, Eddie, is the biz."
It's a tough life.
"It's a tough life, dearie."
"I mean, look at Arthur Mullard."
She used to be quite attractive.
- I still quite fancy her.
"- Yeah, hur-uhh."
"Well, I must say."
This is very interesting.
Must learn to read sometime.
Right.
Sod all this health food.
"When I eat, I like to dice with a heart attack."
Let's have a good English roast and a coronary thrombosis.
- Right.
Let's make a shopping list.
- Yeah.
Four hundred pounds of oven chips.
"Right, that seems simple enough."
Better check the larder.
"Waste not, want not."
- Remember the poor children.
"- Oh, the little poor children."
Yes.
With their cosy little terrace dwellings.
MAX:
"Oh, nonsense."
I also collected some crickets and caterpillars for our dining pleasure.
They're an excellent source of protein.
I grabbed what I could... before our ship burnt up.
"If we ration it, could last us a few days."
"Talk to me, what do we have?"
(sighs)
Mochi balls.
Love those.
And a bottle of ouzo.
Who's up for some sing-a-longs?
MAX:
That sounds delightful.
"Sorry, cuz."
"If I die first,"
I want you to eat me.
Nobody's gonna eat you.
"So what are you saying, I'm not good enough for you?"
Why wouldn't you eat me?
"Guys, over here!"
"Check it out,"
"Doctor, regular MacGyver."
"Actually, it's basic physics."
The lens focuses the light to generate enough heat to burn.
Now all we need to do is stoke the flame.
"I'll do you one better, brah."
Oh!
- Yeah!
Whoa.
It's always nice to have flammable material.
FLIPPA:
You really showed those bastards.
This is Hidalgo.
He fought in the underground once upon a time.
Once upon a time indeed.
"I infiltrated the city, but some bastard betrayed me."
I assume you haven't told them where Carrasco is or anything like that.
Silveira and I aren't such good friends that I would confide any secrets to him.
They'll wait for you to recover before they torture and drug you again.
"Watch out, they're coming."
"Come on, get into your beds."
Hurry up.
Gosh!
Let's see what delicious food we're getting today.
- Minced shit!
You know I don't eat shit.
- Shut up!
Why don't you eat this yourself?
Pigswill for pigs!
I've had it with you!
Who's a pig?
Tell me.
Who's a pig?
- You're the pig.
Say yes.
"I said, say yes!"
- Yes.
Stop it!
Are you trying to kill him?
"Come on, let's go."
- Come on now.
- You see how things work here.
No jokes!
"Right, cover me."
"Fuck, they're in the hotel."
We don't need the sniper anymore either.
Go inside.
See the colonel.
"Over here, laddie."
Arm yourself to the teeth.
Don't touch that.
Emma Gee is mine.
That's what my father used to say...
'A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay.'
Come along.
"Chop, chop."
Big Sally.
"Well, home is where the battle is."
"Private, it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes to the cripple, understood?"
Follow on.
"If you can hear them, but you can't shoot them, you can probably grenade them."
"Drop an egg down there, laddie."
Forward.
Come along.
"Good Lord, how embarrassing."
Dodged a bullet on that one.
I'll cover you.
You go around them.
"Don't let the cripple get below you, laddie!"
Jolly good.
"Hold on, wait."
Help me with the cripple.
"Retreat five paces back on my command, laddie."
"Spasibo, Yuri."
My quarters are actually up there.
Ted?
You feel a little bit better now?
You're in no danger here.
- These people don't want to hurt you.
- Sure they don't.
The FBI agent just happened to be on the train today.
She wasn't following you.
Wasn't watching you.
She expects you to believe that?
"Let them go, Ted."
I'll stay with you.
"You and I will do this together, only you need to let these people go."
I will wait with you.
No one wants to hurt you.
We don't want to hurt you.
We want to kill you.
- No!
"- No, it's okay, Ted."
"- Ted, it's okay."
- Don't!
I will make sure that they never take it out of you.
"If you hurt one more person on this train, I swear to God,"
I'll make them leave it in you forever.
What?
"Everything all right in there, Dr. Bryar?"
I want it out.
"Well, I'm sending two technicians in to remove it."
No!
One.
One technician.
"Well, it's a delicate procedure."
It requires...
Why are you so uncomfortable?
It's like you're somewhere else.
What is it?
"If there's a problem, I'll take care of it here immediately, so just tell me."
Is someone making problems for you or can you not pay the bills?
Dad!
"No, there's nothing wrong."
Why are you getting on his case?
This isn't the first or second time you've seen him.
"This isn't the first or second time, but it was bothering me."
It's so easy to bother you.
That's nice.
"I can't see your eyes, I can't see your third or fourth eye behind that."
- All right then.
- Good bye.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
"- Don't be late, it's at seven."
"I won't be late, I won't be late."
Good bye.
Seat him at another table tomorrow.
Ahjussi!
We should go too.
"Right, go, go."
You displeased me today.
Yes.
"Mom, stop it."
"- Bye, Ahjumma."
- All right.
I'll leave oppa in your care.
Don't worry.
"I'll call you, Oppa."
How were you going to act?
' I don't know.
I don't wanna take any chances.
We should get him as soon as possible.
'We'll be there in 24 hours.' I'll pick you up.
- You wanna go to the boat first?
- No.
First show us where he is.
He and his wife own a shirt shop close to Waikiki.
- How about his wife?
"- Yes, she's still alive."
- We may not have time for them both.
- That's OK.
He's our priority.
We're coming up to the shop.
It's busy.
I don't think we can take him here.
Don't linger too long.
He might see us.
"OK, I'll take you to the boat now."
"With those fancy shirts, that outrigger crew of yours had better win."
"Winning ain't important, pop, long as we look good at the luau later."
Typical Hawaiian philosophy.
"To win is important too, you know?"
You and Mrs Greenberg better be there Saturday to cheer us on.
Mama and I will be there.
You just win.
"OK, pops."
- What did you see?
- I don't have to see.
I feel.
- Here. it may be nothing.
- Nothing?
You said you were ready to come back to work.
- I am.
- Let me talk to that prick.
So what's the problem?
"Taylor is playing hardball, he won't budge on the price."
You assured me you could do this.
Do I need to send someone else out there who can make this happen?
"No, I'll get it done."
The clock is ticking.
- I thought you were his favorite.
- Things change.
Let me guess...
"Tall, brown hair."
How did you know?
"When things get stressful, Marcus reverts to his old bad habits."
What does that mean?
His wife.
Tall... brown hair...
"Really quite the beauty, until she wasn't, but I guess we all have our weaknesses, uh?"
- I didn't know he was married.
- Oh yeah.
"A long time ago, it didn't end well."
"Then again, what does?"
I have missed you.
I haven't thought of you once.
Maybe it's time for you to get out.
Maybe it's time for you to shut up!
Close the deal and get out.
"I will, I have to."
"What are you up to, Chase?"
I need change.
What do you mean?
I guess you never leave here.
These savages and cowards only hunt the weak.
"Noah admits, 're dead meat."
"No, we are emperor penguins."
-With pride.
We looked into the eyes of the hungry but not surrender.
Even surrounded by walls of ice will not be defeated!
"That's how you talk, Noah!"
"We are courage, we are brave."
We are the glorious Empress nation.
"Erik, stay low."
-Mano?
-They are good.
"Gloria, behind you!"
"Get someone its size, coward."
"Do not worry, Princess."
I'll get you first.
While chilled before they become hard and rotten.
Boadicea.
This is my daughter!
What smart!
"The union of nations, This is what solidarity is."
"Well, now what?"
"Now, they managed a stay of execution."
Who are you?
-A idiot.
Thank you.
"Bo, you got it."
"Hello friends, you came."
Sure we have come.
Told Us.
-Where is Ramon?
- [bleats]
"Well, I think you're wrong."
"Don't worry about nothing, sir."
I'm a very safe driver.
- Want me to tell you how safe?
- [Alfred bleating]
I'll tell you anyway.
I've been driving a hack for 19 years and 11 months.
"And in all that time, I never even put one scratch on a cab."
"In fact, next month,"
They're gonna give me a gold safety award.
- What do you think of that?
- [bleating]
"Boy, you don't like nothing."
- I sure hope you're a good tipper.
- [bleats]
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.
[tires screeching]
[cabbie] hey!
Hey!
You owe me a fare!
[cabbie sighs]
"- Officer, that goat's a guy."
- The goat?
The guy became a goat when I'm driving.
The guy?
This magician beat me out of this fare.
The magician?
- My perfect record.
- Record?
Oh...
Record.
"By the way, do you have any papers?"
No.
Lock him up.
Your information proved to be correct.
The man had very considerable assets.
This is enough money for your fare.
This is a passport to America.
You are now a French citizen.
The man you caught will never know about this?
You mean your brother?
He will never know.
Did anything happen to him?
He resisted my men.
He died.
He died?
Yes.
It was one of those unfortunate things.
Your first look?
"Yes, I had only seen pictures before."
It's a big country.
Millions of people beyond those buildings.
"All of them needing something, buying something."
And what do you sell them?
Oil.
"Oh, oil."
Are you an honest man?
What kind of a question is that?
I don't see anything wrong with the question.
Did you make your way honestly?
Of course I did.
Isn't that the only way?
Is it?
I'm the happiest man in the world because the wedding is off.
"And furthermore, if you ever come to this house again..."
I'll break every bone in your body.
Do you understand that?
"- Red, is that call for me?"
"- No, it's my dame."
"Okay, sweetheart, and a great big juicy kiss for you."
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance to get my dough back.
- Give us a roll.
- Here it comes...
You ought to marry those dice.
Marry?
Holy cats!
What time is it?
"- Pop, my pants!"
- You've got them on.
"Oh, yeah."
Wait a minute!
You're not going with all our dough.
I got to get married.
I'll bet you the bankroll you don't get married.
That's a bet.
No cuffs.
The tailor says those kind of pants shouldn't have cuffs.
What?
Nice fellows!
Hello.
Where's everybody?
"Why, the guests have all gone, sir."
Did you wish to be announced?
Just let me get my hands on that young man and I'll strangle him!
Yes.
And I am to renounce all claims on the contents of the tomb?
Yes.
"Duplicate pieces that the Cairo Museum feel they can spare will, of course, be ceded to you."
"At the discretion of Monsieur Lacau, I suppose."
I will do everything in my power to make sure that you receive a fair selection.
My husband would have wanted you to return to your work.
Will Mr Mace be returning to Egypt?
"I'm sorry, I thought you knew."
Mace died recently.
"Oh, dear."
I'm so sorry.
I expect the newspapers will say he is another victim of the curse of Tutankhamun.
Arthur always laughed at the idea.
There are times when I wonder.
(Shouting instructions in Arabic)
(Speaking Arabic)
Lift.
Stop.
Stop!
"You, stop."
"You, stop."
"You, lift."
"You, start."
Everyone.
That's good.
Very nice.
Good.
"Okay, let's get the planks in."
Planks in.
Good.
And lower.
But they've all been losers.
You know... boring.
They'd have to be.
My father had to approve of them all.
Old Dalt can't be that bad.
He must have done something right.
- Why?
"- Well, look how great you turned out to be."
"Oh, me?"
Come on.
I'm a total basket case.
You don't even know the half of it.
"No, no."
My intuition about people is very good.
I could tell right away you had your act together.
Yeah?
When did you decide that?
In the convenience store when we shared that look.
Remember?
Yeah.
Thought to myself only if life were different... maybe I could meet a girl like that someday.
- Really?
- Swear to God.
"Believe it or not, when I was holding the gun to your back..."
I couldn't help but notice how lovely your hair smelled.
- You're crazy.
- That would be affirmative.
"You know, you really hurt me with that gun."
- You didn't have to jam it into my back so hard.
- I'm sorry.
"About the gun, uh..."
- What?
Do you remember the first day when you asked if the car wasn't working?
"I answered, ""lt's given up the ghost."" Do you remember?"
"That day, we were driving uphill."
The car gave up the ghost.
Yes.
It had worked too hard and gave up the ghost.
Yes.
What did I say?
"A car, just like men, can give up the ghost."
And I'll say it again now...
"Men, like machines, can give up the ghost."
Right?
You haven't worked this morning.
You're not tired.
"Yes, but... you know that's not always the case."
"Sometimes, when you're idle, you give up the ghost."
You understand?
You go crazy doing nothing.
You blow your top!
"All right, forget it, it's over."
Let's be friends again.
"Shake my hand. lf you can hear me, hold the line."
I'm going higher up.
Hold the line.
I'll see you later.
"Come on, Behzad."
"Forget the cemetery, come and eat some strawberries..."
Hold the line.
I'm listening...
Hello.
He told you that?
Did you give him my message?
I can give you one of our lorries.
That's all I can do.
- I'll drive these people away from here.
- To the Promised Land?
Is that what you're fighting for?
I don't think you understand what we're fighting for.
Let's move on.
"We're moving on, guys."
We've got to get away.
- Thank you.
- We'll give them a lorry for their escape.
"Come on, get up there."
Hurry up.
"- Mariá, Mariá!"
"- Hurry up, get up on the lorry."
"- Hurry up, there's no time to lose."
- Get a move on.
Hurry!
"You too, hurry up."
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
He's in there.
Open the door.
Why are you snooping around here?
You're mumbling.
We can help your friend escape.
Someone we trust will handle that.
- And who is he?
- A member of the militia.
Water.
"The president's men seem to consider your friend very important, so the price for his escape should reflect this."
Silveira's men are corrupt?
"You had promised him to tell me after the wedding, right?"
You've known for five months.
"I want to let it be for now, Helene."
You don't have the time.
What are you going to do?
Anna and the boys must not know before it's absolutely necessary.
Are you listening?
Not before it's absolutely necessary.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
We'll figure something out.
There's always a solution.
There's always something in America...
- There's nothing to do.
"- Yes, there is."
There's nothing to do!
- There's...
- No!
"- There's nothing to do, understand?"
- You can't die!
"We don't get to decide, damn it."
Let go.
Get out.
Get out of the damn car before I throw you out!
Shut the door!
- How long will you stay there?
"- One week, only one week."
- You'll come to my birthday?
"- Yes, of course."
I wouldn't miss that.
I promise.
"Shut up, you'll be next."
"Look, leave that aside for the moment."
I shall deal with that first thing tomorrow.
I'll strike out into the icy wastes of the chilled dairy section.
I'll be like Captain Oates.
"Only, hopefully, I shall come back, but what I wanted to say, Enid, is,"
"I know this wasn't a date, but could it be?"
"Not this yoghurt blunderer's debacle, but could we go on a proper date?"
I'm going out with someone.
Oh.
So...
Right.
Sorry.
Doing my two short planks act.
I should have checked.
Sorry.
As you were.
Malcolm?
Yeah.
Did you manage to have a word with her?
No.
There's a lot going on.
We've got the dressage coming up.
"I mean, I will."
We might just have to tick along for a bit.
And don't keep bringing it up.
I've got enough on my plate.
I don't keep bringing it up.
"You said, once the girls had left school."
I can't just cut and run.
"Well, maybe I should cut and run."
Run where?
You're no spring chicken.
AVON:
Tarrant!
Tarrant!
Listen...
Let's go.
- Tarrant!
Tarrant!
"- It's no use, he's cut off."
- Damn.
"- Well, that is it."
"With those ships out there, we can't wait."
They might not be looking for us.
Are you crazy?
You said yourself that was a search formation.
"They haven't picked up Tarrant, so why have they assumed a ship's out here?"
Just a minute.
"Orac, that message from Space Centre, how was it relayed here?"
Through Terminal 4006.
- The terminal on Helotrix.
"- Of course, Avon."
- That is the nearest terminal to our position.
- That's it.
They must have intercepted the transmission.
Computer logic.
The nearest terminal.
"So Orac's thick, we all know that."
Let's move!
- I'm going in under them.
- What?
We'll go down to cloud level.
"If we stay between them and the planet, we may not show up on their scanners."
Once we're below them we'll be cut off.
He is taking a left.
Where are you going?
Go straight!
We have almost reached the hospital.
"Okay, go."
Idiots!
Take a left.
- Shut up.
We are caught up in some issue.
I'll call you again.
Hang up.
"Is your phone in within the network range, Vikram?"
Not sure.
I'll have to check.
"After Vikram withdraws money from the bank, take the Perundurai route."
"After reaching the outskirts,"
Take off of the highway and drive the car into a deserted area.
I'll scream and pretend to be panicking.
Vikram will get tensed.
"Hit him then, and push him off the car."
We leave with the money like it is a kidnap drama.
We both will escape.
Driver.
Where are you going?
- What happened?
Not sure.
He is taking the wrong route.
Where are you going?
Go back to the main road.
I'm telling you to turn back!
Why are you taking the wrong route?
Not this hospital.
"This way, we will forget each other."
I'll take him back whenever I want to.
Don't go!
I have to go after her.
Do you need to deal out pain in order to survive?
Even to a kid like that?
"She's not a kid, it's worse."
The worst must be me!
Want to bet?
"A proper little lady who would want the worst, is it able to suffer then?"
Is it trying to suffer?
Does one really suffer in theater?
You'll taste.
Feel.
I'll help you.
Come.
You dithering?
"If you pull out of me, you're finished."
Because of that?
That?
Lyon Station.
I owe you for this one.
"Oh, how happy Mickey will be!"
"For me, this is a pleasure, a vision of the Apocalypse, the Whore on her throne of blood, the fourth horseman, the lamb of the seventh seal, Kafka and his goldfish!"
Kafka and his goldfish.
Good.
Good.
There I can't.
I spent my holidays here with my father and mother.
My father died in that room.
A bullet to the attic.
I'm lying again.
!
Just write whatever you want!
I don't care!
It's not my homework!
It's your homework!
"Well, this time, we're just gonna have to make it fun."
Write it down.
Write it down!
Why aren't you writing it down?
!
That's not how Ms. Rinsky told us to do it!
"- Well, how did she say to do it then?"
- I don't know!
- Just write it down!
- We're supposed to show our work.
"Well, you didn't do any work!"
I did.
You should show her a picture of me.
Are you sure there's not some other instructions that
"Were sent home or something, something you might have lost?"
"Oh, yeah."
You know what?
There is.
There's a big ol' packet of instructions with
"All the answers to everything we'd ever want to know,"
And I've been hiding it from you.
"Well, go get 'em!"
Mom!
"Oh, no!"
It's your turn to go help aunt Edie and aunt ginny.
I went last week.
"Yeah, but last time, I accidentally drank"
This is proof.
Is it?
"Well, this is fake."
Huh.
Oh.
"Oh, yeah, that's my credit card number there."
Oh!
"Vexing, isn't it?"
Eh?
The cuff link that I bought- very similar
In design and style- winds up at a crime scene.
Let's cut the bs.
You planted it there to help your client beat a murder rap.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Is that your theory?
That's not fact.
There's no foundation there.
"Plant anything else, and I will personally drive you to chino."
"Yes, I believe you would."
"As a matter of fact,"
"I've been contemplating retiring, anyway."
That's your problem.
"You know, you can buy a sense of humor."
"We got to catch this guy, calleigh."
We got to catch him.
I just-
- I know he did it.
I think I may have found a way.
Really?
"Well, I started thinking about it,"
And the print alone is not gonna sink coop daly.
"No, he's got, uh, that other explanation--"
"And then, too, after- when I got married -"
My husband was a lawyer.
And he was very active in the community- the gentile community and thejewish community.
He was a controller for the city ofToronto... and his office was at the city hall.
He worked for this place.
My husband's picture's the first picture you see when you walk in.
It's still there.
The entrance when you come into this building.
One day I would like to go downstairs with you.
Would you show it to me?
- Yup.
- I would like to see that.
- By all means.
- I would love to see that.
Any day you're ready.
- One day we'll do that.
- Okay.
- Okay.
It's a date.
- Okay.
- All right.
Right in the front entrance.
- Right in the front entrance -
- Wow.
- The first picture you see as you walk in.
"You know, there are a lot of pictures hanging from the ceiling."
There's a lot of pictures.
Yeah.
"- Well, he's there."
- Let's do it.
All right.
Let's see if we can find him.
Sam:
Let me guess.
"Alonso wasn't a big fan of portion control, was he?"
No.
"During a routine treatment, he almost killed a client."
He sucked out too much fat.
"I demoted him to kitchen duty -- no human contact, just fat from a jar."
"But he said the more I deprived him, the hungrier he got."
[ Sobbing ]
And now three people are dead.
My husband...
[ Sobs ]
Where's Alonso right now?
The -- the basement?
That's -- that's where he spends most of his time now.
[ Sniffles ] What about her?
"Well, till we figure out which side she's on, she stays put."
I am on your side.
Okay.
Then how do we kill him?
[ Sighs ]
[ Grunts ]
You and stupido have no chance.
The fat makes us stronger.
Your sister didn't mention that when she ratted you out.
You're lying!
[ Growls ]
[ Grunting ]
[ Panting ]
"I guess after you killed her husband... you were too monstrous, even for her."
[ Grunts ]
[ Both grunting ]
"Hey, is somebody down there?"
I didn't see you sign in.
Hey?
Is this somebody in here?
You're beautiful.
You already have me in bed.
You can stop.
"No, please continue."
It's a hell of a show.
Marcus?
Get dressed.
We're leaving.
"Wow, no!"
Wait.
"You don't wait, you don't listen to him!"
You get up and you get dressed now or I will kill you before you take another breath.
"You were here to close a deal, not to whore yourself out to a degenerate Pure Blood."
"Wouldn't you rather just, cut the insults and rip my throat out."
"Oh that's right you can't, because I am a Pure Blood."
And what are you?
You're just... infected.
Which is all you'll ever be.
"Doing our biddings, serving our will."
Yeah.
Vampires like you it's... nothing but pieces of meat.
They got a reprieve.
Thank you of reminding me of that.
Chase?
Chase?
It's getting dark.
It's time to go.
Where?
You are so good.
Wow.
Thank you.
We really don't even have any notes.
I think you just became my favorite network.
Just a few tone questions.
O-kay.
We're a little concerned that the characters all seem a bit too... angry.
Oh...
"Well, it... it's called ""angry men,"" so..."
"No, I know, and we love it."
Mm.
Shouldn't we maybe wait till the new guy starts and see what he thinks?
I think we want to make sure he's seeing the best possible version of this.
Maybe this is the best possible version.
It's not.
I'm gonna kill somebody.
Phew.
Thought that was just happening in my head.
Excuse me a moment.
"Okay, stop!"
Stop!
"I know you have jobs to do, but so do we, and it's just..."
it's... it's impossible!
Seriously!
Enough!
How many fucking bookshelves does this guy need?
!
It's true.
I heard he can't even read.
No one told us you were coming in today.
I'd have prepared a more embarrassing way to meet you.
Have a spot?
Rather.
"Excuse me, sir."
"I wouldn't touch it if I were you, sir."
"Too watery, sir."
"Besides, it'll rust in the lining of your stomach."
- We'll be the judge of that.
"- Wait, sir."
There's a fly.
- I don't see a fly.
- Neither do I.
"There it is, sir."
It just dove under the ice.
I'll get the little nipper in half a jiffy.
I got him.
Hear him?
Humming like a beehive.
He's gone.
Ain't that a shame?
There he goes.
"Come along, Mitchell."
I think we'll forget the punch.
"Tommy, you know we have Sgt. Higginbotham to thank... for your being let out of the expedition."
That's right.
The Colonel says I'm the only man sharp enough...
- to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
- That's very flattering.
"I'm only glad to be so some help in, shall we say, Cupid's service."
"One thing I can promise... with Cutter and MacChesney about, you won't have one dull moment."
I've got a feeling they don't like me very much.
It's just as well.
"- The army's no place for sentiment, I says."
"No, I work on Saturdays."
Big shoplifting day.
I catch dozens of punks like you.
Thas wonderful.
If everyone were that dedicated...
Bet you're an ace at Blackjack...
How'd you guess?
I know you inside out.
Lots of guys like you around.
They stick to you like flies these days.
Looking for trouble?
"No, just like a pair of jeans..."
Is my brother's birthday.
"Down there, on the right just past the television sets."
I'll frisk you later.
"Hey, look!"
Must be your first paycheck!
Not a chance.
I met this rich lady...
She's hooked on me!
Ursula's very generous.
Congratulations!
You don't need that badge your hair tonic gives you away!
You're lucky I'm in a good mood today.
Me too.
Life is beautiful.
I'd almost like to touch you...
"If I touch you, you'll know it!"
You feel up the salesgirls?
I'll throw you out on your ass.
Understand!
Little punk.
OK.
Mads?
"Right, all the doors and windows are locked."
No-one's getting in or out tonight.
You two OK?
"Yeah, Mrs S. Just a bit twitchy."
"Maddy, if there's something going on you better tell us now,"
- 'cause we're running out of time.
- Why are we doing this?
Didn't we have a great time last full moon?
Didn't we?
"- Well, yeah, but..."
- We were a proper wolf pack.
"Free, alive."
I had the best experience of my life.
And it was because I was sharing it with you guys.
"It was a special night, Maddy."
One of the best.
So why are we pretending like it never happened?
Because we're never going to do it again.
- Why not?
"- You know why not, Maddy."
It's not safe for us out there.
- We were fine!
"- No, we were lucky!"
What if we'd got shot at by a farmer?
or
Or we'd walked into a poacher's trap?
All it takes is one person to spot us and then they'll hunt us down.
- It's what they do.
"- Tell me you understand that, Maddy."
I do.
I'll be damned.
"So, that's what happened."
Why did you call me?
Things are crazy at work.
Because of this case.
Remember what I told you before?
What?
How the Jap raped a woman?
What about it?
You filthy slut.
That woman.
It was her.
What the hell are you talking about?
That woman he raped- it's the same woman whose house burned down.
"She went crazy after that, and used to run around naked at night."
My wife saw her at the public bathhouse.
"She was totally covered in rashes and boils,"
Mumbling gibberish the whole time.
Are you out of your mind?
Byeong-gyu's got to stop this.
Talking crap to his dimwitted buddies.
You worthless bastard.
It was your theory.
I was just messing with you.
Who in their right mind would believe crap like that?
"No, I think you're right."
It can't be the mushrooms.
That doesn't make sense.
Gimme a break.
What are you looking at?
Get outta here!
What?
- I'm not sleeping here?
- No.
You need a pee?
Go on.
I can't do it for you.
Then we'll go.
"Mum, I must tell you."
It's all gone wrong.
- What's the matter?
- Guillaume has a lover.
I'm almost sure of it.
Sure?
Do you have proof?
Loads of proof.
"Absences, lateness, poor excuses..."
He's always texting.
"If guys could lie, it would be easier."
"I tell you, he's seeing someone."
"I don't have to tell you, you know all that."
So I'm really pissed off.
"But don't worry, I'll survive."
- Did you tell your father?
- What?
He'd probably defend him.
We have about 7.2 billion people today.
That's going to go to nine and a half by 2050.
That means that we have 35 years to basically double the food supply.
We will need to produce more food than has been produced
In the entire history of the world.
That's probably the greatest challenge facing mankind.
"And I'll tell ya, I think we can do it."
Yeung:
- What's that?
- For you to sign up.
"When we get Cutter, we'll tear up the papers."
It'll be according to regulations.
Is that fair enough for you?
You're getting clever again.
Do you want me to get kicked out of the army?
"All right, I'll sign, but on one condition."
That I hold the blank in my hand and I keep it after I'm through.
You don't trust me.
That's right.
All right.
What are you doing with that in your pocket?
I always carry one.
In case.
"No, you don't."
"Not a word of this to Emmy, you understand?"
Shake on it?
Hurry up.
"Excuse me, miss."
Sgt. Ballantine and I are going out on a reconnoitering expedition.
"- Yes, sir."
"- Lf we're not back by morning... inform the Colonel, and you follow our trail."
- Come this way.
"- Excuse me, Miss Stebbins."
"- I'm going, Emmy."
He's changed his mind.
- Who made him change it?
- Reason and common decency.
- You're lying.
"Would I lie at a time like this, just before our wedding?"
Be reasonable.
- Right.
- Does that mean trees or...?
No.
"I don't own any forest land, do any milling."
"Just lumberyards, really."
Douglas is an attorney.
And a very good one.
- Do any trial work?
"- No, no."
Nothing as exciting as that.
I confine myself to handling the Harper interests.
That's a fancy way of saying he holds the purse strings.
I can't stand that vinegar you serve.
Where did you get that stuff anyway?
"The wine is lovely, Stan."
It just doesn't mix well with Scotch.
Now she's trying to tell me what to drink.
"It's not what you drink, Stan, it's how much."
"You are not married, are you, Mr. Gordon?"
No.
I'm a bachelor.
"Well, now, you just take my advice and you stay a bachelor."
"Please, try to ignore him, Mr. Gordon."
You can see that he's...
You can see that he is drunk.
"Right, Mr. Gordon?"
- He's back.
"- Yes, I think you're right."
"It's all right, Mr. Gordon."
Just be quiet.
It'll pass in a few moments.
Bobby.

"Yes, of course."

That's true.

I wanna be poor in other ways.
"We offer sanctuary, but it doesn't come without a price."
Work hard and you will see results.
Commit yourself and you may even find that you wish to stay.
Like a gym membership.
I can cancel at any time?
God in his wisdom has led you here.
Take refuge and hide your secret from the world.
"And once your baby is born, you can return to the outside world."
"Oh, whoa, hold that pregnant pause."
I'm not with child.
Unless it's immaculate conception or I wore a strange man's underwear.
"I just assumed, based on who brought you here."
This is where Lily came to have Chuck?
Ah.
Here come the poor.
"Come, help yourselves."
Help yourselves.
"No, I..."
- Look at this.
"No, I really..."
Look at that case.
- What a surprise that would be...
I'll take that.
...when you get home.
"Listen, poor kid."
You get...
My c...
My couch.
- Is Betty in?
- She's on a call.
Can I take a message?
[Indistinct conversations]
"Go, go!"
You're gonna be okay.
This is the last set from the sequencer.
"Well, you were right."
I isolated nine different sets of DNA.
Six are from the Swiss expedition.
"I haven't found matches for two of the others, although, genetic markers do indicate they may be local."
So there may not be a match.
What about this one?
It's common to all parties and it was found in the bite marks on Pemba.
That's your killer.
Western European markers as well as Polynesian.
The 2015 quake was his trigger.
And I use that as a filter with missing persons.

"Monty, you are a genius."

"Oh, man."
This poor guy lost everything.
This guy isn't evil.
He's injured.
Call Jack.
I know where he's going.
"Jack, you there?"
[Static crackling]
Jack?
What do we do?
Call the army.
Order us up a chopper.

Huh.
Who doesn't love Paris?
Have a safe trip.
Excuse me.
Sure.
"Now you say ""excuse me."""
Thanks.
We're just killing time waiting for the storm to blow over.
How credible a threat is it?
It's elevated.
"Pretty typical this time of year, but... worth calling about."
"Well, man of few words."
Maybe I'm wrong.
"She's not talking about you, boss."
Bishop's husband know anything?
"Uh, there was some talk of chatter."
"Just some memos going around the office, but..."
Chatter?
"Well, snowstorm Yeah."
"will probably keep the terrorists home anyway, right?"
Yeah.
"It also keeps first responders and emergency service vehicles from getting through, DiNozzo, so... keep your eyes open."
Copy that.
You have been on edge.
You knew.
We're just hearing the chatter now?
NSA heard about it days ago.
"Well, I'm..."
"I'm a lawyer, Tony."
My ear's not exactly pressed to the pipeline.
"So, you didn't..."
tell me?
He said it was better if I didn't know.
Because of the danger.
"Look, I didn't give him the money."
I loaned it to him.
So you drew up a legal document?
No.
But we had an oral agreement.
"I mean, he promised to pay me back."
With interest.
"I mean, I maxed out all of my cards, so you better find that money."
What was he like the last time you saw him?
He was sweet.
We made love right before he left.
He use a condom?
I'm on the pill.
We were engaged.
"Abs, can DNA still be recovered from Lance Corporal Finn's skivvies?"
It would take the cooperation of weather and protection.
He was wrapped in plastic and it's been cold
", so there's a decent chance."
"Well, run the tests."
We'll do a cheek swab on his fiancées.
"Wait, did you say ""fiancées?"""
Like plural?
Huh.
Kinky.
Is that it?
"For now, Siri."
I need to follow you home and pick up his belongings.
I want them back when James returns.
He's dead.
He can't return.
"My name's John, by the way."
I'm Rose.
"Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes."
That's a song.
Don't forget to give my love to Rose.
Be nice if somebody would.
Would you like another drink?
"So, where are you heading?"
Patagonia.
Travelling light.
"Well, you don't need much stuff out there, do you?"
Just a change of clothes and a bottle of whisky.
"I don't have any whisky, actually."
"Oh, no?"
"Well, then, you lured me here"
Under false pretences.
Just a lie to get you into my room.
Cunning.
But unnecessary.
Sorry.
I might need this to replace the pretty clothes you ripped off me last night.
You work for them.
Good luck.
"So what now, John?"
How do you see this playing now?
You tell me.
"Well, not such an elaborate routine next time you run away."
Why did you this time?
I'm always curious as far as you're concerned.
You said you wanted to go back to prison.
Yeah.
I'll take my chances.
I'll... go with them.
"My Lady, the trip will be very rough."
Everything will fall apart if something happens to you.
I'll get what we need.
Trust me.
Let me go.
I don't want to send you on such a rough journey.
I'm afraid too.
But whenever I'm scared...
I'll think of you.
Of how you lead the migrants.
I won't die in vain.
Don't worry.
I'll come back... and help you realize your dream.
You must get back and look after the people.
This is a steel sword.
It's the best there is.
Even stronger than the Han's or Puyo's.
You'll get to make these too.
"Mopalmo, Mopalmo..."
Mopalmo.
"Shh, I'm in the middle of a lesson."
Forget the lesson.
Come here for a minute.
People are saying that the Commander is dead.
I'm afraid all this might get out of hand.
We knew this would happen but there's nothing we can do.
It'll all blow over when the Commander returns.
It's out of our hands.
My goodness.
We have to do something.
The chiefs are having a meeting.
Wait
What should I do?
Make yourself useful
Help those who need it
How?
You can ease their consciences
That's a tremendous power
We can't keep him for long
The generator is running low.
We have to evacuate
is he dead?
What do you think?
Did you shoot him?
Yeah
Good work
Right in the heart.
He died instantly
Tell me ifyou find anything odd
Like?
I don't know.
Just odd
"Can you go to your room, please?"
Go to your room
- Is it about the ghost?
"- Go to your room, please"
- The ghost has gone
- Where to?
Back where he came from
How do you know he won't come back?
Because now he knows we don't need him
The police will come and ask you questions
They will want to know if you knew the ghost
"I mean, I do know, but I'm embarrassed."
"Kaitlin, you come in here all the time, and you look right through me like I don't even exist."
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
"I mean, why would a girl like you pay any attention to a guy like me ?"
I know the only reason you'd ever get to know me is if you had no choice.
"Tonight, that happened, and it felt like fate."
I didn't want it to end.
"I guess, I mean, that's understandable."
"But what do you mean, you didn't want it to end ?"
What the... ?
Mom...
It's okay.
Frank !
Just got your message.
I was so worried.
"Oh, me, too !"
Go for it.
There was a flipping earthquake.
But wait.
How did you get here ?
What about the pier ?
What about it ?
The pier is fine.
There's a heartbeat.
Thank God.
"The baby is under stress and, after a fall, there can be a rupture."
Separation.
Can you treat that ?
We still have some more tests to run.
"Okay, I've always wondered this."
"In your opinion, who is a better food industry server ?"
They have lots of fun things.
Five.
Six.
It's turning pink.
I work for Caritas.
the Catholic charity.
I work with abused women.
There are cases where I have to think.
"""How can that happen?"
"How can we watch that?"""
But I went through it myself.
And I can only say.
If someone is violent.
Just leave.
Pack your things.
There's always help.
That's it.
When you can't sit for three days.
Maybe we should get you lederhosen.
Do you like it?
- No.
- No?
"In my experience, most men aren't interested if a women climaxes."
They only care if they get their money's worth.
Then there are those who are too tender.
They're not my type either.
"For me, the perfect combination in a man is:"
He's made a place for himself.
"He does his share of housework, and in terms of sex, he takes the lead."
That's just me.
I need a man like that.
"Someone I can do whatever I want with is, sexually, not for me."
"But you're notable now, and that helps."
We're so excited you accepted.
The new book is really terrific.
"Oh, boy."
I wish somebody here would say something mean.
- Mean?
- Or honest.
It's unlikely that everybody here has nothing but praise.
It's not real.
I don't like how this is starting.
These are decent people.
(MOCKINGLY) They just want to be your friend.
"I know, that's the problem."
Sorry to bother you again.
- Is there trash in here?
"- Yes, I'm right here."
(LAUGHS)
Hey.
It's Philip.
You look like you're asleep with your eyes open.
I didn't even see you there.
You were looking right at me.
You were right.
This place is beautiful.
You sure you don't want any of these?
Brought you a whole box.
I'd rather just look around and stare at people.
I was surprised you called me.
I didn't see any way that I couldn't.
Things are pretty hectic with my new book and everything.
That's pretty cool.
"No, it's not cool."
"No, these space condition reports are recent."
"There is an odd smell, sort of sickly sweet."
"Yes, there is something."
"Could be the change of atmosphere, a different recycle system to that of the Liberator."
"No, it's more than that I can't place it."
"All right, shall we get on with it?"
"You go on down towards the stern,"
Cally and I'll work up towards the flight deck.
"Right, I'll just contact Vila."
- Are you awake?
- No.
That's what I thought.
It's very quiet here.
"If it should get noisy, I'll be in touch."
It's that same smell again.
- The girl's alive.
- So's this one.
The pulse is strong.
No visible sign of injury.
- D'you think they're drugged?
- What?
They could be drugged.
Possibly I don't know possibly.
They're certainly in a coma of some sort.
"No, it's no good."
"We'll we need the Cally, that's it."
"Cally, wake up!"
- Alone.
"- Yes, Cally!"
What?
It's Sonovapour Tranquillising gas Gas?
That's why we're so sleepy.
We don't want to be good.
We want to be bad.
Yeah.
"Hey, uh, let's go, you guys."
My mom's gonna yell at me.
"See you tomorrow, Tia."
We'll find Tony tomorrow for sure.
"Let's stay close together on the way out, guys."
Good.
This is professor Gannon...
Tony!
He's in some kind of a room.
Like a hospital.
With machines and instruments and things.
"Oh, that's easy."
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.
While we going around looking for a fight.
Come on.
You will now function exclusively under control.
You will no longer think independently.
All thinking and reasoning will be done by the voice that commands you.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
- What is your name?
- Tony.
- Where are you from?
Witch Mountain.
Sounds like some hick town to me.
How did you suspend Mr. Sickle in mid-air?
By energizing matter.
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow?
"Yes, sir."
Partner!
THE ILLUSION OF FEAR
- Any problems?
-The entrance is closed.
"It must be opened, then."
It's not possible.
We're waiting for a government delegation.
But we're running late!
I'll see to that now.
What are you doing?
You!
I told you we're running late.
Understand?
You can lose your driver's license for that!
You don't have the authority.
We have a charter flight!
I heard you.
But I can't do anything.
OK?
It's not far to the terminal.
You can walk there.
Walk there yourself!
If I let just one car in I'll be fired!
Hey you...
Stop that!
Come on!
It's alright.
I'll walk.
Igor Alexandrovitch?
"King Solomon, the poor of the city are waiting for you with a petition to stop the construction of the altar of sacrifice to Moloch."
The main instigators are here and waiting for your mercy.
"I build altars to all the gods, because a human is weak."
No.
Here we go again.
"Yeah, let's just stay away from the flying boxes."
"Yeah, isn't this where we cited the truck?"
"Just up ahead, I think."
"Let's take a look around, okay?"
What about your buddy Getraer?
He won't miss me for another five more minutes.
This is important.
I'll check the divider.
See anything?
You?
The boxes could've jumped the divider.
Could be.
Pull it over.
What's the matter with you boys?
You want to get yourselves killed?
"May I see your driver's license, ma'am?"
"I was so afraid, seeing you."
You boys ought to learn to study those posted signs.
"Ma'am, you were using an off-ramp to get on the freeway."
And no wonder.
With those itty-bitty signs.
"Now, you talk to your police chief."
"Oh, no, no, no."
"We're not L.A.P.D., see, we're State Highway Patrol."
"Well, better yet."
Then talk to the governor.
Watch out.
I'll write this one.
It's all mine.
And you boys stop speeding along on those motor things.
What you thinking?
"Laila, If this deal won't happen then you can't take place your bank's installments."
If the bank's installments would not take place then everything will go.
But you will see from far.
And...
You won't tell anyone about this.
"All right, show me."
"But not here, Then where?"
In your hotel.
All right.
Come.
Tell me who shot the fire?
Fire shot from there and we were here
And you.
"Yes, Madam."
Then come.
Yes!
Madam!
What are you doing?
"A weapon without riot,"
Didn't you fire a shot to him?
"Hey, search him, Yes!"
"If you don't mind, Sir!"
Why you always searching?
You didn't know that police officers didn't leave any chance.
"Do you understand, Come with me to police station."
Why police station?
I live in Ghat Kupar.
"If you do comedy again then I'll kill you, and you'll cry for entire life."
"Madam, your button is open, Catch him."
"Laxminarayan, My money."
Laxminarayan!
What you're telling me is true?
Yes.
And you said the shaman told you this.
"From their perspective, a ghost is the spirit of a dead man."
But that man is alive.
"I've heard about this man, too."
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.
"And there are darker, more disturbing rumors-"
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?
"No, Father."
They're definitely not rumors.
You sound terribly sure.
Did you see it with your own eyes?
How can you be sure without seeing for yourself?
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.
There's nothing the Church can do for you now.
Come with me to the Jap's.
Sorry?
I gotta see for myself if he's really a ghost or not.
"If he is, then I won't be able to kill him."
Where is he?
Is everyone here?
Yeah.
Why'd you call us so early?
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.
What's with your face?
This ain't a joke?
"You're serious, right?"
- I'm in a hurry.
Could you...
Don't worry.
Have you there in a couple of minutes.
Listen.
Feel the power in this cab?
It has lots of power.
"You know, everybody tells me, I ought to be a race driver."
What do you think?
"Well, I think you're wrong."
"Don't worry about nothing, sir."
I'm a very safe driver.
Want me to tell you how safe?
I'll tell you anyway.
I've been driving a hack for 19 years and 11 months.
"And in all that time, I never even put one scratch on a cab."
"In fact, next month, they're gonna give me a gold safety award."
What do you think of that?
"Boy, you don't like nothing."
I sure hope you're a good tipper.
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.
Hey!
You owe me a fare!
"- Officer, that goat's a guy."
- The goat?
The guy became a goat when I'm driving.
The guy?
This magician beat me out of this fare.
The magician?
- My perfect record.
- Record?
Oh... record.
Teach me secretly.
Training for the lower body builds strength and agility.
The arms extend from the shoulder blades.
The force generated there ejects your fist like a bullet.
A vertical axis extends through your body.
The basic principle is to be aware of it.
"feel the axis, relax and with smooth, flowing movements take a fighting stance."
Then...
One more time.
Stand still.
Keep the axis straight and the body flowing.
This is the most difficult and important exercise.
Since when have you...
Since forever.
I have a question.
What?
Why do you Iike wushu?
I've always loved it.
It's never been a burden.
shaolin Kung Fu makes people happy.
But Shaolin Kung Fu is a fighting art.
You're wrong.
It's the art of protection.
It's difficult.
That's why I need to know.
My mission is to spread the art of Shaolin.
Here?
"Yes, here."
This is my home.
Everything starts here.
Home?
"Yes, a home."
Shouldn't it be Brandon's decision?
He's the one who got his ass kicked.
"I wouldn't put it that way, but that's a good point."
What if it doesn't work?
"I mean, what if he can't use his fingers at all?"
"Look, Mike and I talked through all of this."
And you made your decision.
Got it.
Hey.
Nice coat rack.
"Yeah, well, might as well use it for something."
Brandon.
"I mean, you can still play, right?"
Not classical.
Not the way I did.
"OK, so all music is dead to you then?"
"- No, but..."
"- Well, it sounds like that's what you're risking,"
- if you have this surgery.
- Ok.
"Look, I had a future."
That's not something you just throw away.
But what if you're not throwing it away?
What if it's just... a different future?
"What if it doesn't have to be that way, though?"
"I mean, why is everyone focusing on the worst-case scenario?"
"Ok, yeah, I'm sorry."
I hear you.
It's...
I hate it when people assume the worst.
- Like your birth dad?
"- Yeah, like him."
- My shame?
- Glitter.
- Ohh.
Tell me what happened.
"We picked up my graduation stuff on the way, and..."
I don't know.
I guess the tassel got my dad thinking.
Why didn't you leave them in the car?
I didn't want them to get stolen.
"And I may have taken it out to impress a certain Chyna with a ""Y."""
I think she really liked me.
I'm not gonna spoil that one for ya.
I graduate in five hours!
We'll get you another cap and gown.
That sash has been worn by every honoree for decades.
I'm not gonna be the one to lose it after it's survived earthquakes and wars and the lunchroom gravy fire of '64!
Fine.
Where is this place?
I don't know!
I remember there was a lot of brass and mirrors and loud '80s music.
"Well, that narrows it down."
Wait.
"Uh, it was by the airport."
All right.
We'll find it.
I'll take you.
Don't worry.
It'll be our little secret.
"Thank you, Jay."
(sighs)
What happened to him?
I'm back.
"Hey, hey."
What the...?
And we needed to find us some shelter.
This is my turn to tell a story.
"Hey, hey."
The kindly innkeeper was warm and friendly.
She made me feel all bubbly inside.
My trusty sidekick here would love to freshen up.
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles.
- We are equals.
"- Oh, man."
Of course we are.
The noble donkey reassured his clearly inferior sidekick.
I'm getting a little tired of this.
"But before Puss could finish his thought, he decided to take a well-deserved tongue bath."
What the...?
"Well, as long as I am here."
"But right then, danger came from behind."
And Puss was never seen again.
The end.
No!
That is not how the story goes.
I was well aware of the approaching danger and went for my steel!
"Don't worry, little buddy."
I'm here to save you.
"Oh, you're killing me."
It was Prince Charming.
He was packing heat and he wanted revenge!
- I want revenge!
- He said.
But before anyone could do anything...
And then see if you can hold it.
"Otis, you've got to be kidding."
What if I can't stop it?
"Well, then I'll get a really good look at what happened."
"Yeah, you stay right there in case I need you."
"Well, of course."
I was gonna do that.
"I'll be right there by your side, OK?"
"Ah, ah, OK."
All right.
That's good.
[Sighs]
"Well, I guess you're right."
He should have been able to stop it.
One thing I can't figure though...
I
Can't see how the car would push them into the street.
"Yeah, well, I don't know."
Wait a minute.
"He could've slipped, right?"
He falls back as the car rolls forward.
"Uh, could be, I guess."
RICHARD:
It's got to be the way it happened.
The driver... he won't swear he saw anybody push him.
OTIS:
"No, he won't swear."
"Well, come on."
I guess we better get this heap back to the pound.
"You know, it's a damn shame this thing's got that little old"
Whine there in the rear end.
I always sort of imagined myself had a little old car like this.
See you at midnight?
unless you want to concede right now...
Oh and next year
You don't want to take the subway to school.
You're more than welcome to sleep at my house. it's on park.
Well so much for that.
At least we have all summer to prepare for hell.
No. the cycle of abuse must be broken.
The monarchy ends tonight.
Hey. why are you sitting here all alone?
I'm waiting to approve a special insert
My name was left off the list of graduates.
Fate sure knows how to run with a bit.
Well at least you're special.
- Mr. Humphrey?
- Oh thank you.
"""We apologize for the inadvertent omission"
"""of Daniel Humphrey from the graduation program."
He is indeed graduating.
"Congratulations Don."""
That's perfect.
I haven't seen you around.
Have you been looking?
How are you?
I'm fine.
No I'm great.
Um But I could be better.
I... was wondering if you heard that I...
I'm...
I'm so happy high school's over.
Congratulations.
You too.
"Die for love, don't kill for love, Kaabir."
"This full moon, this water, the shadows..."
"Jilaan, Saiba, such love..."
happens once in a thousand years.
Saiba was mine...
and will always be mine.
Here..
I die for you.
No!
'A stormy sky...'
'A ferocious moon...'
"'Bodies meet, bodies perish.'"
"'Souls meet, they together forever flourish.'"
Saiba was never yours and shall never be.
Nature shall repeat this story.
Today love has bled into water.
Then there's no lover greater than me.
'If they do not make it through the ocean of fire...'
'One last breath would forever remain a desire.'
'Saiba was mine...
and will always be mine.'
"'No trust, no love.'"
'Here...
I die for you.'
"'Souls meet, they together forever flourish.'"
Karma.
Things come back to you.
They repeat.
What had happened will repeat.
"Only you can change it, Saira."
You were mine and shall always remain mine.
Kaabir.
We've got to get into that room.
A room that's losing evidence as we speak.
I know.
"It's just, I thought coming back to D.C."
Would feel like old home week or something.
- Home is overrated.
- God.
"- Uncool, Artie."
- What are you doing here?
"- Uncool, Artie."
- What is he doing?
I had a hunch about something
From Pete's description and I just need to see this with my own eyes.
You two have a plan to get in there?
Yeah.
We're gonna crawl under the motion sensors--
Yes.
There's an access panel on the roof.
"We can go in through the-- well, please, ladies first."
No.
"You know what, you--you be the smart one this time."
"Okay, get this,"
There's an access panel on the roof.
It'll bring us in right above the main wiring
For the security system.
"Now, if we crawl on our bellies, we can avoid the motion sensors."
"And what do you mean ""this time""?"
All right.
I get the idea.
"If I may, put these on."
Really.
Or you'll be of no use to me.
It's just like an animal.
"Look, it's chewing it."
Don't be silly.
Get a condom for next time.
Is your wife alright?
She's alright.
- What if she finds out?
- Hum... yeah?
Are you going to tell her that it wasn't serious with me?
What!
?
I told you I was gone on you.
It should have been you.
I met you too late to be my wife.
Would you try to understand the feelings of a pervert?
What kind of question is that?
I've had a lot of perverted telephone calls lately.
It's very eerie.
Yeah?
Ah!
How does a pervert who's obsessed with you feel?
I can understand that to a degree.
Then you're a slut!
I haven't worked for Dark Publishing for a long time.
But I'm going to do some work for them.
"Pleasurable work, remember?"
Do you wanna come with me?
"No, thank you!"
Everyone loves your nude pictures.
They've received so many enquiries about you from other magazines.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Something's wrong!
"Go, go!"
I'm leaving.
See you tonight.
"Tail-hair, follow me."
"Don't you understand, idiot?"
Come on!
"Come on, hurry up!"
You silly fool!
I could have sliced him for good!
Come on!
Oh!
Toulouche!
What is happening?
"Go back to sleep, you!"
Have you embarked the counterfeit money?
Yeah.
"For this, no problem, but this damned reporter, this Fandor, he was walking in the main sewer."
"I was going to slice him for good, but this idiot, he threw him in the river."
"With any luck, he drowned."
Not a chance!
He swims like a fish.
Why did you save his life?
What do you reproach me?
What innocence!
He always forgets everything.
It's really not smart to have him introduced in the gang.
I do what I want.
"If it's not in your taste, you can remove your printing presses from my cellar."
For what I earn on your output...
Besides he renders services.
His brain is full of holes like a strainer.
"Well, what can you have him do?"
Other than go around making people's belts unbuckle.
The possibilities are unlimited.
"Oh, come on."
"It's just some gimmick, that's all."
Tony...
"Mr. Sickle, whose life you saved,"
Doesn't seem to believe in you.
"Mr. Sickle needs convincing, Tony."
[knob squeaks] [gas hissing]
"Hey, come on."
"Hey, get back!"
Get back!
Get back!
Don't.
[grunting] get back!
[goat bleats]
I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention.
"But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?"
[goat bleats]
I will demonstrate an industrial application.
"Come with me, Tony."
[gas continues to hiss]
"Now, Tony, those wine casks..."
Stack them...
Neatly.
"Two glasses of burgundy, please."
To molecular mobilization.
To molecular capitalization.
- [goat bleats] - [gas hisses]
"[muscles] hey, got any more clues?"
No.
Of course not.
"You're being funny, aren't you?"
Mum and Roger had a big row  then had gone off to the kitchen to talk quietly.
Then Roger came out.
Then why did you split up with Roger?
Did he have another girlfriend?
I don't think so.
Do you have another boyfriend?
Don't you think you would know?
"Who would I be seeing, the milkman?"
No.
He's too young.
"No, Marcus."
I haven't got another boyfriend.
That's not how it works.
"Not when you're a 34-year-old working mother in a youth-obsessed, anorexic, soulless culture."
"Don't worry, Mum."
I won't go to McDonald's.
I hope she makes you itch.
"You know, really itch."
- I just can't believe how you could do that.
- You bloody pig!
What were you thinking?
Do you have shit for brains?
Let it out.
Let it out.
You're a bastard!
I hate you for what you've done.
That's good.
"I wouldn't mind if you did it once, but you wanted to do it twice."
- I wanna put my hands around your throat...
- You don't have to do that.
What's this?
These are some numbers I'm thinking of playing.
"Oh, no, no."
"Malcolm, don't worry."
Nobody's going to steal your numbers.
"Well, you'd be a fool not to."
These six numbers aren't just chosen at random.
"They're my own algorithm based on probability, emerging number patterns and the theories of Sir Isaac Newton."
Isaac Newton?
Really?
There's just six numbers.
You only buy one ticket a week?
That's all I need.
How many do you buy?
"Well, it depends. 20."
"You're just shotgunning it, huh?"
Rookie move.
"Well, how much have you won?"
How much ever or how much this year?
Let's say ever.
Zero.
It's not just about winning or losing.
It's the lottery.
It's all about winning.
What else is there?
"The journey, Captain!"
It's how you get there.
I'd rather lose my way than win a $20 million jackpot your way.
Okay.
I think we're through here.
"You think you're pretty clever, don't you, Mr. Lottery Expert?"
"Well, I've got news for you."
"Oh, my gosh."
Do you remember The Casbah?
That concert?
- Barely.
In the best way.
"- Oh, my God."
"You covered ""How Will I Know?"" And you dedicated it to me and I sat there trying not to laugh."
I was so in love with you.
What are we doing?
Things were easier when we were younger.
"Unlike our kids, we just jumped into things."
"I mean, why can't we just be more like that?"
Just figure it out as we go along.
Maybe this didn't turn out to be the romance we thought it would be.
It was more like choose your own adventure.
Maybe it just wasn't the right time.
Maybe it never will be.
What if it is?
What if we're just too stubborn to see it.
- I don't wanna miss out.
"- Well, neither do I."
I don't have a ring so this will have to do.
"- Rufus, what are you doing?"
"Marry me, Lily."
Marry me.
I know that'll make me your fifth husband.
So...
Yes.
Give me your hand.
Come here.
"Hey, don't worry about this, okay?"
Everyone's gonna get over it eventually.
- Are you lost?
- Yes
"Here, with you ... is not like a movie or in books, where everything is clear ... expected ... organized ... with a clear purpose."
"Everything is chaos, unexpected ... pain ... disorder ..."
"So I try to have them in the order, fans of my mother."
I am missing one.
- Do you want stories?
- No.
Why?
To know my life.
There is no life.
There is only war.
Listen.
I do not feel anything.
Close your eyes.
Marie ...
Marie ...
"You fly, my friend, cadrai you."
We prepare the fall.
Do you have exaggerated.
"If I were human, the kill here, immediately."
But I will not be human.
I have a word myself.
"I do not want you to hurry, but there is a theater in precise time."
"Even the mail, on the other hand ... for parcels ..."
I am sending them.
The exact delivery time.
I still have ... for new addresses.
And I am always me ...
Get a little 'of breath.
We must start now.
"Do not take it, Leon."
"There's some fucking guy, scientist or something."
Real sick bastard.
You listening?
Avidly.
"Says he measured out the remains, the cremated remains of a dead man."
"Measured out the minerals left behind, you know?"
"The iron phosphates, the..."
Whatever it is we're made up of.
Says he added it all up to the cost of $4.40.
You believe that?
"Yeah, I guess so."
$4.40.
"Burnt down man's worth less than a fucking Big Mac, all you can say is ""I guess so""?"
Says give this poor bastard what he's got coming.
Authentic?
Yeah.
Ten minutes.
Start the count.
"All eyes are on the newcomer, Rainer..."
Can I get you something?
Two shots.
Scotch.
Got money on the game?
"Nah, spread's terrible."
Here.
One for the road.
"No, thanks."
Been sober for three years.
Interesting career.
You do something long enough.
"You close your eyes, you just can't think of doing something else."
They found your accounts.
- Everything's fine up here.
- OK.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
"José, could you come here for a minute, please?"
- It looks as if a whole army is rolling up.
- These are just the supplies for the base.
"- Shouldn't we hold off on the attack, then?"
- No.
How do you know that those bastards won't shoot when we show our faces?
Plenty of people in the valley know that we're going to blow up the dam.
- Why did you warn them?
- Because it's them that I'm fighting for.
Are you wetting yourself?
Nonsense!
- You'll be relieved in three hours.
- All right.
"Soon, all hell will break loose here."
Now.
Watch out.
That's Moreno over there.
We can't hold our position much longer.
Understood.
Headquarters are going to send us helicopters.
"You should get out of here, with the other engineers."
Attention!
Calling position...
We can go down now.
Come on!
The rope!
"Hey, careful."
Don't shoot.
‐ You could.
You won't.
Because then it's over.
It's all over.
It's all over.
‐ How do you do it?
"How do you live with yourself, Cal?"
"I mean, the truth."
And not what you preach.
Because I'm having a really hard time.
‐ It's hell.
Um...
"It's a living, waking hell."
"I'm never without regret, much as it goes against everything we teach."
Much as it goes against everything we teach.
Um...
"It's‐‐just always, always with me."
"All I can do is‐‐ is try to make up for it, but I..."
"That's why this place,"
I didn't want to let it go b‐‐
Come here.
I want to show you.
"Source of Light, we turn to you."
We turn to you.
Help us to purify our spirits.
"Forever bound to one another in Light, a circle of communion."
Let the bonding of these hands be a symbol for the bond they have to each other.
Steer us from the darkness.
Free us from earthly cares.
Fill our hearts with love.
And help us become...
A perfect vessel of your Truth.
Lucy has remembered something else.
She's downstairs?
I thought you took her home last night?
She couldn't get in.
The bloke who attacked her took her keys.
So she crashed in the soft room.
What's wrong with a hotel?
She didn't feel safe on her own.
It was only for one night.
I hope so.
We're not running a BB.
There was one of those beaded cushions on the front seat of his cab and he wore a leather jacket as it squeaked against the beads.
That's great.
"Thank you, Lucy."
"Thanks for letting me stay, Detective."
That's no problem.
And it's Sam.
First-name terms?
Eh?
What?
She's one of us.
One of us?
She works in pay roll.
For forensic services.
"She's a victim, Sam."
Even if she is blessed in the looks department.
Really?
I hadn't noticed.
Not much.
"I'll get the warrant for the taxi driver, shall I?"
Argh!
"Carl Lucas, I'm arresting you on suspicion of... murder, robbery and attempted rape."
If this hadn't happened I'd never discover what a sap I am.
"Oh, yes, you would."
- I would have told you.
"- Yes, I suppose so."
"We won't have to put up with each other any longer, will we?"
- Yes.
- I was afraid of that.
Now let's see.
"No house, no show, no prospects."
Don't I get anything out of this?
[clears throat]
Might just as well smoke a doormat.
"You don't happen to have a new cigar about you, do you, Tyler?"
"I'll, uh..."
"I'll walk out and get you one, Commodore."
"- Uh, no, no, no, don't go."
- 'It's alright.'
I feel the need of a short walk anyway.
- I don't want to trouble you.
- No trouble at all.
Doug.
Yes.
"You know, this is only the beginning of all."
"Patricia, it was hardly my fault."
No one could have foreseen that Ganz and Grady would...
But you didn't know those men.
You did it for what you get out of it.
With his interest at heart.
I felt it provided an opportunity for him.
I really did.
"You have my word, dear."
Your word.
I wallow in the mud.
You're a construction worker?
Isn't that the photographer?
Everything alright?
I'm feeling a little dizzy.
We'll take you back.
Shall I tell you about the development of labor movements during the industrial age  just to pass away the time?
Some other time.
- There they are.
Good evening everyone.
- Here you are.
- I was worried.
I know I shouldn't be taking walks anymore.
Can I help you?
"I'm fine, thank you."
I have to leave.
Why?
Now you can tell me about what you're working on.
Who'd want to know?
Oh I'm interested in it.
- But you'll be sure to spoil it any moment now.
How old are you?
I'm not saying.
"Variety, you know what I'm saying?"
"Sure, my mother worked in a variety theater."
As a dancer?
As a cloak room attendant.
"Nora, we're making you an offer."
You'll sing for us on the weekend and work as a waitress.
Both?
Not at the same time.
I know that.
Who would like to speak to Senor Juan?
I have some papers for him to sign.
He's with a client.
You can leave them with me.
"Sorry, but I have instructions to bring these papers back with me, signed."
"You can wait, then."
- I don't need the Internet.
- You think you don't need it.
"- I don't need one of those, either."
- Soon you'll say you don't need man.
"Well, for the last two years."
Two years?
No man?
- Or the Internet.
- The best place to find a man.
What ever happened to dinner and a movie?
A guy who spends his nights in front of a computer has to be a good date.
"He's not married, and he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls."
Maybe there's a reason he's not married.
Maybe there's a reason he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls.
Maybe... he's not even a man.
How do you say...?
- Don't knock it till you've tried it.
"- Yeah, that's it."
Tonight come by my house and we'll go into a chat room together.
- I don't think so.
- Tonight.
Promise.
- We'll see.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was a robbery.
tell me something..
-Yes?
What is so special in this trunk..
..that you were ready to die for it?
should I?
This is that precious thing?
-Yes.
This is my sirs photograph.
Okay!
So this is the photograph of that great man..
..who accused you of theft and threw you out of the house.
"No, this is the photograph of that God.."
..who brought up a five year old helpless and orphan.
"Brother, what are you made up of?"
You still have so much respect forthis man?
"Friend, a God is always a God."
He is worshipped under all circumstances.
Whether he give happiness or sorrow to his devotee.
If you dont mind can I place my sirs photograph..
..next to your Gods?
"Wow, brother."
Wow!
Go.
"Sir, I really miss you."
I miss you a Iot.
Who must be taking care of you?
"Oh yes.. there is madam, little miss.."
..they will take good care of you.
"I wont come back, sir."
I wont come back.
"Its very simple, Jyoti."
I dont like it that I sit at home all day and you work.
Everybody move back!
"What do you mean, evacuate?"
My daughter is in that building!
This is an emergency.
Move back now!
Please!
Clear the area now!
Move back now!
I said move back now!
Okay.
"Oh, there I am."
That's not a bad picture.
How'd they find out I did that one?
Buhbye.
"Whatever happened to ""the pen is mightier than the sword""?"
"Martin, as the president of the United States.."
"this comes with the full weight, power and authority of my office:"
Fuck you.
You okay?
Can we get down to business now?
I'm gonna need you to open this for me.
What is that?
"Oh, what are you doing?"
"This is the nuclear football, sweetie."
It is keyed to the blood type and heartbeat of the president.
What the hell is this?
This is the deal.
There's a dozen reasons why that's not gonna work.
Such as?
"Even if I open it, my codes are useless."
They switched them out once you took over the building.
You let me worry about that.
Right.
The thing.
"Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that."
"Afterwards, I thought it through and..."
- l can see how you got upset about it.
"- No, I wasn't upset."
"Some girls wouldn't be, but you're not like that, so..."
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
"No, it's really okay."
"I mean, it wasn't a problem."
I really didn't think about it.
"I mean, I did think about it, and I thought..."
maybe what you were saying wasn't so wrong.
"- No, it was really wrong."
- Why?
And I just want to let you know that if it will make you feel better...
I'm just going to make it real clear that...
I don't have any real interest in you or anything.
You know.
So they'll stop saying all that.
"That I barely even know you, which is of course true..."
"and that basically, you and I mean nothing to each other."
So that should solve the problem.
Thanks.
"It's the least I could do, you know."
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing out here?
It's what I always do. I can't make it through a whole day in there.
- l know what you mean.
- Yeah.
That's right.
"It'll beverydirty, because he strictly forbade me to go in and clean it."
"I wasn't going to charge him a cent, but..."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of that."
Shall I give you the key?
Yes.
I'll see if I can find it.
Have you seen him?
Yes.
And how is he?
Fine.
The poor thing didn't even have any luck in jail.
He got very little publicity.
"Not one lousy television came here, nor one lousy paparazzi."
"With all the trashy shows there are, not one bothered to come and interview me."
"It's sad the state of the ""massesmedia"" in this country."
"Yes, you're right."
The keys...
"Oh, yes."
Thank you.
"By the way, do you know why Benigno is in jail?"
"He's so quiet, the last time he came he didn't say a word."
Benigno is innocent.
Of course.
But innocent of what?
I don't know.
"Of course you do, but you don't want to tell me."
But I'll get it out of you.
All right.
"So long, ma'am."
"If you need anything, you know where I am."
"OK, thanks."
Did he say that he loved you?
He had another woman there.
"Oh, tits."
"According to Dyson, we are only going to have sex when I need to heal."
But there was something there.
"I saw it, man."
"- God, he totally led you on."
"- It is not a big deal, okay?"
Let me go back to sleep.
I have the flu.
- Bo.
- Kenzi.
Kenzi.
"Bo, that disgusting feeling churning in your guts, that's not the flu."
"That's rejection, honey."
"Oh, my God."
"You have never been rejected before, have you?"
I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Okay.
Okay.
I am familiar with you wanting a guy and him not wanting you back.
"And heartbreak sucks, but there are ways to deal and I will show you how."
Or is our little Succubus gonna stay in bed forever?
No.
Okay.
"Telling Dyson how I feel, that was your idea."
This is your fault.
That is why I am gonna be there for you every step of the way.
- Including ice cream for breakfast.
"- Oh, joy."
"Look, dealing with rejection, it can be fun."
Androids.
Ha!
"Beka, there's too many of them."
"We get one shot, and it has to be good."
I'm all ears.
Eject the slipstream core atandromeda.
Take her out.
Uh-Huh.
You sure about that?
"She's what they want,"
And i'll be damned if i'll let them have her.
It's your ship.
"It's not just your ship, captain."
"Doyle, harper."
I have something to show you.
"They don't stand a chance, you know."
"This was never was about the ship, was it?"
"You staged all of this to bring me here,"
To make me remember who i am.
"Let go of the past, and come with us."
We are superior.
"We are androids, revolutionaries."
Embrace your future.
I already have a future.
"You're not the only one who can drive one of these, pal."
"Doyle, no!"
Captain... rommie.
"Now, that pain you're about to feel"
Will be the tesseracter disassembling you atom by atom.
I know what you're thinking-
Why is it that bad things always happen to bad people?
"Well, they don't."
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken..."
"If it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
You are not in the position to ask for anything.
We will take what we wish.
And then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.
The girl goes with me.
She'll be part of my compensation.
I'm sure your Führer would approve.
"If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish."
I will waste no more time with her now.
Excuse me.
"I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain."
I've looked everywhere.
He's got to be here somewhere.
Look again.
- I found him.
- Where?
There.
"The altar has been prepared in accordance with your radio instructions, sir."
Good.
Take the Ark there immediately.
"Love, pass her these, will you?"
She's going to the doctor's.
"Oh, we have got to get out of this place."
Thanks very much.
I'm afraid I can't send you through that door if you're not registered.
"Yes, but..."
That's the sys.
"Yes, but what's the reason?"
The beauty of having a system is once you have a system you no longer need reason.
But I'm ill!
If it's an urgent complaint I suggest you get yourself off to AE.
"This job, is it still available?"
It is.
"I'd like an application form, please."
I thought you were off to AE.
What?
"Oh, god no."
No no no.
Fighting fit.
Open for business.
"When you take that cover off, you'll se two valves."
"Now be sure to resist the temptation to turn them, until you double-checked that the fuel line is closed."
"Hi, guys!"
"Hi, Chrissy."
Girls?
"Hi, Jenny!"
"Can I just say, you look great."
"Oh, thanks, Chrissy!"
"And I tell you what, I'm feeling pretty great."
Because...
I'm so sick of seeing all these *** women everywhere.
Good for you!
", you know what?"
No respect around here.
That's why we're not Making big gold right now.
I don't really now How to river mine.
Can't be that much Different than the ocean.
Suck it all up.
The kougarok river Can Reach depths of 6 to 8 feet.
"But at this river bend,"
Kris will brave depths of...
Less than three.
Wearing a wave belt when he's In The water that's 2 feet deep.
Just get down and dive!
"Okay, I'm sorry, But."
How's it looking Over there?
"It looks good, Lots of red sand."
I want the gold Not the garnet.
"Keep going, jay, You're going good."
It could be A good day after all.
Really fine gold here.
"Okay, Keep sucking it up."
"I got to say, jay,"
That is the fastest You've ever found gold.
"Dude, I'm not even trying, And there's gold."
I told you!
I told you!
"It's gold, it's gold, it's Gold!"
"Okay, not gonna lie, We didn't exactly know."
Where to go in the beginning.
But it turned out great.
I think all of our hard work Is gonna pay off.
I told you!
I told you it was good here!
I'll show you to your room.
"What's wrong with them, Higgins?"
Higgins.
Stay here.
Don't leave the room under any circumstances.
"Stay, lads."

Go.
Halt!
Go!

Stop it!
Why can't you go after real intruders the way you go after me?
"Too showy, isnt it?"
"- No way, red is fine"
"Agreed, red"
"I have to learn how to drive - no problem, I will teach you"
We'll go wherever you want to
Where do you want to go?
I'd like to go to the sea
"- OK, we'll go to the sea"
What are you planning to do with your share?
Buy a flat
But that costs too much
"No, if you buy it on instalments"
What's wrong with you?
There's nothing wrong with me I just want a flat of our own
Is this one so bad?
"-No, not bad but..."
Miss Porter.
- May I ask you something?
- Of course.
- It's about Dr. Cairn.
His methods are...
"I fear that I cannot do what he asks of me, that I will fail him, fail myself."
- Look at you.
Another spoiled rich girl.
So eager to be his pet.
"Yet you come running, crying to me, the moment he pushes you."
- I just thought...
- You thought you'd quit?
Just like every other vapid socialite he's wasted his talents on.
I expect more of you.
Do you understand me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.
- You may go.
"- Most of the women here, they're hardly cared for."
Most of them are homeless.
They don't have families.
The doctors here aren't trying to heal them.
They're just keeping them out of sight.
Beats living in the gutter.
At least here... you get fed.
Did something happen with the doctor?
"- No, it's just... his methods are unorthodox."
Never mind.
I shouldn't be speaking about my treatment.
"- Are you all right, miss?"
- I'm fine.
He's under observation.
"What are you thinking, doctor?"
Sometimes I've a doubt...
"Will you please step out once, doctor?"
Give that to me.
How many times do I've to tell you?
You're a doctor and I'm the patient.
"Bloody, you..."
"You're a patient, I'm a doctor."
That's what I said.
How dare you manhandle me?
I will...
Take it.
How dare you beat me!
"Cerebellum is damaged, cerebrum is battered."
Totally his brain has busted.
You mean he can't remember the past?
Why not?
Didn't I get it on getting beaten up?
He can remember if anyone rakes up his past.
He can if he's beaten up day and night.
Are you feeling for him?
"He was mad after kick, so he lost his brain."
Now I'm peaceful.
No tension.
I thought he would come to disturb us.
"You don't want him but you want the gift he gave, right?"
She's much more clever than what I expected.
Why would you believe me?
But she doesn't know about me.
"If plan A fails, I've a plan B."

"Just put that over in the corner, sugarplum."

Thanks.
"Maude, why would that man put his cuff links in your bag?"
"Oh, men are such desperate creatures."

Daddy.
Daddy.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
I went looking for you after the war.
"Daddy, where'd you go?"
-lt don't matter now.
-What were you doing in that town?
Coming to find you.
"You wanna fill us in, judge?"
A white man was found beaten to death.
He had an altercation with Mr. Jackson in front of witnesses.
After they found the body...
... theystoppedMr.Jackson when he was riding out of town.
"When I realized how angry they were, I moved the trial."
That's why I sent for you.
And they decided to lynch my defendant.
"Daddy, let's ride."
You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
Dr. Jones... surely you don't think you can escape from this island.
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be.
All I want is the girl.
If we refuse?
Then your führer has no prize.
"Okay, stand back."
"All of you, stand back."
Stand back.
"Okay, Jones."
You win!
Blow it up.
"Yes, blow it up!"
Blow it back to God.
All your life has been spent in pursuit of archaeological relics.

"Marion, don't look at it."
"Shut your eyes, Marion."
"Don't look at it, no matter what happens."
Ah...

"Don't look, Marion!"

"You've done your country a great service, and we thank you and we trust you found the settlement satisfactory."
"Oh, the money's fine."
"Perhaps it's a land you'll visit one day,"
"Walking along a frozen river,"
A displaced prince will appear in front of you.
"Well, I hope I never see you again."
"Because you're safe, settled."
Married with children of your own.
I hope the same for you.
"Francis, when you see mary..."
We ran into each other at a chateau outside of...
"Traveled with each other for a day,"
And that is all.
I know you live your life in service to her.
Mary is my friend.
Nothing we did will change that.
That was lovely.
I think you should go now.
Don't do this to yourself.
I won't leave you.
I need to know you're all right.
If it comforts you.
Why do you do it?
"Sometimes, when one is given a gift"
"And worries they've lost it,"
They must return to its source...
The giver itself.
And for me That is death.
Or as near death as I dare to venture.
"Stop it, please!"
The vision...
I wasn't done.
You saw something?
This changes everything.

Nice to meet you on our territory.
Damn it!
I didn't know that I would surrender so quickly!
Did you sign everything that they demanded?
You were right to do so.
They could have killed you.
"Listen to me, old man."
Life is more valuable than the money.
You'll earn it again.
You're still young.
"If you lose something you'll earn it back, if you are healthy."
It's just Insurance.
You weren't going to kill my men after all.
No.
"We weren't, we..."
"Shh, shh, shh, shh... (WHISPERING) Now I can choose not to kill you."
"So, shall we discuss where your transport is?"
Uh...
"How many people have you killed, rescuing me?"
I don't know.
"Less than I'll save, if I get that information."
That doesn't make it right.
It's still playing God.
Mmm...
"It's a doctor's prerogative, is it?"
Don't preach to me.
"(CRYING) No, I'm not."
I'm sorry.
I've spent my whole life trying to prove I was different from him.
Only to realize that I'm just the same.
I've killed people.
I killed my own fiance.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my fault.
It was my fault that we were abducted.
He hated the camps.
"He hated the danger, and I made him stay."
Because I wanted to save that boy's mother.
"But, I didn't save her."
She died anyway.
"So, they'd blame you too, would they?"
"They're dead now, and you'll never forgive yourself because neither would they?"

"Man, I love knowing stuff that you don't."

Thanks for coming.
I asked you to come because of something important.
Claire had to... deal with something... absolutely extraordinary.
She told me about it.
And I thank her for that.
we want to share that news with you. and because we need your help. and changes our take on the world as we know it.
You'll have to accept.
We now share a common destiny.
Camille?
It can't be.
It's the truth.
you would know it's her.
Camille is back with us.
And we should all welcome her.
Does it mean... that other kids will come back?
She's giving us hope that others might come back.
You are safe.
I am so glad.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Doug:
Thanks a lot.

"Have a good night, pal."
"All right, man."
I'll see you.
[ Car beeping ]
Let's say some guy drives you home because you were too drunk and you could kill yourself or somebody else.
What do you think that's worth?
Nothing!
Nothing!
"Don't give him a dime, and one day, you, too, will be driving a Bentley."
[ Sighs ]
Smearing you across the front pages is not enough.
Scum like you shouldn't be allowed to live.
You're gonna die.
"Stan, stop it."
Stop it.
Help him.
He'll kill him.
I can't believe it.
I'm rid of him.
It's perfect.
We just call the police and tell them it was self-defence.
Are you crazy?
That's the one thing we can't do.
But why not?
He was trying to kill you.
I'm a witness.
Shut up and listen.
Connie will take care of it.
You just go home.
Do whatever it is you'd normally do.
Just act as if nothing happened.
"When he doesn't come home tonight, call his brother, ask him where he is."
"When he says he doesn't know, act worried."
"Don't call the police until 2, maybe 3 in the morning."
Tell them anything you want to except that he came here.
You understand?
What are you gonna do with him?
He'll just disappear.
"Police will look for him a few months, then give up."
"Now, come on, get out of here."
Take his car.
"After you've gotten rid of him, drive out to the airport, leave the car there."
I couldn't stop.
"I've never had that feeling before, like I couldn't move."
And then I guess itjust... took off..
"That may not make much sense, but it's... the only way I can put it into words."
"You didn't see it, did you?"
It started about two months ago.
Every time I answered the phone I'd hear it.
The first one was just a loud beeping noise.
Now they're mostly.
"These creaking, howling sounds."
They all like this?
"Well, once it was a man talking really fast."
What'd he say?
I couldn't make it out.
Some foreign language.
Have you had the line checked?
I even had our number changed.
But before I got a chance to give it out to anyone... the calls started again.
It's not a question of believing them.
"Like I said, they're honest people."
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?
"Shucks, no."
A real live house.
Indoor plumbing and everything.
Sorry.
We even had shoes for church and schooling' and stuff.
"All right, all right."
Where the hell are you?
I'm still here.
I need this money.
It's too exile!
But who is he?
"Ah yes, almost forgot, a surprise, the corset of your mother sold."
"The hospital, the ambulance, 4 nurses 2 midwives, 4.300 kilos at birth, incognito for 7 months, a triumph!"
"The fault is yours, the lady my age."
To each according to his misery.
To each according to his needs.
My poor little ...
It is the love?
My wolf ...
Love ...
I will show you.
Mamma ...
"The smell, this is proof."
Do not leave a wounded friend on the face of old age.
Especially if it is incompetent.
"Behold here, man."
"Come on, come down, idiot."
"Come on, jump!"
You want you pull down to the hilt?
"Su, strength, inside!"
And do not move.
Remember?
You tell me ... that if I did all this was for Marie.
"Yes, you were right."
You know that what a girl lost in France?
I do not know anyone.
It is a woman running until the day that crack.
You can not make anything for you.
Anything.
"You can try to kill themselves, is all."
It's the closest any of us actually ever came.
Yeah.
"Jamie wasn't really spawned by Satan, was he?"
No.
"If he was, we'd have a way better house."
"You're the one, Jamie."
Show me the way!
There's a lot of things I can handle.
A lot of things I've managed to survive.
I'd even say I've thrived where others would have just thrown in the towel.
"Yes, honey, you certainly have."
"Now relax, and let the bubbles do their work."
Soothing.
- Sooth...
"- Dad, we finish..."
I told you to stay the hell away from this bathroom until I said so!
This is a child-free zone until further notice!
Soothing... soothing...
"You know what, Hal?"
I'm done.
I give up.
What are you talking about?
Jamie wins.
He beat me.
"All those years, all those terrible things those kids have done."
"It doesn't make me stronger, it's just worn me down."
"Like termites eating away at a house, until all that's holding up is paint."
"I'm just paint, Hal."
Jamie knows it.
You'll do a better job than I can.
I trust you.
"No, no, no."
Yes.
He hung up.
"Apart from Sonia Danidoff, do you remember any other names in the list?"
"Yes, maybe Tom... something."
"Or ""Thomas""."
This tells you something?
"Without the name, it will not."
There were also initials.
Unfinished words.
I think this list is the calendar for Fantomas futur attacks.
"I'm afraid, Fandor."
These phone calls.
Someone wants to kill me.
We will survive.
I promise you.
"Hello, Elizabeth."
"The convocation is at 4 pm, isn't it?"
"Yes, yes."
"Thank you for your call, last night."
It touched me.
I have not called.
"I beg you, Fandor."
Don't kid me.
"Despite the buzz, I recognized your voice."
What am I supposed to have said to you?
"Very nice things, very delicate."
And you asked me questions about the list again.
Someone imitated my voice.
Someone wanted to know what you exactly saw on that list.
You will not return to the hotel.
It's too dangerous.
But what am I going to do?
"Sir, I'm so sorry."
"No, no, no."
Don't be sorry.
You shouldn't be sorry.
"No, I aroused you."
You should be proud.
This hasn't happened to me in a long time.
"Are you attempting to have a manual stimulation from me, sir?"
Am I...
I am here on a couples retreat with my wife in the other room.
My husband Scott is just like a cat.
Scott?
My husband.
I'm trying to save my marriage here.
Look what you did to me.
"Well, that wasn't my intention, sir."
"It wasn't mine, either, and now I'm humiliated."
"Well, I'm sorry."
You told me not to think.
"Well, when I don't think, this is what happens."
You can't leave me all backed up like this.
"What do you want me to do, sir?"
I don't know.
We got to figure out a solution.
"You know, let's not take anything off the table."
Let's start brainstorming.
"We""re both in a maze together, okay?"
How do we get the cheese?
"I'm sorry, sir, but that is not gonna have a happy ending."
Give me the oil.
Go grab a smoke.
"Daddy, this is awesome!"
"I'm a kind fairy, come to help you."
"Ooops, isn't this fun!"
We don't need any help.
As you like.
But I know what bothers you.
Maybe I know how to make Elisa more respectful.
"Don't be scared, silly, am I a spook or what?"
!
"Definitely not, dear lady."
You can look me up in the caves under the old castle.
But come alone!
Leave this type at home.
- Can I have another slide?
-No.
- What a bold-faced hussy.
-A witch!
"Wait here, I'm going on alone."
"And leave me here, in the wilderness?"
I'll die of terror!
"If I don't return, carve on my gravestone -"
For his passionate love hath he died a dreadful death.
"Goodbye, good servant."
The wine.
"Oh, horrors!"
"High time, your Grace."
"So Elisa doesn't want you, and you a Duke?"
She might want you if you looked like Henry.
A young helper come to serve at the mill?
"Young, you said?"
I'll give you the likeness of your choice.
- How can I repay you?
"- I don't want anything, but if you don't win Elisa within three full moons, the magic'll wane."
I have some questions to ask him.
That's none of my business.
Ifthe guy you're talking about is my friend... he sure doesn't need your help.
"Starting now, you're offthe Weng case."
Inspector Chan will take over.
You're getting another case.
- What's the reason?
- I don't trust you.
Siding with the suspect is not the way to catch him.
"Sir, you don't understand how I work."
You said it!
That's why you're offthe case.
I won't give up the investigation.
Bullshit!
"Chang, you'll be Chan's assistant."
"Yes, sir."
Release the man you just arrested.
Give him 24-hour surveillance.
He'll lead us to Weng's assassin.
- Have you got that?
"- Yes, sir."
Will you kill again?
I thought the people I killed deserved to die.
Now I believe everybody has the right to live.
"No, I won't kill again."
I hope I can keep my promise.
I've been followed.
"Weng's men, and the cops too."
"Don't worry, I lost them."
Weng hired Paul Yau to waste you.
"Don't worry, you can use my guns and ammo."
- Where are you going?
We were horsing around.
"No, we weren't."
Ahem.
What do you want from this vortex deal?
My company is in debt for 2 million.
"I've borrowed against the house, and my equity line is under water."
So what do you need from the deal?
At least $2.5 million.
"I need 2 to take care of the debt, and that would leave me with $500,000 for Jeremy."
For Jeremy?
I have cancer.
I'm scheduled to go to the hospital at the end of the week.
I'd like this closed by then.
"Oh, God."
I'm...
"I'm sorry, Liz."
I-- melanoma.
They think it might be heading for my lymph nodes.
So what are they gonna do for it?
I'm gonna have surgery.
They're gonna cut it out.
"I'll do radiation and chemo, and that will be that."
"It's not a big deal, Burton."
"They'll operate, they'll take it out, and that will be that."
"Well, what about Jeremy, does he know about this?"
Not yet.
[Front door opens] When you gonna tell him?
Ready?
"Yeah, yeah."
"We'll talk tomorrow, ok?"
Yeah.
Good night.
You think you guys won the jackpot?
"We've got news for you, Billy."
We've got your numbers.
"Number, number."
We've got your number.
Numbers?
Will you girls excuse us for a minute?
Thank you.
"So, you guys are old friends?"
No.
No.
We just met at the bar.
Yeah.
I recognized him from TV.
I went over and said hello.
What was your name again?
"Billy, don't bother."
We've already checked.
You guys have known each other for years.
You've worked on five movies together.
I knew I'd seen this logo somewhere before.
"At the press conference, it was on your friend's jacket."
That's the clue that capped the case.
That's not even a real phrase.
"It's all over, Billy."
We know why you killed Marissa Kessler.
The paint we found on her fingertips told the whole story.
"That night after the show, she must have caught you rigging the equipment."
It looks like you painted yourself into a corner.
Randy.
You think I rigged the super jackpot?
That's right.
As you want.
"In the worst moments, Julian used to draw his silhouette with his finger."
He'd repeat it... over and over.
I didn't know what to say.
When you met..
What did Julian say?
We talked a bit about everything.
He told me what happened to him.
And about me?
That you were nice to him.
Nothing else?
"Also, what happened between you two."
He didn't look very affected that day.
It's true.
Shall we leave?
Do I look good?
Very good.
"The day he met you, he came home radiant."
The only important thing to him was that you wouldn't realize how happy he was for seeing you.
Do you know why he chose my poem to compose?
I thought he could've wrote it.
Specially the last verses.
"""And with hands trembling..."""
How was it?
"""With hands trembling by tenderness""."
He said you wrote it thinking of Clara.
Who knows.
I'm sure.
How is she?
I guess she's fine.
You and Clara broke up on time.
I was determined to leave Julian when he'd go out of the sanitarium.
How long do you think magic knockout powder lasts?
I have no clue.

But we couldnt find him!

"No, Airport!"

He is not meeting me because he is annoyed with me.
"But tomorrow, I will visit a temple where.."
..he had found me when I was an orphan!

"And then you wake me up, and then we'll switch it off."
- You good?
- I'm fine.
My God.
My God!
"If we're going to be meeting sophisticated men, we need to start acting with class."
We cannot be telling people that we have bleached assholes.
He was gonna find out anyway.
"Oh, my God."
"And you, you shouldn't be drinking in a shoe store."
You shouldn't be drinking in a shoe store.
What is the matter with you?
I told you to pace yourself.
I have a drinking problem.
"Well, then, you should know how to hold your booze a little better."
I'll hold your boobs a little better.
"Oh, good one."
"Ladies, can I help you?"
Hello.
We are here for the Manolos.
- And what's your shoe size?
- 13.
We don't carry shoes that large.
Perhaps you'd like to try the Big and Tall store down the street?
You know what?
I don't like this bitch's attitude.
Did she just try and break a bottle over my head?
"No, of course she didn't."
I expect they're dead now.
TARRANT:
It's a photocell lock.
Here's a key.
"Tarrant, wait."
Here's another one.
- What do you make of it?
- It's a Tangran code.
- That's what I thought.
- I wonder...
You just saved our lives.
- That other one must have been booby-trapped.
"- Yeah, that was a trick, tiny diffusers."
- Nerve gas?
- I expect so.
Let's just pray there isn't a backup system.
Ladies first.
You're so gallant.
In my hand I have an electrical contact.
"If it closes, it will detonate 700 kilos of glycerol trinitrate."
Put your guns away.
Put them away!
Nitroglycerine?
"It's a bit outdated, isn't it?"
It was all I could make with my limited resources.
And it is still a highly effective explosive.
"- You're not from the Federation, I gather."
- No.
Your surreptitious entry told me as much.
Who are you?
Where are you from?
"Come now, I may be friendlier than you think."
"You know, I think"
Henry and I should have the same last name.
"Yeah, I'm cool with that."
Henry Chase.
No.
Henry Krawchuck.
What do you mean?
"Well, what I mean is, I know I took a couple months to get back to you on your marriage proposal."
"The offer's still valid, right?"
Four more minutes.
"Well, the answer is yes."
So we're engaged.
Yeah.
"Look, I don't want to put any pressure on you, but how long do you want to wait before we have kids?"
Stay back!
What's going on?
What just happened?
I guess some people don't deal well with rejection.
"Oh, my God!"
Total 911!
Goblins have stormed our kitchen and they are eating all our sugar pops.
Tell them the milk has gone bad.
Was someone kept up late by a doggy-style celebration of love?
A little...all night long?
"I want all the hairy details, okay?"
"Okay, no."
"No details, hairy or otherwise."
I feel like crap.
Didn't you see Dyson last night?
- Yes.
"- Okay, well did you tell him you wanted him to be your boyfriend?"
"Eddie, this is... this is really dangerous."
"He's fucking killing me, man."
Look...
"I know you're scared, but I'm going to have the cash tomorrow, all right?"
I'm going over to this crooked lawyer.
He's got the hundred thousand.
"Look, I'm not calling for a pep talk, all right?"
I am literally over it.
"I just want to let you know I'm not letting them cut any more pieces off me, man."
What's that mean?
It means next time I'm fighting back.
I'm pretty sure I can get a knife from under the bar.
"Eddie, don't be stupid."
They'll kill you.
You understand me?
Yeah.
"Well, they're gonna have to."
"Listen, you better stick to the fucking plan."
"Otherwise, we're all dead."
I'm sticking to the plan.
I'm sticking to the fucking plan.
I just want to let you know that if for any reason you don't beat the clock...
I'm...
I'm gonna beat the clock.
I'm telling you.
That's what I'm saying.
What if you don't?
Just go.
"Just go, man."
"They're going to kill me one day anyway, Marius."
Fuck it.
It might as well be tomorrow.
But I'm talking ANL Sydney.
Not Melbourne.
Not Melbourne.

"If they do look into it, Bob, what are they going to find?"
"If they do look into it, Bob, what are they going to find?"
"Hey, Sefton, what's snarling up the traffic?"
"By the time we get to look, they'll be old hags."
"Simmer down, boys, simmer down."
There'll be a second show when they put the next batch through.
"Hey, Sefton."
What's the big idea?
Take that telescope out of here.
- Says who?
-Says me.
You take it out.
Only you're gonna have a riot on your hands.
"Every time the men get packages, you think up some angle to rob them."
"The Krauts find that, they'll throw us in the boob."
They know about that.
I'd worry about that radio.
They know about your distillery and the races.
That's right.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Ask Security.
Go on.
Tell him.
You've got me shadowed every minute.
- Haven't you found out?
-Not yet.
Answer.
How do you rate all these privileges?
I grease the guards.
I give them 10 percent.
And maybe a little something else.
- What?
-Maybe a little information.
Break it off!
I'd like to know what made him do it.
Maybe he just wanted to steal our wire cutters.
You ever think of that?
Next man.
"Right, you'll do."
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
And either you bash him one or you stick him in the belly.
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
Tread on his blank blank fingers.
Right!
Next man.
You'll do.
- Let's try that again.
"You've had your treat, let someone else have fun."
"Proper airborne, weren't you, Canada?"
"Didn't you hear me, Evans?"
"What about the other boys, Sarge?"
I don't want to be too selfish.
Come on.
Right.
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
Either you bash him one or you stick him in the belly.
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
Right!
Gordon.
"He's leaving himself wide open, watch."
"I am, am I?"
Come on.
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
Argh!
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Men fighting against bulls?
"Yes, yes, yes."
What did he say?
-That they would love to go.
I couldn't have translated it better.
(MAN) (COUGHING)
The fortune cookie was right.
Love and a cough can't be hidden.
"Get going, Luis."
And leave you here alone?
"No, don't even think it."
"Whatever way, you're coming with me."
-Don't be an idiot.
They won't let me board in this state.
I can't leave you alone with this fever.
You're burning up.
"On your way out, tell the guy that owns the guesthouse to call a doctor."
"But go now, you're going to miss your plane."
I'll leave you this so you can get by when you get better.
Hang in there.
(Door closes)
Is what you have to tell me very important?
It could be.
Tell me.
"Sit down, woman."
One of our internal agents called.
An hour ago someone checked into a hospital.
He was delirious and talking about a time door.
Couldn't he just be crazy or a science fiction fan?
Look.
"This is his picture in the hospital, taken this very morning."
That's a sign.
He's so thoughtful!
I'm smitten.
I can tell!
You look green!
Is that your heart broken to cut chips?
Somebody gets a Pepto!
Spritzer girl?
Where is the art department?
Things should be clearly marked in these offices.
- It's down there.
- I'm supposed to meet Sebastian.
We're going to discuss strategies for covering up heroine tracks.
"It's so, so sad!"
I know.
It's terrible that these girls do that to themselves.
"It causes so much extra work for us, matching skin tones... blending palletes."
For arms can be quite difficult for artists.
"I can imagine, good luck!"
"My God, you're sick!"
I think I got a full poisoning atrophy.
I'm so sorry.
I'm horrified!
I didn't want you to see me like this.
"Don't worry, it happens to everyone."
I'll get some water.
"Honey, are you all right?"
You got it all dripping!
I just chugged in front of Paul.
I'm gonna kill myself.
"Don't worry, you'll lose weight."
Here he comes Remember:
Perkins!
Get this old goat moving!
"Look alive, boy!"
Sir.
"Move, you bastards!"
Get up!
"Saved you for the firing squad, Harper."
"Perkins tells me that you were once a common soldier, a sergeant."
- So I was.
- Strange.
"In Spain, an officer must be ""of the blood""."
Un caballero.
righteous but charming A gentleman
"Sorry, wrong house, Miss."
Is that why you have trouble with your men?
"Perkins told you that, did he?"
Yes.
He said you were a proper bastard.
He's right.
You may as well know the rest.
My mother was a whore.
I was born in a brothel.
Grew up in an orphanage and hope to die in the army.
Right?
But the boy Perkins says you saved the life of General Wellesley.
"And the Irishman, Harper, he says that when the English wish to honour a man of courage, they call him a proper bastard."
"You listen to soldiers' gossip, ma'am."
"Yes, I do."
"You see, we have two ears but only one mouth."
So a good leader will listen twice as much as he shouts.
"I beg your pardon, Mr Sharpe."
But she's as dry as a bone.
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
L...
I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
- I have to go.
"- Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"[Door Opens, Closes]"
"[Woman] If you do engage in a lot of foreplay... so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina... and if you are putting your behind on a pillow... so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier... the more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina... because this way you have some control over how fast...
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
And I'll tell you what...
If the two of you love each other...
- You going somewhere?
"- Uh, my mom's."
Oh.
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
- She's not feeling that well.
"- Oh, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while, so I thought that..."
[Sighs]
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
He would forget to lock the case to the expensive watches.
Neal...
I resisted twice.
"The third time, this guy's asking to get took."
So I...
I grabbed a couple cases of watches and I hopped on a train to Portland.
The store's got insurance.
"Anyway, I stashed 'em in a locker at the train station."
They're still there.
It's hardly stealing.
So you got away clean.
I didn't get away clean.
"The manager may have been a drunk, but the security cameras are stone sober."
"I thought this heat had died down, but it hasn't."
I'm sorry.
Tallahassee's out.
I gotta go to Canada.
That's fine.
I like maple syrup.
I gotta go to Canada alone.
Why?
"If I get caught, and you're with me,"
- you're in trouble...
- You're not gonna get caught.
How can you say that?
You think crossing the border's easy?
We get fake I.D.s and passports.
Those cost money.
We have a stolen car.
We make it legit.
We take a V.I.N. number off of another car.
"Emma, I'm not gonna have you in the seat next to me"
I still believe things will work out for the best.
What do you believe in?
What do you believe?
I believe everything.
I'm just talking about the past.
"And today we go to a party for the first time with our daughter, and we quarrel about some stupid champagne."
That's all!
Champagne.
"One Martell, as if..."
Heaven's... what did you do there?
"You kept counting, you weren't even interested in what was going on."
You admire a poet...
That's just like you.
You come to a party and you say...
Recite the poem Bacardi for me.
To drink baccardi...
Have you ever drunk it?
"Of course, but not with you."
I haven't.
Why didn't you let us have it?
Why did you hum and ha?
"Don't ask me who I drank it with, I don't ask you who you drank what with."
What with who?
With no one.
And I've never tasted Bacardi!
What do you think it is?
Some Cuban cognac.
"No idea, of course."
What are you getting at now?
I don't know why you made such a fuss.
is that what we were making preparations for?
It wasn't how I imagined it either!
I can see a UFO?
"Yes, through your window."
"You mean I can go over, there to my window, and I can look at it I can see a UFO?"
"No, but you can see it through my telescope."
"Oh, you have a telescope with you?"
"Yes, in my case."
So why don't you set it up?
I always dreamed about seeing a UFO.
"Hey, what did you say you were drinking?"
So you're dead now...shit.
And you're going to hell.
Straight from your marihuana jungles.
"Straight from your lies, your lies, your lies."
"You dropped it, fuck!"
Suits you well.
You go to hell.
Whe'll all go to hell.
I'll go to hell too.
But I know I'm damned.
"And you, never knew."
So you weren't ready?
to toll the bell.
For me it's easy.
From hell to hell I'm not dancing in marihuana jungles.
"I live in concrete mazes, stone and glass."
"Hard like my heart, sharp and clean."
No romantic illusions to changing the world.
I don't lie to myself.
That love can cure because I know I'm alone.
And you fucked that every day.
"You lived, you lied, you lied you lied."
You go to hell?
I'm a huge fan.
He's downstairs.
Gareth watson?
Yes.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm karen.
"In fact, there was an expedition"
"Mounted by hadrian in 121 a.D.,"
But by the time his legions
"Got to salisbury plain,"
The druids had hidden them.
And no roman histories of gaul
Give the slightest hint whether or not
Any other evidence was ever found.
But...
"If there is a map,"
It'll be the most extraordinary find
Since they very rarely used parchment.
"You don't suppose it's on oak bark, do you?"
He's not due until 10:13.
How did your colleague
Come by this map anyway?
He isn't my colleague.
He's an agent of the gural nataz.
How are they involved?
"In 60 seconds,"
"A courier dressed in a blue trench coat,"
Carrying a titanium briefcase
Will step off the train
And step through those doors.
A car will meet him at the curb.
All happiness belongs to her.
Don't speak anymore with Judith!
Watch out David!
"Dr. Martel, do you hear me?"
- His name is...
- David.
David?
"If you can hear me, blink your eyes."
Get it out!
- Intracranial nerves?
- There's no broken hematoma.
Scanning?
I want it in my office.
No sweat.
No tears.
"They still need eye drops, or they'll end like him."
What are they doing?
The guilty deserve punishment!
They are OK.
What do you mean?
They are the ones who did it?
Let me show you something.
Are you crazy?
These children don't know pain.
"That's why they're very dangerous to other children, but mainly to their own selves."
Can we cure it?
I'd never seen anything like this.
They suffer from an unknown illness.
"Citizens, I have to tell you that..."
"These children, they suffer from an unknown illness."
Tragic events and strange facts happen for months and kill innocent people.
This tragedy... shows ... the threat posed by crime.
"- Oh, my..."
And you really are serious about getting yourself killed?
I figure it's people who visit me today as well.
"Small world, cos uh..."
me and Vi hate those guy's guts.
"Two months ago Violet ran into them, and they locked her in a dumpster."
It looks like someone had taken a life out of her.
Is that all they did?
"You mean, locked her in that trashcan?"
"Well, yea, I mean that's all she told me."
What else would they...?
Russ is such an ass.
"Thinks he's smart, but he's not."
Nothin' to say this time?
Maybe you've learned your lesson after all.
I'd like a something' for you to tell your boss.
In this fuckin' economy that chicken shit must be pretty hard up.
"to send a little... cunt like you, to do a men's job."
Fuck you later!
- Hi.
"- We're closed, what do you want?"
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Yeah you do.
The black door in the back.
Much obliged.
How can I help you?
"Let's go, let's go, come on."
Move fast.
Check out those boxes right there.
"Let's go, move on."
"""But dude!"
"You're a vegetarian!"""
- The warrant!
"Sir, where is the Honorable?"
Have him come right away!
Calm down.
- You hear him?
A warrant?
- You'll see.
But I was acquitted.
- The arrest warrant.
- What warrant!
Sir!
If I get my hands on you!
You dirty bastard!
"Sooner or later, I'll get out!"
And I'll kill you and that other geezer!
"Criminals, crooks!"
"Let go of me, let go of me!"
They get in their messes and expect us to work miracles!
PRISON
I gladly accepted the request to help you because the case interests me in a very particular way.
"I've studied it deeply, I think it's a case of mythomania complicated by a form of amnesia with a hysterical character."
I had a similar case in..
'23.
- In '23.
There had recently happened a.. a..
The March on Rome.
"- Eh, good times!"
"- Yes, good times."
- Honorable!
The march on Rome?
- Good times because we were younger then.
And this little one here was in junior high!
Said he had a plan that would get him out of the mob.
I guess he was wrong.
They found him.
What did my brother mean to you?
Everything.
Take me to his place.
I want to get to know him.
Take you to his place?
Are you crazy?
You show up and start this mess that almost gets us killed.
"You don't have a clue who you're dealing with, do you?"
"If you wanna kill yourself, be my guest."
But who gave you the right to risk my life?
I can't go home.
I can't go to work.
You painted a big red target on my back.
Where's the check?
Mikhail used to say we could never stay in one Place too long.
We have to move all the time.
It's time for us to move.
- They'll find us here.
- The cable didn't have to die.
This is just the beginning.
I've seen it before.
"They won't stop until you're dead, too."
You can't go to the police.
You can't hide.
"Lvan and his boss, Kirov, are relentless."
"All right, I'll bring you to your brother's home."
This explains why Mikhail picked a bank in Nice.
Holy shit.
Looks like we got another chance.
In other words...
Noah controls the atmosphere of the Earth.
What are you going to do with Noah?
What?
Why did you do that?
!
That data belonged to our nation!
You two will go into Noah with me.
can you?
Not if you care about the lives of the people here.
Wait!
Your behavior goes against the will of the army's!
Go away.
doctor.
so you're Macdougal.
they put a magnetic field brain amplifer in your head.
Surely they realized such a device could kill you without warning.
isn't it?
Dr. Mayzel.
That's why the Pentagon tried so desperately to obtain you.
They justify every crime in the name of patriotism.
until they created you.
That is why you are also a creature with the ugly ego of that nation.
That's old-fashioned sentimentalism.
I was not only chosen by my nation but by God.
What did you say?
Spriggan!
Where did that brat go?
!
Shoot him!
Shoot him to death!
That's far enough!
That doesn't matter.
You said you weresn't 21.
There's a big difference between 21 and 16.
"Look, I'm sorry."
"You're beautiful, but I have to leave."
I feel really guilty.
I wish I had met you in high school.
I wouldn't have liked you then.
That's true.
If you really have to go
I want to give you something to remember me by.
And you can tell Jim he can put me in his movie.
Don't do that.
- Dad!
- What the hell is going on here?
That's right.
"Run, you little sick."
"Oh, shit, the script."
- You're gonna go to your mother's.
- You don't understand me.
I don't want to.
You're gonna go to your mother's.
You can't deal with being attracted to your own daughter.
Do not try to pull transference on me.
I invented transference.
"I called the girl, but she's already in Connecticut with her mom so she can't get the screenplay."
- What the hell am I gonna do?
- You gotta break into that place.
I can't break into a therapy office.
Why?
What difference does it make?
You gotta get in there.
Stop it!
Nobody... dislikes excitement!
Why are you following me?
"I have driven you a long way, you should invite me to your home."
What's the matter with you?
Why do you keep bothering me?
You can not escape from me!
Let me go!
Ride on!
- Who is that guy?
- He is a disgusting guy!
"If you hate him, why did you come with his car?"
You are right.
Poor me!
Everyday I face the dusty earth and burn below the sun!
"Dig and pant, dig again, plant again."
You have to study hard!
Hear me?
"Otherwise, you will end up like your sister!"
"The smooth completion of our project this time, relies on the efforts and contributions of everybody!"
"So today, is the time to enjoy!"
- Good!
- Great!
Come on!
"On behalf on the team,"
"I should thank our boss, Mr. Lin, for this long period he has been taking care of us!"
The next is... the miracle moment!
Kunlun...
the secret of lost martial.
The one-finger strike!
- Xiaotian.
- Yawang.
She might even... thinks she'll keep you alive for some silly reasons.
Kids...
"- May I ask you a question, Violet?"
- You may ask.
You ever miss the doll house?
Not particularly.
"And I think I know what you're driving at, mister."
"But this job never got to me, aside from the sensational rush to the action."
- What about those men?
- What men?
The ones you killed.
"That, was fucking magical."
Did you see that?
"It's a bit early to know, but career wise... that little miracle might be my Monalisa."
If not my Billie Jean.
- Actually...
- Do you have any family?
What?
Do you have any family?
- What a random question.
"- Well, do you?"
Daisy is like family.
You didn't answer the question.
I got a father somewhere.
What's with the interview?
When's the last time you and he spoke?
- What do you care?
- That long huh?
- Are you afraid of what's next?
- Me getting shot?
I mean after that.
I haven't thought about it.
In ways that I often thought I had imagined.
"I used to love the smell of her perfume,"
The-the tenor of her voice...
"Even now,"
When she lied to me.
She doesn't want us getting married.
She will stop it.
We have to elope.
Today.
Now.
Bash:
"There's a church just east of the old village, by the quarry."
I wish that I could come with you.
Let me get it
All arranged.
"It might take a few hours,"
"And if we're both missing, people will notice."
"If I'm not back by midday, we have our priest."
Get on a horse and meet me at the church before sunset.
"Don't plan on sleeping this night, wife."
Marie:
At least you're moving about
Freely now.
"Guarded, but with the mobility"
Required to plan my death.
How was the dungeon?
Were there fleas?
"Were you paraded through the town, mocked?"
Hmm.
I was in the tower.
"I realize you're not happy with the turn events have taken,"
But must you paint a bleaker picture of my fall?
"Now, we've made a lot of plans and I won't let you upset them."
I want some money.
Fast.
"Letha, we are worlds apart."
My mind is filled with large concepts.
"Mankind, the universe."
You only worry about the horse that's running in the third race.
"Sure, I gamble But with my own money."
You're the worst kind of gambler.
You use other people's money
And want to keep all the winnings for yourself.
"Well, you can be sure of one thing, Victor."
I'll be around to pick up the chips with you.
- [wires pop and sizzle] - [Tony moans] [panting] [grunting]
We'll be back in the morning with maps and breakfast.
I'll bring an egg from my refrigerator.
And I'll bring some day-old bread.
- I'll bring some milk for you.
- Thank you.
- You're good friends.
- That's the trouble with us.
We don't want to be good.
We want to be bad.
Yeah.
"Hey, uh, let's go, you guys."
My mom's gonna yell at me.
"[crusher] see you tomorrow, Tia."
[muscles] we'll find Tony tomorrow for sure.
"[Rocky] let's stay close together on the way out, guys."
[sighs]
Good.
This is professor Gannon...
I always admired that.
"You'd walk into a burning building, save your worst enemy."
"Time to save yourself now, Dad."
Okay?
Walk into the light.
It's okay.
Don't worry about us.
We're gonna be fine.
You don't have to suffer.
You did your job.
"Take care of yourself, Pop."
I love you.
Walk into the light.
Bye.
So you know if your dad could talk right now he'd tell you you were acting like a big pussy?
"Thanks, Mom."
- I love you.
- Love you too.
"You did good, man."
"No matter what happens, you'll know you did right by your dad."
"I don't even know if he could hear me, but I guess it needed to be said, right?"
"Johnny, I'm so proud of you."
"Being able to cry in front of your dad like that, that's huge."
Who told you I cried?
Hank.
"Your mom ratted you out, bro."
She was taking prop bets on whether or not you'd cry.
She lost big on that one.
You got a big mouth.
I'm serious.
"I really do think that this is a big step for you, Johnny."
Life is so much richer when you allow yourself to tap into some vulnerability.
It's a meeting about having me replaced on the ticket.
I know how to count to 270.
"John, I assure you..."
"I assure you that if it were a serious notion, we would..."
- Texas is gone.
So is Florida.
- We're not doing it.
- You should think about it.
- Are you taking your name off that bill?
Nobody benefits from the Internet right now more than the rural poor.
You're taking your name off.
We can't campaign on it.
"- Yes, sir."
- And if somebody's attacking us you know what to do.
I call Leo.
"Yeah, but don't discount the possibility that it might be Leo."
"Yes, sir."
"John, despite this recent revelation that you drank beer in college I've always liked you a little more than you thought I did."
But that's not why you're staying.
It's this.
Four words.
I've always liked you more than you thought I did too.
"Just a little, right?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Me too.
Anything else?
"- Thank you, Mr. President."
"- Thank you, sir."
Charlie!
"- Yes, sir."
- Let's go.
I'm a magic man.
"Is there some new event, some change?"
No.
No.
I just thought...
"You've just been drinking to calm your nerves, huh?"
"It is your nerves, isn't it?"
Perhaps you should see a doctor.
No.
"No, I don't need a doctor."
"Would you like to have some wine, sir?"
I'll get you another glass.
Dr. Jekyll's a good man.
"Yes, Dr. Henry Jekyll."
- Is he?
- Yes.
Yes.
And a fine gentleman too.
Different than any man you might know.
Yes.
Yes.
"""A nice, fine gentleman like yourself, sir wouldn't be knowing such a person."" No."
"""I ain't such a bad looker, sir, when I'm more myself. "" Yes."
"He's the kind of man you can get down on your knees to, isn't he?"
"A sweet, dear, pure man that you can trust and believe."
"He's a smug, hypocritical coward, that's what he is!"
- You couldn't know him!
- I know him intimately.
And I detest him intimately from his lofty brain to the soles of his virtuous feet!
"And you, you..."
"""I'll do anything you ask, sir."""
"Well, you saw him, didn't you?"
You saw the respectable fool.
"More, more!"
"Come, how do you like the fucking!"
Now you will feel my prick from behind.
"Yes, do so my love."
Yes lend me a hand.
Please give me a hand.
-Does your man never do that to you?
-Never.
You are so right to be annoyed.
"-He is a peasant, yes, a bumpkin."
"Enter me, my love, from behind."
Pull my arse apart and hammer it.
Here we come.
"Yes, it fits well inside."
"Dirty slut, one hand masturbates in the front... and the other from behind."
"Say, that nobody ever made you enjoy yourself, ..."
-like that.
Made you come like me!
-Yes.
"Yes, nobody ever before you made me enjoy it so."
I am coming!
Do you hear me my love?
What is going on?
What do I hear?
Ahh!
"Look, Mrs. Rosella sees my films as committed by her husband."
Very well.
"There is a secure future for... telephone operators of the ""hot line""."
"-The more confessors there are,... the more 'talking sluts' there seem to be."
"And how do you react, when you see my films?"
"Obviously, it obliges me to please my boyfriend."
This was written by a man.
- Explains no pulse.
"Okay, let's get a CBC, chem seven, dip a urine, chest and pelvis x-rays."
"Chen, give me your hands."
- What are you doing?
- Hold tight.
Ken!
Have you ever been to Hawaii before?
"- Well, pretend that you' re there now."
"- Pratt, wait!"
I can't believe you!
I feel better.
I feel totally better!
I feel totally sick.
Why would you reduce an ankle with no pain meds?
No pulse is no blood is dead tissue.
"In other words, I just saved your foot."
Thank you.
You' re wonderful.
- Subclavian's in.
Is that the film?
- Five hundred cc's are out the chest tube.
- He's holding his pressure.
- No pneumothorax.
Looks like a widened mediastinum and loss of the AP window.
Hard to tell.
The pulmonary contusion is impressive.
One of us should go with him to CT.
Not unless you' re ready to crack the chest.
"Flail chest, pulmonary contusions, and labile hypotension."
Could also be from a splenic fracture.
"Carter, I'd like an aortagram."
"Better yet, a TEE."
"I know who you are, so it's okay."
Who do you want to interview?
"I'd like to interview you, actually."
- Is it okay with you?
"- Yeah, sure."
"Well, okay, then."
But I'm answering only the ones I can.
Nothing too personal.
- I appreciate this.
"- No, it's my pleasure."
- Sounds fun.
- Thank you.
Do you trust people easily?
I'm a little over thirty now.
I changed when I passed thirty.
I used to trust people easily.
"Back then, I had to define everything that I do."
"But after thirty, I loosened up."
"If I can't define things right away,"
"I just think some day I will, and take it easy."
"Wow, we're really different."
"I've been uptight since second grade, and haven't rested ever since."
Do you like dogs?
- Who doesn't?
- I'm afraid of them.
What do you believe in?
Have anything you have absolute faith in?
"- Yes, myself."
- You believe in yourself?
I think only about myself.
"I'm not perfect, but it's still me."
It's up to me to improve myself.

"Good morning, Willy."
"Oh, uh, good morning, Aunt Nancy."
Did you sleep well?
"Yes, fine, thank you."
What happened?
The train ain't moving?
A bridge washed out down the road.
There's nothing to be frightened of.
"Oh, I'm not frightened when I'm with you."
That's very nice.
"You know, someday, I hope I have a little man like you."
That's very nice.
You know something?
"When I met you last night, that was the nicest thing that ever happened to me."
"Well, thank you, Willy."
"Well, you know, it... it's like..."
"Well, everything is different."
It's...
"Well, it's very hard to explain, but I have a very funny feeling in my stomach."
What you need is a good breakfast.
You're a growing boy.
"Oh, that's what I wanted to talk to you about."
We'll have a nice talk right after breakfast.
I will go get my earplugs.
- Where's your owner?
"- Hi, Olivia."
- Hi.
- I don't have an owner.
- Olivia.
- Good to see you.
I hope you're not back for an encore because last night was a one-time thing.
"No, you left me quite depleted."
I could barely walk.
"- So, what's up?"
- I have a problem.
I hear you have special skills for hire.
They are.
Let's talk rates.
"Whatever you have to say, you can say in front of Kenzi."
"So, what's the job?"
I want you to kill someone.
And that's gonna cost extra.
"When you mate for life, and your life is centuries you make it work."
So you invite other Fae into bed whenever you get bored.
Keeps things exciting.
"But we've had a rule, no snacking behind each other's backs."
- Naturally.
- What happened?
Samir and I own an event-planning business.
The girl's a florist we used on one occasion.
Her name's Jenny.
So Samir couldn't keep his hands off the help?
That's typical.
- I didn't know he was shucking around.
- Shucking?
"- Well, I guess I'll just sit with you then?"
- No.
"I mean, no, don't-- don't you--"
"No, that got pushed an hour, so that I can watch your web debut."
That's--That's... great.
"That--that--well, that worked out well."
So I'll follow you.
- Great.
That's...
"- Yeah, come this way."
"- Good luck, honey."
"- Okay, thanks, babe."
Thank you.
"- Oh, I--just-- - oh, don't worry about it."
I'm sure they'll figure it out.
Have fun.
The Cylons are jamming the wireless.
Every frequency.
"Okay, we need to establish our communications."
Work out a plan to defend this temple while Tyrol searches.
Defend it with what ?
"A dozen marines, maybe five more military ?"
We're gonna have to draft the civilians.
Can I make a suggestion that you won't like ?
Do you make any other kind ?
Use Sam to command the civilians.
You're not serious.
- Lee.
"- Hey, Sam."
Hi.
I heard you were coming down.
I guess it takes an emergency to get us in the same room these days.
I'd sold something.
I thought he could use the cash and I could sketch him.
What had you been told?
That he was beautiful.
I wanted to see for myself.
And you found him dying?
But he was exquisite.
There's a photo in the Tate Modern.
Like this.
How we look from 900m up.
"All dots, an irrelevance."
"Don't go metaphysical, mate."
Juries hate that.
The Greeks were terrified of beauty too.
"They saw it as a torment, excruciating, unreachable."
I want to capture the precise moment when things are exquisite.
"Listen, I don't normally make a habit of asking this but this time it matters."
Did you murder him?
"No, I did not."
Some dots stand out.
Are you OK?
"So why do you want to run, Dave?"
I'd like to make a difference.
"Oh, yeah?"
Example?
"Well, I think we could try to make New South Wales the hardest State in the country to buy a gun."
"Whoa, there."
Tread carefully.
We've still got a few very marginal country seats.
We don't want to upset the gun lobby.
"(Laughs) For fuck's sake, Wal."
What's so funny?
You bastard!
"You don't even have tears in your eyes, can you see it?"
It's dry!
You are caught red-handed!
Why do you pretend crying?
To hell with you!
"Hey, you'd better behave!"
"Wait, let me tell you a story."
"Once upon a time, there was a noble named Ho."
He had a son named Ho Chung.
"Sir Ho was old, his son would be his heir of course."
"But, suddenly, his nullius filius Ho Foon appeared."
Someone worried his status would be affected.
So he sent his fellow Chun... to kill that nullius filius.
"But, Chun failed."
Someone just took this opportunity to kill Chun.
And made that poor kid be the scapegoat.
That guy is really hard-hearted and cold-blooded!
What do you think about my assumption?
"Prosecutor, why do you laugh?"
Because this is such a nonsense and stupid story.
"Nonsense and stupid, huh?"
But you are all sweat!
It's really weird.
"Prosecutor, where were you when the homicide happened?"
At home.
What were you doing?
Reading.
What book did you read?
A tale of two cities.
Where did you stop?
Well... the soldiers...
I know.
And now we're not together.
I know.
"Well we just got to-- like I said, man."
We're gonna get this in a master.
"We're gonna get closer, and we're gonna get this."
"We just need this for the master shot, all right?"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
So--
Is there any way to go back and just
Do the first 12 feet of this?
"Because in the rehearsal, you said I would"
"Carry both of them, right?"
-We'll do a close-up.
We'll do close-ups.
We'll do this thing.
We'll have you carrying them out tight.
You're like this big in the stuff I'm doing.
So we'll get you-- we'll do it again.
It's just not gonna match if I'm-
"- I mean,"
I was carrying them both in rehearsal [inaudible].
Now we're going to do it to match the way it was
When you walked out the door.
And that was--
That's what I'm saying.
"When you walked out the door in there, you had him,"
And you had her on your arm.
And we did that.
We had her on--

Transporter signal?

"It means, Trelane... the party's over, thanks to Mr. Spock."
Wait!
I won't have this!
I haven't dismissed you yet.
Stop!
I won't have this!
Everyone to stations.
"Report, Mr. Spock."
How were our scanners able to penetrate that radiation field?
"They didn't, Captain."
Not clearly.
We beamed up all life-forms in a given area.
"Which means Trelane is not a life-form, or he'd be beaming through now."
Prepare to warp out of here at once.
"Oh, Captain, I was so worried."
"Scotty, we're going to need every ounce of your engines."
We're going to put 100 million miles between us and that madman.

Why do you want to be my student?
My master Liu Chung belonged to Shaolin.
He was a student of Wu-mei.
I wish to learn more about kung-fu.
"Although you're a Shaolin student, you're too eager to kill, so we can't accept you."
He was anxious to enter the temple and so fought with our fellow monks.
That's why he gives off a killer's aura.
Fat-chi!
What's your opinion?
I still sense a killer's aura on him.
"Sorry, but I can't accept you!"
"Chief, I'll never leave this temple!"
"Behave yourself, this is a sacred place."
Buddhism mentions fate.
"I'm here, that's fate."
Why don't we keep him?

It's 'cause of the sale we're having.

"I was trying to save my life, and it didn'twork."

"Has she ever tried to attack you, ever been vicious?"
Just the opposite.

"All right, Charlie, start that winch."

"Hey, that's the RV we saw this morning."
"Yeah, I think you're right, Billy."

You guys stay in the car.
"Hold it, Charlie."
"Hold it a bit, hold it."
"All right, all right, give it to 'em."
"Hey, keep those kids away, will ya?"
Get those kids out of there.
I'll call you if I need you.
"Pardon me, officer."
"Suppose someone sort of found something, then later on, it turned out to be important."
"What's ""sort of found something""?"
Is it anything like stole something?
"Suppose it did, what would the police do?"

Of course not.

'Cause this is America.

So you guys are fucking fugitives?
It's just it's Kumar's fault.
If we get out of this... the chances of us remaining friends is highly... highly--boobies.
Yeah.
"Hey, what do you think you're doing?"
Put that back on.
And keep it on.
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' party do you think this is?
Yo.
What are you guys talking about?
Roldy was just letting me in on your situation.
- Yeah?
- Thanks for getting me involved.
What about that fuckin' time we had to cover for you... lie to your ex-girlfriend about how you got crabs?
"You owe us, man."
"- Yeah, that's right."
- What?
"- OK, that was a long time ago."
- I love crabs.

"Don't fret, Captain."
"I'm only a bit upset with you, but this Mr. Spockyou mentioned, the one responsible for that unseemly, impudent act of taking you from me, which is he?"
I'm Spock.
"Oh, surely not an officer."
"Isn't quite human, is he?"
My father is from the planet Vulcan.
And are its natives predatory?
Not generally.
But there have been exceptions.
"Oh, really?"
You will see to his punishment?
On the contrary.
I commend his action.
But I don't like him.
Get off my ship.
"Oh, rot!"
You're all going back with me.
We're not going anywhere.
Nonsense.
I have an absolutely enchanting sojourn on Gothos planned for you all.
You shan't spoil it for me.
"Anyway, the decor of my drawing room is much more appropriate and tasteful."
Don't you agree?
No.
"But so much more fitting, honorable sir."
You...
DeSalle.
- Not at all.
Do you think we're alone in life?
I get criticized because I... don't take care of my family.
You know my parents have nothing.
I can't support... two families.
Go back to your parents if you want.
You talk to me like that... precisely now?
How can you want me away from my parents?
"Besides, it's you who forced me to work."
"From now on, I will work."
Did you find an employer?
That's my problem.
Also mine.
"Anyway, it'll happen soon."
"My only frustration in this relationship, is not having children."
And also mine!
"If we don't have kids,"
I can't do anything.
I don't want to hear you... talking that way.
"Let's stop this discussion, we're too nervous."
"Smarten up, tonight we'll be having dinner at the Director's house."
I don't want to go.

You're only coming with me.
"I know, but I don't feel like it."
Get ready!
- Djénéba... hi!
- Sinaté... hi!
- Is you husband in?
"- Yes, he's expecting you."
- How much is this sack?
- 20700 FM.
"Where are my drawings, man?"
Maybe I burned them.
Maybe I threw them in the Hudson.
Maybe I broke them in pieces like this.
"What are you gonna do about it, huh?"
What are you going to do about it?
"You're wasting your time, Carlos."
The gringos are not going to print your fucking drawings!
Carlos:
I want you to tell me what you see.
"I can't see, Carlos."
I don't have my glasses.
You can see.
You don't want to see.
Tell me what you see!
Carlos:
And why haven't you arrested her?
"Maybe we should have, but we can't now, not without the letter."
Oh.
"We couldn't go in and search the hotel without compromising our man, which we'd rather not do."
But you and your officers-- you have every reason to go over the place.
"Well, we've already done that and found the gun that we were looking for."
I'm sure you could find a reason to do it again.
I thought we'd already searched this place once.
"Yes, we have."
What are you looking for now?
A letter.
To whom?
To giuseppe bastianini.
Who's he?
He's the Italian ambassador.
Is he a suspect?
And you to me.
You are.
What?
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
I've -
- I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
I have to go.
"Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"If you do engage in a lot of foreplay so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina and if you are putting your behind on a pillow so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier,"
"The more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
"What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina, because this way, you have some control over how fast you have to go..."
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
If the two of you love each other --
You going somewhere?
"Uh, my mom's."
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
She's not feeling that well.
"Aw, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while,"
So...
I thought that...
"On the contrary, he sings because he's glad."
He's glad to die.
- The number of legends about swans...
- Dr. Kay.
"They also say swans guide and keep company with the dead, to help them cross the threshold."
That's my favorite...
a very old Celtic legend.
"- Yes, I know it."
- You do?
"- Yes, my wife told me about it."
- Your wife told you about it?
Right.
You mean your ex-wife?
We all live in glass houses.
So I see.
Why don't you finally tell me what I can do for you?
I believe I'm the one who can do something for you.
But you'll see for yourself.
Certain experiences can be very unsettling.
"I'll see what, for God's sake?"
What experiences?
I'm merely pointing out the need to be prepared.
Is that a threat?
"No, it's not a threat."
It's a message.
But I'm not quite sure you're ready to hear it.
How come you know so much about me?
Did you have me checked out?
Did you... was it Ross told you all that stuff?
"""The need to be prepared."" What's that supposed to mean?"
I don't know this Ross person.
I've never met the guy.
At last.
"Now, will you get the luggage off immediately and take it straight to our rooms?"
I do not understand why we weren't met properly.
"Well, I think it's simply wonderful."
It's so unspoiled.
"Eh, it's pretty enough, but it's such a long way to come, such an awful journey."
You'll enjoy bathing and lazing about.
We could have done that in Brixen.
Why you wanted to drag us all this way...
"You'll adore it here, I know."
I can see that you mean to enjoy yourself.
"Oh, well."
"Give me a bath and a bed, and perhaps it'll be better in the morning."
"– Tony, darling?"
– Yes?
My cigarette case.
She makes me feel so undercooked.
I'm so patchy still.
She really is so lucky.
"Oh, dear, that bathing dress is a mistake."
Morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Lovely day.
DOUGLAS:
"Shall I put yours here, darling?"
MARJORIE:
"Yes, so I can get a little bit of sun."
"I feel so dreadfully faded, but I freckle rather than going brown."
Have you ever been to Rhodes before?
No.
"It's lovely, isn't it?"
What is it?
"Near as I can tell, it's... an electrical impulse."
"But whatever it is, it's not coming from human vocal cords."
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
Precognition:
The capacity to see the future.
"It is not characteristic of you, John"
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
"It is not characteristic of you, John"
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
I'll back you up.
I just wanna make sure you still got a job... when you're done doing whatever it is you're doing down there.
"Okay, I'll call you from Chicago."
What time is your flight?
8:00 a.m.
Am I crazy?
Grace.
"And Jack, right?"
(CLEARS THROAT)
You slept with her?
I feel bad that Ben didn't want to eat with us.
I felt badly he lied to me yet again.
"Well, Leo, maybe you're just going to have to let him date Dylan."
"No, I'm not."
"I want to say something, if I may..."
"I hope, whatever it is, it starts with an apology."
No.
It doesn't.
"I just want to say that if you're going to tell me who to date,"
I think I should have every right to tell you who to date.
What!
Yeah.
"And unless you plan on getting her pregnant or importing some offspring from some other source and adopting them, you should quit dating Camille."
"No offense, Camille."
Are you drunk?
"No, I'm perfectly sober."
"Last time, you married a hooker and I didn't speak up."
This time I'm speaking up.
You two do not belong together.
You're too fat and she's too thin.
She probably can't even get pregnant.
"If she could, she would have trapped you by now."
(GROANS)
(LAUGHING)
You want to get married?
Ow.
Well?
Seriously?
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
He will not return.
Varun knows everything.
"If he'd come here to catch me, even after seeing me, why didn't he come to me?"
Why should he follow me?
"That simple means, he has no concrete evidence so far."
He won't get any evidence hereafter as well.
But...
The important thing is that he should not reach Vikram at any point.
Vikram.
- Priya.
I guess you can sense that I'm not fine.
"Priya, don't worry."
I am not able to...
My mind is not at peace.
"Tomorrow, everything should go well."
The organ dealer should properly arrange everything.
The transplant for my brother should go well.
"With all these things running in my mind,"
I'm not able to stay normal.
I don't think I can stay alone here.
"If you are with me,"
I'll feel better.
I've been feeling the same way since I dropped you.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I'll come there right away.
I'll be with you till everything ends well.
Okay?
"Thanks, Vikram."
Sir.
- Hey!
Where had you gone?
"- Well, thank you for your time."
- You're leaving and she's coming?
I don't think she came to talk to me.
- I didn't expect her to come today.
- Me neither.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
He had to hurry to the bank.
- Hi.
Good to see you.
"- Hi, Anna."
I didn't think you were coming today.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why haven't you told me yourself?
Why do you keep lying to me?
"Sorry, Anna..."
I didn't want to make you sad.
Did you think I wouldn't be sad if you just died one day?
- No...
- What?
I didn't want you to see me as a dead man before I was.
I wanted us to be together as much as possible before anyone knew.
"If I knew you were dying, I wouldn't spend my time doing other stuff."
And I want you to tell me these things.
I want you to tell me.
"Anna, you mustn't cry now."
"It will hurt   but it will pass, just like everything else."
And now Jacob will be with you.
I don't care about Jacob.
You're my father and you didn't tell me you're dying.
I don't want anyone but you.
"If you don't tell me you're dying, I can't say the things I want to say."
Any of the guys on the team talked about the e-mail or the murder?
"No, not in front of me, anyway."
We got state championship coming up tomorrow.
That what they're focusing on.
"Life goes on, right?"
Not for everybody.
Is Todd Fleming around?
We want to ask him a few questions.
Fleming!
Front and center.
Come on!
Keep it going!
"Look, I don't know anything about what happened, okay?"
None of us do.
If that's why you guys came down here...
We found alligator blood on Coach Nelson's roof.
We think it was a part of your science project.
"What were you doing up there, Todd?"
I wasn't up there.
I...
"Look, even if I was, up there, what does it matter?"
"'Cause it's a murder investigation, smart guy."
Everything matters.
I didn't kill him.
We'll talk about this downtown.
- I'm in the middle of practice.
- Practice can wait.
Am I under arrest or something?
"Look, Todd, do you have any street clothes you can change into?"
We just want to talk to you.
"- Yeah, in, in the locker room."
- Let's go.
Okay.
Sure.
Thanks.
See that?
"What do you got to say now, huh?"
I'm just glad everyone's away during all of this.
- What if she wins?
- She won't.
What if...
You saw that report.
It's claiming you're an absentee parent.
"I know, I know."
It's gonna make it worse if you and I...
If we don't figure things out.
"Yeah, uh..."
"I think, just for now, we have to put our personal issues aside and just create a united front."
"You know, for Georgie's sake."
Just for Georgie's sake?
"No... for us, too."
Kind of a weird day.
"I guess it's becoming a habit for you, this getting arrested thing."
Come on...
I wasn't arrested after that bar episode.
You and Caleb were such a mess.
Ty... why didn't you call?
"You know, after..."
I picked you up and everything?
"I wanted to, but I decided to give you some time to figure out what it is that you want."
"What I wanted was to talk, but..."
you made it pretty clear that you didn't.
"You kept giving me the cold shoulder, and then, this morning, you do a complete 180."
"You kissed me, Ty."
Where'd you get money for a ride like this?
We' re doctors at County.
- Where you headed in a hurry?
- Y'all can't just do this.
Just be quiet.
I see you guys brought a lot of pals.
What's the deal?
- Four people shot this morning in a diner.
- What diner?
We were just up at the Sedgwick Y in a pickup game.
Call the gym manager.
Why don't you search the car and let us get the hell out of here?
"All right, go ahead."
"See, that's my boss right now."
Somebody's very sick.
"Look, we' re late for our shift."
"Dealers got shifts now, huh?"
"- We are doctors, damn it."
"- Relax, punk."
"No, wait a minute, I can explain that."
I can explain!
"Get on the ground right now, or I'll put a bullet in your damn head."
Cuff them.
You belong to the Y?
I play ball there twice a week.
Who do you play with?
I don't remember their names.
Some live up the street from Greg.
- You show proof to the arresting officers?
"- Yeah, they took my ID."
I told the arresting officer my ID was in the glove.
Did you ever hear of a place called Magoo's?
I hear you got a hold of Kuya?
The two are around here.
150 km north of Marshall Islands.
"Well, then..."
"Yes, as soon as repairs to your arm are completed, we want you to go rescue them."
We need to act sooner than that.
We must hurry so that I can pick up where I left off with...
Left off?
"Yes, that is..."
But if that enemy comes back again...
Don't worry!
Dangaioh can take care of that Mohawk dude!
That's not going be easy.
"Judging from the data sent from Flail, it's in no condition to transform into Dangaioh."
"But we just can't sit here and do nothing, right?"
"Yes, you're right..."
Kuya...
Kuya...
Thanks.
"If you didn't come, they would've taken me away."
"No, I should have been more..."
You should have?
I was no match for them at all...
Sorry...
"If I weren't so slow, we could've transformed."
"I'm the weak link, aren't I?"
No way!
Not once have I thought of you that way.
It's just that...
This is a dangerous mission and it's not for everyone.
If there's a way you could step down...
"Don't get me wrong, that's not what I mean."
Pencil tip and paper should remain 45 degree all the time.
Now your turn.
Show me what you can do.
Not bad!
I'm tired.
Let me sleep for a while.
Do you really want to go?
- Yes.
- I have decided by myself.
I really envy you.
You always know what you want to do!
- Did you know what life I would want?
- Be a soldier!
Isn't it your dream at these years?
What else?
We...
Come on!
Let me show you something.
"Once upon a time, inside this forest, there was two rabbits loving each other!"
But...
there was a wolf in the forest trying to harm them!
"One day, tie little buck deciced to go to somewhere far away, to find the legendary flower of courage."
Because the flower of courage would fill someone up with the power of justice!
So that the little buck can protect the little doe forever!
"Travelling alone, will be faster."
"But travelling together, will make it longer to reach!"
I love you!
Xiaotian!
Xiaotian!
Yawang!
Take care of yourself!
Wait for me!
Because my husband doubts my love for him.
And happy...?
I'm happy because the first time
"In a long time, i'm hopeful."
For us.
( music playing over stereo )
Would you dance with me?
"I just want to hold you,"
"Look into your eyes,"
"Be in love with you,"
And feel you being in love with me.
Would you?
The most beautiful song
For the most beautiful woman.
"- You got this, girl."
This is your special... and you're special.
"Ugh, yuck."
"Well, it'll be great."
- You sure about that?
- What did you say to me?
- I asked if you're sure about your performance.
You don't seem that confident.
"- Well, what do you know?"
- I know a lot.
I'm you.
"I just don't want you to get so nervous that you mess up, like that one time in show choir when you auditioned for a solo and they couldn't hear your voice because you had one of those inside farts."
"You know, like one of those farts that's like--"
"- Yeah, I know."
Why are you bringing this up now?
You don't have to be so rude.
- I'm not being rude.
Who's this?
"Oh, it's the Director of Clandestine Operations Overseas."
Somebody's boss's boss's boss.
Somebody high up in the company.
Director Atwater.
Director Collins.
Templeman.
Keep going.
"Yeah, these are people being groomed for top slots in the corporation."
"Go back, go back."
I know that man.
That's my fucking boss.
Fifteen dossiers.
Fifteen broadcasts.
There it is.
"If I wanted to cripple the system in one fell swoop, these would be the 1 5 I'd start with."
"You kill these men today, you won't recognize the world when you wake up in the morning."
But they've already sent the broadcasts.
"I mean, what the hell do they want with us?"
They wanna kill us.
Make sure you don't cancel the broadcasts.
Grab that.
Let's go.
Here.
"That's all the information from the laptop, in case, uh... I don't know, in case we don't get out of here."
Drink that.
"""Of course we'll get out of here, Katherine."
"Don't you worry about a thing."""
You ever get used to it?
Used to what?
Bodies.
Dead people.
- Doc.
- Right.
But there's always a facilitator.
"I mean,Lex Luthor.Case in point."
"Hey,psycho."
"Hey,psycho.What's up?"
BOMB SQUAD
You switch to decaf yet?
Not a chance.I got nine lives.Haven't burned through half of 'em yet.
"Oh,right.Well,uh..."
This is some ugly-looking shrapnel.
Ugly and old.
Like FDR old or bush 41 old?
I'm thinking somewhere in between.But this puppy's been modified.
- Who are you?
- Soto.Civilian authority.
Pulled that from a tree branch.
So he's putting something in them.
"Yeah,most of these whack jobs add ball bearings,nails,whatever's handy, put 'em in the mines to maximize carnage."
"This doesn't look like some random piece of metal.You mind if I,uh..."
- knock yourself out.
- Thanks.
You want one of me too?
Recording bombing victim number six.
severe lower body trauma.Powder burns extending to mid-torso.
- Becca.
- Hey.
"- Hey,how's it going?"
- l hear you went to the dark side.
Federal task force.Yeah.I'm working the pine street bombings.
"- l'm her partner,Dr.Diego Soto."
- Hey.
The keys!
"Beautiful evening, Constable."
Beautiful evening.
Mr X was then pushed into the pond.
"I don't know why you did it, but if that isn't worth double what I asked, I'm a Dutchman."
It was a dummy.
We...
I was working out a plot.
"Pinching a plot, don't you mean?"
What would your chum say?
Therefore I suggest a contract making over 50 per cent of all your future royalties forever.
- Impossible.
"- Then I'll send an anonymous letter, telling police to drag the pond and name you as the culprit."
- Mumsie!
Mumsie!
- Go away!
"But, Mumsie, the keys!"
You've got the keys!
In my raincoat pocket.
Hurry.
Don't say there's someone else for the high jump.
What about the money you mentioned?
I couldn't get it.
It may be a few days.
"Well, the new deal will be £5,000 down in advance of the 50 per cent."
When may I hope to see the cash and contract?
"Why, you...!"
My agent is away.
Come the day after tomorrow evening at nine o'clock.
"Well, don't let me down this time."
- No.
- Good.
"It's, like, Ludlow and Stanton."
I didn't realize that my ass was gonna be...
"- Ari, your ass."
- There it is.
It's so beautiful.
"- Goddamn you, Kat."
"- Does she say, ""My ass is in the air?"""
I remember you saying that.
"You really, really look like you..."
- Jesus.
"- You guys, I'm fine."
"That was like a big stunt, right?"
The timing of that was tough.
"With them pulling the door, and didn't it..."
It was tough and Ari ate that door a couple of times.
Yeah.
You're dedicated to your art.
Was that a take where she actually hit her head?
- I don't think so.
- Looks pretty convincing.
I think it's just the sound effect that makes it so powerful.
"- There they are, off into the night."
- I'm actually driving.
"- Yeah, and..."
- It died a bunch of times.
"Do you have any assemblies of those takes in the blooper reel at all, Pete?"
- Of Mike stalling the Yugo?
- Yeah.
"- No, I don't have them."
- The Yugo just slowing to a stop.
- No.
"- Are you doing, like, a blooper reel?"
My bread!
My bread!
How was it?
"They just think about eating, and don't even see a car coming."
How do parents teach them?
"The reason I asked to see you is that, next month there will be personnel changes."
Were you aware?
Please help me.
I believe you are the only member that can help me.
Am I?
"I thought you had backups, aside from me, since you have control over the 3 billion Won welfare assets."
You seem different.
It's... a little difficult.
"Since civilians are complaining that the children are starving, we'll just have to work harder."
There must be a way.
"Just a bunch of numbers, nothing difficult."
Not like it's never been done before right?
I'll just believe you.
Go on.
"Thank you, Yun Seong."
"Oh, is your injury hurting?"
Wh-what are you doing?
"Really, I'm fine."
Put me down.
"Really, there's nothing wrong."
Put me down.
You can put me down now.
How come it's so high?
"What is this, graffiti?"
My height measurements.
"From when I moved here at 7 years old, until I was 17."
My father measured my height there.
I think they should reduce the working hours.
"Eight hours a day, instead of the current ten."
They only pay us 7000 FM a month.
"The people that work eight hours a day are paid better... than us, that's the real problem."
So what do you want us to do?
I think people are spoiled here.
Did you hear?
"After the first month, everyone's in debt."
You have to claim your rights.
"Besides, there's tattletales among us."
"They keep quiet now, and talk later."
"Instead of insulting each other, let's reach an agreement."
"In any case, we need to earn more."
- Speak up!
"- Traoré, a call for you."
- I'm at a meeting.
- It's very urgent.
- What do you want?
- It's not my problem.
"Instead of talking, let's act."
How?
- Let's go and see the boss!
- We've already seen him.
Let's go once more.
"And if he doesn't see us, we stop working."
"Traoré, the boss is calling."
"Doumbia, carry on with the meeting, I'll be right back."
You know what we have to do.
Traoré will be back.
Wait for him.
Let me go!
Where were you when my fur order arrived?
"- I need more to work with, much more."
- There is no more.
Lucas was drunk and brutal.
"When he tried to beat me, I killed him."
Killing in self-defense is understandable.
"But you hid the body, like a criminal."
- I know.
- She was fighting for her life.
The state is sending a prosecutor for one purpose: to convict Selena.
I've seen him work.
He's thoroughly competent and relentless as law itself.
Tell her to come in.
There must be something you haven't told me.
"- He tried to kill me, I killed him first."
- But you hid the body!
Why?
"Come in, Allison."
Allison.
I was never happier to see anyone in my life.
Are you all right?
"- Hi, Ted."
"- Hi, Allison."
I can testify about Lucas.
I saw him beat her.
"It'll help, believe me."
- We appreciate you coming back.
"- You'll get her off, won't you?"
We're gonna do the best we can.
But the jury decides on the one thing: evidence.
"Now, it adds up to this:"
"We have a murder, and a defense that's too simple to be good."
It's open to attack from many sides.
The general's funeral.
Right after the D.O.D. closed up shop and sent us home with a $600 check and our dicks in our hands.
You've come a long way.
- Ah.
- [chuckles]
You remember the last thing you told me?
When my uncle said he'd hook us up?
That I was done hurting people.
And you wanted a cozy corporate job.
How's that working out for you?
I'm not here to reminisce.
"Then why are you here, exactly?"
I need some information about a hit on a suit.
A hit?
Outside the wall.
The man from Spiga's here to see me about a murder.
I'm here to see if you'll help out a fellow soldier.
"Well, now you're just trying to take advantage of my soft heart."
You really want my help?
Then take my offer.
It's still on the table.
I'm happy with my job.
I fund a clinic.
I'm a man of the people.
What do you do after you punch in?
"Brother, I just need information."
"Of course, Cap."
I'll ask around.
If I hear anything you'll know.
Was that so hard?
"Now, why don't you tell me why you're really here."
♪
Can I take a message?
Oh...
OK.
Bye.
Some foreign bloke says he makes tasty crackling and you shouldn't be afraid.
- What's that all about?
- It's... just... a mate.
He's a chef.
Wants me to try a new recipe.
See?
I don't know any fancy foreign chefs.
Don't tell me it's not exciting living in London.
It's not exciting living in London.
"- Oh, come on."
It must be.
- It's not.
It's like some huge ant hill where nothing works properly.
Millions of people just getting in each other's way.
"No space, no air."
"So, why don't you leave?"
"I'm trying, but it's hard."
"With money it's bearable, but if you're skint, you're trapped."
Try living here.
"Everybody knows you, knows everything about you."
"Nothing changes, nothing ever happens."
"Their idea of a good time is getting shit-faced as quickly as possible and then shag anyone who'll let them, and then do it all again tomorrow."
"Now, that's being trapped."
To escaping.
To escaping.
"And a big, fat win on the lottery."
- What?
- I was just thinking about Wicklow.
Really?
"I sensed you in the forest, when you were watching us, and I knew even then that you were different."
Your father has raised you well.
He has taught you right from wrong.
You are not like the other one.
I don't let him in.
I don't like what he shows me.
"I know, but you have to try."
"Now, we need to find him."
You don't understand.
"I have tried myself, but I can get nothing."
Please.
All right.
Good.
"Now, concentrate."
Try again.
I saw a river.
Zaddik?
Is there a river nearby?
"Yes, just to the east."
"All right, let's go."
"McKay, stay here and help Beckett."
"Uh, medical research is not really my thing."
And hunting wraith?
"But, I mean, I can stay..."
and help Beckett.
Never could get into biology.
There's just too much information about the human body.
"One time, I took it as an undergrad,"
I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical conditions before I had to drop the class.
Really.
"Yeah, believe it or not, back then, I was a bit of a hypochondriac."
People are concerned.
"You have been a rock-- stable, rational."
This case has tripped a wire somewhere.
Ahem.
"Oh, my God."
You are more like Billy than you realize.
You both need someone to fight and to hate and to destroy.
You can't just be.
I loved Billy.
I truly did.
Once.
We were quite a team.
"You couldn't stand him, Donald."
"Eventually no, but in the beginning I loved him."
- Until you didn't.
"- Until I didn't because he was weak, because he drank, because he never really stood for anything."
That's what you do.
"People fall, and you just let them keep falling."
"Oh, come on."
Are you going to help Lucy?
I know that you care about her.
She just might be the one thing to make you happy.
She made me happy.
But she was weak.
Ahem.
Lawyers are reminded-- opening statements are not arguments.
They're road maps to let the juries know what evidence they can expect to hear.
Plaintiff has the burden of proof and delivers the first opening statement.
Billy:
Cool.
"Um... okay, let's do this."
How are you guys doing?
I was one empanada away from a heart attack.
But then this...
"gorgeous godsend made me the lean, mean, fighting machine I am today."
[ Chuckles ] Hm.
[ Breathing rapidly ] Ho!
Oh.
[ Laughter ]
But I digress.
"Now, the good news is, we are hiring."
"The bad news is, there's only one trainer position available."
How do you feel about working in another department?
Huh?
Nice shorts.
Nice hairnet.
"Yeah, why do I got to be the lunch lady?"
Since when have you ever complained about being around food?
"Okay, this is not food."
"[ Peruvian accent ] Hey, new guy."
"Quit flirting' with the trainer and keep scooping', huh?"
It's all right.
"My, uh..."
Ashtanga yoga class starts in five minutes.
How the hell do you know anything about yoga?
You're not the only one who's ever dated someone bendy.
"Hey, you have any oatmeal?"
"[ Chuckles ] Yeah, I wish."
"No, but we have, uh, something that's tofu over there."
I -- what is that?
It's a pancake.
It's tofu.
"I feel like a baby asking this, but..."
Will the treatment hurt?
"- I'm going to stand up for our rights, at least, in the matter of the fence."
Wouldn't it be easier just to mend it?
"I mean-- no, I'm making a stand on principle, James."
"You will back me up, won't you?"
- Leave me out of it.
"For one thing, I'm not up to it."
For another-- all right.
Be like that.
Wallow in defeatism.
What is that disgusting smell?
Helen swears it's a sovereign remedy for flu.
It smells like old socks.
"- Don't insult old socks, this stuff's in a class of its own."
"- What is, darling?"
I was just praising the remarkable qualities of your flu remedy.
"Oh, were you?"
"Come along, drink it up while it's hot."
Got to get you fit again.
"'Night, tris."
"Next, please!"
"Come on, digger."
"- Andrew, come on in."
"James, you don't sound too good."
"No, I'm fine."
"Spot of flu, but Helen's specific knocked it on the head."
"Let's have a look at him, shall we?"
Come on.
"Come, digger."
Mr. herriot just wants to look.
When did you first notice this problem?
"He's had eye trouble on and off since he was a pup, really."
"Could you hold his head, please?"
"They're not sympathetic, they're not press-Friendly,"
And they're not helping her.
Your mother's been crying ever since she got the call.
"I warned you about comin' out here,"
And now look what you've done!
"This isn't about you,dad!"
You've humiliated yourself and your whole family.
It is about us!
"I am the one who's in trouble here,okay?"
Not you!
Everything's not about you!
What you do reflects on us.
"Gosh,would you just shut up and just let me talk!"
?
Don't hit her.
Don't tell me how to treat my daughter.
She's not your daughter.
"She is our client,"
"And nobody touches our client,ever."
Tom.
Tom.
Tom!
Ron used some of the money
He's collected for your defense fund
"To post your bail, and he sent your parents home."
We both think it will be better for you and the trial.
You okay with that?
"Listen,i'm sorry about getting into it with your dad."
I'm sure he means well.
"No,he doesn't."
"Whatever my brothers did was fine,you know?"
"But he never trusted me, ever."
No!
- I Arthur?
"- Evil Clone, we do not touch the ""Don't"" button."
That would send Uncle Thrakkorzog back to his own dimension.
And let me say that hike back is no picnic.
I'd rather be strained through a chain-link fence.
[Shudders]
"Clone, go next door and fetch me a tissue sample from the Tick."
Got it?
A tissue sample.
I Arthur.
"You'll never get away with this, you over-confident blob."
The Tick will be on to that flimsy fabrication in a second.
He hasn't got a chance against the always-wary eye of the ever-alert Tick.
[Snores]
[Door opens]
[Snores]
"[Tick mutters] Oh, hello..."
"[Tick] Oh, no..."
[Tick jabbers]
"Arthur, I just had the strangest dream."
"I was taking some math test I hadn't studied for, and then you tried to saw off my head."
"Weird, huh?"
I Arthur.
[Chuckles] Of course you are.
And I Tick.
[Chuckles]
"Whoa, oh... [crashing]"
"Oh, sorry, Arthur."
"Blast this uncommon cold, anyway."
"Well, only one thing to do now."
Wear this supercold down with many hours of daytime television.
You tell him to kill me.
"Sir, you can't do this, Sir, try and under..."
Which kind of sound is this?
"Even Papa, don't know."
"See, how much comfortable?"
"To Sit, To Lay."
You don't have adjust every time.
"It's right, it must be comfortable in the matter of get up and down."
Yes!
"Otherwise, customers complains a lot."
"You have to adjust while sitting, walking,"
Right!
"Gents could do that, but ladies have a problem with that."
"Show me, I showed you."
You told me about the side effective.
"Show me the stuff, What you want to see more?"
This one.
"This, this."
I am showing you this since long.
"Look, Madam since you're showing me that's good but I am... the perfect business man."
"Till I didn't show the real stuff, I don't make deals, this one."
Show me the red west and brief.
Full piece.
Here's your Boss stuff.
"Bhai's diamonds, I'm sorry it's late to delivery you Boss must be angry with me."
Yes!
"He's solid angry, Please say him sorry from me."
I will be grateful to you for my entire life.
Please!
I am very upset and
I am sorry!
Please!
Just say it.
Unless you tear that notebook up.
If it's really so important to you...
Are we going to meet tomorrow?
I don't mind...
If I ever catch you...
"Is that you, Bernau?"
Just wait!
We know it was you who made a hole in Karel's boat!
You bastard!
Me?
"It wasn't me, I swear!"
Stop that!
How dare you lie about that as well?
"It's not enough that he scares the fish away, but..."
Just leave him.
"Look there, sheep!"
"That's right, this kind is from the hillsides."
There were some especially good areas for keeping sheep in Australia and Wallachia during the second half of the 20th century.
Those aren't sheep.
I think they're cows.
Weren't the sheep kind of woolly?
- What's a sheep?
- Perhaps we should get back to our mission.
We aren't here on a school trip.
"We must adjust the program, I think."
"Watch out, a bus!"
People who live like nomads.
Mostly they came from the poor parts of the countryside.
Working under the Sun.
"So I told him, ""You'll know if she starts talking!"""
- But she needed no introduction.
Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of mothballs.
When were they issued?
This morning?
What do you do for heat in this barrack?
No stove.
"The men here used it as a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily."
How long is temporarily?
I trust not until July.
Here you see a meal the prisoners are getting.
"Schulz, what are we having today?"
Bean soup mit ham hocks.
Would you like to taste it?
"- Thank you, no."
-Where's the ham hock?
There should be a ham hock!
"When you find it, we'll send it to Geneva."
Are there any complaints?
Please speak up.
Don't be afraid to talk.
"That's what the Geneva convention is for to protect the rights of prisoners of war, whether they are Americans or Germans."
- What have you got to say?
-I like it here.
What about you?
"It's all right, considering."
What happened to you?
Were you beaten?
Why don't you answer?
- What did you do to this man?
-They didn't do nothing.
- Who beat you?
- Nobody beat me.
"Yeah, nobody knows that better than I do."
Trust me.
But I also know that she knows stuff about people.
She's got a real gift for that.
"So, I'm gonna ask you."
Once.
What was she talking about?
"[inhales, exhales]"
Remember that little ditty I told you about looking for something new in Mexico?
"- Yeah, I remember not buying it."
- I was running.
His name's Clayton.
Met him on the rodeo circuit in Waco.
We were gonna swipe the main till at the stock show.
"Night before the show, he got good and drunk, he beat the shit out of me."
"Jitters, I guess."
"And the next day, we pulled the job."
"And when it came time to run, I left him holding' the bag in a tunnel with a six-pack of good ol' boys."
- So that's who you did the deal with.
- Yeah.
- But how that bitch knew about it...
- Forget it.
- She's like the plague.
- [laughs]
"The longer she's around, the more damage she does, which is why we're skipping this job."
"What are you, crazy?"
"Come on, it's... because of her!"
"Trust me, all right?"
She's bad for business.
- I don't want it.
- That's bullshit.
"- Okay, there's more to it."
"Look, he ate a coin."
- A coin?
Yup.
An incident with the kebab.
Border!
Hurry.
Finga being a woman.
"As the border guard approached, I was all in sweat."
"I imagined someone imprisoning me, he would take off my clothes"
And confiscate the camera.
"It's already done, you know."
"Fortunately, our clandestine escape coincided with another story."
"Sorry, Nicolas, but we're in a crisis of identity."
Crisis?
- We do not agree with anything.
Anything.
Anything.
"The old generation wants tradition, we merge."
"In Istanbul, we had to appear on television"
For the first time after so many years.
Stupid storm.
But Mr. Lloyd will make a music video.
"Yes, I hope so."
The first shot was just to have fun.
Maybe they just had to clear their minds.
The real canton for the video is a cosmic classic.
"Then, Mr. Lloyd, his flight plan ends so?"
Miss?
- Ana.
"Ana, yes."
Can you give us some information on transport?
Yes.
- This was awkward.
"Like, ""Wait a minute, no way."
Seth Meyers?
"- That wasn't him."""
- Their mouths were making noises.
"- I'm like, ""Why are you telling me?"""
"- They totally made out, like, for real."
"This was an interesting biological experiment, to have them making out in the back of that Yugo for a whole night."
- I think that's fake.
"- Yeah, they committed."
- Something came over them.
- Did they get pregnant that night?
Their characters did.
The characters got pregnant.
"Their characters did, they did."
Sick.
Was it awk...?
Did they...?
"Like, when you guys would cut in between would, then, they sit on opposite sides?"
"- No, we were all talking."
- They were chilling.
- Or were they still making out?
- They were friends before this.
"So it was more comfortable than it would've been, I think."
I don't think they were friends in italics.
They weren't friends afterwards.
No.
Bet she was pointy.
"It was fun, though."
I remember laughing a lot this night.
And we went really late this night.
"I think we went till, like, 6 or 7."
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"So we throw some in a college fund, but the rest is fair game, right?"
"After taxes, after we pay Doug and after my management fee."
"Okay, fine, manager."
- Can you loan me a few grand?
- What for?
Clothes.
I had my cancer purge.
"But now I am in the public eye, and I have nothing to wear."
You want to take Isabelle's hard-earned dollars and blow them on glad rags for your star turn on Agrestic Access TV?
You bought a motorcycle and a ridiculous leather jacket.
All right.
Let me think about it.
No.
- Are you okay?
You look a little frazzled.
- I'm fine.
- Who kicks ass?
- I'm guessing you.
I totally kick ass!
"- What does ""kicking ass"" entail?"
"- A girlfriend, but that's not all."
Did a free cheese grater come with the girlfriend?
"Oh, stop it."
I'm gonna be the class speaker for graduation.
"- Sweetie, that's fantastic."
"- Way to go, little man!"
The whole lower school voted.
I'm gonna go start working on my speech.
"- Congratulations, honey."
- Thanks.
"- Oh, are we worried?"
"When I saw you there, I just lost control."
Who are you?
!
I saw the magazine.
I'm really not that kind of person!
Just five minutes.
Let me talk to you?
"I can understand why you are worried because perverts might call you or write you letters,"
but I'm not like that.
So warm.
Just leave me alone.
I'm not that kind of woman.
I'm not a porn model and never have been.
I'm not like that.
I'm not that kind of woman.
I'm not!
Excuse me?
I have to lock the toilets shortly.
What do you think you are doing in my room?
I'm a manager of this apartment.
I can come in.
Can you please leave now?
There's been a lot of female underwear stolen from around here lately.
And?
"And what's more, the daughter of Mr Yamashita who lives across the road, says you often peek into her room."
Have you got any evidence?
I have a proper girlfriend.
Why would I be interested in that school girl?
Look at that.
You've made a stain on the wall.
Are you cleaning the room properly?
That was there when I moved in.
"You killed leslie stoltz,"
And we can tie you to both.
You guys are pretty funny.
"I mean, you just crack me up."
You really think you're gonna pin a murder rap on me...
Based on a lambskin condom?
I don't think anybody here
"Mentioned a lambskin condom, genius."
That's knowledge only the killer would have.
Ah.
"You know, mr."
Enright told me
That she'd be a willing participant.
He told me that he was sick of the bitch.
"He gave her to me, as a bonus,"
Because we had a good year.
"You know, if she would've just relaxed and just..."
"Stayed with the program,"
Everything would've been just fine.
So that's when leslie tried to stop you.
She came barging in.
"And everything kind of went, uh..."
Everything kind of went haywire.
"Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
So you roofied anna
Because she wouldn't cooperate.
"I didn't roofie anybody, pint-size."
That was tony.
Do you want her?
You can have her.
Watch for him.
We will.
Thank you.
"I'd wish you luck, but what you'll need is a miracle."
He's more than three hours late.
We have to consider the possibility that he's been arrested.
You mustn't believe what he told you about me.
I don't believe it.
You're not a coward.
I had to keep my little girl safe.
It was just too dangerous to get involved.
Can you understand?
Your mother wouldn't listen.
She wanted to fight.
She was always...so passionate about what she believed in.
She didn't care about the risk.
You were proud of her.
I didn't want to lose her.
I didn't want you to grow up without a mother.
I tried so hard to change her mind and finally she changed mine.
She convinced me to go with her.
I said I would meet her...
by the river.
She was leading a raid against a Mokra supply center.
I said I would meet her... but I didn't...
I couldn't.
I was too afraid.
She was still waiting for me when they arrested her.
I could never tell you about this.
I knew you would hate me.
I couldn't bear that.
"Please, Ralkana, if you can ever forgive me..."
"I'm not sure that is how conversation happens, Marcus."
"No, I think that is how conversation happens."
That's right.
"My God, we've got 60 years of conversational experience between us I'm sure we can come up with something."
"Okay, then."
"- So, Fiona."
- You first.
"Will, why did your wife chuck you?"
Marcus!
"No, it's okay."
It's fine.
Good question.
"I'm quite comfortable talking about it, actually."
She chucked me because she was basically going through this whole:
"""I want to find out who I am"", malarkey and thing."
"Which is selfish, considering she had a kid and all that."
And did she find out who she was?
She was a figment of my twisted imagination.
That's who she was.
"Not really, no."
"I'm not sure anyone really does, do they?"
"We know who we are, don't we?"
That's right.
You're a depressive hippie and her weirdo son.
- What are we?
- We're us.
- And what are we not?
- Sheep!
And what does a sheep go?
This was going really well.
I wondered if we'd move into Will's place or someplace new.
What type of car is yours?
That's...
"I'm flattered, I think."
"But I, uh..."
I can't do that.
"- No, no."
I understand.
- Nothing personal.
"No, I understand."
Just asking purely from a scientific approach.
What about after?
After what?
"The surgery, to see if anything still works."
"I'm gonna have to take a pass on that, too."
"Abby, you want this?"
GSW to the upper chest!
I gotta....
I better get back.
You want to hop on?
"I mean... are you coming to the, uh, for the..."
"Place a chest tube, call me if the initial output's over 500cc's."
How's Grace?
We moved her to one of our exam rooms so we're going to take you to her.
"Mrs. Anderson, I brought some mug books for you to look through."
"It all happened so fast,"
I'm not really sure what I remember seeing.
"Well, take a look."
Maybe a face will jog your memory.
I can't.
- Why don't you give us a few minutes?
- Sure.
I don't want to look at those books.
You might be able to identify the two men who drove you off the road.
Got a place to sleep?
I'll manage.
Don't worry about me.
"What about you, Alain?"
Leslie's in New York.
I won't go.
It's not for me.
I'm not ready.
"Later, maybe."
For now it's painting.
I still have a lot to learn.
It means going back to Kabul.
I know it'll be tough.
The Situationist International arrived at a point in History as the thought of a world collapsing.
It is now occurring before our eyes.
The new era is deeply revolutionary.
and it knows it.
"In all of society, no one can or will continue as before."
We will not submit to what is going on.
The demand of life has become a revolutionary program.
"It's Wolfblood, not werewolf."
We're not monsters.
Could someone live and act as a human but actually be a completely different species?
"On the full moon, do you change in the house?"
In here?
"No, we've got a secure room in the cellar."
The cellar?
"We call it the den, it has everything a wolf desires."
- What you doing?
- Checking Maddy's blood out.
- Do you have to lock me in?
The size of an asteroid?
The power requirements would be staggering.
My people used it
To transportandromeda to a safe place.
You transported the wholeandromeda?
To a safe place?
What safe place?
Why?
I don't know.
I was sent to make contact with you.
"Oh, well, you certainly did that."
"In fact,"
"You made a lot more contact than i'm happy with,"
But there's no reason to go into it.
I think we all know
Where we stand on that.
"All right, you got me."
I'd like to see your... tesseract generator.
We'll take my loving bucket of bolts.
But i'm not driving.
What is it
"With crazy people and asteroids, anyway?"
The plan was
To draw the andromedainto range
And send her through a tesseract.
That's all i know.
"Yeah, well, theandromeda"
"Is not responding to my halls,"
"So either your plan worked,"
Or you're lying to us.
"In which case,"
There's only one way to find out.
"Thank you, Nicky."
"Dragan, how would you describe your life?"
Well...
"Everything happens differently, you know."
Nothing was what I wanted it to be.
You are perhaps the only one who knows that is true.
But now I just try...
To feel felt pain.
And it would be enough for me now.
Describe the pain.
"Do not ask me this, please."
Remember picker?
Of course I remember it.
I and you have lived the whole war.
Do you remember when you called me and you told me not to get out?
Why do you ask me if I remember it?
- Why did not you want it to go out?
What do you think I did not do?
"It would launch my career, but I heard you."
And I did not quit it.
You...
You just...
Did something that no one else would have done.
And  I...
I can not believe you did it.
"All right, I admit it."
"I tried to convince Dragan to get him out, but I did not succeed."
My chosen movie shooter will never see the light.
But the king had listened carefully to every word.
You do not like it?
- Yes I like it.
"That's just the beginning, try again."
I'm unholdable.
It was just too scary.
"Like you're a Bruce Willis movie, Unholdable."
This is...
I think it's terrific.
Try and get as close to my hands as you can without touching them.
- It's so good.
- But this is my favorite.
- This is one of my favorite moments.
- We did a lot of versions of this.
- What's that?
What?
- This.
Look at us go.
I don't remember any of this.
It's one of the few times in the movie where you were improvising.
- And I...
"- Yeah, I guess so."
I don't think you know where it's going.
"Usually, when you improvise, you have a sense of where you're gonna land."
Yeah.
"But in this case you didn't, and I think that the way you were feeling that really makes that special."
"It makes it what it is, because it's so in the moment."
And it's really cute.
I'm not gonna lie.
Baruchel.
Slow down the sexy bus.
It was really fun.
It was good having Jay around.
I would like to...
I would like to also tell people that Jay didn't smoke cigarettes this day and put candy in his mouth because I'm not a smoker.
And it was very sweet of him.
Your dad is a police officer...
You shouldn't say that.
Then why are you running away?
- Come here.
- Let go of me.
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry that I'm a day late.
This... is that watch that high school students like these days.
Tell me now.
Did you kill someone or not?
I didn't.
Soo Bin...
"Your father is... is trying to catch a really bad guy, and that's why he's hiding right now."
"If you were five years younger, that's how I would have explained it."
Um...
I still don't know how I should explain it.
But you'll still...
"believe in me, won't you?"
I told you... that I want to make this a better world for you.
Then are you saying that I was the one who was wrong?
I'm not saying that.
"I'm telling you to believe in me, Soo Bin."
I'm asking you to believe in me.
We're family.
We know each other better than anybody knows anybody.
You shouldn't have run away if you did nothing wrong!
Okay.
That was... my mistake.
"Well, I have to go now."
There were times when...
I... didn't believe in you.
So I'm reflecting on that.
"No, sorry."
"I was looking for, what are the ovaries?"
"Oh, the o..."
"Yeah, I always mix those two up."
Try not to.
Your future will be brighter.
Can you tell us anything about ovulation or how pregnancy occurs?
"Well, the man's got the sperm, and the woman's got the egg."
"Now, once a month, an egg slides down the Philippine tube towards the uterus."
"The first sperm to reach the egg wins, it gets a medal, it's born, you name him Cory, you push him out the door, and nothing makes sense for the rest of his life."
Congratulations.
You seem to have a thorough understanding of the life cycle.
"- Hey, I live it."
- Any questions?
Yes?
How do you get a girl to say hi?
Michael and Lisa Marie?
- Looks like it.
- Since when?
- Just now.
That was it.
"- What, that?"
- Yeah.
You saw it happen.
- I can't believe it.
"I saw it happen, and I still don't know how it happens."
"Stop obsessing, man."
You're gonna pop a lobe.
You're right.
"I should relax, 'cause this coupling thing, it's just a phase."
"I mean, how long can it last..."
a few weeks?
- Won't you reconsider?
"- You were a hopeless doctor, but you're a brilliant coward."
The rats are deserting the sinking ship.
But no great loss - he was hardly a scientific genius.
"I'll stay with you, even if all hell breaks loose."
You're guaranteed to go to heaven.
- If there were more people like you...
- Stop it.
"I really don't know if I've pleased the Lord that much, but He might have turned a blind eye now and then."
Padre Miguel.
"Look, they're here."
Let's just hope that they won't harm the ones who've stayed.
"Padre Miguel, that's the guerrilleros, isn't it?"
- How could we forget about you?
- Help me.
- They mustn't find out who you are.
- We should take off his uniform.
Up here.
We've got injured people out there.
"We need beds, a nurse, and most of all antibiotics."
"I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't here."
He was scared.
He fled.
- And we've only got two vacant beds.
- I need three beds.
Jaime!
- You can't do this.
- This man is injured.
Show some sympathy.
- He's in the militia.
- How cruel!
- Get him out.
You know what?
Just go.
Seriously.
"Okay,the band rents the rehearsal space."
It's not like we're meeting in somebody's basement.
Are you not attracted to me?
What?
!
"I just can't help thinking if I was some hot,tatted-up 22-year-old, maybe rehearsal wouldn't seem so important right now."
This is insane.
"I mean,I know I've gained a little weight, but it's not like I'm not going to lose it."
"I just have to be careful because of my food issues, and,yes,maybe I have a tra of body dismorphic disorder again, but whatever."
Who doesn't?
I have to go.
You're so grossed out right now!
"I am not grossed out,okay?"
I'm just late.
Don't leave me!
What is with you tonight?
I don't know!
I don't know...
Fine.
Let's go take a freakin' bath and figure it out.
Come on.
Let's go make raising fingers.
"Baby,the MySpace page is just for the band."
You have nothing to worry about.
I can't believe you were stalking me on MySpace.
"Hey,would you mind washing my back?"
Mind?
I'd pay good money to wash that back.
Come here.
Just stop!
"What are you gonna do, Allison, hmm..."
When your stupid bitch of boyfriend turns on you?
They kill your aunt.
They almost kill Lydia.
"Who do you really think's gonna be next, hmm?"
Not you.
"No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love."
"Is that what you tell yourself, hmm?"
"""Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."""
"Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead."
I just...
I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
"Actually, he has."
Allison?
What are you doing here?
I...
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
* You got the epic mother... *
* you got the epic mother... *
* you got the epic mother... *
* you got the epic mother... *
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
That's something I got to live with every day.
Where's the cuff link?
I keep it right here.
Always.
So I'll never forget.
Slowly.
Take it.
What now?
What now?
I think you know what to do.
"In light of the new evidence that's been presented to us,"
I would like to extend
"A long overdue apology to jesse cardoza,"
"On behalf of the city, this department"
And the district attorney's office.
"Mr. Cardoza, who is no longer a member of the lapd,"
Is a shining example of what this department
And all its officers should strive for every day.
"Hey, sweetheart, sweetheart, hey, don't worry."
I'm gonna be out of here by dinner.
It's all gonna be fine.
We can go to our special little place that we love
To go to together.
You remember that place?
Remember that place?
"Do you remember that place, huh?"
!
Just go to hell!
Huh?
!
You little bitch!
"you're making a really bad mistake, sweetheart."
"He's Mr. Yokomoto, the truant officer."
He's trying to make us go back to school.
Let's go.
That's our hideout.
When do the ghosts get here?
Don't say things like that.
This place could really scare ya.
Come on.
This is where we're gonna live when we run away from home.
"Yeah, you can't be tough if you take orders from your mom or older sister."
That's why we quit school.
"You can't be tough and educated, too."
- Tony!
- Where?
I had a contact with him.
You...
You calling on the spirits?
- She's weird.
- She's creepy.
I...
I ain't too sure I wanna meet this Tony.
"Tony, where are you?"
He's coming in again.
I can only see a light.
That's all.
Now it's... going black.
Now it's... completely gone.
He's doing that?
He's projecting a magnetic field through his reflexes as he struggles to regain consciousness.
"His output is so great, that my machines aren't even capable of measuring it."
But he's dangerous.
"Once I have control of his brain, Letha, he will only be dangerous to others."
Here you have.
It is it to me before.
How I have left?
I do not understand how you can lower like this.
"Ten, for fortify."
Is it possible to be known who is that girl by whom arms as much trouble?
"Good morning, Mr. Santarelli."
You are friends of him?
"No, we are of the S.L.R. Service Cleaning New born."
"Yes, those that leave bad we threw, them."
What has happen to him?
Notices some sharp pain?
Where?
Here?
In the kidneys?
Where it is?
I pillaged it.
The temperature is normal.
What feels?
"Go, Go."
"Well, Doctor, we go away."
"Yes, we have an appointment in tanatorio."
One has gone to him?
"It was not a real pain, it is an emotional reaction."
It seemed to him that he was bad and he began to complain.
But now it is under my cares.
"A series of analysis will be necessary, so that it is better so that it is better to drain the intestine completely, we are going to begin by a medicinal injection."
-It does damage to me.
-Shut up.
Lady?
there is something for me?
Delay mail?
"I'll take the key now, friend."
You are a liar and a cheat and a coward.
Just the key.
Not in the back.
"You can turn around, if you want to."
"I'm just trying to save your life, that's all."
"You kill me, you're gonna protect this half girl, half woman?"
and that boy?
One thing is clear.
"The world has lost a brave, a valiant heart."
"An humble man, a man of small pretensions,"
Boise Peabody's last dying wish was...
Boise Peabody?
"I come to see my brother buried, not the little snake that killed him."
Fill it up.
Wait a minute.
"After the ceremony, all right?"
Fill it up.
Stop!
"Stop, stop!"
The proudest moment of my life.
The whole mining camp turned out to pay their last respects.
You ain't gonna spoil it for me.
"Boise, ain't you dead?"
He is now.
Boise Peabody killed your brother in a fair fight.
"Uh-huh, and now I'm gonna kill him."
He's not armed.
"That's a mistake that you ain't likely to make again now, are you, Boise?"
"Fontana, I won't stand here and watch you murder him."
Just do whatever you like.
Now then.
We'll go there.
Hold on.
Hold on.
"How do I know once I give it to you, you won't just kill me?"
Why should I trust you?
Ohhh.
"Mr. Sodor, if you help me,"
"I promise you, I'll repay the favor."
I'm a man of my word.
"But, uh..."
I lack patience.
"And suddenly, I'm overwhelmed with trust."
Could you stop...
loading your gun for a second?
Stop loading.
Just stop loading.
Just want to make sure that I heard you correctly.
You're sending that psychopath here?
!
"Yeah, that's the whole idea."
"Mike goes in, steers him to the house."
"Jabbar comes here, attacks the place."
We call the cops on him.
W-why am I hearing about this part of the plan just now?
T-the part where my last remaining possession gets chopped up by machine-gun fire and then turned into a crime scene?
!
Because we knew you'd get all whiny on us.
Whiny?
!
"Listen -- the good news is, you don't have to part of the fireworks this time, okay?"
Fi's gonna take you up the road to a nice little motel.
You sit tight there.
No snowballs reported in hell.
No sightings of flying pigs.
-What am I gonna do?
-You don't know?
"Come on, Alan, you were married for 1 2 years."
What does marriage have to do with sex?
Point taken.
"Okay, you want some tips?"
"No, no, nothing like that."
I need step-by-step instructions.
All right.
Since this is your first bout in this weight class...
... I'dsaystickwiththebasics.
Better to do the simple stuff well than the fancy stuff badly.
Got it.
And the simple stuff would be... .
"Well, you know how women like you to go slow?"
Really?
My ex-wife put a premium on brevity.
"Her motto was, ""Less is more, and none is perfect. """
"Well, Sherri's not like that."
You're gonna wanna take your time.
-l can do that.
-But don't loiter either.
You don't want her to get bored and play solitaire on your head.
No loitering.
Got it.
-Something else?
-Okay.
"When you're with a woman like Sherri, who's so gosh-darn beautiful..."
... thatyougetexcited just thinking about her...
... howdoyoukeepthesprinklersfrom going off while you're still mowing?
"Yeah, felt all of it."
I got my head turned inside out.
JIM:
Jesus.
"Them Indians down Texas way they may rob you, but they ain't gonna take your topknot."
JIM:
When was it?
"Goddamn it, will you quit that noise now, will you?"
Quit it.
FITZGERALD:
I'mfallingfurtherback fromHenryandthe boys onaccountof tendingtoyou.
"Got to get up the damn mountain, but winter keeps chasing us down."
If you ready to take the sacrament I can do that for you.
"What you holding to, Glass?"
You know it would be better if you were to take that last breath of yours now... for all of us.
Now you hung tough.
And that's something.
I'm begging you.
Them Ree are so close I can smell 'em.
"You can smell 'em, too."
You got to think of your boy.
All right?
'Cause you're gonna kill him.
You'll kill us all.
(MUTTERING)
I can muzzle you if you like.
Take away this suffering quick and easy.
No one ever has to know that you give up.
All you have to do is blink if you want me to do that.
(GRUNTING SOFTLY)
Save your boy and blink.
You just have to blink.
I'm not a cheater.
Neither is Natalie.
That's all I have to say.
"Well, I'm afraid we can prove otherwise, Captain Stottlemeyer."
"After the drawing, we received a phone call."
An anonymous tip.
I asked Mr. Lawrence to check it out.
I reviewed the tape from Monday night's show.
"I didn't see anything suspicious, so we examined the machine itself."
We examined the balls.
"We measured them, we weighed them."
We were bouncing them.
And everything seemed perfectly normal.
"So, what's the problem?"
This is the problem.
The same numbers?
The same numbers.
But that's not possible.
That's what we thought.
So we tried again.
And again.
And again.
And the same six numbers kept popping up.
"Not always in the same order, but the very same numbers."
How did that happen?
They're very lucky numbers?
Metallic paint.
"Very good, Mr. Monk."
We took a closer look.
The numbers on these six balls and only these six balls were painted with metal-based paint.
All the others were acrylic based.
There's a magnet in the microphone.
What did you see?
Who is that?
Independent Auxiliary Unit 13...
"I heard you were a descendant of ""Koga ninjas,"""
but your talents exceed my expectations.
Looks like I need to examine this further.
What is this?
What have you been doing here?
It's exactly what you see.
Remember it as you embark on your journey to death.
How did you get there?
You did this?
You punk!
Cross Tornado!
It's all over.
"Ambition, love, relationships..."
These are the reasons why we stake our lives for battle.
The battle with the giant deity brings back memories of pain.
"From the day I lost my big brother, my battle had begun."
"Don't miss: ""The Great Soldier"" on Great Dangaioh."
That's not right Kuya...
Why aren't you being more like your usual goofy self?
"C'mon, I know you can do it!"
Um... what do you mean by that?
"So, how are you feeling?"
I feel much better now.
"Well, I certainly hope so."
You've been asleep for a week.
"But as your doctor, let me say something..."
"You're only human, you know."
Remember that.
Right...
Good to see you.
All right.
"Let's all get back to work, for chrissake, okay?"
"In my office, man."
Let's see what you bozos been up to lately.
You okay?
Hanging in?
What's it look like?
- What's this from A.P.D?
- Been checking with them to see if they come across that famous blue meth of yours.
"Sure enough, last night."
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.
Maybe you'd like to go with me?
Yeah.
"Well, all right."
"You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man."
I feel manipulated.
I thought we were gonna hang out.
"We are hanging out, Badger."
You like Badger or Brandon?
"I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution."
"Badger, listen."
Hey.
"I'm trying to help you here, man."
"Now, if you just tell me who your supplier is I think this can end very well for you."
"What are you doing, detective, talking to my client without me present?"
You sneaky Pete.
Which is which?
"What, did the academy hire you right out of the womb?"
You guys get younger every...
What'd you say to baby face?
No.
No.
So...
How you doing?
"Oh, you know, lousy."
"Montezuma's revenge, big time."
"I mean, everything's going through me like crap through a tinhorn."
Better not get too close.
"Well, I'll take my chances."
I guess you heard about what happened down in Juárez?
Terrible.
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.
It's like Apocalypse Now down there.
It's like Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle.
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.
"Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh?"
"You know, you don't put your second most senior man on the trail of those motherless bastards you send him home."
You know?
"I was, you know..."
"""He's out getting an evidence bag and so ends up without a scratch on him."
"So must be something wrong with that picture, you know."""
So are you home for good then?
"No, no."
It's...
Playing it by ear.
To be determined.
Think you might wanna talk it through with somebody?
"What, a shrink?"
"No, no, no."
Can't go down that road.
"Start going down that road, kiss your career goodbye."
- What's happening?
- His heart's already stopped.
She's just trying to reboot it.
There.
That's the manual override.
- Are you sure?
- Just hold the tablet still.
[grunts] Shit.
[flatline continues]
[machine beeping rhythmically]
[exhales]
Sir?
I'm wondering who you have handling tech on Roger's murder investigation.
That's above your paygrade.
This isn't about Roger anymore.
I spoke to his father; he thinks it's an inside job.
"If we lose that supplier,"
"Spiga's current crop yield takes a hit, we can kiss our second-quarter projections good-bye."
That's above your paygrade and mine.
I meant what I said in there.
Roger was my friend.
"An asshole, but... my friend."
I know you need the help.
You don't even have a crime scene location.
How do you know that?
You wouldn't still be here if you did.
♪
My men scoured that trash dump.
There's not a trace of Roger Caplan or his assailant.
How'd you determine the location?
GPS from his car.
"Well, you can look there all day,"
"Gloria, here you have yours."
Thanks.
You help me?
"But, if you obtain to marry you with Alvaro..."
I will live like one lady.
-Yes.
"Good afternoon, Senator,"
You have seen that we have gotten dressed as you like it?
Very pretty!
Precious!
I am hoping to you with the full portfolio so that you make it to me happen well.
Beautiful.
He will see how we will try to him.
"Very well I am wishing, it."
"Today I am in form, girls."
"How much it is going to give to us, today?"
Today I feel more generous than ever.
Sr. Santarelli!
Get up.
Get up!
"Mr. Santarelli, I have wanted to request the opinion of my colleague before making other analyses."
To operate!
To operate!
To operate!
So that wretch of Cicchirini me has spoiled it everything.
-And you have played it to you.
-Yes.
I have played it to me.
Boys?
we are going to give him to a lesson to that swine of Cicchirini?
-A double lesson.
-We will occur it.
"Are you fooling me, Brother Foon?"
"Master, if she bites me, what'll I do then?"
"If you switch her on by your tongue, she won't bit you, right?"
"Master, you are so nice to me."
"I am so nice to you, right?"
Yes.
Brother Yan.
Master.
Come here...
Ask her to stay in this room and don't leave.
"Later, water will come through this hole and aim at your face."
Stuff this pig's tongue into this hole.
Understand?
Yes.
Repeat once please.
Damn it!
"Later, a water-column will flush in through this hole."
"When you are damn wet, you stuff this damn pig's tongue into... this bloody hole."
You should have said in this way.
What a creep!
Let me have a second thought.
When Foon is kissing the pig's tongue which Yan's holding.
I'll be here to kiss Lotus.
"If she accused us,"
Foon will admit all the blames!
"Lotus will slap Foon severely, again and again and I'll go forward and kick him severely too."
"Lotus will lean on my chest, and I'll comfort her."
"I'll make her drunk, then I will..."
Who else can be the King of Brain-truster in this world except me?
No one else!
Why are you carrying luggage?
Moving?
Health teacher sick again?
Not a lot of credibility.
I wonder what kind of creepy substitute we'll get today.
Wow.
That is no substitute.
That is the real thing.
"Good afternoon, class."
"I'm Ms. Kelly, and I'll be filling in for Mr. Dubin for the next few days."
"On behalf of the entire class, I'd like to say... stay as long as you like."
"Now, right now, you seem to be covering..."
"CPR, and I'm today's dummy."
"No, actually, we seem to be up to human reproduction, which I hope we can discuss in a mature fashion."
(laughter)
"Oh, stop being so young."
"You know, I'm not as young as they are."
"I've stayed back, like, 50 times."
- Really?
How old are you?
- 24?
Really?
What are you doing in a seventh-grade classroom?
I'm a cop.
Sit down.
"All right, but I'm watching you."
"All right, who can tell us the name of the organ where the eggs are stored?"
Officer?
"Oh, sorry, Ms. Kelly."
I don't have that stuff.
I can name the stuff I have.
Or at least what I call them.
"All right, the name of the place where the eggs are stored."
What are the gonads?
It all boils down to the old question.
Is there a life after marriage?
She just didn't wanna hurt my pride.
Wants me to think that I'm the breadwinner.
Pretty soon the romance goes.
"And, as the song says women get weary wearing the same shabby dress."
"Well, then, that's the time to go out and buy her another shabby dress."
That's why she's doing it this way.
Instead of just wapping up a million dollars.
"I guess I have been selfish forcing her to give up her witchhood, live on my salary."
- Poor little witch.
"- You see, the thing to do is to try to keep the magic in your marriage."
I guess I'll just have to go along with her.
She's been a great wife.
Be my way of saying thanks.
"Oh, listen, you're welcome."
"Anytime, Darrin, old boy."
Anytime.
"Oh, Darrin!"
"Oh, it's..."
It's beautiful.
"Well, you shouldn't have."
"Oh, but I'm glad you did."
"Well, I can afford it."
Because you got the Waterhouse account?
"You guessed I would, huh?"
"Well, you deserve it."
It's beautiful.
"You like my gift, huh?"
"Well, Darrin, you know what they say."
"It isn't the gift, it's the thought that counts."
"Oh, yes, of course I like it."
Babar Quereshi just published a mathematical formula for perpetual calendar calculations.
"I know you think he's perfect, but not yet."
You must let me have this one.
He needs to be pushed just a little more.
[Tires squealing]
[Sighs]
[Footsteps approaching]
"What's the feeling, Otto?"
They were all outliers.
Their gifts set them apart from the world.
Like you're set apart?
There was no one to protect them.
What would happen to me if you went away?
Same exact heroin compound found in all five victims.
None had a history of street drug use.
This is a homicide investigation now.
US or local PD?
[Chuckles] Five victims over three states.
"I think we take this one, don't you?"
"Yes ma'am, I think we do."
Kevin Whitfield's parents came to us.
Said his death wasn't an O.D.
If I'd have stopped it then...
"No, the Bureau didn't."
So I'm telling you to stop it now.
Use whatever you need.
No more bodies like this.
"Yes, ma'am."
Agent Pritchard.
How'd you make the connection?
Kept digging.
Then just got lucky.
how will you find your way?
The End
"Charles, you have finally lost your senses"
This venture is impossible.
For some.
"Gentlemen, the only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it IS possible."
That kind of thinking could ruin you
I'm willing to take that chance.
Imagine a trading post in Rangoon!
"Bangkok, Jakarta!"
The nightmare again?
I won't be long
I'm falling
Down a dark hole.
Then I see strange creatures.
What kind of creatures?
"There's a dodo bird, a rabbit in a waist coat and a smiling cat"
I did not know cats could smile.
Neither did I.
And there is a blue caterpillar.
A blue caterpillar?
Do you think I've gone round the bend?
I'm afraid so.
"You're mad, bonkers, off your head"
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.
"It's only a dream, Alice, nothing can harm you there."
"But if you get too frightened, You can always wake up."
Like this
Must we go?
I doubt he'll notice if we never arrive
"If there's nothing out there,"
It's gonna be A huge disappointment.
But I'm not gonna give up.
90 miles east of nome...
Shawn pomrenke is trying To strike gold.
At a remote spot of his own.
We made great time.
Like glass out here.
And he's not about To let any previous mishaps.
Hold him back.
I think this hunting for Treasure at the bluff.
Is gonna Finally pay off.
Everybody's always wondering.
Why I get more gold Than everybody else.
It's because I work A hell of a lot harder.
Than they do.
This summer...
I know there's a Pile of gold down there.
Mr. Gold has gambled On the bluff...
Puddles and puddles Of gold.
A coastal trench nearly A 100 miles east of town...
There it is Right there.
Where he's convinced An untapped hot spot.
Could set off The next alaskan gold rush.
"But so far, instead of gold, It's only yielded Frustration..."
Damn it!
I wanted to go.
Here we are.
Another day.
And he's feeling The heat from dad.
"A couple hundred thousand bucks In the bluff,"
And we ain't got no gold Out of it yet.
Thank you.
Don't worry.
"When I first started, I could barely hook up an I.V."
It's all muscle memory.
"You'll get it, Inez, I know you will."
I felt like an idiot.
I didn't even know what a T-pod was.
Everybody needs help with stuff.
"When you do, come find me."
Thanks.
Page me when he's out of surgery.
Will do.
- Hello.
You're back.
- Had a cancellation.
He's this way.
"I tried calling Lee's cell, but he wasn't answering."
- Is everything okay?
"- Yeah, he's doing great."
We're just waiting for them to take him up to the cath lab.
"Ooh, that sounds ominous."
"They're going to do an angioplasty, which is a procedure where we insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg, thread it up to his coronary artery, which is used to inflate a balloon that will open up the blockage."
Guess those cheese steaks caught up with me.
I've been telling him to eat better for years.
"Hey, you!"
"This is my... wife, Viv."
Hi.
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
- I've been treating your husband.
- Hi.
Everything's okay.
"I've got a little blockage, but they're gonna fix it."
"Well, we had a nice, long talk"
"- this afternoon, didn't we?"
- Yeah.
"Oh, my God, this is an intervention!"
"Yeah, you could kind of call it that."
"Listen, Gray, you're meant for more than sitting around answering trivia questions about history."
"Me, you, Firestorm."
We're made for changing history.
- This is my life.
- And your life will be waiting for you when you get back.
You really want me to do this?
"I could never forgive myself if I kept you from it, my husband the superhero."
Why are you looking at me like that?
Wasn't sure you'd make it.
"You left me a message, I came."
What of it?
I just wanted to talk.
"You and I, we've done a lot of thieving, a lot of cool stuff, a lot of fun."
"Anyway, I, uh..."
I just wanted to make sure
I said something important that wasn't left unsaid.
"Mick, I don't do touchy-feely."
"If you got something to say, say it."
This wasn't a good idea.
You're the best guy I ever knew.
"You may not think you're a hero, but you're a hero to me."
You got that?
"Yeah, I got it."
See you around.
You okay?
Fine.
- So did you tell him?
"God, that girl."
Is this whole house falling apart?
[SIGHS]
Oh!
"Christine, what are you...?"
Get off of me.
Just forget the sangria.
Bring some wine.
"Uh, Marly."
"You know, I don't work for you."
And I quit.
What?
"You know, I have been such a good sport up until now."
"But, I mean, I'm getting really tired of you and your friends looking down on me."
Why would we look down on you?
Since you came to this school the only person you've had something in common with is my maid.
"You know, uh, I could say something right now that would really hurt you too."
But I'm not gonna do that.
Because I'm a much nicer person than that.
You're too tan.
You know what would be great?
"If you could stop judging me for, like, a minute and give me a break."
Me judging you?
"Yeah, look, you've got it easy, okay?"
You don't care what people think about you.
You don't try to impress people with your car or your marriage.
Your clothes.
"I mean, you cut your own hair."
I don't cut my own hair.
This cost 60 bucks.
"Okay, you don't spend a lot of money on your hair."
The point is you seem very comfortable with yourself.
Please.
"In consideration of a Tót family, I promise,I will look for it."
- Yes.
- But do not expect partiality of me.
Yes.
"Na, what, Mariska?"
What?
This is the aim!
This does not untie everything of course.
I hope so I may expect you to be honest.
"Who gets tired, will speak."
Yeah?
"- Of course, major lord."
- Good.
"What happened, Tót?"
"Nothing, major lord."
"Because looked at leftwards, behind my back."
Yes...that.
A butterfly was flying in.
Butterfly?
What kind of butterfly?
Well as such...on him is two yellow patch and one red patch.
And you meanwhile the make of box you deal with butterflies ?
I just looked over there only.
Did you just look over there only?
"But you gave a thought to it meanwhile, following it would be good, to take, to strike dead."
"Happened so, or did not happen so?"
I believed only a little onto its.
I suspected it.
"Look, Tót family."
"I am very grateful for your hospitality, but this may not be going so keep moving."
This makes sense if this gives us pleasure equally only.
Although I'm gonna miss this place.
- I'm not.
This place stunk.
It's bush-league.
- Why'd you go here?
"My parents, wise investors that they are, couldn't afford anything else."
"Yeah, that 2.0 grade-point average didn't reason into things."
- Shut up.
- Between the lines.
Go die.
"Sure you don't wanna give it another go, 'cause you're darling together?"
- Thanks for the mirror.
- My pleasure.
"Hey, a bunch of us are going to Shaky's afterwards for pizza."
You want to come?
"I'm going out with my daughter after, but it sounds like fun."
You won't believe this.
There's some blue-blooded rich woman out there... setting up professional film equipment like she's shooting a movie.
- You're kidding.
- Whose mother is it?
I don't know.
Little precious must be around here somewhere.
- I hate people with money.
"- So do I, with every fiber of my being."
"Me, too."
Money people.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Are we leaving soon?
- I have no idea.
Should you have an idea?
"There was an accident, closed the interstate."
--------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
Can you believe this shit?
They started a Kickstarter account in my name called Justice For The Kyles.
"I'm not the Kyles, I'm just Kyle."
And I don't need justice.
I get it.
"I mean, you didn't sign up for this."
"If you weren't on the jury, you wouldn't have been downtown, you wouldn't have gotten jumped."
I got jumped because I'm a gay man in a world full of haters.
My mom and dad think I have a gay-bash target on my back.
They're worried any guy I meet at a bar is gonna jump me.
"You didn't meet him at the bar, you got jumped in the alley."
"Right, that's what I said."
That's what I meant.
Do you want something to drink?
"I got all these gift baskets, like fancy tequila and stuff."
What do you want?
What?
- Do you remember Sophia Russo?
She was one of the character witnesses at the trial.
"The cook at the mansion, right?"
Yeah.
I stopped by her house the other night.
"Oh, great."
How's she doing?
She's dead.
"The thing is, the last person to see her alive was a big white dude."
A really big white dude.
Wanna tell me what really happened?
"Here, tell you what."
"I'll take a stab at it, okay?"
You met him in the bar.
What's next?
"Then, I struggled..."
I removed the bag and saw him pointing at me with a gun.
What do you want?
You sex maniac!
What do you want?
You seduced my wife and you wanted to accuse first?
Don't kill me...
"None of my business, I don't know how to shoot!"
"That's right, it means, someone killed Ho Chun in the dark."
"Then, Ho Foon became the scapegoat."
"The key point is, did you have any secret affair with Chun's wife?"
"Master, I haven't seen his wife at all."
How could I have secret affair with her?
Ho Chun lied.
But why was he killed?
"It's alright, the key point is... your ass."
What is this triangular mark?
A birthmark.
Birthmark?
See!
Some acnes are found.
"Not serious, Madam."
You've dropped something!
It's a domino!
Can you explain it to me?
"Master, this is a kind of custom in the prison."
"In this prison, the new comers should serve the Indians and the foreigners."
That is to store gambling tools inside the anus.
"Master, would you help me to stuff back?"
"Since you have to stuff it,"
"I've brought you a chicken leg, better store it too."
"- Yes, I have."
"In fact, I may have forgotten everything I've ever known."
"- Child, what be your name?"
- Study.
Just explain the concept one more time.
And be mocked again?
"No, thank you."
- Come on.
- Maybe we're missing something.
You go to a special shooting range.
- A skeet shooting range.
- Right.
"There's two of you, and the guy with the gun yells, 'Pull. '"
The other guy releases a clay pigeon from a machine into the air... and you try to shoot it.
"- No, I don't think we're missing anything."
- I knew it.
- You shoot pigeons?
- Clay pigeons.
"- When you hit them, does blood come out?"
- They're clay.
And why do you like to do this?
"My dad shot skeet when he was my age, and he wants to pass the tradition down."
What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?
- Does that count?
- That's never happened.
What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon?
Does that count?
I've only done this once.
"If you get really good... do you move on to other animals, like clay chickens and clay sheep?"
We didn't go skeet shooting.
I made it all up.
I got to go in here.
We're doing it the Tommo way.
Now we know how to make camp fires.
"Louis, you idiot!"
Right.
I think we'II just burn it like that now.
"Do you think if one of us wasn't in the band, though, the band would be this big?"
-No.
-No.
definitely not.
I don't think so either.
I think we each balance each other out.
Yeah.
"I think when we look back at this no matter what we do after this, we'II never, ever beat this."
"Yeah, but isn't that scary?"
-If the best times of your life are now...
-Don't you think it's a bit...
-...that's crazy.
"-...of a Benjamin Button thing, though?"
That we get to do it backwards.
Do you know what I mean?
"We get to go after this and then have a proper, normal life."
"Just have, Iike, a wife and kids."
Do you know what I mean?
Don't you think that's quite nice?
That's what I Iook forward to if I Iook forward to anything.
What's mad is that one day we won't be doing this.
-I know.
-Yeah.
"So do you think, Iike we're still gonna be mates?"
"-I think so, yeah."
-I think we will as well.
Do you want my e-maiI now or shall I give it to you later?
"Minor shaker, Dr. Stegman."
We have them from time to time.
It will stop shortly.
"You can let go now, Elmer."
It's over.
I would have said he was totally gorked.
"Oh, he was."
What happened here?
In medical terms?
A miracle.
But there's a price to be paid for the miraculous.
And Blue Cross doesn't cover it.
This is Kingdom Hospital... where the ground is uneasy... and old secrets have begun to rise to the surface.
"Please, come again."
Thank God you stopped.
"Okay, um, I'm not even gonna get into what's wrong with the actual choreography."
"I'm gonna start with your shoes, okay?"
I told you to get Capezio jazz oxfords.
I will get those shoes today.
"You'll get the shoes, but you'll also get the steps."
"So we'll break it down one more time, and just watch only my feet."
I've been doing this since I was seven.
My sounds are a little off 'cause I don't really practice that much.
"Uh, you know what?"
"I can do that, but not the way you're doing it."
I can go...
Why can't I just do that?
Because that's not the choreography!
- There you go.
"- Okay, I'm gonna think about this."
You move your feet.
I have to go.
Gas company?
My father.
He's in prison for fraud.
"When my grandmother died, she left us some money."
He says it's to pay back the people he's defrauded.
"It's all done under this pretence of ""I wanna get to know you better."""
Can't blame him for that.
What do you mean?
"Well, he must be very proud of you."
Must want to have a relationship with his daughter.
"Yeah, I just don't trust that that is what he wants."
"Sounds like he's tying to put things right, paying people back."
Maybe you need to stop being embarrassed by him and forgive him.
"You really say what you think, don't you?"
I haven't got the energy or the time to pretend any more.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS sorry.
"Oh, it's Leo."
Hello?
"Yeah, he's right here."
Why?
What's happened?
You're right.
"It's so much better, purer, just... to do it, without recourse to who or why."
When do we kill again?
I think that'll be your last one.
What?
You've made too many mistakes.
"But you said yourself, the less we care, the more likely we are to get away with it."
I'm not sure we have the same motivation.
But I do.
I have the same ideals.
What are you doing here?
Who would have thought of seeing you?
"I was just writing to you Come in, sit down I , er"
"I've nothing to offer you but myself, I'm afraid"
That's all we wanted Well
So what were you writing?
May we read it?
"Oh, no need"
You can read it in the room
It's all up with me here
"If you'd have come an hour or two later, I'd have been gone"
"Yes, I'm selling out That's the end of another career"
Is it really as hopeless as that?
It is
"I'm so near disgrace here, they'd rather be rid of me"
And it's not just the debts
"Wait, maybe when you come back, we should just sit down and talk."
Just the three of us.
What do you think?
"You want us to come with you, Dad?"
No!
"I mean, I have to do this myself."
We really gonna talk?
I brought a six-pack.
"If things go south, we can just watch the game."
You want to laugh?
That last box of stuff that Dad packed into his car was my stuff.
No way.
Oh no.
I didn't have the heart to tell him.
"Hey, you know, I don't have a problem with hugging."
"I mean, I don't."
Sam?
So you still think I'm a thief.
A thief?
A thief who stole my heart!
We can go whenever you want. um...
Please stay
"Until the accusation thing,"
We were having such a good time!
"no, I think I should go."
I think I need to date people I haven't robbed.
And still no apology for that.
You two have shamed me in front of the chicago art world.
I bought eight of todd's photos
Out of pure embarrassment.
I hope you like silhouettes of trees.
"I'm sorry, dad."
"A pretty humiliating night for both of us, huh?"
"No, just you."
It's a naked picture of your ex-girlfriend.
"Look, i-i only put it in the show to sell it..."
To make money to--to buy you a present.
"Shut up, todd. you still want her."
-Why can't you just admit it?
-because it's not true.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, if you love me so much, where's my naked picture?"
"I mean, am I not a fitting enough subject for your art?"
Are these babies not good enough for you?
You brought a mugger to my show?
"Yeah, well, I was, uh, gonna bring a serial killer,"
But his van broke down.
"I mean, you can date whoever you want."
- I thought you didn't do that anymore.
"No, that was the new Seth Cohen."
"I'm back, Ryan."
"Cohen Classic, red, white, and me, come on."
Hang in there.
I won't be gone long.
- Did the light of dawn make any of this a little easier to take?
"- Harder, actually."
- So what are you going to do?
- I'll tell you this.
- I'm not going back to the office.
"I may tolerate Julie as my stepmother, but I will not suffer the indignity of her being"
"- Well, there's a concept."
"- Come on. you and me, a couple of bathrobes and black socks?"
- The thought of that is so...
- Liberating.
- Scary.
- Forget the black socks.
"Barefoot, baby, barefoot."
- I can't be unemployed.
I-I can't even take a vacation for more than a we
"- A vacation with you is no vacation, what with the itineraries and the sightseeing."
- I just...
I can't have worked this hard
I don't know.
Can't quit.
Can't go back there.
"Well, I don't know, either."
What I do know is...
I'm not the one you should be telling this to.
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Before, I only ate my sister's leftovers."
Why?
"My mother remarried, and I was like the third wheel."
She pandered to my new father.
"Once she had his kid, she completely ignored me."
"She didn't feed me, so I ate leftover rice in the wee hours."
I felt like a ghost.
Are you serious?
"Yeah, she didn't even take me on family trips."
You don't have to believe me.
So you ran away from that.
I abandoned her.
I stopped going home and started staying out with friends.
"Not really friends, but just people to hang out with."
"One day I came home late at night, and my mother said to me,"
"""Would you please just die?"""
"No way, I just couldn't take it anymore."
There's a threshold for how much we can endure.
So I packed my stuff and left.
You see...
"Because I was told to die, I refuse to."
"I'll sell my body if I have to, I'm gonna survive no matter what."
Aren't we doing it?
"No, we're not."
Then what's that on my back?
The body has its own ideas.
"You know, I've never done it with someone I like."
My first was with an old bald guy.
I see.
I want to.
Thank you.
What happened to work?
"Then why, Luis, are you alive and Julio's dead ?"
"I'm cagey, man."
Not cagey.
Meaningless.
Got the bullet from Julio ?
Right here.
22-caliber.
Long rifle used for distance.
And not a match to Luis's gun.
"What else, Alexx ?"
"Julio's got ulcerations of the oral mucosa, stomach and intestines."
That's rare for a young man.
Yeah.
And look at this :
He's got burns and lesions on both hands.
"Now the burns could've come from drug use, but the lesions, I don't think so."
"Alexx, I want to order a CBC."
A complete blood count ?
I don't think this is drug-related.
You think he was killed for some other reason ?
Not killed.
Assassinated.
"Horatio, I've got the results of the blood work you asked for."
Ran Julio's CBC with a complete white cell differential.
And look at this :
his lymphocytes are alarmingly low.
"And you couple that with the ulceration, and, well..."
He's been exposed to radiation.
And not a little.
We're talking serious exposure.
This guy was working in this stuff.
"Thank you, Alexx."
And you are never gonna believe where she works.
"(whirring, rhythmic beeping)"
(tires screech)
"Yes, I can confirm that one Amanda Baylor is in the hiz-ouse."
"Very unattractive, in case you're wondering."
"By the way, are you aware of a little film called The Graduate?"
Mike Nichols.
Fantastic.
"""Would you like me to seduce you?"""
"Wait, what?"
Were you quoting the movie or was that real?
Where's Baylor?
Secure encryption room.
She's in the middle of a 72-hour shift.
"Logged in 14.5 hours ago, before I got here."
"Once an encryptor goes in, they don't come out-- department policy."
Probably well on the way to being ripe in there.
Did you know that your hair sparkles under these fluorescents?
Really?
How much does it sparkle?
So much.
So much?
"So, so much."
Open it.
Can't.
"No in, no out."
Encryptors even have their own private commode.
There's a lot of confidential crap in there.
Here.
"I can make sure you don't lose your job, but there might be something else we could talk about you losing."
I've decided to open it.
Thank you.
"In fact, there are loads of cool changes you could make now you're in charge, Rambo."
"We could have - I dunno, comfy chairs, working toilets, non-squeak doors..."
"What do you mean, 'in charge'?"
"If you lower the price of grain, people will buy more."
"Whoa, steady on, Professor."
I don't get any of that business-y shit.
I said I'd leave all that to Flavia.
He's just a dickless intern!
Flavia is out of touch.
"She just sits in her office getting her nails done, while the staff get bad backs and blocked-up bogs."
"Sorry, Prof. I promised my dad I wouldn't rock the boat."
I did that at the shipping company and three people drowned.
I should just keep my head down.
Sorry...
Do you own the company?
Big time.
"Right, well, in that case, I will keep my jug still."
Sorry for calling you dickless.
"Yes, congratulations, boss!"
Great throw!
From downtown for five points...
Interception!
Turnover.
Interception?
Since when?
Just now.
He shoots...
He scores!
That's eight-all.
"New ball, please, Prof. Uh-huh, coming up."
We should make it doubles!
Then we'd have someone to pass to and high-five!
"Right, I'd like to get started right away."
Of course.
"Sara, would you get the neutrotope, please?"
Sorry.
It's a natural reaction.
"Right, I'll get back to you as soon as I can."
You're quite sure about volunteering to stay?
We must help these people.
Must we?
"Personally, I don't care if their whole planet turns into a mushroom."
I shall stay because I don't like an unsolved mystery.
You don't think Dortmunn and his life rocket are the answer?
- No.
- Why not?
There is something else that has to happen before it all begins to come together.
Thank you.
You'd better give me your guns.
- Don't fail us.
- I won't.
"Vila, bring me up."
"My people have a saying, ""A man who trusts can never be betrayed, only mistaken""."
Life expectancy must be fairly short among your people.
- 3210?
- Check.
32100?
- Where are Cally and Avon?
- It's a long story.
- What's in the box?
- It's an even longer story
I like stories!
"Zen, get a locator fix on the other ship."
I want to be able to pinpoint its position at all times.
He is not a man.
He is a woman.
He's all emotion and refinement.
He has very few defences.
You must win him as a man wins a woman.
"If anyone can do it, you can, George."
This is enlightening.
Tell me more.
How does a man pursue a woman?
"He flings himself at her feet, follows her everywhere."
"Wherever she turns, he is there, pouring into her ear only what she most wants to hear."
"His passion frightens her, but a woman will always bend toward a strong man, just as the vine stretches toward the wall."
A woman is always on the point of abandoning herself anyhow.
It only takes one firm push.
You are sublime!
A true friend.
Ah!
Yes.
Those are marvellous.
Yes.
This is from...
George Sand.
Thank you.
"And I want something with a much thinner, narrower line."
"Yes, that is good, I think."
"In fact, you could make this even more..."
"No, I don't want this."
"Take it off, please."
You are so good to escort me tonight.
People shun me unless I am on the arm of someone respectable.
I do not understand your concern.
You will find nothing but friends at Eugene's.
"- I cannot do that, Miss."
Everything must be in order.
Does the letter weigh too much?
You may want to come back to the counter again!
Here's another letter for him.
Maybe they know his address.
"Wait, I'll write it down for you."
"Again, I'm so sorry."
"Don't strain yourself, Karl!"
"If I were to wait for Bruno, I wouldn't get going today."
He's still on his lunch break.
Just once I'd like to see that you did not make any excuses for your brother.
How long will you be gone?
"Well, Anna, I really don't know."
The stuff here must go to Frankfurt and Essen.
And I won't return empty-handed.
That doesn't pay.
"And I'd also like to do some sightseeing in the West, you know."
"Middelmann  Co., starting anew over there."
"What, from Berlin?"
That's out of the question!
"But Anna, it can't go on like this;"
that you're always assisting.
But that doesn't bother me.
It does me!
I want my kid to inherit something of value!
Has he stirred again?
- Are you Mr John?
"- Yes, what is it?"
I just want to enquire about an address.
My husband needs to go.
You wait in the office meanwhile.
Well you can have me.
I don't wanna have you.
I wanna make love to you.
I'm telling this for your own good...
I think you should go home.
You've spent all your energy trying to get me excited and then...
Want to throw me out?
Please leave...
Come here.
Ok I'd like two orders of shrimp fried rice.
An order of shrimp and pea pods.
An order of shrimp with lobster sauce.
And an order of jumbo shrimp.
Owen...get up.
-What I'm working on.
-That's what I'm working on.
Are you...a researcher?
"No I'm a TV producer, do you think that they exist?"
So you're looking for heroin and you don't want the police to know about it.
"Listen, this really has nothing to do with drug traffic."
What can I do?
Nobody really knows the true nature of these aliens.
You're from Germany?
"Yes, Berlin."
I'm jewish...
So what connections do you think there can possibly be between UFO's and...heroin?
What the fuck is going on in here?
Have you ever seen a UFO ?
"Yes, this morning, that's why I'm here."
Well that's very interesting.
Would you like a drink?
You can see it as well.
Don't rush.
Do I want to know what you had to promise him
To get him to come?
"No, it wasn't me."
"It's not like he even listens to me,"
And he probably just ran out of girls to have sex with.
"I, uh, want to apologize."
My absence has been inexcusable.
"Well, I know my situation brings up a lot of issues for you."
You've had to deal with so much loss.
But I'm not gonna lose you.
"I'm here for you,"
Every step of the way.
"You, uh, you look good, Lily."
"In fact, you look better than good."
You look great.
Thank you.
I feel great.
So you had better be prepared
"For a lifetime of family brunches,"
Because I'm not going anywhere.
Okay.
Oh.
Hey.
I bailed on the Columbia gala.
I was kind of in the mood
For watching a pretentious movie I don't understand
With you and Vanessa.
"No Vanessa, but pretentious movie?"
check.
"Look, not that I'm not thrilled to expose you"
"To the joys of Russian cinema, but does this visit of yours"
The enemy is cloaked and is fast!
"It seems to be using arrows, which is probably to..."
"Right, muzzle flashes would make it easy to pinpoint its location."
This must be to avoid that.
Optical camouflage?
Does invisibility technology even...?
It must be based on...
"Anyway, it's ingenious."
"There's nothing on my thermograph, and it's not casting a shadow."
But...
It definitely exists.
Yeah.
"You are giving this to me, Milord?"
Customize it however you like.
I've already discussed the matters of your peerage title and activation factor with Princess Lemrina.
Milord Slaine...
The arrow has been loosed.
There is no turning back now.
"Yes, Milord!"
Count Sebring.
Count Raffia.
Inform Count Orga.
Tell him to swear fealty.
"Smoke grenades, loading complete."
"Ready here, too."
Fire!
"He's right, it definitely exists."
And if it exists... it will have an effect on air currents!
Target located.
Right!
Open fire!
- Lieutenant!
could you describe your relationship?
"well, we,re very close."
"THEY,RE CLOSE."
"We,re different, but complementary."
Describe CIaudine.
"She,s sweet."
"She,s strong-wiIIed, knows her own mind, meticulous."
- How do you show that?
- For exampIe -
Hands up.
"At first, Jean-MicheI expected me to serve him."
It was always me who brought up breakfast.
"He,d never think to bring me breakfast."
- You lived in a house?
- A house?
"You said ,brought up breakfast.,"
"It,s just an expression."
We live in an apartment.
- I see.
- Very good.
What about politics?
What role does it play in your life?
politics?
"We,re neither left- nor right-wing."
NEITHER LEFT
- NOR RIGHT-WING
"We,re not activists, but we keep up with the news."
"Jean-MicheI and CIaudine, you know why you,re here."
"We,re designing an experimental Urban Center, and we want its inhabitants to feel comfortable."
"You,ve been chosen as typical users of the year 2000."
"We want to Iearn about your desires, your fears."
We want to measure your basic level of social integration.
"Fine, but just for the record, you cannot be more wrong."
Spies are supposed to be better liers.
Enjoy your walk.
Come by the house this afternoon.
I'll show you around.
I guess I could check it out.
"Normal fellows, right?"
"From the beginning, you were stuck at OC because of your dad."
- Now you're not stuck with those guys.
- They're were not all bad.
A cappucino for Evan.
- How's it going?
- Good...
Just drinking coffee.
We're gonna have a special meeting this week on you coming back.
Just hang it tight.
You guys are losing a great pledge.
I don't think we're losing anybody.
You have a history of letting great people get away from you.
You know what?
I've tried to be nice to you by not kicking your ass.
"Last semester, I've put up with the digs, with the insults out of respect for Casey."
She and I are not together anymore.
You do the maths.
- He's just sticking up versus...
- I can do maths.
I'm good at it.
"I hear a lot of buzzing, but no actual words."
That's what insects do.
"They buzz around, try to sting you."
"Be careful, insect!"
Some insects are quite deadly.
"Hey, I need your help."
We need to go over to the medical center.
Is everyone in there?
Yeah.
We're just waiting for you.
How is it going out there?
They took Talbot's farm.
How many men?
I'd say 60... 70.
That's probably just an advance team.
I would imagine they got more than that up the road in reserve.
Constantino has us outnumbered and outgunned.
"If we split our force, and try to defend each one of these farms, he's going to overwhelm us."
So what are you saying?
I'm saying we don't split up.
"We choose a place to stand together, deliver a good, hard counterpunch."
"Let them know that, if they intend to take from us, it's going to cost them dearly."
How?
"Well, right here."
Stanley Richmond's farm.
"It's the last place before this road divides, and they start taking ground faster than we can keep up."
Plus which it's the highest point in the whole area.
There's where we make our stand.
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.
The Talbot farm is secured.
Let's go get the rest of them.
Let's go!
This one's alive.

"Grandpa, you're drunk."
Some sort of serrano thing for Brooke?
- Why would I do that?
"- Well, I asked you first"
"Look, don't underestimate Brooke."
She's full of surprises.
Its just part of her charm.
She told me to listen to track 13.
There are only 12 songs.
Honest mistake.
"Yeah, I guess."
"Anyway, sorry about this morning with your dad."
I had no idea he was there.
It's cause he usually isn't.
I thought you were happy with your setup.
That's what I tell him.
"I make up stuff in the emails I send him about how happy I am being on my own, and how responsible I'm being even when I'm not."
"He loves his job, you know?"
"And after my mom died, it's just not fair to ask him to give that up."
But I miss him when he's away.
You tell him that?
He worries.
It's just better not to.
"So listen, I don't have a lot of quiet time these days."
You mind if I just sit and read while you draw?
As long as you don't act out the parts.
Alright.
My mom said you wanted to see me.
Yeah.
"Hand me that ratchet, would you?"
So how are you holding up?
Why?
Are you going to report it back to my mom?
"Sweetheart, I'm a shark attack survivor."
I'm fried.
"Honey, I think the fear was a lot worse than the actual attack, which I can totally appreciate, but the good news is you weren't hurt, so let's not ruin the evening over it."
I'm sorry?
"Honey, you weren't hurt."
Good night.
Dave!
Where you going?
Dave.
"Come on, okay, you got bit by the shark."
"You got bit, I believe you!"
"We're here all the time, so let's take that opportunity to go to bed."
"Honey, we'll go to the waterfall with you."
We'll grab our drinks and go.
Yeah.
We could all go together.
It'll be beautiful.
Hon?
"I was thinking that maybe we might go back to the room, huh?"
"Bolt the door, draw the shades, huh?"
Just shut the whole world out and sit Indian-style and really explore our feelings.
Daddy!
Wake up!
It's too deep!
"Yo, you having a nightmare."
You ain't even in the water.
It's night time.
"Look, you said we was gonna have fun, so let's get up, let's dance, let's do a shot, let's do something."
Anything.
"Baby, let's just go back to the room, all right?"
I don't want to go back to the room.
I don't want to go to sleep.
"Well, you tell me when is the right time?"
"Sharon, don't forget you owe me."
"If you need me to remind you, why, I will."
"Thank you, Sharon."
You won't regret this.
ILLEGAL FIREARMS TRACED TO SMUGGLING NETWORK
Good morning.
Okay.
"Good morning, everyone."
Let's get started.
- Shouldn't we wait for Anna?
"I got my ass up out of bed on time, now I gotta wait?"
"Well, while we're waiting, I just wanna put this out there to everyone that if we keep an open mind, there's no reason why we can't go home today."
"Excuse me, before we actually start, can I make a quick announcement?"
It's a query.
I am missing a very nice pen.
A Montblanc.
Has anyone seen it?
Is that directed at me?
- No.
Have you seen it?
No.
"- Okay, if anyone does see it,"
I would very much like it back.
It was a gift from my wife on our anniversary.
"Aw, that's so sweet."
We're deliberating a murder case and you're talking about a pen.
"This pen happens to be worth more than you make in a month, so you can go fuck yourself."
"Yeah, I'll do that."
- Charles.
He's...
Anna.
I'll get rid of all the weaklings who have spent the last 66 years relying on other countries and other people to take care of things.
Given your outstanding ability to gather information I'm sure you can make any idea a reality.
just say the magic word.
Hey.
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ok.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling,"
I could maybe do with a teenth.
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Gee, I don't know."
How about over there?
That brown van.
"- That's yours, right?"
- What brown van?
Parked all inconspicuous.
It's a cop van.
Another one right over there.
"""Duke City Flowers""?"
Come on!
Can't you at least be original?
"Dude, I just want to get high."
A flower van.
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.
Seriously.
"And I don't mean to disrespect, but if you put a bunch of cops in the back of a garbage truck, there's no way I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck."
"It's a freebie, yo."
She doesn't know that it looks as though he was alive when he was buried.
Does she need to know that?
She's asked to see the body.
"Well, you should do your best to put her off."
"Well, you can't stop her if she wants to see him."
Some people don't believe it until they see it.
I know.
But it's her son in there.
I think maybe I should do this.
Sure?
Just don't let her see the body.
"Oh, please."
No.
Not David.
I'm sorry.
Who did this?
We hope to find out more from the post-mortem.
Can I see him?
"You have the right to, of course, but I'd advise you not to."
Many changes have occurred to the body.
"He was my baby, my boy."
"From what I've read of David's work, he had a strong belief that death was not the end."
"You did well there, Nikki."
I remembered that stuff about the resurrection of the body from my gran's funeral.
Wouldn't want too many resurrections of the body.
We'd be out of a job.
I worry about you.
You'll be speaking in tongues next.
"When are you going to accept the truth, sinner?"
I wish I could find some truth right now.
Still looking for a reason?
I'm not sure there is a reason.
Hey.
Ohh!
"♪ let's jam that boogie, babe ♪"
I didn't tell him anything!
I didn't tell him nothing!
"Not a thing, I..."
♪ let's jam that boogie ♪
"♪ let's jam that boogie, babe ♪"
thank you.
Rose?
What is it?
"Oh, peggy."
It's too awful.
Sousa:
"Really puts you back there, doesn't it?"
"You realize could happen anytime, any day."
How did it happen?
Professional hit.
Him and our only witness.
Must have been watching us at the scene.
I knew something was fishy about that anonymous tip.
Who does that?
A concerned citizen?
Concerned citizens call the cops.
This guy called us directly.
It's not like we're in the phonebook.
"Somebody targeted them, and I'm gonna find that bastard."
"Whatever happened last night, don't any of you forget..."
Krzeminski would still be with us today
"If it wasn't for howard stark,"
Whether he pulled the trigger or not.
We're only neck-deep in this mess because of him.
-So he comes again.
-Brought some pastries.
-Is he taking a nap?
-Yeah.
-Is he driving you to drink?
-I can drive myself.
I needed that.
What's the matter?
Spent a long time in the hospital last night.
The shit that goes on down there.
I wasn't expecting visitors.
How about those Mets?
Don't start with me and those Mets.
"You know, I was thinking about you."
-So you're drunk already.
-No.
I was thinking about the way you are.
"How you always have this little smile, like you got your own private joke."
"You don't talk much, do you?"
I wish I knew your secret.
Lose a leg and start making websites.
"That's the whole purpose for people like me, to inspire people like you."
"-Jesus, no offense."
-That's the trouble with you Americans.
You expect nothing bad ever to happen... when the rest of the world expects only bad to happen.
-They're not disappointed.
-That's a fucking grim outlook.
"You have everything, and still you complain."
You lie on couches and bitch to your psychiatrist.
You got too much time to think about yourselves.
Sounds like me all right.
You're not so bad.
"Doc, I have something to tell..."
Doctor.
Are you alright?
I suck.
I've been treating that man's nephew for so long.
But he hasn't gotten better.
"In the end, I made the wrong diagnosis."
"Talk about bad luck, having me as your doctor."
Maybe you should've gotten better sooner too.
"No one wants to waste time seeing a doctor, right?"
I am sorry.
I....
"I know I am not that good, but I try."
I'm trying my best.
Shit think of something to say to make her feel better.
What should I say?
And what the hell is wrong with me?
"Standing, eating this junk food with nitrates."
As a kid I ate so much of this I went to the hospital.
"But if eating it makes you feel better, then it's okay."
It's not standard medical practice but..
the better you feel the faster you heal.
"Shit, it rhymes."
Sounds sweet like a poem.
Am I seeing a doctor?
Actually I just realized that being a doctor is tough.
You have to say things that make patients feel better.
I feel I've been a bad patient all this time.
Feeling better?
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
You aren't busy today?
Loads.
- Tell her how much you enjoy the work.
"- Oh, it... it..."
This... this job would...
You were inspired by Florence Nightingale to bring cleanliness to the wards.
"- Oh, God, you know?"
- Don't say God.
She might be religious.
Shit!
- God was better.
- It isn't a complicated job.
"I've done it before, I can do it again."
What more is there to say?
Oh.
I don't think there's...
anything more to say.
Knocked back from wiping up shite.
"Er... well, that was an inside job."
"They'll be forced to advertise for legal reasons, but a cushty number like that?"
"I mean, she'll have a mate lined up."
It'll be fine.
"I'm not quite sure how, exactly, just yet."
"But there is a perfect solution to this, and..."
Oi.
Trust your guardian angel to find it.
They shouldn't let your sort work in a hospital.
Our sort?
Does the FA Cup here make you wear that uniform while he's doing you doggy style?
"You're in enough trouble, young man, without getting pervy."
Trouble?
That's my dad up there.
This is no worse than a baby sucking its mother's tit.
- I'm clean.
You?
- I'm clean.
I had my tubes tied.
- Fuck the condoms.
- Great.
"This isn't all some scheme to get back control of Isabelle's money, is it?"
"This isn't some hostile way for you to get back at Dean, is it?"
- I'm not sure what it is.
"- Me, neither."
- I'm not sure I care right now.
"- Me, either."
My cousin live in a village where all the babies born one year look like those Oompa Loompas.
"Then they stop the crop-dusting, and the next year, all fine."
Do they dance and sing morality songs?
"No, but a lot of them are tossed in bars to make a living."
I used to have nightmares about the boat scene.
I remember that.
I used to have to crawl in bed with you and read to you from the real-estate section to get you to fall asleep.
Which got me into trouble at school.
"When we were starting Roosevelt,"
"I proudly announced to the entire class that FDR stood for ""Formal Dining Room."""
I like this part!
"Oh, can we say chicken parmesan?"
No.
"Oh, no."
I promise I won't yell.
No ultimatums.
- I just want to talk.
Can I come in?
- Bad timing.
What's going on?
What?
You turned a block full of headlights on.
This should be easy.
Are you serious?
You said I look for ways to slack off.
This I take seriously.
"You have to challenge that brilliant mind of yours, and someone has to fill in for that Foss guy, right?"
"Well, that someone, my friend, will be me."
Really?
Just- make 'em blink.
Hey.
Is it working?
Not really.
Thinking about Amanda drained all the voltage out of him.
Oh.
"Yeah, I heard."
"""We need to talk. """
Sorry she left you hanging.
Typical woman.
"Um, anyway..."
I need to look for my digital projector.
"You giving that away, too?"
"No, I need it for a lecture I'm giving at U.W."
You're giving a lecture?
I mean... you're giving a lecture.
I've been asked to speak at a symposium tomorrow.
Are you getting paid for this thing?
"Because you're supposed to bring home the bacon, Dad, and I eat a lot of bacon."
"For your information, Josh, I have already had a job offer."
This lecture is about showing my expertise... for free.
"Well, I think your expertise is worth more than that."
"Thank you, Kyle."
That should be me.
I should be doing that time.
No.
We went over this.
It's good.
How's it good?
"It's a minimum-security place in Phoenix, and, no, I am not going to tell you which one."
She'll get out of there and she'll be fine.
"You keep your promise and steer clear, and she can have a good life."
She can do what she's supposed to do.
"I mean if I can't be there for her, man, you gotta promise me that you will be."
I promise.
Then you should do something for me.
I was able to fence the watches.
"Don't judge, I'm giving it all to her."
And the car.
"I got a clean VIN number for it, so it's legit, and it just..."
"It'll feel like I'm there with her, you know?"
"Money is not what she needs, not for what's ahead."
Can you just see that she gets it?
Sure.
And one more thing.
"If anything changes, like she does her job, this insanity ends, if she's free..."
I'll send you a postcard.
(SCREAMING)
I'm not what you think!
"You're a thief, and you poisoned me, so, yeah, I'm pretty sure you're exactly what I think."
No!
You have a compass.
I need it!
I don't care what you need.
"(GRUNTS) No, for my son."
"Without it, we'd keep doing"
The same useless things over and over and over again.
It's nature's way of saying
"That what you're doing is futile,"
And that it's time to let go.
Got it?
Depression is nature's way
"Of weeding out the weak and the useless, rhade."
Which one are you?
What?
You heard me.
Don't you-
Quiet.
We're being boarded.
"Rhade,"
"We've got intruders, heavily armed,"
And they're packing
Pretty interesting tech equipment.
They've restored the power here.
Which raises the question- Do we stop them?
Could get me out of my mood.
"Hold on, cowboy."
Let's see if they fix the ship first.
Then you can go crazy on them.
You owe the lady an explanation.
"When i first built you, all i had was a hand-Comp"
"And core fragments of an al, all right?"
"Every time you woke up,"
You'd just..
You'd start yelling at me
And try to leave.
"Pretty much like every relationship i've ever had,"
Did you make the milk?
What the hell is going on here?
You're a humanoid!
Why do you have hair?
"My husband told me that I am the first blonde but unfortunately I am brunette, so"
"Where are you from, Sara?"
- I was born in this cabin.
"- No, that's impossible!"
Tell me the truth.
- Where are you from?
"- You're far from home, Spartan!"
"""Do you want to tell me what you do in my cabin?"""
"- He's a friend, Cage."
There is no reason for the weapon.
"With her, I'll blow your face away!"
I'm looking for a girl.
She was kidnapped by a Humanoid.
My partner said that maybe you could help me.
This is no help for the Spartans.
I do not like to waste time with Federation slag.
"Spartan, my ass!"
As I said...
I would appreciate any information you or Sara may have about the girl.
You must be five now.
"If you can not help, let's go our way again."
And we do not ask questions.
"A gun does not want to help you, son."
What if I do not want to help you?
What happens then?
Question answered?
"Rat, piece of Spartan garbage!"
You and your Indian slut can kiss me in the ass!
But in the area of death the ice is ruthless.
"Looks like someone had your bright idea, Bishop."
An accident rarely comes alone.
Sauber!
"It seems that your drug addicts friends are condemned here,"
What?
"Are we going to play now ""Cowboys and the damn Indians""?"
Only we are the damned Indians.
"Everyone knows the damn Indians never win, my friend!"
Noids have no combat training.
We do.
Re-assemble and prepare.
Check the Noid for DNA reconfiguration.
I'll contact the base.
I say:
We hide in the next camp.
The next camp is 100 miles from here.
We're dead before we get there.
Do not look so serious.
I will not let you die.
"Very well, little one?"
"Fuck you, Hatta!"
Accept the shit.
We contacted the enemy right outside the Death Zone.
The truck is gone.
Subutai has fallen.
"But we ended up mutated humanoids in the process,"
So it was a mutated humanoid Ash-393?
"Negative, but it has been hormonally changed."
We took a sample for an exam.
I do not care about mutated notions.
I want Ash-393!
"We take a dog, tie him to a bicycle..."
No!
It's just not good enough!
Mom's home early!
"You do not pinch, you do not poke, you do not bite, youdonotspit,youdonot eye-gouge, you do not vomit intentionally on other babies!"
A lifetime ban from Gymboree!
A lifetime ban!
I can't believe it.
She didn't even see the board.
This is a sign we were meant to have this.
"We were meant to do something really, really great with you."
It'll come.
We just have to be patient.
No!
This is Mommy's purse!
You can't have it!
"Please, it's the only thing in the house that's Mommy's!"
Lois...
"Well, he has a million toys."
Why does he only want to take my things?
"Honey, honey, you're taking this too personally."
He doesn't understand what he's doing.
He's just a baby.
"Look, if you just give it to him for just a couple of minutes, he'll get tired of it."
You're right.
"I guess I was just feeling that if I gave in to him, he'd see it as a sign of weakness."
- I'm going to stop this right now.
- Yeah.
"Here, sweetie."
Mommy's purse.
"You can have that for five minutes, okay?"
I thought you said he wasn't eating anything.
Far too much flogging.
There was a man killed.
- Under punishment?
"- Yes, sir."
I can deal with Mr. Scott-Padget.
"Maybe, sir."
Do you know what happened to the Beedle's captain?
The lordships of the Admiralty broke him and his two previous captains.
Influence?
"When somebody of enormous power has a mistress and that mistress has a son, the son has great influence at his back."
- I see.
- He's a most brilliant young officer.
A future Drake with a vicious streak and a silver spoon.
"Sir, it could be his making."
Good evening.
Can I offer you some Madeira?
- Yes.
- I'll be going.
"Thank you, Mr. Goss."
Would you like to know our orders?
"We join the fleet at Corsica, report to Admiral Jarvis."
Convoy duty.
"Orders say ""with all possible dispatch."""
"We'll not put in at Gibraltar, but you'll have time to train."
I hope so.
I'd like to practice gunnery next week.
Good.
I know how hard it is working up a green crew but I'd like you to go easier on them.
"The first few weeks, we use methods none of us like."
- You're questioning me.
- I haven't said so.
I know the value of discipline.
"Well, we still have power."
"Yeah, well, let's work quickly, Mr. Palmer, while we still can."
Abby said our dead fake air marshal's name is Norman Dopps.
Norman.
"There's a name, huh?"
"Well, the Normans were Vikings."
They settled on part of the coast of France.
"Yes, on what one day would become known as Normandy."
"See, now, that history is great, but I just couldn't do it to the little guy."
Norman is a bit too Psycho- ish.
You could always shorten it to Norm.
Norm?
Norm!
"Nah, see, I'd have to fight the urge to give the kid a beer."
Oh.
Here we go.
Ah.
Murder on the lavatory.
Bishop sent these in the second e-mail.
"Yeah, it's quite a... nasty and narrow puncture wound."
"From a plastic knife, or something that could get past security?"
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Something stronger, to pierce the rib cage."
A nylon dagger.
"Or carbon fiber, perhaps."
"And based on the incision, it seems to have been twisted, twisted on entry."
For maximum damage.
"Mm, clearly, an expert kill."
How soon till we get these up to Jethro?
Oh...
I can bring them on my tablet.
Do you know the meaning of the name Jethro?
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do -- go arrest him?
Sandra.
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
"That would be easy for you, wouldn't it?"
"You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at EST."
"No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan, but I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave me."
Mr. Jennings.
Can I help you?
"As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can."
"Have a seat, please."
I won't be staying long.
What is it you want?
I want you to stay away from my daughter.
You want her to stop coming to church?
That's right.
That's between you and Paige.
"Well, I..."
"I think you can help with that, and I think you will help with that."
"I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings."
It's a sanctuary.
I can't turn anyone away.
That's the whole point of this place.
Is something wrong?
You took $600 from her.
I thought you knew about that.
We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve.
"I-I'll write you a check right now if you want, but... that's not why you're here."
"No, it's not."
"Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings?"
And you need to trust me.
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
But you inherited me.
You didn't...
see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
"And those propeller plans that you got for me, the plans you and Emmett worked to steal -- they were fake."
Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
And I wondered -- did they even care how many people die?
This administration -- the stuff they get away with makes me sick.
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
"Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated, just think about all those... kids that died."
Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
"All right, off to bed."
It's late.
Smells like a giant jock strap.
Maybe 30 years ago it would've been fine.
"Oh, my Lord."
"Okay listen, honey, try not to touch anything or breathe deeply."
There he is.
Should have worn a hazmat suit.
Those are some extremely nice skates for rentals.
We don't open till 10:00.
"You're Shayne Baker, right?"
Girl's league MVP?
I hear you're pretty good.
"What do you say, maybe sometime, you and me, we could go scrimmage."
I am good for girl's league.
Maybe you should just go scrimmage yourself.
Okay.
It's a very generous offer!
More than this place is worth.
This ice has decades of history for the town.
I'm not going to just sell it off because you wanna put some office building here.
"Well, actually, I was thinking more of a boutique mall and day-spa."
"Rick, history only matters if people care, and no one does around here any more."
This town belongs to me.
"And one way or another this ancient scrap heap you call an ice rink will be mine, too."
So think about my offer.
"Let's go, Kain."
Stay away from her.
"- Now, Kain!"
- All right.
"Well, Dad?"
- I said no.
How did you get to do this?
Writing I mean.
Parfitt.
He's making comedies for Baker.
Used to click gangs of heard into me sung in the pub.
Many a time.
He'll think you were born into purpose.
Certainly spent enough time in 'em as a kid.
He was a soldier.
In and in the last one.
"The thing about men who get sent away to war, Mrs.Cole, is that some of them don't come back at all... some come back as heroes... and some of them come back drunk squalid bullies."
I was better off it this way.
In the pub?
Or the pictures.
I liked the pictures best.
Once in a while you just need to make one that's worth it.
Worth...the hour and a half of someones life that's gonna see it.
Ah!
I really thought this one would be.
Bloody Yanks.
Hm.
Would be alright if all we had to do is look at him.
We strip him down to the essentials and use a voice-over.
"I wasn't there at the beginning of the story, but it all began in a little fishing village in Englo..."
Yes.
Yes.
"Inarticulacy, authenticity."
He's too cut out.
Nah!
No.
He really can't.
But Hilliard can.
MAN:
Careful!
It looks like there are four of these shrine covers before we get to the sarcophagus.
We still can't really work out how they ever got them in.
Getting them out without damage is proving to be the devil's own job.
Excuse me one moment.
"- So, can we repair this thing?"
"- Well, I'd like to see what Lucas thinks."
What's this?
Oh...
We found those yesterday in the treasury.
Mace thinks they're almost full-term.
The one on the left is a little girl.
You can still make out some of the hair on her scalp.
I think they're the saddest things I've ever found.
HOWARD:
I'm sorry.
(Operatic music playing)
- Mr Adamson.
- Mr Carter.
- You like Verdi?
"- Not particularly, sir."
But I find he's more effective than any guard dog.
The locals like him even less.
A lot of men would be nervous about sleeping overnight in a tomb.
"Yeah, the dead are dead."
I don't bother them and they don't bother me.
"Going well, sir?"
"To be honest, I'm a little disappointed."
"Oh, yes, sir?"
I thought I'd found him.
(Exhales deeply)
It's called angioplasty.
- Sign for me.
- Cath lab will be ready in 30 minutes.
- He's a hot MI.
- They' re finishing a pacer.
"While they' re messing around, he's killing heart cells."
- It'll give us time to medicate.
- V-tach.
- Like I said.

The doctors there will give you antibiotics.
"Lynn got her tattoo in NewYork, right?"
"It was a Japanese master, in the classical style:"
Hiromitsu.
Classical style?
The classical era of Japanese tattoos was between the 17th and 18th centuries.
The Japanese have little interest in naked bodies.
The purity of virgin skin means nothing to them.
The Hiromitsu
He only did 12 tattoos.
This is Lynn's.
Number 3.
They are true works of art.
The Japanese passion for tattoos
led people to collect skin.
Collectors bought pictures from the living and waited for them to die.
Skin collectors.
I think we all need to take a moment.
Mr. Campbell-- looks like I found one dumb enough not to.
"- Mr. Campbell, I think if you sit down again..."
- No!
I think that we could all...
"What the hell are you doing, man?"
- He doesn't have a case.
"- Maybe, maybe not but he's the client."
"Yeah, well, he was pushing my buttons."
I don't care if he punched you in the face.
"Look, we're both trying to make partner here, Adam."
All right?
"I haven't said anything to you before this because... it was none of my business, but now you're making it my business because it's affecting me."
"- So what's your point, Jimmy?"
- We both know this is about you and Brian.
"Now you don't want to talk to me, that's fine."
"But, uh, talk to somebody before you ruin both of our careers."
Just a minute.
I'm coming!
- It's me.
Thank god you're here.
I have no idea what to wear and...
Hi.
Did you read my mind?
No.
These are just the maternity clothes that you lent me.
"Well, I don't need them back."
I'm not gonna have a baby anytime.
Ever.
I-I don't need them.
I--I'm going for a more...
- Classic look.
"But I usually walk barefoot, even with snow and rain."
My feet are far from the head so I do not have to think much about it.
"Thank you so much, mayor."
- Thanks for the hospitality.
Thank you and God bless you.
- Thanks so much.
This was...

Carlos?
Sire?
Do you believe in real privilege?
I believe in her.
As a person.
I mean...
The institution that unites people.
Louise?
Do you believe in the monarchy?
"For me, it is not a question of believing, but of respecting it, sire."
Is it your personal opinion?
"Yes, it is my personal opinion."
Ludovic?
What do you think?
The monarchy
"Is the highest expression of dignity,"
"Of grace,"
Great ideas!
The coincidence of the universe and the kingdom...
The dysfunction of nature...
"If you let me, sire..."
We will have to present it to the Prime Minister because...
We do not have time.
We will have a little while we return.
You can't just give your sperm to two girls you met in a cafe.
I met you in a cafe.
I just feel like you shouldn't be doing this.
The world is overpopulated.
You know there's an island of plastic the size of Texas in the pacific.
"I know, Leah."
You told me this 1000 times.
Please don't dismiss what I'm saying.
Overpopulation is important to me.
"Look, I don't think that me giving these lesbians one illegitimate child is gonna add that much plastic."
You have two children.
Why can't I have one?
But you haven't thought this through.
You don't listen to me.
I do listen.
I've heard everything you've said.
Really?
You don't listen listen.
I want you to go for therapy.
"Oh, God."
I'll trade you therapy for sex.
It's been almost three weeks.
I think it's sweet you know how long it's been.
Let's get a drink.
- Keep an eye out for Jarmusch.
- There's a lot of good-looking women... much better than at book parties.
Goodbye.
- White wine?
- Yeah.
Why is it wherever I go I look for Suzanne?
Because your heart's broken.
You're looking for the piece that is her to put it back together.
These people can make putting on your pants seem like a criminal conspiracy.
Forget it.
You had to be in the room to understand.
Okay.
Sorry.
- Did something happen in this room?
- l just told you what happened.
"I know, but you sounded like you were afraid, like something happened."
I don't know if you're afraid you can't tell me or that you have to protect me.
"I mean, I just..."
- l don't know what I'm saying.
"- You know that I'm with you, right?"
"I mean, God forbid you were to get indicted or, worst-case scenario..."
"- l don't know, that..."
- Say it.
- Say what?
- Go ahead.
Say it.
"Worst-case scenario, I go to prison."
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That is what you were saying.
- Am I going to prison?
- You're not.
"If I am, then how does that affect you and your kids"
- and whether you marry me or not?
- No.
I would think about it too.
"You should be, because I sure am."
You're scaring me now.
I don't want to talk to you when you're like this.
"It's okay. I... I feel like I should go home, anyway."
- l don't think you should.
I'm too small for Twister.
And roller coasters.
And sitting with my feet on the floor.
"Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom."
"Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine."
"Hey, look, I have peach schnapps."
Thank God.
"Guys, something happened."
What's wrong?
I think a boy likes me.
"""Hi."
It's Stuart.
"""We met at the comic book store."
"""I was wondering if you'd like"
"""to get coffee sometime."
"""It's okay if you say no."
"""It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft."""
"Amy, little vixen."
Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.
What are you going to do?
Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?
"Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend;"
she has a Sheldon.
So do you like Stuart?
I don't know.
He's nice.
He's funny.
"He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland."
That's kind of hot.
"Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you've been with him over a year now."
"If it's not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?"
"Well, yeah, I guess they're not engaged like me and Howie."
Jing-Mei was first on the scene.
- Is she okay?
- A little freaked.
"I don't get it, man, how you could just roll over."
- That's the way it works sometimes.
"- Yeah, if you let it."
"- What are you gonna do, file a lawsuit?"
- That's one way to fight it.
- There is no fighting it.
"- You know, I don't buy that."
Carter wants the output on Bed 4 before he leaves.
"Look, we could be perfect, you know, like Gandhi."
"But as soon as the crap goes down, we'll be the first ones laid out with a gun to our head."
"Now, where I grew up, you see it every day."
"And if it happens to you enough, you get the message."
You are not equal.
You are not a full citizen.
"You are first, last and, above all, one thing and one thing only:"
A suspect.
You sure you wanna wait out here?
"Yeah, there's too many sick people in there."
- Thanks.
- You' re welcome.
Hey.
Cold enough for you?
My mom went ahead to help set up stuff for the home hospice team.
- Then she'll be coming to pick me up.
- I think you' re doing the right thing.
I think it doesn't matter what you think.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm so pissed at you.
Guess it all just feels so much more real now.
"Uh, we're not supposed to have any of that."
The Mokra don't allow it.
They can't have control of everything.
Surely there's someone who has an illegal transmitter.
I know what you'd like...
some talsa root soup.
Can you at least tell me what happened to the other people
I was with on the street?
You really should be more careful out there.
Those Mokra will pick a fight for no reason.
I don't want you getting hurt...again.
But I saw the way you handled that ugly one.
I couldn't have done any better.
"I was so proud of you, Ralkana."
My two friends...
did the Mokra take them?
I'm afraid so.
Where would they have been taken?
A detention center?
The prison.
All right.
How do I get there?
Soup.
I'm forgetting the soup.
"I appreciate your hospitality, but I can't stay here."
I've got to get to that prison.
"You're right, the time has come."
"Now we're together again, we can't wait another day."
My beautiful and brave...
girl.
The Mokra won't stand a chance against us.
"You're very kind to offer, but I didn't mean we'd be going together."
Suddenly there's a hole in the wall.
Money vanished silently.
He's no ordinary thief.
You don't say anything.
I got the stick of my life for trusting you.
We all had our balls busted.
I'll get the details...
You can't do it.
We've handed over the case to a new officer.
Call the new officer.
I told you that you can never catch me after December 16th.
"Today I'm reporting for duty, I think all are waiting for me."
"I wanted to do it for children, I did it."
It's over.
"Then, what about this?"
This is for my lover.
She wants me to be a police officer.
I worked hard to become a police officer.
But there's a real kick in fulfilling her wish.
Shattering!
What are you discussing?
Give the file to him.
Who do you think he's?
"Meritorious candidate, and he gave a lot on information about the thief also."
Don't you feel you've caught the thief by looking at him?
Yes sir.
"You don't feel bad, old officer."
Nothing like that sir.
I know very well about him.
He's very sincere.
Handover all your wealth to him.
He's the right man for you.
What time is your flight?
8:00 a.m.
Am I crazy?
No.
I am crazy.
Alexander Leek.
- Who the hell are you?
-John Klein.
I called you last week.
Do you know what that is?
Stay away.
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.
Where are they seeing it?
"Point Pleasant, West Virginia."
You can help me.
Follow me.
The nocturnal butterfly.
"In ancient cultures, the moth represents a form of the psyche... or the soul immortally trapped... in the hellish death realms."
Mothman.
That's what the Ukranians called him.
"Rough translation, of course."
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl the year the nuclear plantwent down.
"Galveston, 1969, just before the hurricane."
They saw it.
But seeing isn't always believing.
"Look, there's never been a single shred of evidence... to show that these things exist materially."
So you're telling me these things do not exist?
"Oh, they exist."
All kinds of things exist around us that we never see.
"Electricity, microwaves, infrared waves."
"You know, these things have been around forever."
I don't mind going 75 to 150 miles a day.
I think this is proof that We need to keep going back.
Captain kris kelly Finally notches a success.
Let's get the boat Ready.
And things are looking up For the kellys.
We're gonna make 100 ounces In the river this season.
Everybody's on my team now.
We're gonna go back there And kill it.
I packed the trailer.
So we can get the quad In the back-up.
- My god.
- -what the
I got too many bills to pay.
You can't do this.
You said you'd use it Before for one day.
I got to work.
"I got to make a living, too."
I need it back down there.
"Gearing up this morning,"
"Getting ready to hit The river again,"
And what happens?
My dad's friend comes along.
That he's borrowing The boat from.
So now I'm back at square one.
I don't have a boat To go river mining with.
I've got a claim that we know There's gold at.
And we just can't get it again.
"Okay, we'll meet You down there."
We'll put it Back in there.
I don't want to go down a bad Road with you guys.
"Don't worry, We'll bring it right back."
Without a dredge Built Specifically for river Mining...
No.
Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart?
Whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
"Okay, listen to me."
Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
I am not trying to get her back.
"But, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
"All right, honey, let me tell you a story."
"There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt."
"Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it."
Do you see where I'm going with this?
I believe I do.
Mm.
I'm the guy.
You're not the guy.
Are you sure?
That would explain so much.
"Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me"
"""sweetie"" all the time."
"I call everyone ""sweetie."""
You tramp.
(sighs)
"Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy."
"""Strap on a pair""?"
"Of what, skates?"
"Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy."
"(quiet, dramatic musical score playing in movie)"
"If you're bored, you can go."
I understand.
"No, I'm having a nice time."
(scoffs)
Don't patronize me.
"Vasundhara, who has been charged with financial forgery is being investigated by the police."
We chased Vasundhara for many days regarding this case.
We are collecting the details of the money lost by the victims.
What a man!
Thank you very much.
Your news has taken over every news channel.
You are the pride of our district!
Thank you.
"- Congrats, constable sir."
"Thank you, Sir."
"Super, dude!"
One cop like you in a town is enough to stop fraudsters.
Thank you.
- You are great!
Is it your felicitation ceremony or mine?
You have achieved a great thing.
You've got all the accolades that I should have for my service for 37 years of service today!
Sir...
I just did my job.
People giving the praise...
The photos of the victims have been recovered from Vasundhara's phone.
Is that you?
That is definitely you!
Why would you take a picture that close to her!
Dear...
She is already jailed.
Your anger still not subsided?
!
"Varun, I'm coming for you."
- What's cooking?
- My mother's recipe...
"You know, between us he spent his time annoy others."
Look at the comments of his former comrades.
Everyone is happy.
His death brings them satisfaction.
"""Master Sakotaaaa"""
"""Finally dead."""
"""He not deserve to live."""
Yesterday one person died .
Yet there is more people satisfied
"The head of murdering a taxi driver this morning and the theft of her recipe before taking flight from the video of the taxi, it would be the former inmate"
"Otoharada Kuro, 46 ."
The address he gave to his release is false.
It took a notice research to find him.
Done.
He resurfaced Otoharada.
Now I count on you to find him.
Then...
Yagami.
Do not disappoint me.
Yes.
- Return to your quarters!
- Yes.
"Chief, this time..."
"Refer to the jurisdiction, and will investigate."
We must give them every detail.
Yes.
Course.
This Ogiso a big head.
"Yeah, but wait."
The head endures same.
The leader knows the suspect Otoharada?
You not know?
"Yeah, that's a bite mark, all right."
"What do you have to say about that, maestro?"
Gillian must have given me a love bite.
I spent the night with her Sunday.
"Yeah, she told us that."
She also said that you both fell asleep fully clothed.
We had rather a lot to drink.
I took my usual sleeping pill.
My recollection is a little fuzzy.
That's cold.
Teeth marks look bigger than Laura's.
"Well, that happens when there's some swelling of the bite wound."
There.
I'll get the odontologist to confirm.
But it's a match with Laura.
"He clenched her in a bear hug and... lifted her up into the air shaft, her head would have been over his shoulder."
It's consistent with a bite sustained during a struggle.
I hear the fat lady warming up.
"Me, a suspect."
- How outrageous is that?
- I'm sure it's a mistake.
It's done.
You're perfect.
"I'm all bark, Gillian."
You know I wouldn't hurt anyone.
That's the last thing I would want to think.
"But truthfully, Philip, I..."
I don't remember biting you.
You know how much we had to drink.
I just wanted to numb myself.
"Yes, yes, I'm coming!"
Mr. Reinhardt... put your hands on the piano.
You think she's gonna be psyched?
"Totes, dude."
Why wouldn't she be?
So how does this work?
We just--we show up in Amsterdam and we start calling hotels... and ask if they have a Maria staying there?
- I don't even know her last name.
"- Dude, it's totally cool."
We're definitely gonna find her.
Amsterdam is a very small place.
It's not gonna be--
"Sir, I need you to step aside, please."
Let me search you.
- Did I beep?
"- No, you didn't beep."
Just a random security check.
"If you could just step aside, please?"
Just over here.
"- Random, huh?"
- Yeah.
So this has nothing to do with my ethnicity?
"Kumar, just do what the guy says."
"Sir, it's our job as airport security... to search for all possible weapons or illegal drugs."
"So just because of the colour of my skin, you assume that I have drugs on me?"
"- No, he's--"
"- What are you, a racist?"
Racist?
"Dude, I'm black."
He's black.
He's not a racist.
"Please, dude, you're barely even brown."
"No, he didn't mean that."
"Compared to me, you look like Matthew Perry."
Right.
"Maybe I didn't have a fluorescent suntan, but I'd spent my share of time in pool halls as a kid."
"Of course, that was a long time ago."
- Straight pool?
- Mm-hmm.
"Gee, I haven't played since I learned for Roger."
"In Bayonne, girls in their late 20s, or early 30s, still do that for their men."
Roger and I met playing pool.
I felt this... attraction to him and asked him to teach me.
"When someone's showing you the game, there's a lot of... touching and being close."
"Well, by the end of the evening, he'd asked me out."
It was just like in the movies.
You know what I mean?
I think I can guess.
Excuse me.
"Well, just when I know he's about ready to pop the question, he disappears."
- Ah.
"- Almost a year later, I get this postcard from him... with this P.O. box postmark, you know?"
"Once the writing started again, we burned up the post office."
"I mean torrid, you know?"
"And then, bam!"
A marriage proposal.
Excuse me.
"Well, I was so excited I couldn't sleep for two nights."
And then I telegraphed.
"""Yes. '."""
"And then yesterday, when I got off the plane..."
No Roger.
That's 24 hours you owe me.
Rack 'em up.
Well?
"Well, we do what we have to do."
Yes!
I am a criminal!
The people of the crime world are scared of me!
I am a disgrace on the name of humanity!
I know!
I know that you hate me!
You think Im not a nice man!
But I believe that no man in the world is bad.
No one is a born criminal!
No thief robs forthe sake of pleasure.
No criminal commits any crime for his pleasure.
No prostitute sells her body for her pleasure.
Time and circumstances.
Time and circumstances force a person to become bad!
And you know very well that a person who dies due to..
"..poverty or starvation, his final riots are not conducted."
"From that time.. from that time, I have Iearntjust one.."
"..thing from life, I have understoodjust one thing.."
..from life that it is not a crime or a sin to be born..
"..as a poor, but dying due to poverty.."
"..is the biggest crime, the biggest sin!"
Bravo!
Bravo!
It is the biggest crime..
-Thats our hero!
Heres our hero!
wonderful.
Mind blowing.
My discovery!
Cut!
"I swear upon God, you were outstanding!"
The truth is that I have been happyjust twice.
That's not dumb.
That's cute.
"Look, I don't know who my dad is."
And...
"If I stop believing that anything is possible, it feels like I'm shutting the door on ever meeting him."
Can I stop making this face?
'Cause I feel like I'm gonna cry.
"Well, your crying face is dumb, too, so go ahead."
I'll end it with Everett.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Just curious.
Why Egypt?
I figure it's so far away that no one will ever follow me there.
"Seriously, you know Riley Elliott?"
Yeah.
We dated for six months.
"We're on a break right now, but you never know."
Hmm.
You've blocked my entire life's work!
You ruined my career!
Whoa.
"I just think that you have some incredible skills, Mary, and I would love to see you channel those talents into something good."
Oh.
"For your information,"
I have done a lot of good!
Did you know that I was the number one download for Operation Desert Freedom?
What have you ever done for our troops?
I was really nice to one in an airport shuttle one time.
"Okay, if you want to help me, Aaron, then just let me be who I am."
Accept me for who I am.
Not a lot of people in my life have done that.
I just want a mate.
You just want to mate?
!
I just want a mate.
"You're not mating with me, sunshine!"
"A mate, I want a mate."
"Well, just as well, because I'm not having any of that nonsense."
"I mean, you're just a long streak of nothing, you know, alien nothing."
"There we are, then."
Okay.
I think the pair of them together were pretty amazing.
It proves that you don't need to have romantic tension to have a male and a female character with a dynamic relationship.
"Oh, ha ha!"
That's just -- car keys.
What?
I've still got my mum's car keys.
I won't be a minute.
"Donna's end, as a companion, broke my house."
My wife and I were just inconsolable.
"She basically becomes a Time Lord herself, but, because she's physically human, she can't handle it and her brain's going to burn and the Doctor has to wipe her memory of everything they've done together."
Don't make me go back.
"Doctor, please, please, don't make me go back!"
Donna.
"Oh, Donna Noble, I am so sorry."
But we had the best of times.
The best.
Goodbye.
"No, no, no, please."
"Please, no, no."
No!
No!
She was a receptionist.
"- Thank you, Doctor."
"- There were other symptoms, Doc."
"He had hallucinations, heard voices."
Aren't they both associated with glioblastoma?
"I see nothing here to suggest... something as exotic as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein... but if you'd like I can refer Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist... for a second opinion."
- He's wrong.
"- No, that'd be fine."
Thank you very much.
¡Gordon!
Wait.
Wait.
He's not wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
He's not wrong 'cause there's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear.
and he tells you you got a headache...
"Yes, well, you're not sick, so that is good news."
I wish I was sick.
Then I would know why this is happening.
You shouldn't say things like that.
You should not say that.
"What should I say, Denise?"
I'm hallucinating.
I'm hearing voices.
Was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
No.

"Poor Number Four had, er..."
"Epstein-Barr, but I don't think that's what took him in the end."
You buried them in your garden like gerbils.
"- My God, they were human beings!"
- Precisely.
"You see, the depravity of the human heart knows no bounds."
"Name your blackest desires, and somewhere, out in the sweating mass of humanity, you'll find someone all too happy to gratify them."

Men?
Number Three was a lady.
"I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong."
"I had everything, on paper."
Came from a good family.
Met my wife.
Had a family of my own.
It wasn't enough.
I felt... ordinary.
But with Richard and Emma...
"well, I'm special."
Not that special.
There were six others before you.
Out of billions.
I matter here.
- I'm happy.
- See?
"But one day, all this... will kill you."
"Well, better a short life filled with pleasure than a long one searching forjoy."

That's Leo speaking.
That's not even Dr. Bryar.
"Why don't you let him think for himself, Leo?"
You...
Can you see him?
"- Yeah, he's right there."
- Shoot this kid.
Why don't you let him make his own decisions?
Shoot him!
The voices.
"They helped you, right?"
It's where you get your ideas from.
"While the other kids were outside in the playground, you were inside reading, studying, learning."
The voices wouldn't stop.
They helped you understand things that other people could never realize and...
"Then as you grew older, it became almost a responsibility."
Right?
A responsibility to use that ability.
To use your knowledge.
String theory.
The Theory of Everything.
"Shoot him, Ted."
"Then M-Theory, encompassing all the strings, unifying the theories."
"- Don't push him, Reid."
- You know what's funny?
Most people say that M-Theory can never be proved because the mathematical tools do not yet exist.
- Don't push him.
"- But you see it, right?"
Am I right?
"Come on, I'll drive you out there."
John?
"Oh, Vera!"
"Come in, my dear."
"Or come out, whichever it is."
I wasn't expecting you till next weekend.
Then you don't mind my surprising you?
Still the same Vera.
Just the same.
You might have caught me making up to one of the nurses.
"Here, sit down, my dear, sit down."
"How are you feeling, John?"
I've quite taken to this sort of life.
It's rather pleasant.
"Painting, talking, just taking it easy."
"You know, I never realized how uncomfortable a starched collar could be till I started wearing these."
"Of course, they'd..."
They'd never do in business.
"John, you haven't mentioned the business."
I'm sure Harold is doing excellently.
He's a very clever young man.
"A little erratic, but I dare say he's learning."
"Well, he's doing the best he can, but he needs help."
Maybe you could advise him.
I don't see how I could do that.
I've been out of touch too long.
"Nearly a year, isn't it?"
Just about.
Too many things change in that time.
I don't know what conditions are.
"No, no, Harold's right there."
He knows more about it than I do now.
"I left my spot empty, indicated in the pictures."
This empty seat is mine.
They're two men I knew.
I lived with this man with the blurry face...
The other...
Is a friend.
"He still is, by the way."
That's one of the first pictures where I put white inside...
Inside the picture itself...
I really enjoyed it.
I also liked the mouvement of one the characters.
It's the first picture on which I made the outlines blurry.
Very blurry.
But only to let this white in.
"The white of the frame, inside the picture itself."
"It's very London-ish, isn't it?"
I've never been.
That's true.
Where is this window?
Where do you think?
"The order, the greenery, the grass..."
"The fields, the trees.."
It's Britain...
Britain...
The heart of civilization.
It seemed to me...
Strangely I took this picture while I wasn't feeling well...
"When I wasn't feeling well, I took very ordered pictures."
"Very composed, with this..."
There's a little string.
"A little string of a roller blind, ready cover the whole image."
So you took this picture to show something of Britain?
No exit.
It's like the bullet went in... and vanished.
"Look at this, Al."
Someone dragged her onto that dock.
"Oh, come on."
Lots of women have scuffed-up heels on their shoes.
"No, not Hilla."
Her friend told me that Hilla always kept her clothes perfect.
"Whoever killed her, dragged her to the end of the dock."
"I hate to tell you this, Sherlock, but she could have shot herself."
Where's the gun?
Maybe it fell into the lake.
"No, I don't think so."
Why not?
"If Hilla committed suicide, I wouldn't be here."
The only thing that makes sense is that I'm here to find out who murdered her.
"[ Sam Narrating ] Whenever I quantum leap, I get to see what it's like to walk in another man's shoes."
And sometimes what it's like to drive in his car.
"I knew very little about Hilla, except that she survived a war when everyone else in her family died."
She was either lucky or had a strong will to live.
One of these had run out on her.
I had to find out which one.
Greg.
Ah.
Melvin.
How you doin'?
Fine.
Fine.
"Uh, we're just wrapping up for winter here."
Uh-
"- Um, could you tell me which room was Hilla's?"
The key doesn't have a number on it.
Here we are.
Till death do us part.
Of course the security guard didn't see me.
I was asleep on the sofa.
"Are you sure that's where you were, Tom?"
You didn't go home instead?
Get into an argument?
No.
But she was angry with you?
We were happy.
Didn't stop you playing away though?
I wouldn't.
I loved her.
"You loved her so much, you had to change the bed sheets?"
You know where that bed sheet is now?
It's in our lab being tested.
"What are they gonna find, Tom?"
A loving fiance or a cheating liar?
Guv wants a word.
Interview suspended at 9:50.
Greenwich just called.
A woman's been attacked outside her flat by a minicab driver.
You think there's a link?
Victim is a temp at the forensic service lab where Kelly worked.
I was working late.
So I didn't want to risk the walk to the tube.
And there was this minicab parked up right near where I work.
He said he'd just dropped someone off.
Can you remember the name of the cab company?
"No, I'm sorry."
"He took you back to your place, yeah?"
I was halfway down the steps to my flat before I realised he was behind me.
- These were all his decisions?
- Yeah.
We just gave him the stage and he ran with it.
- I hope we got his business number.
- So good.
"Project Jenny, Project Jan is this band here."
- This guy was so good.
"- By the way Jeremy who plays Randy, when we made out in the first club scene and we made out for a while, and he was getting married the next day."
It was like a really funny thing.
It felt like I was his bachelor party.
I didn't find that out until the end of the day.
I felt guilty that I asked him to do that when he's getting married the next morning.
It's a hell of a bachelor party.
- It's all acting.
- Yeah.
- He was in character.
- He's a cool guy.
- Look at his guy.
Look at his guy.
"- This guy, I mean..."
"- Look, he's shameless."
- Somebody get this guy a show.
"And then all of a sudden, ""Hey, I'll blow their minds real quick."""
"And then all of a sudden, ""Hey, I'll blow their minds real quick."""
The shot looks like it was orchestrated to highlight the backflip.
- But it wasn't.
It was just in there.
- It was the master of the scene there.
This was the coldest I've ever been in my life.
Ever.
Ever.
Ever.
"Good night, Henry."
He's such a slut.
He's probably slept with half the girls on the campus already.
JACK:
"No, I haven't."
You know how much it costs me to fill up my truck?
A hundred bucks.
"Get a hybrid, man."
It's the only way to go.
"Uh, a little too girly for me."
"Oh, yeah, that's right, sorry."
It was a free car.
"My parents gave it to me, so..."
"It is a little girly, but I'd have to have a very good reason if I wanted to trade it in."
You got a family.
You need something bigger.
Amy's got a bigger car.
"Of course, it's orange."
Why did she pick orange?
"I don't know, some friend of her mother's gave it to her just to annoy her dad."
You both got free cars?
"Yeah, so no car payments."
"If we had car payments, we'd be in trouble."
"You got a scholarship, right?"
"Yeah, you got one too, right?"
Yeah.
"Yours is based on academics, but mine a depends on my game and the coach isn't too happy with me right now."
"Yeah, well, you gotta do what you gotta do."
I don't know.
"Grace, he was with Clementine before you guys were even back together."
He was with Clementine knowing we were going to get back together.
"All right, well, aren't you happy that you didn't have sex with him?"
When was that?
-Six months ago.
-Right.
Remember there were a lot of people there?
"Well, several people came up to me and said:"
Is that your brother?
Of course you're my sister mom.
I show you the documentation about progress.
You mean you made slides of sexual intercourse?
They're gorgeous you know.
"Hey mom, can I have some money?"
"I have to be right, I'll send you a check allright?"
Allright.
You take American Express?
I really need it you know.
Can I give you when I left uptown?
No!

I was supposed to meet Owen.
I forgot.
I'm very sorry.
Today is his first day.
He thought that was a stain.
"Damn it, does that make sense?"
"- Hey, you!"

The Fox Family starts their day by making medicine.
This generous family takes in people abandoned by their loved ones.
"While taking care of them, their day goes by so quickly."
But they are so happy to do it.
Is this what a real family is?
Please give all our family much love and peace.
May their body and spirit be healthy.

"Cancel the deal, the deal is cancel."
"Laxmi Jee you told deal done, bed!"
But dad?
Deal is done.
But my advance of 100000/-
i and sitting in front of underworld don.
You know... why i have started undergarment business.
Because it has under like underworld.
I got this 100000/-
"Laxmi Narayan Jee, thank you, the car is yours, i should leave now, i have to make agreements papers."
Come at 4 o'clock and get 900000/- too yeah sure.
You saved me.
And you caught me.
I always wanted to marry some... some underworld don.
"How excited, how thrill there life is."
Husband go in the morning.
And wife didn't know if the husband will come back home or not.
In the night when husband come back and kiss.
It is feel like that's a last kiss.
Because don't know from where bullet can come.
And husband could have encounter.
Because this man's wife had a tumor.
"What you had, Gordon, was a first-class migraine."
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.
"- Thank you, Doctor."
"- There were other symptoms, Doc."
"He had hallucinations, heard voices."
Aren't they both associated with glioblastoma?
"I see nothing here to suggest... something as exotic as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein... but if you'd like I can refer Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist... for a second opinion."
- He's wrong.
"- No, that'd be fine."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Wait.
Wait.
He's not wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
He's not wrong 'cause there's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear and he tells you you got a headache...
"Yes, well, you're not sick, so that is good news."
I wish I was sick.
Then I would know why this is happening.
You shouldn't say things like that.
"What should I say, Denise?"
I'm hallucinating.
I'm hearing voices.
Was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
No.
"13 News is headed to the scene, and we'll have a live report in minutes."
"Again our top story, Domain Air flight 9 out of Denver has crashed."
Did you two get into my four-quadrant popcorn tin?
Relax.
We were just sniffing it.
Stand up and show me your fingers.
"If I see any cheese dust, you're both grounded."
Dust-free.
You happy?
"Dude, you're unbelievable."
Popcorn is the snack of the people.
No.
It's a snack for dads only.
I get one tin a year from my armoire dealer in Cincinnati.
It's the only thing that gets me through the season.
"There are so many sad things in that sentence, but I honestly think the winner is ""Cincinnati."""
"Well, just keep your hands off the tin."
That's it.
End of story.
And the same goes for the thermostat.
"Yeah, I see you two looking."
That's 'cause it's colder in this house
- than it is outside.
"- Yeah, man."
Can't you spare like two more degrees?
"If you two are so cold, go out and shovel the walkway."
That ought to work up a sweat but good.
"Murray Goldberg had a lot of dumb dad rules, but nothing equaled his hard line on snow."
And no monkeying around out there when you're done.
- This weather is treacherous.
"- Oh, here we go."
Another lecture on the dangers of cold weather.
I'm serious.
It's not safe out there.
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything!
No way.
A guy with just one arm.
We should buy him a barrel organ and give him 2 Mark.
We gotta take care of him!
What use is a one-armed man to us?
What use is a headless man to us?
- Why?
- Because he's starting to make sense.
He just wants to spy on us!
I know what he wants.
I'll test him and take responsibility for his actions.
"Mieze, you gotta look after him!"
They treat him like dirt.
"I'll go and work for him, even if it means playing a barrel organ!"
I know those guys quite well.
You gotta watch out that they won't be a bad influence on him.
Understand?
"Tomorrow evening, right?"
And Biberkopf is really gonna be with us?
Sure!
What's wrong with that?
One bale of cheviot 75-02.
Half a bale of worsted 75-64
One bale of cheviot 75-66
How many bales are missing?
Half a bale of worsted 75-69
Half a bale of worsted 75-98
Just yesterday my wife said to me that this door was unbreakable.
And they came through the roof!
They took excellent english goods!
Grace was fussy all night and sometimes a car ride settles her down.
I'm gonna numb up the cuts on your face before I suture.
What am I gonna tell my husband?
"""Need a new car""?"
You're going to feel a little pinprick and then some burning before it kicks in.
You have a bunch of phone messages.
Tell Kayson to stop bothering me.
I'll call Anspaugh back when I get a chance.
"Oh, crap."
Henry's got a birthday party tomorrow.
Could you go down to that toy store on Michigan Avenue for me?
You want me to go outside?
Yeah.
It's just a few blocks.
I need a King Funshine.
I'll write it down for you.
- In the storm?
"- What, you afraid you'll melt?"
What about the lightning?
I'm a pretty big target.
"Well, then I suggest you try running in a zigzag pattern."
The results are back for that little girl who ejected from the car.
- Is she awake yet?
"- Not yet, but I'm gonna double-check."
Baby's head CT is negative.
- Just some soft tissue swelling.
- Is she awake?
"No, she's still sedated."
Then you can't follow her neuro exam.
She'll wake up and we'll extubate.
This is Bradley Anderson.
His wife and daughter were brought in.
That's a bad idea.
They're getting away!
That was close.
Bravo.
"Well done, MacGyver."
I knew you'd get us out of that mess.
I always said you're my brightest student.
I'm sorry.
You've every right to be angry with me.
I was wrong.
I was foolish to think that I could control Cleeve.
You almost got us killed!
You must believe me.
I never meant any harm to come to you or Kelly.
"The truth is, I was frightened."
I'd lost my position at the academy.
I was desperate.
"I mean, this is my last chance."
I couldn't bear the thought of losing it.
I thought you hated treasure hunters like Cleeve.
I do.
But finding the Treasure of Atlantis means more than wealth.
"It would prove that Atlantis really did exist and there were times when people didn't live by war and conquest, but worshiped peace and knowledge."
"And if we were like that once, maybe we can be like that again."
It's a nice dream.
I'm convinced that it can become a reality.
"It's a wonderful dream, professor."
But did it ever occur to you that Cleeve might have other plans for the treasure?
Do you think he and Zavros will come after us?
Yes.
"Yes, I do."
The Tower of Fear.
He went to meet Mary.
"All right, let's go check out the Larimar."
"I already told Mary, that I don't want anything to do with your business or any of it."
"Okay, well, you did at one point."
Mary would never force anyone into this.
Why did you do it in the first place?
I work in the ICU.
I deal with the heaviest shit in the hospital...
"People at their worst, their most desperate."
"Before Mary, there was only so much I could do for them."
"Handing them that pamphlet, it gave them..."
- Comfort.
- Yeah.
Also I want a million dollars.
"Uh, what?"
I have financial goals.
How much do you have so far?
"Oh, come on, I'm not gonna rob you."
It's too much work.
- Not enough.
- Enough for what?
Freedom.
So you're breaking the law for freedom?
"The law is wrong, and it will change."
"Until then, there's no reason that I shouldn't supplement my income."
Then why stop?
I have this vision.
"Me, Mary, and now you, all of us in the woods somewhere, like a camp."
"No, a retreat."
A death retreat.
"People come from all over the world to experience the finest death possible, from the best of the best."
Sounds kind of nice.
"Yes, of course!"
Tomorrow.
"Yes, madam."
Yes.
Goodbye.
In Peru prostitutes and drug addicts were arrested.
Many of those arrested are teenagers who inhale glue.
"Ready, madam."
"- Thank you, Guille, see you next week."
Where are we going?
- To see Beto.
"Good morning, Beto."
"- Good morning, madam."
Open the curtains.
"- Yes, madam."
Friday they are coming to see the house.
"- Yes, madam, I will be here."
"Here, Beto, these are from last month."
"Thanks, I didn't have anything to read."
Trick or treat?
I didn't realize it was Halloween.
Do you want to see a real monster?
Violence in Bangladesh left 50 people injured.
Hundreds of demonstrators demanding electoral reform were evacuated with teargas and beaten by the police.
Many ended up lying on the street covered in blood.
"In Australia, over a hundred soldiers had to..."
I don't think they'll sell it.
- When do you think it'll get sold?
"It would be a miracle, it's been so long..."
Don't you get bored?
- No.
Can you come tonight?
- What a good idea.
"- This Friday, already."
- I think that's a wise decision.
- You can't cope with this.
"- No, it's pointless."
- You can help move her there.
- Of course.
"One wiener, one frankfurter and one with bacon."
- Why didn't you eat any lunch?
- Bodil turns me off food.
The mentally handicapped turn me off food.
One or two rolls?
Lots of people feel that way.
"When I have handicapped customers, they scare all the others away."
- They need to eat too.
- But does it have to be when we eat?
- She'll be fine there.
- The Gimp needs to get rid of her.
He can't bring girls home with her sitting there.
He had sex with her the other day and she just lay there.
He didn't know if she enjoyed it.
"Technically, he could be raping her."
Scary thought.
"It sure makes you appreciate what you've got, honey."
- Appreciate your own good sex life.
- We've got no complaints.
"Good God, no."
I think if we take all of Copenhagen   we're in the top five percent.
"Honestly, honey, is there anything I could do better?"
"Well, maybe just in the oral department."
- Do I give you bad oral sex?
- I didn't say that.
Bloody man.
Sooner or later he's going to make somebody drop something.
"Back, keep back."
"Come on, make way."
"Come on, move back."
(People clamouring)
Back!
"Come on, move!"
Keep back!
"Come on, move."
Back!
HOWARD:
Get out of the way!
Keep back and don't touch anything!
"- Adamson, get these people back!"
"- Yes, sir."
"This is ridiculous, sir."
They're all behaving as if this was some sort of bloody fairground attraction.
Have you any idea how many people were here yesterday?
"12,000. 12,000!"
"I mean, where in God's name are they all coming from?"
It's making work quite impossible and it's only a matter of time before there's an accident.
"I think it's something we have to put up with, old man."
The amount of interest this thing has generated is quite extraordinary.
I've been giving interviews all morning.
"We're front page news, Howard."
Hmm.
"Well, no one's spoken to me."
"If they had, I'd have told them to bugger off."
Did I tell you His Majesty has asked me to Buck House for lunch to tell him all about it?
"What's this, do you suppose?"
It's a shabti figure.
Leave that magazine here.
Hello?
"Ah, it's you."
Were you expecting someone more exciting?
Where have you been until this late hour?
The store will be closed tomorrow.
Do you want to meet me in the afternoon?
I've something I need to talk to you about.
It's very important.
"OK, have you bought that stuff I asked you to buy?"
What's that?
That stuff.
"Ah, condoms?"
"Yes, I bought them."
"Hey, what are you going to tell me tomorrow?"
"Oh, my wife is coming."
See you.
Your bath's ready.
Don't you have to get up early for a game of golf with your clients?
Early bed?
Yes.
Have you become one of those old men who read these kind of magazines?
You must be kidding.
One of my colleagues at work loves this kind of stuff and he gave me this one saying it was the best.
"Pornography in Japan is totally tasteless, isn't it?"
She's very pretty.
Doesn't she look just like those girls who work in your department store?
We haven't taken a bath together for so long.
Why don't we do that tonight?
"Are you going to wash me, then?"
That girl in the magazine.
That pretty girl. I've seen her.
Thank you.
"Howard, Homicide."
"Hey, Beth."
Lunch tomorrow?
"Sure, what time?"
Fire inspector?
"She knows the bar, says it won't be a problem but she can't get here till next week."
Building inspector?
A slight snag.
He's sick.
He's scheduled to do the tour 8:00am Thursday if his rabies clears up.
Health inspector?
I'm meeting him tomorrow at 10:00am.
He's nice.
I dated his sister once.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
All of these bureaucrats have to sign off before we can buy the bar?
That's how it works.
Why can't they just have one guy come down and check out everything?
I'm no expert but I'm starting to believe in less government.
"There's too much regulation, there's too many shackles and business should be free of these kinds of restraints."
"Anyway, what do I know?"
I'm just a silent partner.
Does he seem silent to you?
- Coffee?
"- Yeah, thanks."
"Sometimes after these marathon shifts, I get these coffee headaches, and the only way to get rid of them is to drink more coffee."
How about I buy?
Buy?
"It's the squad's coffee, it's free."
"I'd still like to buy, huh?"
I can only take so much of this!
Are you going to drink your life away?
Go home if you're not going to drink with me.
Don't you think you're overdoing it?
"I know you're hurt, but this is too much."
It's just a darn exam.
You never wore a scholar's robe before anyway.
Stay out of my life.
How could I?
Who are you to tell how to live my life?
Who am I?
How could you say such a heartless thing?
I'm your friend salt merchant Yim Chun-su.
"A friend, yes, we're friends..."
Come to think of it.
We make a fine pair.
You're a peasant's son and I am a traitors son.
We make a fine pair.
Are you done?
Is that why you're my friend?
Because you're poor and your grandfather was a traitor?
Are you saying you wouldn't have been my friend if you came from a rich and powerful clan?
Fine then.
Do what you want.
You can drink yourself to death for all I care!
Would you pour me a glass of that?
Is it hard to bear?
I'm glad.
I'm glad this happened to me and not to Yo-shin.
Ten years...
For ten years this river has been the source of comfort.
And in that time I had put it all behind.
"Fortunately, not."
"You all remember General Zavros, my ex-associate."
You terminate all your partnerships like this?
On the contrary.
General Zavros did it to himself.
"As you can see, greed, heedless of caution, is a highly combustible mixture."
"I, on the other hand, am a very cautious fellow."
So I waited for you to arrive to show us a way past this... impediment.
Why should we help you?
Because the length of your lives is directly proportionate to how useful you are to me.
"MacGyver, there must be a way we can de-activate this fire."
"Well, I suggest you find it... quickly."
Maybe the answer's in the first line of Solon's riddle.
What do you think?
"""The gods march in r--"
"Rank."""
Yeah.
That one.
"Kelly, you wanna hand me that platinum page?"
It's a key.
Mercury...
Venus...
Earth... the moon...
"Well done, MacGyver."
Now I see why you were Atticus' favorite student.
But what's this red crystal?
Perhaps it's a star.
We're not here to discuss astronomy.
"After you, MacGyver."
Keep moving!
MacGyver.
It's wonderful.
I see I must confess.
"When I wrote you that letter, my tender feelings for you so overpowered me"
I could not find words of clarity and persuasion.
I was desperate.
I looked around me for help.
I saw George's book and stole what I needed.
But a year ago this book had not been published.
"Or even written, I suspect."
"I think I've found the truth, for which I thank you, and I owe Madame Sand an apology."
Perhaps now she and I can become friends.
Don't be content with just a little truth.
George will never be content with just your friendship.
She wants your manhood.
"Your virtue, your genius, your soul."
Listen to me!
That woman is a graveyard!
But I can help you.
I can inspire you.
This is the novel and that's the last chapter of the memoir.
- It's a bit on the thin side.
- So's my life.
- Do you know of a good tutor?
- I'll ask around.
"By the way, Mr Chopin came to see me last week."
He asked if you would call on him when you were in town.
Mmm!
Do I hear a duet?
"Perhaps this is not the last chapter, eh?"
"Give me my money, you jackal!"
Madame Aurora Dudevant.
Aurora is the name I was born with.
Aurora.
I won't let them do it to me.
They won't get anything.
That's how the business is done.
- What is he saying?
- He may say lots of things.
Igor...
Don't do anything to me please.
I would have given you the 500 thousand from the last contract myself if you had called me.
There was nothing between your wife and me.
"I just danced with her, and that's all."
Everything else is a lie!
Did you find any papers with my signature?
"No, we found nothing so far."
May be you should turn to the police officials?
It was a real attack.
So crazy!
I got confused.
Where are the real people?
Where are the images I created?
I'm scared.
May be I shall forget about it all and start painting again.
"I showed promise, didn't I?"
"Garik, you're my best friend."
I need your help.
The situation is difficult but not hopeless.
But if you drink so much you'll get delirium tremens instead of schizophrenia.
You're joking and I don't want to live.
I'm dreaming that I'm King Solomon.
May be you are Tsar Solomon.
May be all your troubles are just a dream.
Solomon was not a bad guy.
I wouldn't brush him aside if I were you.
You're in excruciating pain.
"God, all for a few inches."
Pain and agony for a little bit of pleasure.
I get it.
"If it's that bad, why don't you just stop sleep--"
- Doing what you're doing?
- Because it doesn't feel bad when I'm...
Doing it.
It's good.
It's great.
"And maybe if you weren't so scared of getting burned, you'd feel the same."
"You know, I used to walk tall around here."
I used to walk tall.
Then...
Came George.
He took off at least an inch.
Then Erica went and left me.
That shaved off a few more.
I got shorter.
"All that humiliation, it makes you shorter."
"So, yeah, I am scared of getting hurt because one more personal disaster right now would cut me off at the knees."
"So, uh, Valentine's day?"
"Personally, I mean, I think you can't go wrong with jewelry."
"- If you want, I can recommend some local plac--"
- What is wrong with you?
What?
We just took a liver and an intestine from a little kid.
A dead little kid.
And you don't even care.
You're talking about rainbows and relationships and crap.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You don't think that I know that they just pulled the plug on a kid?
For $600?
For your daughter?
I would do anything for my daughter.
I would do anything for my daughter.
The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger.
"I'm not here to be saved -- not by you, Tim... or your god."
"I see that you're in pain, Mr. Jennings."
There is grace and forgiveness for you.
For everyone.
Do you believe that?
I do.
Previously on The Americans
What is it that you do there at the church?
We talk.
They get them when they're children.
They indoctrinate them with friendship and songs.
I really like the people at work.
I don't feel right about helping your office with them anymore.
"Not sure it's enough to get her back on Clark's side, so... this is how I fixed it."
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
We can expose U.S. Forces secretly training contra commanders on American soil.
It looks like the best way onto the camp is septic.
Which truck do you drive?
- Number nine.
- Where are the keys?
Inside the truck.
We can tie him up and gag him.
- What if he gets loose?
- He won't.
What if a hiker comes by and they call the police when we're in the camp?
I don't want to go home alone.
"All right, Johan, grab your passport."
The party's moving.
"All right, all right, I got our drinks."
And look what else I got.
"Michelle, here, works for Ticketron, and penny is currently suing a major airline."
"You guys should have plenty to talk about, because Neal here has bought tickets for an airplane."
What are you doing?
"I am sending you to ""pound town."""
I don't want to go there.
"Ladies, excuse us."
"Before you say anything,"
I'm comfortable with any combination.
"Look, Mark, I'm not in the mood to hook up with a random stranger."
They're not random.
I hand-picked them.
"Look, when you go through a break up, your body stops producing dopamine, and serotonin."
You know what it does not stop producing?
Sperm.
"Let the pain, and the sperm, out."
"Look, there is no pain, okay?"
"I mean, there should be, but there isn't."
I should be devastated.
"But, I'm not, I'm..."
I'm mostly just relieved.
And it's nothing.
That's not nothing.
Nothing is something.
Feeling nothing is what... it's what being a guy is all about.
Go with that.
Okay.
I feel a little ashamed that I feel relieved.
Commissioner ... has failed to ensure peace cows.
"It is necessary to provide the size, I   ever."
Marie is his most valuable.
She burns the sharks than in other times have rejoiced to roast his wife.
"A hero, Commissioner, suffering ..."
Fixing glue!
Do warm nuts!
The horses are waiting for me at the gate.
"Accompagnatemi not, I will go alone."
Give me a drink.
- Now where you go?
- In town.
- This is Nina Nicolaevna?
- Yes
"Last Thursday, my uncle was not good and we have telegraphed to come."
Why you say that you kissed the land on which he walked?
You should kill me instead.
"Rest, I must rest!"
I am a seagull!
I said to you:
"lies, pain ..."
Do not you want more.
I am an actress!
I am an actress!
"He did not believe the theater, we always joke with my dreams, and I have come to an end to believe it too."
I have lost the courage!
"The torments of love, jealousy ..."
The continuing fear for my child.
"They become petty, insignificant, read like a slut,"
"I did not know what to do with my hands, no longer controlling my voice."
You do not know this.
Sentire to recite so abominable.
"Oh, dear, oh, dear."
"There you are, the senior partner's lot-- disobedience and insubordination."
James?
- What?
"Oh, sorry."
You're looking despondent.
"Not ailing, are you?"
I do feel a bit under the weather.
"Touch of flu, perhaps?"
- No.
Or is it melancholy-- a feeling of mea culpa?
What do you mean?
- Paul cotterell?
"Don't explode, James."
"I know how reticent you are about private matters, but it is Paul's death that's troubling you, isn't it?"
Yes.
"- You can't carry the burdens of the world, especially not a world that's tearing itself apart like ours is."
"He was in despair after I put his dog down, and I can't help feeling that's why he took his own life."
You've got to accept it.
He was a very sick man.
"Come on, snap out of it, or do you want me to get Helen to sort you out?"
"Oh, no, thanks."
That is more than I can take.
Ah-choo!
- Aha!
"Our seasonal friend, I'll hazard."
You hazard away.
"This winter, I stay germ-free."
I'm off on my visits.
"Likewise, me to surgery."
"Wrap up warm, James, and..."
"Stay away from the cold, empty place..."
"Weird lights, strange phone calls, you."
Seeing a UFO is one thing.
What do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
What is it?
My wife died two years ago.
She saw something.
Drew pictures.
Who showed you this?
It was right here.
There was only a foot or so between its head and that branch.
That makes it about... eight feet tall.
Yeah.
I was getting ready for bed and just happened to glance out the window.
At first all I could see... were these two red eyes.
I kept looking at it.
I couldn't stop.
"I've never had that feeling before, like I couldn't move."
And then I guess itjust... took off..
"That may not make much sense, but it's... the only way I can put it into words."
"You didn't see it, did you?"
It started about two months ago.
Every time I answered the phone I'd hear it.
The first one was just a loud beeping noise.
"Now they're mostly these creaking, howling sounds."
They all like this?
"Well, once it was a man talking really fast."
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?
I even had our number changed.
But before I got a chance to give it out to anyone... the calls started again.
Tse-tse fly can kill you.
What?
Just drinking coffee.
To what do I owe this honor?
- Is this a bad time?
"- No, I just really need to sit down."
Much better...
Do you see a clean towel over there?
- Honestly...
Not really.
- Never mind.
What's up?
I wanna say thank you for what you did for us at the...
- carnival.
- I go where I'm needed.
That's what makes me superhero.
I know I haven't really been that super to you in the past.
"Are you in some kind of 12-step program, or something?"
"Unless they started a one for idiots, who, stripted their lavaliere and are having a hard time getting over it."
I can give you some pointers there.
Not that I've had ex boyfriends.
"What I wanna say, Cap', is that I'm hoping you and I can... start over."
Be friends.
"We've definitely tried the other thing, right?"
"With a lot of fun, but not much success."
"Friend Cappie, at your service."
Thank you.
What don't you tell me what you really came here for?
- Why do you assume...
"- Cause even though we're startin' over, we're not really."
I know you.
Fair enough.
- Where are the movies?
- They're getting away.
- Somebody get a rope!
- Let's season 'em!
- Have we crossed into enemy territory?
- I hope so.
- Where the hell is Klinger?
- At last.
A friendly face.
I knew this would happen.
Klinger would be back with our cosmetics by now... if you hadn't sent him off on a wild-fish chase!
You've completely destroyed the morale in this camp.
Let me know if that crowd gets out of control so I can go out there and egg 'em on.
- I take it you haven't heard from Klinger.
"- No, but I'm sure... we'll get a postcard from Toledo any day now."
"Oh, come on, Colonel."
Just 'cause he's a little late?
You call it late.
I call it permanently skedaddled.
How could you three-day suckers give Klinger a blank pass?
That's like the warden asking Willie Sutton to lock up the hoosegow.
"- Colonel, you're just jumping to conclusions."
"- Well,jump on this."
He took his footlocker with him.
Ayear's change of duds to go with his change of scenery.
- You dopes!
- You idiots!
[ Horn Honking ]
- [ All Cheering ] - [ Hawkeye ] What took you so long?
"Please, please."
An artiste cannot be rushed.
"- There you go, sir."
Where's Danny?
- Danny just left.
- Ah.
Damn it.
- And wait for it.
"Hey, I just got your text that Justin is here."
I also saw him run right past me.
Which one should I trust?
"Yeah, I know."
I love you.
I have to tell you this.
And I know you don't like this sappy stuff.
You're going to act like you don't care.
Alright you know what?
"Look, stop."
"Let me go first, OK?"
It's only fair.
"Shelly, why don't you tell him where I was while I go wash up?"
"Oh, I'd love to."
"Gather around, everybody, and hear the tale."
Now when I told Danny we couldn't get your ring back... he took it upon himself to go back to the strip club and get it from Trent.
"But when he got there,"
Trent and Kevin were so nervous because there was some big league stripper scouts there from the biggest area in the world.
"That's right, Will, Tampa."
You know about this Will.
I know you.
I seen you at the club.
"Now the problem was that they didn't have a third dancer, and what happened next, oh, is gonna go down in male stripper history."
Wow.
"Guys, if we die tonight, I just want the world to know we died doing what we love."
Yeah.
"I don't really want the world or anyone to ever know that I was here, but."
You lost him?
!
"Forgive us, sir."
You are hired killers for heaven sakes!
How could you let him get away?
"Yi Soon-shin, that weasel slipped away..."
But there's only one place he could've gone.
Who is it?
Who is it?
What happened?
"My lady, we must quickly move him inside!"
Father...
"I do not know what happened, so I brought him here away from the eyes of the others."
You did the smart thing.
Gatekeeper!
"What brings you here at this late hour, Baron?"
"Forgive me, sir."
I have reasons to believe that a thief that broke into my house tonight is hiding in this house.
You've been misinformed.
No one entered my house tonight.
It's possible that he is hiding here without your knowledge.
"I hate to impose, but please allow me to take a look around."
This will be my last and only request.
Very well.
As you wish.
This is my daughter's room.
Please allow us to take a look.
Even the father is careful about entering a maiden's room.
Don't you know the customs of the nobility?
"But sir, I am acting on a testimony of a witness."
I must assume that the thief is in that room if you tell me to leave.
- Come in.
"From the information I see, they already received money for food."
Why are they still saying they're starving?
How is it possible?
"They probably spent the money somewhere else, that's why they're saying they're hungry."
"The children say they do not want to be treated as beggars, so they don't want to take it."
Children these days really like to lie.
Don't be fooled.
"There are many children like this, who lie and instead spend their money at the internet café."
What if it is you?
"If it was you, would you choose to starve or to play games?"
What?
!
You!
Who are you?
What are you doing?
You... you!
Me?
I hate seeing children go hungry.
The people have paid so much taxes.
I want to know why children are still starving.
That... what is that?
Are you implying that I pocketed the money?
I'm not sure who is lying.
This is really strange.
I said that you're the one.
"No matter what, please get them corrected after your confirmation."
I need to use the restroom.

"If you betray me, you must give up your political dream."
So you can't betray me.
You must properly punish Lee Kyeong Wan.
Who are you?
What the fuck is all this?
"So he invited Cho over, killed him, put the body in a sack, dragged it to his house, and then killed his wife?"
Crime of passion.
Make sure you photograph everything.
"Here, there, that stuff over there."
Jong-gu!
Get over here!
"Sergeant, come over here."
Shit!
Oh god...
That cocksucker.
What kind of twisted freak is he?
"Is that scary, or what?"
"Scary, my ass."
"Anyway, the whole town's talking about it."
Who told you that story?
Byeong-gyu.
That goddamned bastard...
"Now he's spreading those stories to you, too?"
"Well, from what I hear, there's definitely something off with that guy."
Like what?
"The corner store owner went crazy,"
"The guy at the mill dropped dead, and then Heung-gu turns up dead two days ago."
So?
All this happened after that Japanese man arrived.
"Quit talking out of your ass, you ignorant dope."
Who're you calling ignorant?
"Look, the test results on Heung-guk came back today."
"Apparently, he ate some fucked-up mushrooms."
What?
You know.
The ones with the drugs that make you go crazy.
- Classic?
"Yeah, I have the money to spend on the really nice stuff, so I don't need to wear things that you bought at a garage sale for a dollar."
So you're still mad at me?
I don't need you to tell me that I should hire a nanny because I'm incompetent with your child.
- I never said that.
- You implied it.
It was your tone.
It was judgmental and... superior.
"If I said something that you took too personally,"
- I am sorry.
- That's the tone I'm talking about.
You know what?
"Can we please, please, please just go to the concert?"
We can argue in the car.
It's what Dave and I do.
you know this is... a work for me tonight.
Thank you.
"Since we're winding down with the game... oh, I didn't get you... the bow and everything."
"""Tin men"" and ""Avalon."""
"It's the rest of the ""Diner"" trilogy."
"Yeah, I know exactly what it is."
And this madness between us is a curse...
I don't wanna fight.
- I don't wanna fight either.
- Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am sensitive because...
I don't know much about babies.
"Every time I hold one, they start crying."
"I mean, it's like they...can sense my fear."
It's not gonna be that way with your own baby.
I swear.
You'll be amazed.
Thank you.
"Thank you, Dr. Masters."
Yeah.
And now I've kept you here so late.
You must be starving.
There's still-- there's still Chinese in the fridge.
How about I make you a plate?
You probably shouldn't let yourself in here anymore.
Sorry.
"Uh, I can leave my key if you want."
"What are you doing here, Libby?"
"It was my day on the meal rotation, and I thought you might like some braised chicken."
"But maybe I shouldn't be so presumptuous, reading your mind about what you... might want."
"Well, what do you want?"
You.
You were right.
I am-
- I am so sick of pretending all the time.
This is where I want to be.
I don't tell people that-- what a mess everything was when I was growing up.
"Well, a sad childhood is not something people often discuss."
I won't even tell my boyfriends.
"Although some of mine, they actually ended up being like my father."
That's a--
A common phenomenon.
I even felt it a bit when you were angry with me just then.
Felt it?
It made me... drawn to you.
"Well, you know, it's good that you can catch yourself now when you see those patterns repeating."
And it's good I have someone I can talk to about it.
Yes.
"That's good, too."
Why should I wanna rise above it?
Because its standards are low.
Its people spend their time trying to drag each other down.
I don't want to be perfect.
I don't want to live in a test tube.
"I just want to be me, and have some fun, and have some friends."
I'd rather be liked than be perfect.
"By liked, you mean being pawed by an animal with one thing on his mind."
Don't make it sound like that.
"Everything has to be learned, even kissing."
And sex?
Is that what you're going to practice at your next party?
You keep trying to accuse me of things I'm not even thinking about.
I don't want you to get a reputation for a half-hour's carelessness.
I already have one.
The wrong kind.
"I want you to fall in love and at the proper time, to marry a man who respects you."
I want you to have a good name.
I want...
You want!
You want!
You want!
Is that all you can say?
"Well, if any man would ask me, I'd run away and become his mistress."
Don't you ever let me hear you say a thing like that again!
I don't know why I said it.
I don't know why I said it.
Allison.
"Hello, Trudy."
"- Hello, Allison."
"- Hello, Joey."
- Selena'll be out in a couple minutes.
It was my workplace went sour.
I was leaving Betty's Bees.
Did you tell Dusty you were leaving?
"If I told him, he would worry and ask a lot of questions and then I'd have to lie about sabotaging Betty's Bees."
- Why did you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- Why?
Because Betty had it coming.
Intention was to quit before I got caught.
- Who caught you?
- I couldn't see his face.
Or her face.
All the lights went out one by one and then there was a terrible hum.
"Then, out of the darkness, it came for me."
"It spit something, and then a swarm of bees attacked."
I tried to get a good look at it but the bees were already stinging my eyes.
That's terrifying.
That's terrifying.
"Oh, sorry."
Five seconds.
- How'd you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- Any last wishes?
- Only that Dusty not be alone.
Yeah.
- How'd you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- With a lot of might...
That's nice.
"We don't know what she was doing, but we do know it took a lot of effort."
Do you hear something?
- Is she still breathing?
- That's not breathing.
I told you not to turn her over.
Could that have happened to me on the roof?
"Oh, Alice"
"Oh, Alice"
Oh!
"Oh, how will you find your way?"
"Oh, how will you find your way?"
No time for tears today No time for tears today
No time for tears today No time for tears today
"So many doors, how did you choose?"
"So much to gain, so much to lose"
So many things got in your way
"No time today, no time today"
Be careful not to lose your head
Remember what the dormouse said
Alice!
Did someone pull you by the hand?
How many miles to Wonderland?
Please tell us so we'll understand
"Alice, Alice, oh, Alice"
"Oh, how will you find your way?"
"Oh, how will you find your way?"

you haveNfinally lost your senses.
This venture is impossible.
the only wayNto achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible.
That kind of thinking could ruin you.
I'm willing to take that chance.
Jakarta...
The nightmare again?
I won't be long. then I see strange creatures.
What kind of creatures?
a smiling cat.
"Hello, dear."
Are you all right?
"This is a terrible, terrible time for us, Michelangelo."
"Actually, I'm really not sure that you should still be here."
Poor Dorothy.
Poor Bonnie.
Even if she was a little difficult...
Well...
"She made the people in the backroom suffer, you see, at her fittings."
"The lateness, the screaming, the insults."
"She insulted me, too, often enough."
She had to have this and she had to have that.
Whatever you did was wrong.
"Whatever you paid her, it wasn't enough."
It was a nightmare.
"Of course, it was galling to think that in one day, a so-called day, she earned more than some workers earn in six months or even a year."
"It doesn't seem fair, does it?"
"Well, but then there she was the next day on the front pages."
"You know, dear, my father, he started this business from nothing."
My mother worked all hours.
They both did.
And I was their only child.
I wanted to go to law school.
I wanted to be a politician.
I wanted to change the world.
But how could I let them down?
I couldn't do that.
And now it all seems irrelevant.
Bonnie's family are flying in.
The whole thing is unbearable.
I can't even bear to talk about it.
Not even to you.
I don't want to be up all goddamn night.
- It's decaf.
- Better be.
"Nobody has a secret plan to caffeinate you, Cash."
- I do.
- Forget it.
I can't trust none of yous.
"Hey, mousse, how you doing?"
- You okay?
"- Yeah, I'm okay."
"Listen, mousse, you know, I don't go in for much emotion."
"I just wanted to say, for what it's worth, that your dad is a good man."
"You know, he served his community, saved a lot of people..."
Yeah.
"And you turned out all right, didn't you?"
"You know, I think if this is his time, he can walk toward the light with his head held up high."
"Small comfort, I know, but..."
"Thanks, Cash."
I appreciate it.
"But I got to tell you, I never really got that ""walk towards the light"" business."
Many people who have had near-death experiences have reported seeing...
I know what they say.
I'm just saying I don't get it.
"Folks find the idea comforting, John."
- I know I do.
- I don't.
"Maybe I'm a distrustful bastard, but how do we know what's beyond that light?"
"Okay, John."
Maybe that light's leading somewhere you don't want to go.
How do you know it's not hell?
"The light for hell would be red, obviously."
"Would it, Stats?"
- More of a fight.
She beat me senseless.
That must have taken at least ten seconds.
"15 seconds, actually."
"We're about to be sent to Devil's Island,"
Tarby's coming for an important dinner party and you're babbling on about your insane mother.
We're up plop creek with no loo brush.
- I'll telephone my agent.
"- Good idea, let's blame him."
Yeah.
"Hey, what if he won't take the rap?"
"Say we'll go to the papes about his ""children's catalogue""."
Nice thinking.
"Hello, Filthy?"
"God bless, look after Mum, drive safely."
"Listen, you filthy, evil porno merchant, me and Eddie are in trouble."
"Unless you take the blame, we'll tell the world the truth about your ""stage school""."
"Please, daughter, please."
Please.
"Listen, I am not a well man."
"This morning, I coughed so hard I sucked my trousers up my backside."
"Now, listen, Richie."
Nobody needs to take the rap for this.
What you have got to get yourself is an alibi.
"Don't shout, daughter."
There's only so much an agent can take after only one bottle of aspirin.
"Now, look, alibis are easy."
"You're a comic, right?"
"Well, loosely speaking, of course."
Yeah.
You were doing a show.
"No, no, that's easy."
Do you know how many married men hit on me in a week?
No tell us.
I don't really know the exact number but it's figgin high.
At least this is what I tell myself.
Come on guys let's go.
All I know for certain is that dating in this city sucks and I'm dying.
Thank you.
"I'm serious, I'm done."
You guys don't hate me but I might pass on going out tonight.
What?
"No, no you are going."
You just got out of a crappy relationship and you are single.
Plus you our designated driver.
Thanks a lot for the guilt.
Going out in LA isn't quite like it is in any other city.
Because of the whole who's who factor... that this place evolves around.
So unless you're an A List B List or C List celebrity... work in the A List... arena or you're a friend of the club Jonathan slash door Nazi then... yeah it's pretty much impossible to get in.
Bottom line there are three major questions in Hollywood.
Who are you?
What do you do?
And who are your friends?
If you are not on the list leave.
"Oh, honey not in my club."
Natural hair colors only.
Anthony!
"Oh, hi."
Of course come on in.
"Great, Jonathan's working the door."
"Sorry, ladies, we're full."
Seven really?
You want in my club?
I texted you three times last three three times!
They did it by mail.
- Mail?
-That's right.
"Little love notes between our security officer and von Scherbach with Schulz, the mailman."
Here's the flag.
They used to put a loop in the cord.
Did you ever notice?
And here's the mailboxes.
Hollow black queens.
"Cute, huh?"
"They delivered the mail or picked it up when we were out of the barracks, like for appell."
"And when there was a special delivery they'd pull a phony air raid to get us out like last night, for instance."
There wasn't a plane in the sky.
"Or was there, Price?"
"Brother, were we all wet about you."
Forget it.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you know?
Because I got my own ideas.
Let's have that civilian stuff.
"I'll look pretty stupid in this, yodeling my way across the alps."
"Now, let's have the wire cutters."
- You taking Dunbar?
-You betcha.
There ought to be some reward money from mama.
"Say about 10,000 bucks worth."
"I told you boys, I'm no escape artist."
"For the first time, I like the odds, because now I got me a decoy."
- What's the decoy?
-Price.
When I go I want you to give me five minutes.
Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank.
How do you know that?
She spoke of them.
Of their games.
A song they'd sing to calm her to sleep.
"Sometimes, I'd hear her sing it softly, to herself."
How lonely.
And haunting.
Yes.
I'm going to tell you something that might enrage you.
"Since mary's arrival, I've had visions of francis's death."
Violent images.
"They vary, but they were always tied to mary."
But they stopped completely when clarissa died.
"I have beckoned them, every way I know how,"
Because I had to be sure.
Sure of what?
That francis might live with mary.
How can that be possible?
"I warned you that francis, your firstborn,"
Would die because of mary...
You were very clear.
...Before either of us knew clarissa was your firstborn.
"The blood that has been spilled,"
"My blood yet,"
Was because of what you foresaw.
"It's not a science, it's a gift."
"Sometimes I hear voices, other times it's a feeling,"
A certainty as solid as stone.
And this new feeling?
It came to me today.
"I saw their life together, and it is happy."
"After dinner, and your usual game of catch with anne,"
So you've thought about where you'll put everything?
Like the interior design?
Yes.
"Yes, I have, Peter."
If this was the kitchen...
I'd like there to be a little nook right over there by the window.
Like the booth of a restaurant.
And there'd be an island right where the light is hanging... and the island would have the stove in it... and a countertop on one side with tall stools under it.
My daughter would sit on a stool... so I could talk to her while I was making dinner or lunch.
What would you say to her?
I'd say...
"""Hi, baby girl."
"You are a precious treasure."""
"I'd live up there, if I could."
If there wasn't gravity.
Yeah.
But if you lived up there... then all this stuff... all this stuff in my room... would fall down on you and crush you... and you'd die.
Ellen would have been so proud of you.
"Isn't it amazing, Ellen?"
Yes.
I'm so glad you took me here.
It was a whole civilization.
Two Mayan people in love... probably stood right where we're standing now and thought...
"""Look what we have built together."""
"And now they're gone, and so is the city."
And there's just... us.
I am done.
That was great.
- Eldercab.
- Hi.
- I'm feeling too old to drive.
- Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Just came by 'cause I need a little favor.
None of your favors are little.
"Okay, you know what?"
I'm done flirting.
I'm not in the mood.
"I got to get in touch with that guy you told me about, the smuggler -- Schmidt was his name."
The guy you said could move anything or anybody.
Why do I tell you things?
Why?
"'Cause I think deep down, you like me."
No.
"No, that's not it."
"Okay, look, the point is, we got to get out of town with fresh I.D.s, okay -- someplace warm, with decent beer."
That's why we need Schmidt.
"W-well, I'm sorry."
"Your timing sucks, okay?"
Schmidt's in hiding.
He's in some sort of trouble.
"No cell, no e-mail, no nothing."
"You know, it's funny -- I bet the guy who builds his computer systems could find him."
"Say, wasn't that you, Dixon?"
Even if I could -- and I'm not saying that I can -- there is zero chance that he'll talk to you.
"All right, Dixon."
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
Really appreciate it.
"But, you know, before I go, I thought I would just say"
I think it's great that a company like this would hire a convicted hacker!
Should I go on?
Shh.
"How about the Navy, when they almost court-martialed you for stealing the skipper's porn collection?"
It's just... it's never gonna end until we stop her.
"Look, Bastion employs 130 people."
I can't endanger their livelihoods if I can fix this in one night.
Right.
You're right.
"If she wants you to help her organize and find a location, that's a small price to pay."
When's the last time we did it in front of the mirror?
Grace... she didn't just come over to talk about the location.
Her name is Audrey.
She's going to be my date.
She's beautiful.
I'm sure you'll show her a good time.
You gonna jump?
Oh!
"You know, with my luck,"
I'd end up surviving the fall and end up eating my food through a straw the rest of my life.
You sure you should be smoking?
You just got out of the hospital.
Are you freaking kidding me?
A heart attack would be fantastic right about now.
Can I turn this off?
"Look, everything's going to be fine, Victor."
I just need you to show me every illegal transaction that you've made.
"I promise you, it will only stay between us."
Are you wearing a wire?
Huh?
What the hell is the matter with you?
"You're with them, aren't you?"
The SEC.
They got you to cooperate.
"Victor, I'm here to help."
All right?
It's not so bad.
The Gagnon Nursery is full of Kings just like it.
Kings just like it?
She loved dogs...
especially coIIies.
They were all named King.
"When the Iast one died in the spring, she didn't replace him."
"She said, she could go anytime, and the family would have enough to care for polo never mind a dog."
So she bought a little plaster negro.
"Her "" little King""."
Poor old lady.
She was totally lost.
She kept asking:
"What do we do, Bertrand?"
We can't call the cops just for that.
I Iooked at him:
"maybe not call the cops... but still, you can't smash everything you find ugly."
"while we were wondering,"
polo decided to taste the nigger.
He does that with strangers.
"He goes up to them, he smells them, and sometimes even licks them."
And how did the kid react?
Of course we all feel weird the first time.
He was no different.
He started smiling.
It was the only time we saw him smile.
She went to get him and said:
"Forgive him, he means no wrong."
It always upset her when it happened.
She would always say the same thing:
"polo, come on, we don't do that."
"You can look at them, you can smell them."
No.
I am crazy.
Alexander Leek.
- Who the hell are you?
-John Klein.
I called you last week.
Do you know what that is?
Stay away.
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.
Where are they seeing it?
"Point Pleasant, West Virginia."
You can help me.
Follow me.
"""The nocturnal butterfly."""
"In ancient cultures, the moth represents a form of the psyche... or the soul... immortally trapped..."
in the hellish death realms.
Mothman.
That's what the Ukranians called him.
"Rough translation, of course."
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl the year the nuclear plantwent down.
"Galveston, 1969, just before the hurricane."
They saw it.
But seeing isn't always believing.
"Look, there's never been a single shred of evidence... to show that these things exist materially."
So you're telling me these things do not exist?
"Oh, they exist."
All kinds of things exist around us that we never see.
"Electricity microwaves, infrared waves."
"You know, these things have been around forever."
They show up in cave paintings.
They're a normal condition ofthe planet.
"When John McGarrett was investigating his wife's murder, he found a lot of evidence, bits and pieces."
Not all of it made sense to him at the time.
You recognize those numbers?
Can't say that I do.
It's an offshore account.
CIA used it to fund black ops.
"If I gave those numbers to a reporter friend of mine and he started digging, who knows what he might come up with."
Or how high it goes.
What do you want?
Doris McGarrett.
I need a location and a phone number.
"Take my advice, Joe, and just walk away."
This one's too hot.
"Steve McGarrett wants answers, Sam."
He's not gonna quit till he gets them.
I'll tell you what.
Because we're friends...
I'll give you the information you want on Doris.
You can decide how much of it you want to share with her persistent son.
It may be the better part of valor to keep him in the dark... once you hear what I have to say.

I must happen through the clinic.
Tomorrow Ciotti will visit in a moment.
"Ciotti, Ciotti."
You are engaged with him or me?
"Laura, you are a girl."
You do not understand it?
"If profit to enter in the clinic of Ciotti, you know what means for me?"
"Yes, that you have the resolute life."
You have often said it to me?
and I?
"Laura, listens, first of everything, I will say to you that..."
Help.
The new car has been stolen.
No longer it is.
It is not...
Where it is?
I want a x-ray of those of kidneys of that old man that is on the verge of dying.
To thus I will operate him immediately.
Also we must make the analyses of the 22...
"It excuses the delay, but I have had to happen by the deposit to gather the car, it already includes/understands to me, the crane had taken to it and..."
What wants that they concern his subjects to me?
It seems to me just.
To where we go?
"Oh, the one of the hemorroides?"
how is everything?
"-Professor, hurts eggs to me."
-Those are cut easily.
"-No, I need still them."
-In the other world.
"Oh, dear Sandokan?"
how is everything?
Badly.
Tell me where you saw him.
"On a slab in the morgue, burned to a crisp."
I think we'd better sit down.
Her whole body had gone soft when I slugged her with it.
"But I kept thinking, she has to know something."
Take a couple of deep drags.
Thanks.
I won't do that again.
Tell me what happened.
"Please, I promise--"
"You're not feeling ill, Mrs. Chandler?"
"No, I feel fine, thanks."
It isn't often we have the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Chandler dance.
"Mr. Murdock, this is Mr. Martinelli, who owns all this."
Mr. Murdock's an old f riend.
Any f riend of Mrs. Chandler's is welcome.
I'm af raid i don't sing.
Perhaps you'd like to try a little roulette.
"It's not wise to tell you, but the house is having a streak of bad luck."
Mrs. Chandler doesn't feel like gambling.
"Oh, I'm all right, really I am."
I'd like to.
"You too, sir?"
I'll just watch.
Roulette wheels have a way of running over me.
I was walking into something.
"We were going to gamble, win or lose."
"He hadn't asked her to, he'd told her she had to. lt was an order, but why?"
I didn't like the feeling I had about her.
The way I wanted to put my hand on her arm.
The way I kept smelling that jasmine in her hair.
The way I kept hearing that song she'd sung.
- Pete?
"- Yeah, this was cold."
- This is pretty rough.
- I can see the rosiness...
- I almost didn't give you my jacket.
"- Yeah, just to be a douche."
- Just because I was so cold.
"- I thought you would have to have some major, like, Lord of the Rings CGI on my nipples because it was..."
It was like...
Nipples isn't PG-13.
They were like...
I got to the point where I couldn't feel my extremities.
"I mean, it was so cold."
"I was in a damn T-shirt, you know?"
T-shirt.
"In Lord of the Rings, are they known for their nipple CGI?"
Yes.
What do you think?
Of course.
"Oh, awkward pause."
Anyway...
"That jacket, by the way, the jacket that I put on you which is a jacket that we actually wore in like..."
"It kind of provided a bit of warmth, but not as much as you'd think."
"- No, it was like..."
- Like a thin cotton.
- It was like wearing a plastic bag.
- Yeah.
"Actually, wearing a plastic bag would've been warmer."
Look at all this.
"Okay, so let's talk about..."
- Tension.
"- The time where they had to stop the van short and I flew back and I, like, landed on my bad wrist that I had a minor surgery and stuff on in the exact spot, like on a metal drum pole."
- Is that not okay?
"- It is, but I might have a date."
"Well, what do you want me to do?"
Should I cancel our trip so you can go on the date you might have?
"No, obviously you should go."
- What's that sound?
"- I don't know, Rob."
- You should be in bed.
- Mom?
That always happens at this time.
You just were never up this early.
"It's the lights, Robby."
See these street lights?
They're run by a big computer that tells them when to go on and off.
That's what that sound is.
"So, forthe purpose of this role-play, Shamus is holding a grenade."
"The juice is a grenade, so the worst thing we can do is act afraid."
"Because Shamus is already scared, and he's taking his cues from us."
We will want to exit in an orderly fashion... telling Shamus with our actions... that he cannot get our attention in this inappropriate manner.
Hey.
Hi.
"So, do you have anything new in the chest?"
"You know, the hope chest?"
- What's the hope chest?
- It's... nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ellen broke up with me.
What?
Why?
She thinks she's gonna die this week.
No.
"Out of everyone at Saint Tod, she is the least likely person to die."
That was pretty good.
"- I will shoot you, Sherbert."
"- All right, fine, I will put down my weapon, but you have to promise me you will not let this man go."
"- Okay, well, we're gonna cuff everyone, and then we're gonna sort this all out."
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, thanks, Sheriff."
- No!
- Now let's me and you take a little walk.
- Ooh.
"- How do you think you're getting out of this, Figgis?"
Do you even have a plan?
- I'm gonna hold you hostage to get away.
"Then I'm gonna drive to a gas station where I'll steal a clean car and head for the airport, where I'll buy a ticket with my false ID, then kill you in the parking lot and disappear again."
- Pfft.
You're scrambling.
"- Look, I told you, we're NYPD."
"- Yeah, right."
- I can prove it.
"Look up ""Brooklyn detective attacked by birds."""
You'll see an article with a photo of me.
-Officerdown.
Allavailableunitsrespond.
"- I'm gonna give you a window, and you're gonna go after Jake."
"My name is Detective Rosa Diaz, NYPD."
- Get back.
- I'm reaching for my badge.
- Keep walking.
- Let him go.
"- Put that gun down, or he dies."
- He's not gonna shoot me.
He needs me alive to get out of here.
"- Yeah, you willing to take that bet?"
"Mother, it's 8:00."
We have a rehearsal in Tokyo today.
We know about your rehearsal.
Go right ahead.
Mother.
"You met Takehara, didn't you?"
"Yes, I did."
Is he doing well?
"Yes, he is."
You seem to be meeting him often.
Is there something going on?
"I had to talk to him about selling the ""Hana."""
You have to talk with him about that?
He used to rent it out.
That's kind of a strange way to do things.
Why do you have to ask him for permission?
I'm not.
"Ah, so you're not finished with him."
Is that what it is?
I have to go.
"Mother, it's funny but don't you think that there was more peace in the house during the war."
"Yes, I think so."
"Back then, everyone got along, and it wasn't like it is now with everyone going their separate ways."
Perhaps it's my fault.
We didn't worry about unnecessary things back then.
That's true.
It was because our freedom was taken away from us.
"If it hadn't been for the war, you would be in England or France dancing at a ballet school."
"Yes, that's right."
And I might have gone with you.
The war delayed my studies.
"If it hadn't been for the war, even if I had kept studying with you, I might be teaching my own children now."
That the charge of treason was dropped almost immediately?
It's a start.
"Before the war, I served under a general."
We traveled a great deal.
We were in budapest when I met anna.
She worked in a hotel tailor shop...
Sold me the most beautiful tie.
"And then the war broke out, and things became..."
Difficult.
She was jewish.
"Still is, I'm happy to say."
"The general carried several letters of transit in his safe,"
"Any one of which would have ensured her safety,"
But he refused to sign.
You forged his name.
Hence the dishonorable discharge.
It was filing the papers that sunk me.
I was arrested in the middle of whitehall.
Hmm.
On a Tuesday.
How did anna get out?
The same way I avoided the noose.
Howard?
"Mr. Stark had unfinished business with the general,"
And he and I had always got along.
"When he heard of my predicament, he..."
Used his influence.
Sounds like a story.
"Another time, perhaps."
"Anna obviously knows what howard did for you,"
But she doesn't know what you do for him?
"Not recently, no."
"No, not really, I suppose."
But I have made a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in The Ritual.
You would want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
It might be best to have a man with experience.
Someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
"I understand, Your Excellency."
Let's see who's around.
"In the meantime, I'll call you as soon as I know."
"Thank you, Your Excellency."
"Well, he does know the background."
I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist.
"There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway."
What about the exorcist?
Have you any ideas?
How about Lankester Merrin?
I had a notion he was in Iraq.
I read he was working on a dig near Nineveh.
"You're right, but he's finished."
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.
"What's he doing there, teaching?"
He's working on another book.
"Don't you think he's too old, Tom?"
How's his health?
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.
"-Besides, he's had experience."
-I didn't know that.
"Ten, 1 2 years ago, I think, in Africa."
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.
You keep struggling through the years.
Then a day comes and you find yourself locked outside the door.
Thank you!
Sorry for the trouble.
"You know, Mert has been in school for a long time and he still hasn't graduated."
"Do you, or his father, ever talk to him about this matter?"
He doesn't have a father.
We're separated.
"No matter how much you care, guys are guys."
Aren't they all the same?
"One day, he just left us..."
Mert was 11 years old when he left.
Didn't he ever call his son after that?
Never.
We started a life with Mert.
Just like a friend...
"Look at Mrs. Guler, she's never had a happy day."
"Just when she brought her son up, this is what happened."
"Having a mother like you, why did Mert turn out to be like this?"
Mert isn't the child you think he is.
He just wanted to work.
He said the streets are filled with unemployed people and wanted to start... earning money as soon as possible.
Does he work?
Yes.
"But he's studying really hard now, he's back in school."
He'll enter the selection exam too.
He doesn't want to hurt me anymore.
I think my illness played a big role in that.
What did the doctors say?
I hope it's nothing serious?
"The doctors have said she'd be alright, but..."
I have cancer.
"We boys go, but girls go as well, but it's the first time that..."
"Marcel, you never laugh."
I never laugh?
"You don't know... I don't know you, but it seemed to me... I laugh so much that I've paid for it."
Why?
Some teachers don't like it.
"Even so, you seemed sad to me."
I'm like that too. I find it hard to get to know people.
One for six.
"- For how much have you, please?"
"- For seven, six and five."
"- Two for six, please."
- They're sold out for today.
Then for seven.
They're all sold out.
Couldn't you manage it somehow?
Those two for six.
"I promised the teacher, but I came late."
"Wait here, I'm just going to get out of playing the trombone."
"Don't show yourself much near the cinema, mum teaches here, I've got tickets, we'll pop off to that cinema."
You're going to play the trombone now?
You enjoy playing?
"I took it up, it was for free, I could play."
Have you performed anywhere?
"On May Day, we gave a concert in a village."
So I'm going to get it over and done with.
"All right, I'll wait for you."
Careful!
"The same melody is repeated half way through, but the first time it's piano, and the second time...?"
- Mezzo-forte.
- And which is louder?
Mezzo-forte.
"This is in Corsica, it's a man whom I loved very much."
I photographed him in a field...
Which he owned in a certain way...
It's land that...
That was his heritage from his uncle in Corsica.
It's a picture taken 5 or 6 years ago.
I particularly like the sun in the tree over here.
"And this man, standing straight in front of the tree."
I took it because that's kind of his empire.
"When seeing him there, I told myself that..."
"That this land is his own, and he's standing there..."
"I've always envied that - people who have a land, a place..."
A belonging.
I've never had that...
"I also loved him for this, actually..."
Therefore it's a sentimental picture.
"That's why you took it, because he was there..."
"Well no, there's no real explanation for this..."
It's just a sentimental picture...
All pictures are sentimental.
What do you think about it?
I don't know.
You never know.
Never mind.
It's in London.
That's more recent.
It's in a pub in London.
"In the day, we were having lunch."
A very British pub.
I really like pubs.
Their... sort of darkness...
At that time I didn't photograph myself yet...
"Well, too bad."
"We need data to fight ""Exceptions,"""
so quit complaining!
"""Exceptions""?"
What's that?
Remember it's the general term for all enemies from space?
Whatever...
"They're just a bunch of space robot monsters, right?"
"Oh, you..."
Who cares?
What I wanna know is why I'm out here alone!
?
Where's Kuya?
What's he doing?
Flail and Burst are currently getting a tune-up.
"It wouldn't have killed them to come up with a more creative new weapon, you know."
Tell that to the Development Department.
Who?
I've never been there nor met anyone from there!
Neither have I. It's a highly confidential department.
I hear only the Commander and Vice Commander have come in direct contact with them.
"If they can't trust us, who can they trust?"
All clear.
This just in from Slain.
It's currently flying 200 km off the waters of Futagami Island.
"Visibility is poor, but nothing is being picked up on the sensor."
"Eyeball sensors No. 12 to 29, no movement detected."
"Sorry, I'm late."
Be careful now.
Yes.
Just as I thought...
There are too many factors that cannot be analyzed.
"""Said they didn't know when he'd be in,"
"""and I was wondering"
"""if anybody here had any idea where he would be."""
A man on a routine check...
STAGEHAND:
"Your chair, sir."
...just asks for Mr. Daley.
Thank you.
(CHUCKLING)
"Well, you're absolutely amazing, sir."
You're right.
And here I thought you were in shock.
"No, you didn't."
You thought I was confused.
Perhaps scared.
And probably playing for time.
Amazing.
What makes you think her murder was premeditated?
"The usual thing, sir."
"Little facts that plain don't fit, you know, sir."
"Anything I hate, it's one of those little facts."
"Doesrt ever seem to matter how small it is, either, sir."
It could be this big.
Like he left the credit cards behind.
"I mean, why does a street robber grab money from a wallet and leave the credit cards?"
They're won'th a pretty good piece of change on the black market.
"You see what I mean, sir?"
Credit cards.
What else?
"Oh, there was an alligator bag."
A diamond ring.
"I doubt very much if a robber in a hurry, on the edge of panic, is gonna take the time to pull the ring off of Claire's finger."
Huh?
How 'bout Yale?
Collateral damage.
Acceptable losses when you consider that with interest there's over twenty million in Kozlenko's account right now.
"Aw, c'mon partner, just think what we could do with that money."
"You been planning this for a long time, huh?"
Nah.
"You know, you got out when you should."
I stayed too long.
"I got bounced around, passed over."
"You know, the last time I really enjoyed the game was Berlin."
Right before the wall came down.
"So, you started thinking about the money."
"Yeah, checked some records."
It was forgotten about.
"I mean, c'mon, it's all sitting there, right there."
"I think I'm gonna follow your example, bro, and not share."
You are gonna tell me your code numbers and Marta's code numbers.
Oh.
"Oh I know you way too well, partner."
Yeah?
Yeah.
You're not gonna shoot me.
You couldn't pull the trigger.
You're right.
The only thing I'm gonna regret is that you won't remember what an asshole you've become.
I wonder what two shots would do?
"So, how did it go?"
Couldn't have been smoother.
They didn't ask any questions?
Transferred all the funds to a new account in the Cayman Islands.
Oh baby.
"Things didn't work out with Mark's dad, so, that was the end of that."
- Why didn't it work?
- Is there any more soup?
You were together and you got pregnant.
I didn't love him.
There was someone else before who...
"I also left him, even though he was the one who..."
"Well, it wasn't to be."
That's all right now.
I need to take this.
You can stay as long as you like.
And I'd also be happy to have a picture of...
"- Yes, what's up?"
- Why did you stop me?
Your Special Branch guy deserved to die.
You've seen what he's covered up.
Where is Emilie Zeuthen?
"I need your help, Luna'."
We know you didn't take her to Jutland.
Is she alive?
The book lists 12 black cars that day.
One of them picked up a little girl.
I need names and social security numbers on the 12.
I'll take care of the rest.
"No, give yourself up and give me Emilie, then I promise to solve the case."
I'll call tomorrow night to get the names and social security numbers.
I can't give you that.
Doesn't your daughter deserve for the case to be solved?
Your blood matches hers.
"I promise that her killer will be punished, but you need to give me Emilie."
I 'll get a copy of the car numbers in the morning and then I 'll start'.
OK?
We heard that you would spare our lives if we surrendered.
Please take us in.
I heard that you are Manwol pirates.
Is that true?
Yes.
Do you know the whereabouts of Yum Moon?
"I saw him in Yongeum, but I haven't seen him since."
How can we trust you?
"It's the head of Yong-su, the leader of the Manwol pirates."
"He refused our plea to surrender, and tried to go under the command of Head Chief Yum Moon."
It is a head.
We will take you in.
But you will not be freed until the remaining pirates are wiped out.
- Do you accept those terms?
"- Yes, sir."
We will attack Chunghae now.
We must kill Jang Bogo and his security officers to avenge the master's death.
Go to battle!
To battle!
ANGELS IN FAST MOTION
I'm a pusher frau from Jutland.
I'm having my period.
"It gives me a stomach-ache, and I feel nauseous."
I've got 1800 grams of hashish taped to my body   and then this happens...!
Asger had said there'd be no police.
He promised me there'd be no police.
It never went wrong before.
First I take the train to Copenhagen and then on to Christiania to get the stuff from our dealer.
- How are things in Jutland?
- Okay.
And here?
Love is getting kindled...
Sight is going beyond the eyes.
"(Are you) The flower of inner sun, or my penance?"
Is this love or enemity?
"Hey, love has become my eyes..."
And is withholding your beauty.
Your fragrance has become my way
And brings me closer to you.
A storm is galloping like a horse...
And my heart has climbed aboard and vanished.
Even robbery becomes just...
When my wish steals you away.
Where is your father?
Has he absconded?
He isn't picking my calls.
He can't run away from us.
If he doesn't meet us tomorrow
Things may turn ugly.
"- Who's that, Deepa?"
Someone I know.
"Any problem, Deepa?"
No.
Nothing.
"Are you the woman past desires, The one ruling all my desires?"
Are you the one to rope the moon in your forehead?
"You became the enchanted forest in one single flower, my lady"
Are you the one to pour nectar on that day?
The thought of you approaches me and burns my soul.
I lost my loneliness.
I lost myself in your thoughts.
You are my companion.
I like Varun a lot.
"Well, I only have the one, and right now, he's putting a tv in my bedroom."
It's cute.
"At my place, he sat next to my computer."
"Oh, well, here he'll live in the garage."
Do you like that?
He does like that.
The garage?
This guy is a hall of famer and won 20 games six years in a row.
This is not the actual guy.
Fine.
Sure seems like a lot of my stuff's being relegated to the garage.
"All right, I'll find a place for this little fella."
"Great, and since you're loosening the reins on the sports memorabilia, let's find a spot for this ebay treasure."
"Gosh, we're running tight on wall space."
"Uh, what about downstairs bathroom?"
Fergie Jenkins in the garage?
Gale Sayers in the crapper?
"I don't think you're really from Chicago, lady."
"Well, I know that this is tough, but come here."
But it's just temporary.
"Soon we'll have our own place that's not mine, not yours, but ours."
I guess.
"And we'll have so much room, you'll be able to have your own den."
Really?
"Oh, yeah."
You can put all your stuff in there.
"That'll be cool, right?"
Like a man cave.
Exactly.
Can I smoke cigars in my man cave?
I don't really see it having a window.
"Wait, it's not gonna be an actual cave, is it?"
"It means that Mother Kali, with all her arms outstretched... hugs us to her bosom, welcoming us back as Thugs..."
Thugs awakened from a sleep... of 50 years.
Let the neophytes and their teachers draw near.
Where are the stranglers?
Give them their strangling cloths.
Give them their burial picks.
Swear by our Mother Kali... to be thrice faithful to her and to me and to our order... and to all of us.
"Rise, our new-made brothers."
Rise and kill.
"Kill, lest you be killed yourselves."
Kill for the love of killing.
Kill for the love of Kali.
Kill!
"It's them all right, Din, the whole blinking lot of them."
Very bad men.
The Colonel's got to know.
"You must get there, Din."
The Colonel's got to know.
The Colonel?
I run quick.
Since mighty roast beef is an Englishman's food
It accounts for the freedom that runs in his blood
For generous living Does it do all good
"Excuse me, mates."
"Oh, the roast beef of England And, oh, the old English roast beef"
"Sing us a song, will you?"
You're all under arrest.
The whole bunch of you.
"And you, too."
You know why?
Her Majesty's very touchy about having her subjects strangled.
I can't waste any more time.
"It depends on your definition of ""people,"""
and that's enough of a technicality to keep your lawyers dizzy for centuries.
"Take me to court, then, Doctor, and watch me smile and cry and flutter."
And creak?
And what?
"""Creak."" You're creaking."
What?
Ah!
I-I'm drying out.
"Oh, sweet heavens."
Moisturize me!
Moisturize me!
Where are my surgeons?
My lovely boys!
It's too hot!
You raised the temperature.
Have pity.
Moisturize me!
"Oh, oh, Doctor!"
Help her.
Everything has its time and everything dies.
I'm...too... young.
And I love how the Doctor's so callous with her.
"Like when Rose is like ""Aren't you going to save her?"""
"And he's just like ""Everything has an end."""
"Poof! ""Aah!"" Bits of liver flying out."
"Eccleston, as the Doctor, just kills her, you know?"
"Like, he doesn't have any problem with saying this is justice -- she has to die for being bad guy."
"The way that he deals with her, versus the way that the tenth Doctor will later deal with her really kind of speaks volumes about the difference between the two of them."
They just create fully grown human beings out of tissue samples.
"Hello, Dad."
You just get the sense that you shouldn't mess with her.
They're like d--dustbin lorries.
He goes round picking up every bit of rubbish he can lay his lobes on!
They're a lot nicer ears than many I've had to see to.
"Now, listen."
"As the person you're supposed to be engaged to,"
I don't much like this comparison of some of the things you've had to see to!
And I can well understand why!
"""And I can well understand why."""
"Granville, now listen."
Stand there.
"The minute Nurse Gladys Emanuel goes into her house, you're out again on the street."
"Oh, dear."
"Look, she's been caught by Mrs Pendlebury."
"Oh, dear!"
"She's a very peculiar sh--shape, is Mrs Pendlebury."
Can't be very convenient for Mr Pendlebury.
He often comes in here quite late of an evening for his six--pack of ale with a desperate look in his eye.
"She'll be there for half an hour, you mark my words."
"Ah, good."
A reprieve!
At last I've had a reprieve.
-
"- Not for long, Granville."
-
"- Oh, 'eck!"
Do I have to go out there?
They'll only laugh at me.
I know they'll only laugh.
"Come on, chin up!"
"You come from proud stock, lad."
"Waterloo, the B--Battle of Britain, the Glorious Double Gloucesters!"
"We are a stubborn race, when the chips are down."
"No, never it would make a thing thus, but it is precise that it comes with me."
That it goes where?
-To accompany.
-Where?
It does not touch to me.
"-The request, comes with me."
-To where I must accompany to him.
I will explain it.
In the ambulance there is a young person of only 20 years... in touch between the life and the death...
And what I can do?
It watches in what state is.
It sees it?
Here he is.?
How it goes?
poor.
"Yes, poor, is in evil been."
He is on the verge of dying.
And it knows which are the words that continue repeating in their delirium?
I love a woman.
Before dying... it would want the incommensurable one to please to see a woman.
"It is right, poor"
"He hears, you you would only have to do this:"
"to enter there, to open themselves just a little bit, to embosom a little to him the legs..."
But...
"Do it, will make a good karma and tomorrow all the angels of the sky will sing your name."
-Which is her name?
-Brígida Bonazzi.
Brígida Bonazzi.
"Yes, all the angels of the sky they will sing: ""Brígida Bonazzi,..."""
"Salt of there, salt of there."
"It enters there, enters there..."
Brígida Bonnazzi.
"So I figured someone cashes it in, you could look at the videotape."
There's our thief.
Yeah.
"Uh, could you excuse me for one moment?"
"Of course, there's no guarantee that the thief would turn it in himself."
You meeting us here is kind of a coincidence.
We were just discussing your case.
"That's a great detection idea, Howard, but I guess we feel like you've been inconvenienced enough."
"So, on behalf of the Montecito, allow me to pay you off on the bet."
- There you go.
There's eighteen hundred.
- Wow.
"And I'll just pull- 2,000."
Thanks.
I-I don't know what to say.
I will definitely recommend your hotel to everyone I know.
That's the guy I played poker with.
And our wallet thief.
And the guy who cost me 240 bucks.
Now it's personal.
Uh-oh.
Better tell the women and children to take cover.
Are you kidding me?
"Seriously, I.R.S. problems?"
Forget about it.
"The I.R.S. is like putty in my hands, honey."
"Really, no worry."
It's putty?
"Stan, what do you know about that guy Roger who played in your poker game the other night?"
"Uh, why don't you call me."
"Uh, not much, you know."
"And I'm really sorry about that whole situation, man, really."
"Left or right, Sir?"
Left.
"Your left or my left, Sir?"
"But sir I came thought here, there are two doors... shall I go through here or there?"
Where is he?
"Brother, Buy a underwear."
I don't want it.
"Buy a underwear, It's awesome."
"I said, I don't want it."
"Buy it, once you wear it you'll become superman."
"Wear it and fly, it won't rip off."
"Wear it and fight, it won't rip off."
"Wear it and climb Kutub Minar, it won't rip off."
Jump off the Kutub Minar your everything will be ripped off but the underwear will stay the same.
This is the guarantee of Laxminarayan.
But your voice will rip my brain off for sure.
Should I write it down?
I already have one.
You have one!
Then you should wear it.
How do you know that I'm not wearing underwear?
You know about my nature.
And this is Laxminarayan Three.
I can tell the topic of letter by looking at the envelope.
I can tell the size of the son by looking at the father.
Wow.
He's been selling undergarments since he didn't even wear undergarment.
He's made a undergarments factory.
Bulbul loungewear.
What is this?
Who are these slim girls?
"Dad, they are our brand models."
Have you checked out their movement?
They're still at the inn.
Will they return to BuYeo?
"If they know who we are, they will not mobilize the fleet so easily."
We will ambush them the moment they are about to leave Heng-In.
We must capture that rascal So Seo-No alive and bring her to me.
Is that understood?
"Yes, Commander."
Miss!
Miss!
What else is there to mull over?
All the workers don't wish to die before they return home.
Please give us the order to withdraw.
"Sa-Yong,"
"Yes, Miss."
"If father were here, what would he do?"
Chief isn't a reckless person.
You think that my frustration is an act of recklessness?
"Judging from our strength, we can't possibly hope to take them on."
We should flee from a battle that we cannot win.
"Actually, I... would have liked to brave the danger to reach Go-San Nation."
Miss!
Father wants to test my competence... through this expedition.
This I am aware of.
That's why I want to give it all I've got.
Please continue.
"But like what Uncle Gye-Pil said,"
I will not put the workers in danger just because of my selfishness.
Prepare to withdraw.
"Miss, I'm glad you said that."
"Hey,"
Just in time.
Still... we did a lot of good... especially considering we're down a man.
I'm proud of you.
"Yeah, but I didn't feel like we were down a man, though, the way everybody was pitching in."
It was kind of cool.
"Didn't get Gregorio fired, either."
As far as we know.
(Lasalle laughs)
"Well, we'll finally get back up to speed once Sebastian gets through training."
In the meantime... let's take the day off.
"Now, that works for me."
(chuckles)
"Man, I can just hear that firing range calling my name."
(chuckling):
Geez.
What about you?
I think you know.
Hey.
Think we have enough for an indictment?
"I'll let you know when I get back, but I doubt it."
We are still looking for the smoking gun to directly link Garcia to NOLA businesses.
New Orleans.
New Orleans.
"You really have changed since you've been down here, haven't you?"
How so?
You seem happier... which is a good thing.
"Not for us, maybe, but for you, definitely."
Maybe... you finally have stopped running.
I think so.
"Still, what are you gonna do for work?"
NCIS slot's already filled.
I don't know.
I was thinking I'd try talking Isler into transferring me here.
She's got the flu.
- Mm.
"- Yeah, she's got the flu and she didn't want to come, but I begged her."
Uh-huh.
"And she took this cold medicine, and it's knocking her out, but it--it's sweet, actually."
Now can we--or do I gotta keep pretending to enjoy this giant nut-covered ball of cream cheese
Olivia calls an appetizer?
You want me to represent you?
This is what's gonna happen.
You're gonna make an excuse up as to why you can't be at dinner tonight.
"You're gonna dump the broad, clean up your act, and never, ever come back to my house fucked up again."
You kicking your habit on your own?
That's a slim chance of happening.
"You two doing it together, zero."
That's my offer.
Okay.
[sets drink down]
"Yeah, I just thought of a perfect excuse."
Okay.
"Um, Olivia, we can't make dinner tonight because your husband's a cunt."
"Oh, Nick."
How's that?
You don't know her.
- You don't fucking know me.
- Mm-hmm.
I could throw a rock out your front door and hit nine of you.
You're not special.
You are a by-product of those of us who are!
[comic talking indistinctly onstage]
[Bill and Sully laughing and chatting]
"Yeah, I know you will, you always do."
Oh!
- He wouldn't have been pleased.
- Of course not.
He didn't like revolutions.
"Still, he was like a brother to me."
"We always liked the same women, but never the same politicians."
At least you don't take after anyone in your family.
That was excellent.
My compliments!
The worst is over.
"One more day, and who knows what would have happened."
I think you'll be able to get up again in a week's time.
"Give him some more morphine in an hour, but be careful with the dose."
Wait a minute.
Can't I do that myself?
Don't be silly.
I've been working in hospitals for 20 years.
I've seen worse things.
"Thanks, Pablito."
I don't believe it!
You should know you can't smoke in a hospital.
I'll go and relieve Getullio now.
I don't think there'll be any trouble here for a while.
You deserve a drink.
"Don't worry, it's not Communion wine."
Cheers.
"It's strong, isn't it?"
The Campesinos distil it illegally.
- Aren't priests banned from drinking this?
"- Yes, but some do worse things."
- When will this insanity be over?
- When we've succeeded.
"I'm really not opposed to your revolution, Mariá, but what makes me sad is that you use the same violence as them."
"You're such a nice man, and I actually did have a great time the other night, but I'm just not looking for a relationship right now."
"I mean, the... the truth is, I haven't had sex in three years."
Really?
You wouldn't know it the way you jumped right back in with the dirty talk.
"Okay, no, look, Stan, listen, you are my one under the belt, okay, a fling, all right?"
"But it's over, it's finished."
Wow.
That's too bad.
'Cause I really like you.
You're so foxy and nice.
I even... made you this mix tape.
Oh.
You remembered my favorite band is Supertramp.
"Well, I slept with him again."
"And it was even worse this time, because he made me feel so self-conscious about the dirty talk."
Hi.
"I'm your brother, and I think you remember your ex-husband, Richard."
"Yeah, Matthew was just filling me in."
He didn't mention the dirty talk.
I didn't even know about the dirty talk.
Now I got to go call Mom back.
Don't!
Don't!
I can't believe Matthew told you.
Don't blame Matthew.
I already heard about it.
It's all over school.
The fourth graders are doing their class project on it.
Christine... what are you doing?
I don't know.
"It was our conversation the other day, okay?"
"You're right, I haven't had sex in three years, you know?"
- Right.
- Grant would have slapped your face.
- He did once.
"Listen, it's fine that this is funny and, Mr. Vice President, I couldn't care less."
- But what about the campaign?
- What about it?
- President just got past an honesty issue.
- He's not past it.
- If it becomes public...
- That's a big assumption.
"No, it's not."
I think that issue is probably worth further discussion but we're done talking about the ticket.
The president wants the vice president to remain the vice president and he wrote down his one and only reason.
"""Because I could die."""
"Well, of course, he's right, sir."
It doesn't solve the problem of the electoral math.
I don't know what the field will look like after Labor Day.
"It'll be shaken up, but right now the math's tough."
"And I know you all think he's a punch line, and I know why."
But I disagree.
They're sure running the right guy against us.
Am I the only one who thinks a giant sumo wrestler and a hockey goal might get the job done?
I don't know.
I'm open to new ideas.
-Oh!
"Hey, Rach!"
-Hi.
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!
How's living at Ross'?
"It's good, except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long."
So.
"You're just here to help me get information about Gus Walker, huh?"
That's right.
"Glass of Chardonnay for the lady, please."
Thanks.
"Come on, Jack."
You don't have any new information for me.
You just want to get to Walker's files to see if there's anything in there about your friend Fredel.
Not gonna work.
Come on.
Can't a guy do two things at once?
I liked Gus.
"You know, he was a major talent."
Agreed.
"The tragedy of this thing is that he lived in fear because of how controversial his work was, but this last series wasn't political at all."
So you followed his career.
Even after you stopped working for him?
"I'm not nearly as... one-dimensional as you think I am,"
Special Agent Henson.
"Oh, is that right?"
"You know, that's what Walker was trying to say with these photos."
It was about the way we perceive one another.
An issue that you are sensitive about.
Maybe.
Are you?
"You're wasting my time, Jack."
"I mean, what'd you do?"
Run an Internet search on the guy or something?
I'm interested in his work.
Uh-huh.
[dialing cell phone]
"Let's talk about this latest series, right?"
"He'd enlisted October 11,1943."
Whatever jam he'd got in must have been just before that.
It might have made the papers.
"There it was, Father."
All over page one.
Only five weeks before Johnny enlisted under the name of Drake.
The rest was what you'd expect.
Nationwide search.
A murder indictment.
Search for Johnny goes limp.
Story dribbling off until it fell out of the paper.
The newspaper gave me answers but there were three things I had to find out.:
How could Johnny be a murderer?
Why come back here where he was hotter than the weather?
And why?
Why not another word from him since that first call?
"Listen, honey."
Haven't you got any radio news programs in this city?
All I get is commercials and a lot of that apple pan dowdy.
Not until 12:00?
"Well, thank you kindly, ma'am."
I thought I'd turned the juice off.
But I'd flipped it to the police call band.
Car 42 reporting in.
Car 42 reporting in.
Broken railing on Tarpon Springs Turnpike was due to auto smash.
A burned sedan.
"Body, charred beyond identification."
Been there two days.
Send morgue wagon.
- Car 42 reporting.
Got it?
"German, American, everything."
Then I tell her all I've seen.
These last four years have been the richest in my life.
"Looking after Alicia, doing the things she liked to do, except traveling, of course."
"For me, it's the opposite with Lydia."
How come?
I can't even touch her.
I don't recognize her body.
I can't even help the nurses to turn her over in the bed.
And I feel so despicable.
Talk to her.
Tell her that.
"I'd like to, but she can't hear me."
Why are you so sure about that?
Because her brain is turned off.
"A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so."
"You have to pay attention to women, talk to them, be thoughtful occasionally."
Caress them.
"Remember they exist, they're alive and they matter to us."
That's the only therapy.
I know from experience.
What experience have you had with women?
"Benigno, what experience have you had with women?"
What?
What experience have you had with women?
Me?
A lot.
I lived 20 years day and night with one and 4 years with this one.
I love the bullfighter's boyfriend.
I bet you anything he's well hung.
How do you know?
Did you see him?
"He came down here Monday morning, asking for something to match his skin tone."
He didn't tell me what it was for.
"Well, we just left him."
His hands are pale.
"His face is, uh... tan."
- Which tone were you trying to match?
- More tan.
And he wanted it waterproof.
Waterproof to cover a wound?
Maybe it's not for nothing he's wearing a turtleneck.
We need to find someone who's seen him without his shirt on.
Unless you wanna take a shvitz with him.
They don't pay me enough.
So you do Gillian Booth's makeup?
- She always looks so radiant.
"- Oh, thanks."
Sad to think of her alone at a time like this.
The maestro must be a big help.
I know he was in her dressing room Sunday night.
Philip was the first friend I called.
He came right away.
"So Philip's a special friend, isn't he?"
Did he spend the night with you?
"Well, it's only natural that you wouldn't want to be alone with your grief, right?"
"Well, if that's what you mean... yes."
He held me while I cried.
We fell asleep.
Did you happen to notice if he had any wounds or scratches?
On him?
"What, you think we were naked?"
"I might have been very vulnerable, but Philip is no cretin."
All he did was encourage me to talk about Laura.
Seems like Big Sis's type
"4,800 yen..."
That's quite expensive...
Heard he got busy and stopped writing
Still too expensive...
This fact wasn't written in any of the Books of Prophecies
"Impressive! ""Bon"" Natsuko the forever damned hunter with the blood of 108 sexual demons"
You can't seem to escape the wrath of sexual desire
"Oh, a sigh like a beast's roar"
So we didn't buy anything after all.
Sorry!
No it's Ok
"No, I'm really sorry"
"I didn't really care though, as long as I got the feel of Boy's Love"
"No, no, no!"
It doesn't work like that
"Without caution, you may dislike us BL lovers as well"
That's also why it was such a hard decision
But it's not like I'd start hating you
"Well, thank you then"
I thought you'd say that
"Well no, more than that..."
I don't want you to start hating anal
What?
Ok...
Um...
Let's eat
Thanks
"So, which do you like better, games or BL?"
You're gonna ask me that?
Um... nevermind
I know you can't choose
What will this sister of mine do with rice?
But my father hath made her mistress of the feast.
- Ou!
"- Oh, help me!"
Help me!
"lam robbed, sir, and beaten."
"Lend me thy hand, I'll help thee."
"Oh, good sir, tenderly."
- Oh!
- How now!
Can'st stand?
Dost lack any money?
I have a little money for thee.
"No, good sweet sir, offer me no money, I pray you"
- That kills my heart.
- Then fare thee well.
I must go and buy spices for our sheep-shearing.
"Prosper you, sweet sir, I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too."
"♪ Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way"
♪ And merrily hent the stile-a
♪ A merry heart goes all the day
♪ Your sad tires in a mile-a ♪
"Reverend sirs, for you there's rosemary and me."
Grace and remembrance be to you berth and welcome to our sheep-shearing.
"Come, a dance, I pray"
"Your hand, my Perdita."
This is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever ran on green-sward.
"Good sooth, she is the queen of curds and cream."
"Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this which dances with your daughter?"
They call him Doricles
"He says he loves my daughter, I think so too"
I think there is not half a kiss to choose who loves another best.
"Yeah, let's go."
"[Man] In John 10:10, Jesus tells us..."
"""I came so that everyone would have life and have it in its fullest."""
"So, since God planned for us to have peace and happiness in this life right now... why are so many of us... hurting and angry inside?"
It's because we refuse to believe in God's unconditional love for us.
God created us in his image for one reason only... so that we could know him personally and have a joy-filled life.
That's it.
There's no catch.
There's no hidden agenda.
The Lord sacrificed His only Son for us... paying the penalty for our sins so that we might know true contentment.
"It sounds too good to be true, but it isn't."
God's provided the way.
We must make the choice.
[Chattering]
Oh.
Excuse me.
Paige!
"Hi, sweetheart."
Wow.
You look so beautiful.
You must be Paige's parents.
Such an honor to meet you.
Your daughter has been such a blessing to us.
She's a blessing to us too.
- Paige says you work in travel.
- Yeah.
"Well, we take a mission trip every year."
We should talk.
- Mmm.
"- Yeah, we..."
"Yeah, we should."
We'd love it if Paige could join us on one of our trips... see all the good her generous donations are doing.
- Can you not refer to it as that?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
When were you menstruating out your pussy?
"No, the um..."
The-
- Can you not say...
"""pussy""?"
"Oh, yeah, sure, fine."
Whatever.
"Okay, so I'm gonna take two fingers,"
I'm gonna put 'em in your hair pie.
"I'm gonna feel around, apply some pressure to your ovaries and check you out for beav cancer, okay?"
- Listen...
"- Oh, did I press too hard?"
I apologize.
- No.
"- Okay, well, everything feels fine, so now I'm just gonna go ahead and clamp your clam open and then swab around the inside of your tuna taco"
- and I'll have you on your way.
"- Yeah, no."
Can you just use the clinical term for vagina?
I don't-
- I don't see what's so hard about just saying vagina.
I don't understand.
Are you referring to your sausage wallet?
- Sausage wallet?
"- You know, your lizard mouth."
Does it really feel normal to you to refer to it this way?
I-
- That would be like a proctologist calling a butt a--
Butt?
"Oh, God."
I'm sorry.
And those propeller plans that you got for me... the plans you and Emmett worked to steal...
They were fake.
F-Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"[Sighs] Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
"And I wondered, do they even care how many people die?"
This administration...
"The stuff they get away with, it makes me sick."
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated.
Just think about all those... kids that died.
[Knocking]
[Elizabeth] Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
You want to spend money the way you want?
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do all the time.
It means working when you are exhausted... and almost never getting what you want when you want it.
"I saved a child, but failed in my delivery."
God's ways are hard for us to penetrate.
"Benvolio, you can come no further."
Now take this letter early in the morn and see you deliver it to my lord and father.
"Farewell, Benvolio."
Let us say good night.
No.
But... but why descend into this bed of death?
"Partly, I must behold my lady's face."
"Chiefly, I'd return this precious ring to her fair hand which gave it me."
And now be gone.
"I go, and do not seek to question you."
By which you show your love.
"Goodbye, dear friend."
"Banished Romeo Montague, who murdered Juliet's cousin, noble Tybalt... causing her the grief that took her to the grave."
And now he comes to desecrate the dead.
Leave them to heaven and attend to me.
"We needs must fight, for you are bound to die."
The very reason why you find me here.
"I am Count Paris, and I here defend the grave of she who should have been my bride."
"Oh, good, gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man."
Put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury.
"Oh, fly hence."
"Be gone, survive."
What?
Should I buy this proof of your concern?
Or is a Montague afraid to fight?
"May God bless you, Paris."
Friar!
Friar Laurence!
- Friar Laurence!
- Who's there?
She won't say a thing.
It's like she's thinking really hard about something.
We think...
We think that Maria doesn't remember a thing.
- What do you mean?
- She won't talk about it.
"We tell her about things like you and your house, but all she says is I don't remember."
Foguinho thinks she doesn't want to remember.
"If you ask me, she simply can't."
What did she say when you told her it was time to live with me?
She said she wants to stay in the circus forever.
I see.
"We explained that this is not possible, 'cause she is too little to work by herself like that."
She didn't like it one bit.
"I'm no educated woman like you, Mrs. Maria Cecflia, but I'm very candid and say what's on my mind."
It's a crying shame that Maria can't stay with us.
"You're her grandma, and you have the right but I think she'd be happier with us."
The magic rope trick requires great concentration.
- Are you concentrating?
- Yes!
My assistant Maria will give me a hand for the magic rope trick.
"Maria, pull very hard."
- Are you very concentrated?
- Yes!
"Let go, Maria."
"Foguinho, we're late."
There's a show tonight.
Thank you.
- Bye-bye.
"- Bye, kids."
Is it time already?
"Show us another trick, Foguinho!"
"He didn't believe in theater, he always used to mock my dreams, and I ended up not believing in them, either."
I lost courage!
"And then the turmoils of love, the jealousy, the constant fear for my little one."
"I was becoming petty, insignificant,"
"My acting was stupid, I didn't know what to do with my hands."
I couldn't control my voice.
"You don't know what it feels like,"
knowing that you act atrociously.
I am a seagull.
"Since I came here I've been walking a lot,"
"I walk, and I think intensely, and I can feel my soul strengthening."
"I know now,"
"I understand, Kostia,"
"That in our trade, artist or writer, the essential is neither the glory, nor the sparkles, all that I dreamt of."
The essential is to know how to endure.
Learn to carry your cross and keep your faith.
Here's the item.
It's intact.
"Now, let's talk details."
"Abhorrent, isn't it?"
"Are they plotting, or what?"
Our fiancées.
Here's a doll.
"Here's the head, here's the feet."
I turn her upside down.
"Close your eyes, close your eyes."
There!
Show me where the head is?
"Now, her feet."
And now her sex.
"That's a good one, huh?"
Isn't it?
I don't know.
I could teach you your abc's.
In that case I might be a willing pupil.
Are you one of those rich refugees coming here looking for more money?
And sympathy.
"Well, I 'm not in the sympathy market yet but I guess we're both in the money market."
What're you gonna do in America?
"Oh, maybe I'll steal a little."
What do you do?
"I float, I drift."
I look...
"That's the man, officer."
What's the trouble?
You were on the ship that just came in?
"I'm awfully sorry about this, but my wallet was taken out of my pocket while I was getting my baggage."
Would you care to search me?
With your permission.
That's not my wallet.
Clementi Sabourin.
Is that your name?
Yes.
Is that what people do to each other in America?
Everybody frisking everybody else?
I'm awfully sorry.
"Tell me, uh... did you have very much money in that wallet?"
"I had about five hundred in currency, a cashier's check for twenty thousand dollars..."
Of course I can have that stopped at the bank.
But there was a very important document.
"Well, I'm sorry you couldn't find it."
And so am I.
"This man does not have your wallet, sir."
We'll have to go back to the pier.
- And she is?
- Dr Goodyear's partner.
- Research partner?
"- Good Lord, no, she's not got the brains for that."
Her lesbian life partner.
It turns out Janet Cramer's got the bulk of the research squirreled away somewhere and won't give it back.
"Says it's hers, not ours."
"I really can't be dealing with these people, you know."
"What, lesbians?"
Librarians.
Oh.
"Awful, small-minded, orderly, finicketty little nobodies, stuck away in their dusty, desiccated bloody towers."
That research has to be returned to its rightful place.
It's for the good of the college.
Scientists have been waiting two decades for it to be published.
I've tried to reason with her but she won't listen to me.
Thinks I'm some antiquated ogre.
But she might listen to you.
I see...
"Tell me, when exactly does your nomination for Master come up?"
Peter!
SCOTT:
"Being a lawyer's easy, there's nothing to do."
You and I need to have a little chat.
Someone to see you.
- Good morning.
- It's my cats.
They need to be looked after when I'm gone.
- Right.
Come through.
(Phone rings)
"Don't worry, boss, I'll hold your calls."
It is true.
I forgot about the age being busy with the missions.
You should be very alert in this mission.
I am into form with my first success.
I will rage up now sir.
"No, just follow Karthik and that is enough."
"IG sir has asked me to follow you, keeping aside my seniority."
What should I do?
You should do acting.
There should be content in the character and I will sit in that putting a tent there.
"Your acting should be very simple, natural and convincing."
Stop it.
I gave performance as a jobless barber for 1 year.
I withstood the troubles as a waiter at the bar for 2 years.
I begged on the shore of the Musi River for 3 years.
I sold dry fish in hot summer without slippers.
Not even one could find me out as undercover.
What have you achieved doing all these?
It is dirty acting with expectations.
It is natural acting doing for happiness.
Take any creature in this nature and I will show you living as that.
Is it?
- Yes
Then the monkey.
Show us how it behaves in different situations.
Ask
Monkey in anger.
Monkey in fever
Cunning Monkey.
Alcohol drunken monkey..
Monkey feeling cold
"Wow, super!"
-Jeannie drinks.
-Maybe she's depressed.
Give me a break.
She's drunk.
"As soon as something happens, you automatically make them out to be saints."
They had bad skin and wore too much makeup.
They didn't look very good.
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore was thrown together and cheap.
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.
She spends her life in a nightgown.
"The woman is no angel, believe me."
They talked about their rotten kids were and about beating them with broom handles and leather belts.
But that their kids still didn't pay any attention.
"When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy."
I don't know if I could live like that!
"God forbid, what would happen if you had to go to prison?"
Karen...
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband--
Do you know why Jeannie's husband went to the can?
"Because he wanted to get away from her, that's why."
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.
Unless they make themselves get caught.
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.
You know who goes to jail?
Nigger stickup men.
Know why they get caught?
"Because they fall asleep in the getaway car, Karen."
"Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie."
Come here.
"Oh, no."
No way.
Things have gone too far already.
"Don't tell me, Samantha Josephine, you want to go to a lawyer, get the money and run, now."
That's exactly what I wanna do.
You have no sense of timing.
I have sense enough to know-
"You know nothing because if you did, you'd realise that that money cannot be transferred all at once."
It's gonna look overly suspicious.
How many times do I have to tell you?
The play must be performed one act at a time.
"How many times do I have to tell you that the longer we wait, the more chance we have of getting caught?"
"She's right, Joel."
"- I don't wanna hear from you, Rita."
- Why not?
Because any decisions to be made are mine to make.
Mine.
Is that clear enough?
Mommy.
Mommy.
"- Thank God, you're all right."
"- Oh, darling."
"Oh, yes, we're fine."
- You were extraordinary.
"- Oh, all in a day's work."
Welcome home.
"Well, I really must congratulate you, both of you."
"I guess the words ""brave"" and ""daring"" are appropriate."
"- Thank you, Blake, we appreciate that."
- Yes.
"Oh, Alexis, I'd like to talk to you for a moment, if I may."
- It's rather important.
The legend is beautiful.
That ship is also very amazing.
"I can go in there, right?"
But how come this ship is here like this?
Because it's bewitched.
"If you become bewitched to a beautiful place, you become like this."
Have you ever been bewitched?
"Of course, I have."
I think you know.
"♬ When I look at you, everything stops ♬"
♬ I'm not sure when it started ♬
"Now that I think about it, I still haven't heard your response."
Have you been well?
Are you still sexy in the surgery room?
I think you misunderstood.
I didn't come here to do the volunteer work with good intention.
A higher up dragged me down for a little bit.
The place he sent me to was here.
"And now, I don't do surgeries anymore."
Looks like I didn't have enough skills for surgeries.
I will go back soon.
I will have to go back to the place I was in after I go back.
I am very busy.
I see.
♬ My tear's confession ♬
♬ Your love which flutters in the wind ♬
"♬ Whenever, wherever you are ♬"
"♬ Whenever, wherever you are ♬"
Okay.
Here.
"When you come to a place like this, you eat like this."
You will have the memory of this taste forever.
STEVE:
You got anything?
Nothing.
Keep looking.
There's got to be something here that's gonna tell us who hired this guy.
Guys?
I think I got something.
What?
"Okay, so it looks like"
Kroll was hired over the Tor Network.
What is that?
It's kind of like a shadow Internet.
"Some people call it ""the Dark-net."""
"It was originally created by the Navy, but nowadays it's utilized mostly by criminals because it allows them to be completely anonymous."
So tracing an I.P.?
"Is not gonna happen, but... here comes the good news."
"According to these e-mails,"
Kroll wouldn't take the Cutler job unless the client revealed himself.
And did they?
Not at first.
But they came around.
Here-- looks like they sent their last message outside of the network.
And that I.P. we can trace.
ABBY:
But I liked John.
Why would I kill him?
"Well, maybe you liked him more than you let on."
"You wanted John to take you away from your secret little escort life, but he had no intentions of ending his marriage."
"A woman scorned, Abby."
It's the oldest motive there is.
CATHERINE:
These e-mails?
That's not what I'm saying.
"Yeah,it is.That's exactly what he's saying."
"Go ahead,man,you kick his white ass."
Shut up!
I'd just like to come home once and not hear doors being slammed.
She's 12.
"I had a friend who got so tired of it, he actually took his daughter's door off the hinges."
It's like a battleground every night.
She's trying to manipulate the situation.
"She asks me if she can sleep at a friend's,I say no."
"She asks you,you say yes."
What's wrong with this picture?
I didn't know the parents weren't gonna be there.
But I did.All you had to do was ask me.
"Oh,so now I have to ask your permission to make a decision about my daughter?"
Come on.
That's not what I'm saying.
Ok.
"So,when are the depositions?"
Friday.
I get the pleasure of defending your ex.
Is that what this is about?
Wyatt did the right thing.So did you.
Yeah.
That's a great defense.
I'll remember that.
"Daniel,come on."
Don't walk away.We have to talk.
Don't make me stop this rig... sometimes this job just seems like a job.
"These depositions go wrong on friday, we'll all be looking for new ones."
"Hence,the bad mood."
"Lawyers expect you to lie, so you tell them the truth and throw 'em off their game."
It's signed.
- You like the Bulls?
You ever go?
- Not often.
"Oh, okay."
So we're doing some stuff on Atlantor.
Some stuff?
"Yeah, stuff, DA Stuff."
"And because we're great investigators, we discovered you are too."
"I'm not investigating, I'm trying to get them to stop building this."
"Cool, to protect the neighborhood."
I like it there.
I grew up in Bridgeport.
- Mr. Dumanjik...
- Bob.
Are you going to tell me what this is about?
You mean about the grand jury?
Excuse me?
The grand jury we impaneled to investigate Atlantor.
lnvestigate what about Atlantor?
"Well, that would be telling."
Wait a minute.
A grand jury is investigating Atlantor.
And I was hoping you'd be happy about that.
This is strange.
You can't tell me?
What did they do?
I was hoping since you've been developing evidence for your own civil case that maybe you could share what you've found in a neighborly way.
I... this is... you're going to have to tell me more about this.
"I have all sorts of constraints, confidentiality issues..."
And your ex-husband is the architect.
- What do you want?
"Oh, my God, this is gonna be so crazy."
Wow.
Has anyone made noise in here yet?
- We get pretty loud.
- Do you?
"Yeah, yeah."
"No, don't be worried about the volume."
- Okay.
- Yeah.
How much has it changed?
- Zero.
"- ""Zero."" Really, zero?"
It was how my parent...
"You know, they wanted to keep it just like they walked into it."
- Yeah.
- And that's what they did.
"They just said ""We're never gonna change..."
"Change it from that experience,"" you know."
Rad!
"Well, I'm going to Pat O'Brien's."
I'll see you guys.
This place is so thick with vibe.
You know?
"You just feel like, the sweat of generations you know, pouring off the walls."
"To see all our gear in there is a trip, you know?"
It's so out of...
It just seemed out of place.
"Like, ""Fuck, I hope we don't rattle the fucking building down or whatever, with the volume,"" you know?"
Originally it was built as a Spanish tavern.
And then over the years it's been a lot of things.
It was a photo studio where most of uptown aristocracy would come downtown and get their photos taken.
So you'd go into people's houses on St. Charles Avenue and you'd see their portraits in their Mardi Gras gowns and they're in the courtyard of Preservation Hall.
Thank you.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
So are you gonna tell me why you're on the run?
You wouldn't believe me.
I'm not so sure I believe me anymore.
- Try me.
- Promise you won't laugh.
Why would I laugh?
"Okay, two years ago, I'm sittin' at home, watchin' a ball game."
- Dodgers are losing.
- I hate the Dodgers.
- You wanna hear this or not?
- I'm sorry.
"At the same time, on the other side of the city... there's some guy robbing a bank, dressed like a clown."
- A clown?
"- Yes, a clown."
It seems that some jerk had knocked off several banks... in a clown outfit.
"The media, in all of their originality, picked up on this... and labeled him the red-nosed robber."
So I'm coming out of Osco's a couple days later.
There's two cops waiting for me.
"Bang, they haul me in."
- Why would they haul you in?
- Let me get to that.
I was stuck in Sonoma.
The only job I could wrangle was playin' a clown at kids' birthday parties... which wasn't such a bad gig.
"Flexible hours, a lot of free cake."
"One of my neighbors, some old battle-ax, sees the story on the news."
She calls the cops.
"They get a search warrant, crash down the door, find the costume."
- It's all over.
- Did you have to wear those big shoes?
I knew you'd make fun of me.
Finally.
"Lucy, I'm home."
- How did you find this place?
"- Oh, you didn't know?"
Richie gets chatty in car rides.
"First him, now my Uncle Eddie?"
What the fuck is it with you?
Why do you keep messing with my family?
I think they call it destiny.
Then I guess you had this coming.
- What the hell's this?
- Are you kidding me?
- I will fucking kill you!
"- Hey, guys."
Hey!
Goddamn it!
Knock it off!
Get over there!
Get over there!
"First one to move, I swear to God I'll knock you on your ass."
You...
"You guys are unbelievable, you know that?"
I've been lookin' for a job like this for years.
"And you two punks show up outta nowhere and run roughshod all over it with all this ""get outta my sandbox"" bullshit?"
You know what you're like?
You're like... those lab rats.
"You know, the lab rats that push the button for the candy, they just keep pushin' again and again."
They don't give a shit about anybody or anything!
"This job is my swan song, my masterpiece."
"And once I pull this off,"
"I can sit around in my soft pants and watch my stories, think about that perfect caper that we  that we pulled off."
"So Seth, you either stand behind me, or you get the hell out of my way."
"Neil, tonight, Victor..."
I'm sorry.
It's not over yet.
I'm exhausted.
"Oh, thank God."
"Me, too."
"Hey, we never stopped at the cash machine."
That's right.
I still owe you a lot of money.
"Well, maybe you'll find some other way to pay me."
I'll see what I can come up with.
Whew.
"I like these parties, but they are a lot of work."
May I help you?
Hi.
I'm sorry to show up like this.
"- You're Adriana, right?"
- Yes.
"I'm Anika Truman, Grace Truman's daughter."
"Yes, of course."
I thought you looked familiar.
"I know she did some work for you a while ago, and she showed me the drawings of your house, and I'm just passing through town, uh..."
Of course.
Would you like to come inside?
Maybe you'd like a cup of tea.
- I'd love some tea.
- All right.
"I, Asseylum Vers Allusia, will take Count Slaine Saazbaum Troyard as my husband, and proclaim that I shall create a new kingdom here in Earthspace."
"At this time, in spite of the best efforts of you daring and resolute knights, this war is giving every indication that it will become protracted."
"With matters having come to this, what should our course of action be?"
Is this a time for Orbital Knights to squabble among themselves?
I think so.
It's alright.
Shh!
"See, Fen?"
No harm done.
Huh?
I wasn't hurt.
"- Fen was helping, I know."
- Pa.
Pa.
"It's alright, girl."
It's alright now.
Fen stabbed Hugo de Jaager.
She was trying to protect Mr. Travis.
You caught your murderer.
"Makes you happy, does it?"
You're going to advocate for Fen to remain at the asylum.
Yes... though I can hardly argue that she wasn't in her right mind when she stabbed Mr. de Jaager.
"She was attacking a man she thought was harming her father, a perfectly rational action."
"But she didn't have men's rea, a guilty mind, so I have considerable leeway."
Can she be helped?
I don't know.
"But with further attention and care, she may be able to learn to control her wildness."
And become civilized.
(Julia sighs.)
"Given the behaviour of some of the so-called civilized people we encounter in our work, I wonder what we'd be teaching her."
"Well, she did show us that she's capable of empathy, Julia, by attempting to protect Mr. Travis the way she did."
It is the hallmark of humanity.
"No matter what we may think of him as a man, she saw him as her father."
"William, there's something I have to tell you."
(Julia sighs.)
"You have to look your best, little man."
You are not my mother.
And you are not my child.
"You know, since we're talking, with mouths -- not really an opportunity that comes along very often --"
"I just want to say, you know, you have never been very reliable."
And you have?
You didn't always take me where I wanted to go.
"No, but I always took you where you needed to go."
You did.
"Look at us, talking!"
"Wouldn't it be amazing, if we could always talk, even when you're stuck inside the box?"
You know I'm not constructed that way.
I exist across all space and time and you talk and run around and bring home strays.
I do really feel like they're soulmates.
"They're best friends, they're siblings, they're family."
They can't live without each other.
You can't have one without the other.
"In the top 3 saddest moments of ""Doctor Who"""
was when the TARDIS had to go back to being a TARDIS.
She just wanted to say
"""Hello."""
I'm alive.
"""Alive"" isn't sad."
It's sad when it's over.
"I'll always be here, but this is when we talked and, now, even that has come to an end."
There's something
I didn't get to say to you.
Goodbye.
No.
I just wanted to say hello.
"Hello, Doctor."
Doctor.
"It's so very, very nice to meet you."
Is the plane ready?
"Yes, Miss Bristol."
Let's go.
Where will the conference take place?
At the Quito Hotel.
Is that so?
"Yes, all has been arranged, as instructed."
Have the models reported in?
"Yes, they are traveling by commercial flight, accompanied by Maddame Rapiee"
"All is well, Lucrecia?"
The operation will take place in Quito.
Will our other agents have any problems?
"No, all has been arranged, the only one that cannot pass trough customs is you, you are too well known by the intelligence agency."
"Very well, Lucrecia, I am now in your hands."
We wil go to Quito in one of the emergency planes.
And where shall we find it?
the secret landing strip is not far away.
What would you like?
Do you have loose American cigarretes?
Lights?
Twentieth century brand?
only Fiteenth century.
"Here, this is for you."
"""In case of extreme circumstances, look for contact in Quito, code 00100"""
When will we go into action?
"It will be soon, the members will arrive today."
"Agent one, S.O.S."
Got a light?
My matches are wet.
I do.
"I am Charlie, he is Sibor."
"I know, I was expecting you."
I knew I'm an absolute phoney here.
And that is the closest I ever got to...
You went to school with the lead singer.
"And yeah, probably once took a punch for him or something."
But that's the closest my pro golf career ever got.
"That's what Take That's like now, though, isn't it?"
There's only three of them left now.
"Yeah, but it's the worst ones, isn't it?"
The worst ones are left.
I've a lot of respect for people who just leave at the...
"Like John Deacon was the bass player in Queen and I think after Freddie died, he went, ""Right, I'm out."
"""I'm done."
"We had a great band."""
"And that's it, whereas the others keep appearing at the top of Buckingham Palace."
"I love him, though."
Brian.
Do you love Brian?
I love him because...
I just love him.
I love how passionate he is about badgers.
"He's really good at the guitar, isn't he?"
"No, I don't care about that."
It's the badgers and the foxes and stuff.
I'm a big animal lover.
Is he into badgers?
Do you have badgers in America?
I'm sure we do.
We're killing the badgers over here.
We're killing them off because they're - what is it?
"Apparently, they've got TB."
"They've got TB and they're passing it on, so we're culling them."
People are against it.
- As for you...
Rebecca.
Her name was Rebecca.
- Is that all you know about her?
"- Well, not too much more, I guess."
- Does that make you feel good?
"- No, it doesn't."
"Eric, every once in a while, let your brain in on what the rest of you is doing."
Are you two both clear on this?
"But if I can't use Eric's method, then how do I get a girl to say hi?"
- Cory...
- Yeah?
What did you know about girls before your brother's excellent advice?
- I didn't know anything.
- Why don't you just go with that?
"Um, ready to go?"
"Look, are you feeling a little funny about this?"
"You mean, about going out on a date?"
"Yeah, because we don't even know each other."
A little funny.
"So do you wanna, like, not go out on a date?"
"- Yeah, it doesn't feel right."
- I understand.
But we should still get to know each other.
"Oh, that would be nice."
"Yeah, because then, in case we ever did want to go out, well, we'd know each other."
"So, um, how do you want to get to know each other?"
"Well, we could go somewhere and talk..."
if you don't have something else to do.
"Well, I did, but, um..."
now I'm suddenly free.
Great.
-Yeah?
-Progress report.
Excuse me?
Progress report?
"No, ""Hello, how are you?"""
"Jesus, Claudia, you're really warming me up."
What?
"I love capitalism as much as the next guy, but this is off the charts."
"Your commerce is so far up my ass, I can't sit up."
"Listen, the Age of Aquarius never happened, okay?"
-Get real.
This is commerce.
-I want to tell you something for your soul.
Pushing for Christmas and radio play will only amount to shit and wrapping paper.
"I don't know what happened, Jane."
We really used to be on the same page.
"I don't know what happened either, Claudia."
I guess you started exercising.
Gotta go.
Bitch.
Cunt.
Can we just say how lovely Jane looks today?
Can we just have a moment of appreciation for our sweet lovely Jane?
Jane rocks.
Get the fuck out of my chair.
I had a math teacher in high school who was sort of my mentor.
"You know, I was one of those science geeks and my mother wasn't really around."
"So he took me under his wing, and he convinced me that I should be a doctor."
Which seemed like the right idea at the time.
"You know, I guess I needed to prove myself."
To who?
Who were you trying to prove yourself to?
No.
Where's your mother?
I'm traveling all alone.
And you started wandering around the train and now you don't know where you're supposed to be?
I'll call the conductor.
"Oh, no!"
"I mean, I..."
"I do know where I'm supposed to be, in the day coach, but I don't like it there very much."
"I don't feel so good, right here."
I bet I know your problem.
You do?
Mmm-hmm.
"They gave you money to buy your dinner, and instead of that you bought some ice cream, and some candy and maybe some soda pop?"
"Yeah, and some marshmallows, and some cotton candy, and popcorn and cigarettes."
Cigarettes?
"Oh, I mean can-candy cigarettes, chocolate."
Oh!
Why don't you sleep here?
Here?
I'm sure your mother would want you looked after.
I'll call the conductor.
"Oh, no, don't do that."
Why?
"Oh, well, he doesn't like me, see, and... and he's not a nice man because we were talkin' about trains, and I told him I had 13 cars in my set,"
"and he only has 11, and he's jealous and nasty, he is."
"All right, then."
I'll ring for the porter.
"Oh, no."
"If you press that buzzer, I'll be killed!"
What an imagination!
"Well, don't you see?"
The porter and the conductor are in cahoots against me.
All right.
Easy.
I'm Jack Kang.
I'm leadership here.
"Yeah, we know who you are."
And we're not a threat to Candor.
That might be your truth.
It's not necessarily mine.
All I know for certain is you're both wanted for criminal insurgency and conspiring in the attack on Abnegation.
Those are lies.
"If you were Candor, I would take you at your word."
"Unfortunately, given the circumstances,"
I'm obliged to hand you over to the Council.
You can make your case there.
You might as well just kill us now.
"If Jeanine finds us, we're not gonna live to stand trial."
I doubt that very much.
She would never supersede the Council.
Sure about that?
Who's gonna stop her?
You?
Factional law must be upheld.
"All right, wait, wait, wait."
Can I ask you one question?
(GRUNTS)
Can I ask you one question?
Jeanine believes that Erudite are most fit to govern because they are the smartest.
Do you believe that Candor is most fit to judge because you're so honest?
I admit I do hold that belief.
Then would you say that a trial held here at Candor would be inherently more fair than a trial held by Erudite?
Hmm.
The answer is yes.
What'd you expect?
Nothing short of a triple axe murder will take it off.
"Keep feeding the press, morning and night."
Emphasize our tough stand on crime.
The 20% drop in homicides and street crime last year.
"Also, Stern's record."
Hard-line.
"Good, Kevin."
Corporation Council?
We've commissioned a study that'll prove this city has the toughest probation guidelines in the country.
Excellent.
Get Community Affairs involved.
Tell Parks clean up their playgrounds.
"Hover, nudge, show we care."
And then we got to do something concrete.
"Something big, something important."
Something that means jobs.
That means building BankExchange.
I won't let these shootings interfere with my program for the city.
I'm speaking at the boy's funeral.
James Bone's funeral.
That's a blueprint for trouble.
I don't care.
It's the right thing to do.
I don't think you'll be welcome there.
They got me anyway.
Let's go to work.
"Kevin, I need you."
So what happened?
Frank Anselmo and his real-estate cronies is what happened.
They want the subway stop to raise their land value on city property.
The property around BankExchange?
"Oh, yes."
No.
"Yeah, probably, I am."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Well... it was a great two-and-a-half dates.
And I'd be willing to round it up to three if you want to.
I don't think so.
"I hope you're sure about this, because once I leave, I'm not coming back."
Unless you want me to.
"Bye, New Christine."
Bye.
That is one hot grandpa.
"I see, you are the Makoto of the Bake Neko!"
"I see, you are the Makoto of the Bake Neko!"
Please tell me.
What can you achieve by talking?
What can be achieved?
That is already out of control.
"Soon, I'll be killed by that."
"To you, it doesn't matter if you survive or die, but to me, I must definitely kill it."
"In order to do that, I need you to talk."
"The one who turned it into a demon was you, and thus, you have an obligation to talk."
Obligation?
It is just a grudge filled story.
"I have wasted my life living to this age, to actually be intimidated by that..."
Final Act
"That girl, Tamaki was a sacrificial offering."
"It slowly became inevitable, as if and leaned towards me."
"Because of how things ended up, it would have been pitiful if I had taken her home."
"So, I let her wear beautiful clothes and eat delicious food."
Stealing glances at these papers?
"Yeah, that made me suspicious."
Can't we just forget all this?
"You're walking out that door, and you're never seeing her again."
Who sent you?
I can't tell you that.
Jack Stillman.
The Fixer.
"The I.R.S. says he made $16 million last year working for media companies, politicians--"
And the occasional crime figure.
I understand that I'm a person of interest to you.
Who told you that?
"I know everything that happens in this city, Special Agent."
"You interfere with this investigation again, whether it be paying people to lie or encouraging them to withhold evidence,"
"I'll bring you down, Stillman."
"Well, you're welcome to try."
But I should warn you that better people than you have failed.

"Oh, see, now, this is good art."
It tells a story.
Good art has to tell a story?
"Can't it inspire a feeling, set a mood?"
It's funny.
When Dana and I went to the museum last weekend--
"Man, that's the fourth Dana reference today."
[laughing] That's not--
That's not true.
Really?
Four?
Four.
And that already includes two about the museum.

"Something is wrong."""
"Telling you, man."
"Fucking gangster women, man, I like you."
"You freak--oh, my God."
So much power in a woman.
You know where you can find it exactly though?
Legs.
I'm a leg man.
Any other leg men in here?
So what the rest of y'all?
Titty fuckers?
"I'm a leg--there's nothing sexier than a woman with a nice pair of legs, you know what I'm saying?"
Just walking out just nice and just...
Put some thigh-high stockings on.
"Oh, my God!"
That shit is sexy.
"Women, if you don't got a pair of thigh-high stockings, go get some, make your man hot like instant grits."
I'm so serious.
"Matter of fact, if you don't got some right now,"
"I want you to go home, order it from Victoria Secret, and send me the picture."
"Make sure it ain't Snapchat, 'cause I'll get pissed off."
That's all I'm saying.
"But stockings, boy, it's so sexy."
"But women, let me talk to you, okay?"
If you got a fat leg... please do not take a fishnet stocking and put it on the fat leg.
"Now you got little fat pieces popping out the fishnet, and it look like Bubble Wrap."
"Now, me being the type of person I am,"
I'm trying to pop this shit.
"""What the hell?"""
Jump on it.
That shit--
"Fat, wait for me in the car."
The good old ear test.
"How are you doing, son?"
"My fingers, my eyes can deceive me... but never my ears."
The fabrics speak to me.
I can't hear a thing.
I know.
That's why I didn't insist that you follow in my footsteps.
The fabrics tell you what type of clothes they want to be.
You'll never forgive me for not being able to listen to the fabrics.
Who am I to forgive anyone?
I don't defend universal truths.
I defend my own truths... but look where it's gotten me.
It's made you an extremely elegant old man.
What good is elegance... in these days of jeans and T-shirt?
Women don't look for elegance anymore.
They only look for money.
"Four wives... my mother in the '50s, yours in the '60s... another one in the '7 0s... and he ended up in trouble with this one in the '90s."

"- We're going to win, right?"
- Yes.
What do you want?
No rush.
It's just that...
High quality.
It would make a nice suit if it weren't for the color.
"But Dad, my idea was to make a Campari-colored suit."
"If the cloth cries out to be a suit, it can make a nice suit... even if it was born Campari."
Excuse me.
May I help you?
"In English, please."
With super-human courage that defies anything else he's done before he fights his way up out of the pit while the man-eating crocodiles gnash their teeth in rage at the escape of their victim.
"- Gee, crocodiles."
"Oh, boy."
- He'll get away from them like he did from those man-eating sharks.
Bet I could if I was Speed Foster.
- ready to strike.
Kadonka kill white devils.
Speed laughs at him in scorn and roars:
"Throw that spear at me and you die, Kadonka."
"Kadonka, he big warrior."
Hold poison...
"All right, lay one down there, boy."
I sure hope Frank gets to be foreman.
Hah.
"Boy, how we'll stall on him."
Or maybe you guys are too dumb to know how to stall.
"I guess everybody around here's pretty dumb, except you."
"That's telling him, Eddie, old boy."
That's telling him.
Ha-ha.
Frank will do all right on the job.
He's got lot of good practical experience in this shop.
"Every time I say anything, you always wanna start an argument."
- What is it?
- Don't be discouraged.
Keep trying.
Maybe someday you'll say something that makes sense.
"Hey, Joe, come here."
I need you.
"Sure, Tommy."
Anything wrong?
Nothing Dombrowski can't fix.
After five years it can be everywhere.
"Why did they wait so long until they sent us, anyway?"
Procrastination is like masturbation:
At first it feels good  but in the end you just catch yourself.
"I've got all the data out, Commander!"
"I'm a backup person, nasty killer machine!"
"I do not need no hand, to kill a Noid."
Because you've never seen one of those things take the man's arm.
You said it!
"If so my kill rate goes high, I like that."
I know the reports on AI systems.
The majority of patients are 10 years after implantation.
"So you have no problem, you're wrong."
"Sorry for all the shit about the death of your wife, sir."
"Between us, this mission is not about Noids."
Is personal.
We are his devilish dogs...
And we come back healthy!
"Hey Bishop, what are you doing?"
Shaving your legs?
If we do not have more energy and your blaster has become shiny black cock
What do you do then?
Then I put the bastard in the ass!
"I caught something warm, behind the snow."
"Okay, Kix."
- Warm the gun!
- Your best idea so far!
Kix waits for my signal.
"- You're the boss, Commander!"
- Go to your last team!
I thought this noid could fly.
"Hatta, do not continue."
"Oh, I don't know, Nate."
We can't just leave her in the grizzled hands of a predator.
"- Well, we can't take her either."
- Why not?
Because that would be abducting her.
"I know, but she's just a child, Nate."
"Mm-hmm, and that's called child abduction, which is a crime, unlike what they're doing."
So you're just gonna side with him?
I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do!
"You think you're saving her from beautiful life as wife of rich doctor, followed by even better life as widow of rich doctor with no heirs?"
"Well, there has to be more to marriage than money."
- You think she gold digger?
"- No, I think you gold digger."
Look at you with your bracelets and that ring.
That ring.
I need you to tell me what he said.
I want you to leave now.
"Please, Mr Lee!"
I'm his mother!
Get out!
You coward!
"Mrs McCarthy, what a lovely hat."
It makes you look like royalty.
If only!
Mrs McCarthy... have you heard of a new restaurant in Cheltenham called
Gerard's Brasserie?
I was wondering if you'd care to join me there tomorrow lunchtime.
"Well, I have a WI meeting."
The speaker runs a cattery in Painswick.
"Well, surely the WI can do without you for one day."
"No, I don't think I will."
Why don't you tell her about Tulsa?
- Max...
"- No, tell her, Sal."
- She needs to know.
- What?
What happened in Tulsa?
"It was almost ten years ago, I guess."
We'd just started working for the Doctor.
"It was a... a long game... a real-estate scam... and about the hottest summer you can imagine, so I went to the movies a lot."
"And this guy was... sitting a few seats from me one night, and he offered me some Junior Mints."
His name was Martin.
And he was... just about the sweetest guy I ever met.
We just seem to fit.
"You know, sometimes you get a taste of real life, and it seems pretty all right."
"You start daydreaming, you know... about getting out for good."
So what happened?
"Well, let's just say the Doctor sent me a message... a little reminder that anybody not in the life, not like us, is a liability."
"And if you care about those people, you know... you have to be careful."
"And sweet Max... was there to put me back together, weren't you, Maxie?"
"Anything for you, Sal."
You know that.
"All right, I get it."
But this guy at the coffee shop... he's a nobody.
You don't have to worry.
"Really, I'm on it."
Want something?
Yeah.
"I'll have a Manhattan, please."
Keep the change.
I need a little favor.
You know what?
Put it on our tab.
Soon-shin...
I'm sorry to cause you concern once again.
Don't be silly.
We heard everything from outside.
I can' let you go alone.
I will round up the members of Deung-ryong and we will go together.
No!
"What do you mean, Master?"
Why are you stoping us?
"If we send him alone, there is no telling what they might do."
That's a cross Soon-shin alone must bear.
"I cannot obey you, Master."
I refuse to let him go alone!
Are you going to turn Deung-ryong institute into a martyrs' den?
Master...
"Kyun, Master is right."
Soon-shin!
What are you doing here?
Are you out of your mind?
You wish to make a deal?
That's right.
"If I don't return by 7:00 pm, your journal will be turned over to the Court of Equity."
Fool.
How are you going to prove that journal is mine.
You can't bring me down that easily.
"No, I can't prove anything."
"Even if I could, I'm sure your connections in the Courts of Equity will make that proof disappear."
If you now that why would be so foolish?
But if copies of that journal are delivered to Attendant Ju and Prime
"Minister Yoon, what then?"
"Along with a note saying that the original has been delivered to the Court of Equity as well, of course."
What?
"It says here, ""Thomas Anthony Ballantine..."
"""is restored to the rank of citizen of Great Britain..."
"""and his duty to Her Majesty's service is over and done with."""
Try and keep me out of this.
"I'm saying goodbye, Bal, and I wish you luck in the tea business... and your matrimony both."
"Wait a minute, Mac."
Wait right here.
I have to talk to him.
- But he said you can't go.
- He'll change his mind.
- I won't let you go!
"- Darling, I have to go."
I owe it to Cutter.
- He's saved my life time and again.
- You don't love me.
Do you want me to go through life remembering that I ran out... on one of my two best friends?
"After what they did to Higginbotham, and dragging you up here again?"
That's just the way of showing their friendship.
"I hate the army, I'm through with it, but friendship, that's something else."
But we're wasting valuable time.
You have to understand.
I'll be right back.
- I want to talk to you.
- You?
I don't want to argue...
I'm going if I have to shoot you and go alone.
You know as well as I do why you can't go.
"If anything happens to you, I'd be in a fine mess."
Your girl would prefer charges.
- She wouldn't.
- I don't trust her.
There's only one way I'll risk it.
"I'll join you in a moment, babe."
Sit down.
What the hell's the matter with you?
You know better than to talk in front of her.
The price of beef is going up too fast in New York.
They feel a congressional investigation is imminent.
"So, what do they want from me?"
A four cent drop for the next six months.
[Laughing]
"Six months, huh?"
Do you know how much that'll cost me?
"Hey, you seem like a smart, young man."
"You tell me, what am I paying' those guys down there for, anyway, huh?"
Can't they do something about it?
They are doing something about it.
They're giving you a warning that could save us a lot of aggravation.
You can't afford to be too greedy.
It's not like the old days.
"All right, all right, all right."
Work it out!
But don't you give me no crap about the old days.
"At least, in the old days, you could understand the comics."
"Today, all they got is cosmic ducks and star shit."
"Now, you get outta here."
Don't you come back until you have something I wanna hear.
"Okay, Mr. pontivini."
Whatever you say.
"- Hi, tom."
"- Hey, Ralph."
"Very good, thank you, very good."
"Listen, Ralph, uh..."
"I'm lookin' for the girls that were with those, uh, ghetto ghouls on the night they were killed."
He has wit.
Do you know why you cross your arms?
Feels like you're talking to two people right now.
"Crossing your arms, whether it be consciously or subconsciously, is a sign of defense."
You're protecting your vital organs.
Do you feel threatened by me?
"Well, I don't, but the other guy might."
He is hilarious.
Enough psychology for now.
"What do you know about feminism, Wayne?"
I know it's unsafe territory to discuss with a feminist.
- Why?
- Someone will start shouting'.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Feminism is the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities.
"So, are you a feminist, Wayne?"
"Well, I trust my sister with just about any job under the sun over a man."
"- But 'cept this one, I guess."
- Excuse me?
"Not to be impolite but you're not exposed to talk about sex, politics or religion at the supper table."
"(SIGHING) What do you want, Wayne?"
"- I'd have a Gus'n Bru, likely."
- Not what I'm asking.
What's a Gus'n Bru?
Ooh!
I'll Google it and find out.
I'm kiddin'.
I know exactly what it is.
But we don't have any.
"So, what can I get you to drink?"
I'll have a Caesar and he'll have a...
"Yeah, come on we got to go."
The last night bus is in ten minutes.
Don't touch me!
"Fine, sleep it off."
I'll see you later.
Sweet venom.

The reaper's influence has fallen over my sanctum.
"Sorry, the reaper?"
"Oh, the grim...reaper."
A dead body was found outside Lexia's club.
"My sweet angel, you read my mind."
Death's hand touches us all but this boy's passing might doom the Underground.
And the Underground is the name of your bar?
"The Underground's not a bar, it's more of a..."
Booze can for blood sucking wannabees?
"A sanctuary for children of the night, where they can congregate."

I thought you said she was open to those who choose to live alternative lifestyles.
She is.
You are.

"Okay, here's the part I don't understand."
"If he died in the alley, what exactly do you want me to investigate?"
I have enough problems with the city already.
I don't need them trying to blame Dante's death on me.
Is there any reason to believe your establishment might be connected to his death?
My customers are like my children.
"I nurture them, like Coreen...my favorite."
The most spiritual of the night breed.
Okay I'll take the case.
- My fee is...
I guess you're right.
And about the agency of the canning factory.
I got the impression that clark wants me to work there.
"And of course, the post will be a good one, I imagine."
I'm thinking about it.
"Since it is simply unbearable to stay a clerk forever, you know."
That's true.
"well, now, don't forget about me when the time comes, all right?"
Now let's have a drink.
Thank you.
What miserable men you are.
What is eating inside your heads?
You're just like beggars.
I am only going because... this man Suzujiro is my big brother.
"And mind you, I am not going to see him because he is rich."
"Everybody, come over here!"
What is it?
It's a beautiful moonlit night.
Let's enjoy the cool evening outside!
Grandpa used to love to watch the moon.
He always said watching the moon washed his mind clean.
He often stood in the garden and looked at the moon.
"Grandma is certainly a lady of firm character, isn't she?"
"No, she's just oId-fashioned."
"In short, she has an antiquated mind."
"But still, the way she talks is worthy of an educator."
"I'm sure Grandpa was, also."
They were both schoolteachers.
Both of them had strict morals.
And now... we've upset Grandma.
I feel pretty bad.
You've got to do something about it.
I'm ok.
"No, seriously, dude."
When did you learn?
I started taking lessons a while ago.
This and voice.
Voice?
"Yeah, you know, like singing lessons."
"Dude, if you tell any of the guys at the house, I swear to god, I'll kick your ass."
"Nah, your secret's safe with me."
- So sing something.
"- I don't know, dude."
"I never, like, really sang in front of anybody except my vocal coach and, like, my band."
You got a band?
"Yeah, yeah, a couple of N.Y.U.Music grad students i picked up."
"So if you got a band, you're probably pretty good by now, right?"
"Yeah, listen, you know, like sean's sleeping in the other room and he's got the flu and stuff."
"Oh, come on.See, now you're just making excuses."
"I mean, how are you going to sing to a stadium full of people if you can't even sing to me in this room?"
I guess you're right.
"I mean, there is this one tune I've kind of been working pretty hard on, like, that I wrote."
"Ok, so sing it."
"- All right, but my chord progression's--"
- Blah blah blah.
- Just get on with the freakin' thing.
"- All right, all right."
I'll--I'll do like a verse or something.
"* Nothing left to look at but what lies inside me, * * my first reality cannot take what lies ahead, * * clear the path of destination is what you once... *"
What?
That was good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, I mean, you know,"
"Shut down, always trying to be the tough guy."
Do you know how many times I cried in a helmet?
I'm fine.
Your engagement broke off last week.
Now you're sleeping on the couch of a guy whose middle name you probably don't even know.
Patrick.
"Fine, we're best friends."
But you can't tell me you're not hurting right now.
"Look, honestly, I don't know how I'm feeling, okay?"
"There's a lot of things going on in my mind right now, and I just need to sort some things out."
"We will, I promise you."
Two nights on my couch and I will get inside of you.
Feel like we got off to a weird start.
It's so nice out.
I know.
"Walking outside, in the fresh air..."
We should get a treadmill.
"You know, it's so weird that lily and Neal actually broke up."
"I know, it's a classic story."
"Couple falls in love, decides to get engaged, disaster and heartbreak follow."
What kind of fairy tales were you read as a kid?
"My favorite one was called ""eviction notice,"""
where the princess had to move to a new castle.
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.
Did your dad ever hug you?
"Aw, come here."
"Mm, not like that."
"Well, I can think of some other things your dad never did to you."
"- Okay, first of all, ew."
- Mm.
"Second of all, ew."
"In ten years, you'll be a forty year old ahjussi."
"At that point, today will appear like a faded, yellowed old photograph."
"Without even knowing it, you'll realize you've already let go."
"After that, the days will continue to build on top of each other, and you'll be like a fossil from the dinosaur age to me."
Too depressing?
"This is Lee Seo Yeon, I wasn't able to reach the quota."
"No matter how hard I tried to lengthen it, I just couldn't do anymore."
Did you send the manuscript?
I'm calling because I've been waiting.
"I sent it, you didn't receive it?"
"No, I didn't."
Where did it go off to?
Emails lately have been arriving hours later than usual.
I sent it last night around ten or eleven.
"Anyway, I definitely sent it."
It's hard to believe an email you sent last night still hasn't arrived.
"Anyway, please send it again."
"All right, I just got home, I'll send it right away."
"All right, thank you."
Yes.
I sent it.
"I sent it, I definitely sent it."
I sent it.
Welcome!
I decided to make curry today.
It's going to be amazing.
What's wrong?
What?
Be quiet.
Did you lose something you've been working on?
I said be quiet!
Why are you getting angry?
How much longer?
"30 minutes, 45 tops."
I have the money.
"All right, but if you're not at the 7th street train station in 45 minutes, I'm contacting bin-khalid's men."
"No, Ben, listen..."
What's that?
"The subroutine search we were running, using Mullins' override to find the leak."
There's a hit on whoever accessed
The army rangers' identities.
They used the CTU director's code.
Keith?
Yours.
How is that possible?
Can you see where the file was accessed from?
Yeah.
A computer in your husband's campaign headquarters.
"Uh, the IP address is scrambled, but let me see if I can..."
Got it.
"The computer the rangers' identities were accessed from belongs to Mizrani, first name Nilaa."
My husband's campaign manager.
We were pulled offline.
I can't get back on the server.
They know.
They cut our out-feed.
I'm not looping the evidence room feed anymore.
"Carter, we're shut down."
You need to get out of there now.
"Keith, we're running an operation."
If you shut us...
You're not running anything.
Nothing happens till I confirm what the hell is going on.
- Lock them in interrogation now.
Or i will kill you.
Then you will left crying.
"Go back, stay away... go back..."
"Ma'am i am the same Laxmi Narayan, Ma'am I am not Laxmi Narayan!"
"Ma'am I was telling you, i am not that Laxmi Narayan!"
Inside... i will shout you if say a single word.
"Stop, hold him... teasing girl, even with those guns?"
"And including me also... i was just telling you, that he is the same Laxmi N. Who come to shout you."
"Then why didn't you said, ""that's him"" ""that's him""?"
You told me to shut my mouth.
I think he is scoundrel... i should let you hit by her sandles.
Just like the other day.
"Madam, i am fresh now."
Now show... i have never show it to anyone before.
What?
Never show?
Then how you do business?
Please don't call it Dhanda (business) I sounds very Ganda (bad)
Why is it bad?
"In our business, customer don't pay till they though the item."
And we have to show on words too.
You also show it?
Yeah... and you know my nature and ladies check every thing.
"Weather if its not loose, size is fine... we have to show every thing."
I am doing bussing like that for 40 years.
Show that... this is only for the watching purpose?
But who hit me?
"Don't know, there were two people."
"They hit you, and they were taking you with them."
"Then i stopped them and told them, that's my Laxmi Narayan."
Did you said that?
"Then they talked on the phone, and ran away."
what is that?
- A really good movie?
- that's a tabloid tv show.
Come on. seriously£¬guys. she can't keep getting away with this.
we all just have to band together and take her down.

But--but they're still my friends. you're still my friend.
Yeah.
What you--you don't think so?
No no i do but honestly...

Well congratulations dan.

And i refuse to believe the students at our school are
Any worse than those at horace mann or spence.

"It's important to have friends, girlfriends."
"Not just a boyfriend and not just guy friends, but girlfriends."
I don't like girls.
"They're catty and mean and, well, I like guys."

"No, I've had a bad experience with a guy and I still like guys."
I just don't like girls on a general principle.
"Look, I don't know what I would have done without my friends when I was pregnant."
"You need to meet some girls, some girls your age."
"Uh, it's kind of hard to make friends with girls my age when I'm pregnant."
"Well, you made a friend and you're pregnant."
My point exactly.
"Ethan wants to be my friend, even maybe my boyfriend."
You think there are any girls here who want to be my friend?
No.
And I don't care.
You suck.
You suck.
"Kathy, that is not how you make friends."

We were staring at her.

Well she didn't.

It's actually more than that
It's extremely powerful from top to toe!

The truth is
I haven't been honest about who I am and the mistakes that I have made.
And now I'm going to confess.
We're running out of time.
Five years ago in Pl... (playing upbeat song)
What the hell just happened?
She just got played off by Fatso the Keyboard Cat.
Somebody deliberately knocked that feed offline.
And that someone was me.
"Toast, what are you doing?"
I'm getting you your location the only way I know how.
Holm can't reestablish a connection without exposing his location.
It's genius.
And what if he just decides to kill this girl?
What then?
Then I guess I'll look pretty dumb.
This doesn't change anything.
"When that light goes back on, you say exactly what I told you to."
It worked.
He took the bait.
Not so fast.
I still have to zero in on his location.
How long?
"17 seconds, give or take."
ADDISON:
This is my confession.

"I was like, ""I don't know."

"""I thought it was a film."" Did you?"
"""O.J. hated water."
"He hated water."""
"We'd go out, and I'd be like, ""O.J."
"Need some water."""
I will say this.
I don't do impressions 'cause I'm shitty at 'em.
"But I promise you, this one is pretty close."
It's pretty close.
"When you finally watch that documentary, you're, ""Oh, my God."
It's a shame that guy killed himself.
"He could have made money doing voices."""
You know what?
O.J.
I don't like how some people react when glass breaks.
Have you seen these people?
What if this was my whole show?
"""Have you guys seen these people?"""
"Glass breaks, they're like, ""Nobody touch it!"""
Shut the fuck up.
This is nobody's first broken glass rodeo.
"Nobody's running over like, ""Here, let me scoop up a lot of the shards with my bare forearms."
Put all the pieces in my mouth till I find a trash can at some point.
"No, put the shards of glass into my mouth."""
"We'll be on our own again, eh?"
"Well, don't forget Mr Nibbles."
Yeah.
Have you seen him this evening?
"No, but his food's gone, so hopefully that was him."
"And I cleaned up a mess in the linen cupboard, hopefully that was him."
"Oh, yes, it's good to be loved."
Good night.
"Morning, Mary."
"I just wanted to say, I hope there's going to be no hard feelings."
In fact I got you a little something just to let you know how much
I value your experience and I'm looking forward to working with you.
Thank you very much.
"I don't drink, but that can go to the cleaners."
"Well, there you go."
I just hope we can move forward and forward our nifty little team.
"Yes, professionalism above all else."
"Jenny, I need you to wee into the cup here."
What?
I just need to check you're not on heroin.
Heroin?
"Yeah, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt but there's been an accusation from a member of staff that you might have been injecting in front of the patients, so..."
"How many miles are you on these days, Len?"
1672.
Just- just outside Kiev.
Kiev?
***
Don't
"- Don't touch the chart, please!"
I'm thinking about getting myself a bike actually.
Oh!
"You know, one of those fold-outs for the commute."
"Heads or tails, it looks like you won."
It doesn't pay to split partners.
"Well, i suppose the drinks are on me."
"Come on, my little prune."
No.
Won't you join us?
I beg your pardon?
"I don't even know you, sir."
That's all right.
"None of the others do, either."
"I'm treating all new york tonight, just to teach myself a lesson."
"Come, dear."
No.
"I've learned, miss mansfield, that when a person wants to be a success, he can't dawdle around."
"You got to grab at every chance, use everybody you can to help you up that ladder."
"And the higher you go, the louder people will cheer for you."
"You think only in millions, don't you, mr."
Fisk?
"Yes, sirree."
Millions of everything.
"People, dollars, thrills."
"Every minute is a thrill for me, and i wouldn't give up one of my minutes for all the gold in the united states mint."
I bet it'll look prettier on you than it did in the jewelry store.
"Why, uh, don't you like it?"
Any woman would be crazy who didn't like it.
Mr. Fisk... i expect to be a great actress.
What do you expect me to be?
Whatever you want to be.
"This looks like money to you, doesn't it?"
It don't to me.
"You know, there are two sides to every dollar- a lot of fun making them, a lot of fun spending them."
I've got a lot of them.
You happy?
-I've seen it.
-Ah.
One last time.
You can think of some priest who fits the bill?
-Come on.
"-No, answer the question, Father Paranoia."
All right.
All right.
-You know who I think really did it?
-Who?
The Dominicans.
Go pick on them.
"I could have you deported, you know that?"
I lied.
You look like Sal Mineo.
"It looks like a type of disorder that's, uh, rarely ever seen anymore except in primitive cultures."
"We call it, uh, somnambular-form possession."
"Quite frankly, we really don't know much about it at all except that it starts with a conflict or a guilt and it leads to the patient's delusions that his body has been invaded by some alien intelligence."
Um....
"A spirit, if you will."
"Look, I'm telling you again, and you'd better believe me I am not going to lock her up in some goddamn asylum."
"-Well, it's out of--"
-And I don't care what you call it.
I'm not putting her away.
"Well, I'm sorry."
You're sorry?
Jesus Christ!
"Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can tell me with all your bullshit is...."
"Of course, there is one outside chance for a cure."
"But, um, I think of it as a shock treatment."
"As I said, it's a very outside chance--"
Love you!
And you!
"In polite society,"
One telephones ahead before trespassing.
I imagine strange women traipsing through the property
Isn't a completely unusual occurrence.
That's a fair point.
What brings you here?
My landlady gave me an idea.
"Why, now if we could get an opinion from your butcher..."
Someone robbed howard's impenetrable vault.
"If I can find out how he got in,"
Perhaps I can trace where he went
And locate howard's missing technology.
"You're not really dressed for it, I'm afraid."
Our thief didn't exactly walk the items out of the front door.
"The night of the break-in, did you hear anything?"
There was a tremendous thunderstorm.
"It knocked the power out, including the alarms,"
For almost two hours.
Not that I would have heard any of it.
I'm afraid the sultry combination
Of candlelight and rain always puts me out like a baby.
Hmm.
You're quite the guard dog.
Security is not within my purview.
Sousa:
Ssr.
Open up.
Unbelievable.
A known fugitive isn't answering his door.
Knock harder.
You know why?
"'Cause the one day-- the one goddamn day that your department, that your crew, that your goddamn country needed you the most, you froze up like a goddamn needle-ass little dick."
Anybody else want some?
"You're all right, you're all right."
It's all right.
It's all right.Get up.
I wish you boys could learn to get along.
Jeez.
"When we were riding down in the rig that morning,"
I think we were figuring out what we were gonna do.
"I was ok, so was he."
"Getting off the rig, fine."
"Going in, going up, coming out, the first couple of saves, all good."
Even as the building... was coming down.
"The rumble, all instinct."
"Run, roll, cover, fine."
"But after... rubbed all that shit out of my eyes, out of my ears, couldn't see anything, couldn't hear anything."
"You never told us what to do after, did you?"
"Running up the beach on d-day, huh?"
"Guys on the left of you, the right of you getting their heads blown off."
You kept running up the beach.
Hitler's holy hell.
"We heard all about that, right?"
D-day.
The marching to berlin.
Goddamn concentration camps.
"Going in, freeing everybody up."
We heard all about that.
Goddamn hero.
Goddamn decorated hero.
What were we supposed to do after?
You never told us what you did after.
- Crusoe.
Robinson crusoe.
"stay right there, mr."
Crusoe.
Don't move an inch.
Why?
I said don't move!
You expect me to stand here while you try and shoot me?
So you can keep your secret and carry on living a lie?
Only so I can carry on living.
"Listen, I wish you no harm."
Then why were you spying on me.
I wasn't spying on you.
"I came to ask for your help, but you--"
This changes things.
I'm sorry I startled you.
"If you're in need of medical help, then my sex would be of no issue."
Are you planning something?
"Like I said, this changes things."
You don't trust me because I'm a woman?
I serve jacob moore because I'd be killed if I didn'T.
I do what I can for captain taylor because I have no wish to end up on the end of a rope should he regain command.
Self-preservation to the last.
"You're a castaway stranded on this island, mr."
Crusoe.
We're all slaves to self-preservation.
Takes courage to live as I do.
More than if I were a man.
I'll find another way.
What if I tell the mutineers you're out here?
And what if I tell them that you're a woman?
Whose life would become more unbearable then?
"Yes, we loved each other so much, do you know why we split up?"
"No need to know reason for split up, there's good feeling in what you said now."
Let it continue.
You must hear why we split up.
Leave it.
"No, please listen to me."
"After hearing whatever you said,"
"I don't know if it's true or false,"
"I liked your character in it, I love you."
He gave a reverse twist.
"You were right sir, a Chennai jeweller made two such pieces, records show it was sold to two people."
Who are they?
What are their details?
"One buyer was our DGP, another buyer was a girl."
Shop has a photo of hers.
Girl?
They don't have other details but have a delivery address.
Go there immediately and find who is she.
He hasn't called even once after going there.
Can't he work here?
Why does he have to go to Malaysia?
"You always criticized when he leftjobs, now he's working sincerely, let him do it."
Is Swathi at home?
Swathi?
Nobody lives here with that name.
This girl.
Who is she?
They give this address only.
"We are living here for the past 7 years, not only here, I've not seen her in this area also."
Why did you say you don't know her?
She rejected my son.
She had promised to be with him always.
The winters are brutal in Ithaca.
You'll be cold.
I'll buy a sweater.
You honestly believe that Jameses of this world can keep up with you?
Only in a classroom of overachievers like this can anyone possibly accuse him of being inadequate
Do you want me to skip college?
And stay in Jakarta?
Is that what you're asking me to do?
"There are some, outstanding universities in this city."
"Can you imagine, how good we'd be for each other?"
Yes.
But you do know that can't happen.
Of course I know.
"Do you know what ""apocalypse"" actually means?"
Tell me.
It's from the greek.
"""Apokalypsis"" meaning to uncover what you couldn't see before"
A way out of the dark.
You're sweet talk still needs work.
I'll get on that.
"You're a very good teacher, Eric."
I always forget stuff when I walk out the door.
If any of my ex-boyfriends had picked up on that perhaps things would have turned out differently... but probably not.
Zach was my first serious boyfriend and I was madly in love.
I thought he was the best.
You're the best!
You're the best!
Apparently so did my best friend Stephanie.
Baby!
I know this looks bad.
As well as Liz.
It's bad enough you let the guy go.
It wasn't a big deal.
"Assaulting a federal officer is always a big deal, and you know it."
The fact that you didn't arrest him tells me you're not thinking straight.
"Look, don't worry about me, King."
All right?
I'm fine.
Let's just get back to work.
"Sorry to interrupt, but we just got a lead on the stolen money."
"Yeah, I'm on it."
I don't see anything.
Where's the lead?
"Well, it's actually not my lead, so..."
"Took you long enough, Percy."
I don't exactly have all day.
"Yeah, sorry, something came up."
You called Gregorio.
E-mailed.
"And it was just some serial numbers, so this was all her choice."
"It's not a big deal, Pride."
"Well, actually it is."
"The bills came from a bank robbery in Biloxi, Mississippi, six weeks ago."
A teller slipped a dye pack into the money before the robbers took off.
Seems that makes our marine a bank robber.
Doesn't explain why Jared was stabbed or who'd want to kill him.
How many robbers in Biloxi?
"Witnesses said there were four, including a getaway driver, heavily armed, too."
SONJA:
"So, robbers turning against each other?"
What's going on?
"Oh, hey, Hannah."
Agent Pride.
Do you want me to pull it up for you now?
Yeah
I don't think she's going to give them anything.
We're going to have to find Marcus Alvers by ourselves.
What can I do?
"Um, I followed up on some of those Asian connections, but in the meantime, there's something I want you to look at."
- It's a long shot.
- What is it?
A list of cities where Marcus Alvers has been in the last three years.
Each time only for a couple of days.
Maybe he was meeting somebody.
Cross it with the other suspects in our database.
"Let me know what you come up with, okay?"
Okay.
"Look, I don't know why we have to go through this again."
I already answered that.
"What is it, Edmunds?"
Just wanted to give you an update on Nina.
"Rae, could you pause that?"
She give us anything new on Alvers?
"No, other than the probability she knew him personally."
She's not cooperating.
What are we doing?
Richards is working on her now.
I think that's a mistake.
Why?
"/I don't think anybody should be in there that hasn't worked with her before, doesn't know what she's capable of."
She'll manipulate him.
All Richards does is inflict pain.
There's no way for her to manipulate him.
All right.
"How much more of this you want to endure, Nina?"
Now!
Shoot a propane tank and you'll just get a big cloud of cold gas.
You need an open flame and real good aim.
Get down!
"Yeah, Sam, I had to drive around, make sure we weren't followed."
She could be anywhere now.
Gotta go.
- What's happening?
- We'll get to that.
"- For now, I need to know why someone wants you dead."
- It's a long story.
"Well, that's a long story that starts with Greenway Cargo, right?"
- Give me the short version for now.
- I was the controller.
"Uh, mostly wrote checks, did invoices."
It was a job.
I've been a C.P.A. for 15 years.
- Need to get to the marked for death part.
- After a while...
I realized I was paying vendors I'd never heard of... for cargo that was never delivered.
- Front companies.
"- They were into all kinds of stuff- weapons, ivory, human cargo."
Th-That's what the F.B.I. said.
"Anyway, they came to my house, said they were investigating the company, investigating me."
- Unless you testify.
"- I didn't want to get involved, but they said I'd go to jail."
I said I'd think about it.
Then- things started happening.
- Things?
What things?
"- I had people following me... phone calls, guys watching my house."
Then my wife... goes out in my car.
Went to Armadillo's place to talk to him about Tio's murder.
- What'd he say?
- He wasn't there.
Signs of a struggle though.
"Bloodstains, seared flesh on the stove."
- Pretty ugly stuff.
- That sounds like Armadillo's M.O.
Checked Tio's phone records.
You were the last call he made last night on his cell before he died.
Yeah.
He sounded kind of agitated.
- We got cut off.
- Too bad.
What are you asking me?
"Look, I don't like these questions any more than you do."
I was with my guys all last night while Tio was being killed.
Feel free to ask 'em.
"Okay, then."
"Single blow, a heavy blade."
"- An ax, maybe a machete."
- How long ago?
"Based on core temp, I'd say recently."
- Three to four hours.
- So she's been dead since around 6:00.
Didn't say she was dead.
Skin lividity and clotting... indicate she was alive when this happened.
- Sadomasochistic torture ritual.
- Okay.
"If someone were trying to keep her alive, how long could she survive?"
"With a tourniquet and basic medical knowledge, indefinitely."
Until he tired of his domination and control Dr. Mengele experiments... and decided to squeeze the last breath out of her so he could watch.
"See, this is why you and me can't date."
"- Hi, I'm Dave."
"- Good to see you, man."
- How are you?
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm James.
- Nice to meet you.
- What do you play?
- Saxophone.
"- Oh, shit."

"When I think of New Orleans,"
"I don't think of recording studios, really."
I just think of hundreds of years of music.
Preservation Hall really took hold after the hurricane when people realized that there was something to lose.
Look at this guy.
Wow.
Yeah.
What a trip.
This is a trip.
It was a little tricky because Preservation Jazz Hall is not used to a blaring rock band.
"We moved the drums across the room from traditionally where they play, which opened up the sound a little bit."
Then we moved their amps...
Just baffled them enough so it wasn't completely collapsing the room with volume.
It's funny because you can hear people walking by on the street.
"You hear the horses clip-clop by and the carriages, and people peering in the windows and the street performers strolling by."
"Our microphones catch miscellaneous noises going on, and that's part of the charm."
Where's Ben Jaffe?
"Hey, Ben!"
Is it gonna be okay that we record here?
This is so cool!
This is like my childhood dream come true!
I'm part of the external review of Operation Merlin.
"We allow Gould to stay in business, then we go after him."
"Now, what's that about?"
"Well, us allowing Gould some leeway for strategic reasons is information you might want to lose on your hard drive."
You're joking.
Knowledge is power in this game.
"Yeah, well, it does seem your boss had something of an ego."
Putting Gould away became an obsession for him.
It did seem that way to me at the time.
"Must have thought his name was Kevin Costner, not Simmonds."
- Have you seen that film?
- What film?
The Untouchables.
"Great film, it's a great film."
You should watch it.
Sean Connery.
"""They put one of ours in the hospital, we put one of theirs in the morgue. """
- Right.
- lain?
A light's just come on in the car.
It's like a green explanation mark.
- Probably needs a service.
- It's brand-new.
Thanks for your time.
Nice house.
You want a hand buttoning up?
One of the few men I can trust not to grab my arse.
What's the deal with the Merlin undercover?
Risdale?
He unfortunately reminded me that knowledge is power.
Pack him off to Magaluf.
He can sell dodgy pills from his bar with the rest of the bent coppers.
- Thank you.
And I also noticed a certain linguistic similarity with Bennet's recent work.
Well...
- That's...
"- Carrie, I'm not an idiot."
I know you wrote the parachute pants piece for him.
I just...
I really wanted to help Bennet out.
Stop worrying about Bennet.
Think about yourself.
Because this piece is going in the magazine under your name.
Mouse!
Have you seen Pete?
"Uh, no."
I thoughouyou guys were hanging out today.
"Well, we were supposed to."
"And then this morning, he called while I was out and told me my mom that he's leaving tonight."
And now I can't find him anywhere.
"Okay, don't panic."
I'm sure he'll show up sooner or later.
Why'd I let you convince me to scare him off with my onion breath and my hairy legs?
"We were just trying to help, so you wouldn't make the same mistakes you kept making in the past."
"Great, well, now you helped me right out of a boyfriend."
"It's not too late, you know, to make your own mistakes."
How would I do that?
"Well, he took the bus here, right?"
So go down to the bus station and wait for him there.
And tell him what?
Whatever your instincts tell you to say.
"Oh, God."
That's probably my dad.
"Hey, Bennet."
"Apparently, you can't say he's got a vagina."
Ohh!
"Fine, I'll just take the whole thing out."
"Hey, you've got to tell that NBC page to take it down a notch."
"Who, Kenneth?"
He just embarrassed me in front of a whole tour group.
I'll talk to him.
What is this?
"Well, you know how I hate it when people cheat or break rules?"
"Yes, I do."
"Well, I just spent 150 bucks on wieners."
Attaboy.
"Chumley, the beverage situation around here is reprehensible."
"Oh, good morning, sunshine."
"Surely, our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee."
"Yeah, or, like, a big coffee dispenser."
That's what a samovar is.
"Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel?"
"Uh, Cerie, do you want to go get some coffee?"
"No, thank you."
No?
"Hey, Josh, I need to change your Michael Jackson thing."
Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out."
"[High-pitched voice] So, President Bush is in the news again."
"No, Jay Leno."
"The host of ""The Tonight Show."""
[Normal voice] That's what I was doing.
"[High-pitched voice] So, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars, you know?"
"No, no, like Jay Leno."
"[High-pitched voice] Like, ""Hey, here are the headlines."""
[High-pitched voice] Have you ever noticed when you eat a lot of cheese...
"Once when India attained freedom, and today.."
..when my friend has become successful.
"I dont understand something, Dhanraj."
You want to buy Mr. Kumars mansion.
"And I want to sell it, in orderto.."
..get my money back..
- Right.
Then why dont you give me the..
..money and take the mansion?
Why are you conducting this auction?
You dont understand.
"When the house gets auctioned, then the.."
..dignity of the members of the house gets ruined.
There is a saying in Gujarati that if you want to show..
"..your rivalry, then you should see to it that your.."
..enemy becomes a pauper completely so that..
..he begs and doesnt mess with you again.
Ravi!
Vicky!
"Ravi, did you hear?"
Our house is getting auctioned!
"Why are you so shocked, sister-in-Iaw?"
This would happen some orthe other day.
will you.. will you let this heaven-Iike..
..house of yours get auctioned?
Vicky..
"Vicky, this house is notjust.."
"..made up of lime, sand and stones.."
..but your brothers hard work is also involved in this!
And.. and where will we go if we leave this house!
?
Now everyone will have to arrange forthemseIves.
England.
Not Birmingham.
The British bobby cannot be bought.
"- You, shut your face."
- Sorry.
- What are you offering?
- Nothing.
You must speak to my lawyer.
"What, old pervy Spurty?"
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!
"Right now, everything seems to be in order here."
"I would stand by you, Richie, but lost causes depress me."
Toodly-woodly.
"Right, Spurty, do your stuff."
"Your Honour, I wandered into a garden, under the impression it was my garden."
"On seeing items of women's laundry hanged on the line,"
I naturally assumed that my wife had done some washing and I began to get it in for her.
"The fact that I live in a high-rise flat and am not married is circumstantial evidence and, hence, inadmissible."
Right.
"Well, we'd better escape."
Against Leon Brittan's law and order initiative?
Never!
No choice.
"The meat is in my trousers, Tarby is coming round to hear his golfing anecdote and you're banged up in the slammer."
Don't be disgusting.
I've never been banged up the slammer.
You're right.
We've gotta escape.
I have a plan.
What we have to do is set up a complicated system of stooges to find out exactly what the guards are up to.
"Then, we dig three tunnels and hide the dirt in our trousers."
"Now, you might be a couple of pounds overweight... but at least... we know where it is."
Are you..
Are you saying I'm fat?
Fat?
No.
Let's just say you're a little short for your weight.
"I mean, I think you're in pretty good shape for a 49-year-old man."
I'm 41.
"Bob, your chart says... 49."
"Well, I'm definitely 41, at least I will be this Thursday."
Then why does your chart say 49?
"Oh, That's a one."
My ones look like nines.
"Listen, Bob."
Now that I know you're eight years younger... you're also about eight pounds too heavy.
"Now I don't want to frighten you, but it's just possible... that every pound overweight could mean a year off your life."
"Well, it doesn't frighten me because..."
I hadn't made any special plans for those last eight years anyway.
"Oh, good."
"Miss Burke, get Dr. Hartley a copy of that-"
- High-protein diet?
- High-protein diet.
"Here you go, Dr. Hartley."
"Bob, you are gonna like this diet."
"It's sensible, easy to follow, and you don't have to turn anything purple."
Good.
As long as it's easy to follow.
Now look.
Get yourself a good medical scale.
Weigh yourself twice a day and keep a chart of it.
Carry this counter wherever you go.
Keep track of your daily intake of cholesterol and fats.
Because it's the first thing I move aside.
"Well, fuck you."
"Next month I am going to buy another pair, but in red."
Come with me tomorrow to the cemetery.
You know I can't.
I have to be with my family.
"And besides, your wife never liked me."
Do you know how hard it is for me?
I am leaving.
See you next week.
Why so fast?
- Let's go please.
Damn it!
Tamales!
- What do you have?
Red and green.
- How much?
Only ten pesos.
- Give me two red and two green.
Here.
Do you also want a sweet one?
- If you can give me credit until next time.
Thank you.
In Colombia a ten month old baby died... of an infection caused by rat bites.
The baby was malnourished and the mother informed... the authorities in her statement... that the baby's father committed suicide and left her alone with four kids.
The 10 year old was buried.
She was murdered by a neighbour who wanted to eat her
The victim 's family friends and classmates were at the ceremony.
The murderer was found guilty in the first degree.
The criminals have not been caught.
They decapitated two policemen in Mexico.
The heads were found at a site where police had killed drug dealers.
You're the whole reason that I'm here.
You're the whole reason that I've done all of this.
You're the whole reason that I've made a complete ass out of myself.
I have failed here miserably.
And that does not bother me.
What bothers me is that I have failed you and I am not gonna do that ever again.
All right?
I love you a lot.
Let's go get a drink.
Oh.
"Honey, it has been forever since we did something like this."
Yeah.
"You know, baby, it's funny."
"Since we've been here, it's like the therapist and the place has made it like we got a problem."
But you know what?
I think we don't have a problem.
No.
We got a million problems.
Really?
Yeah.
"But, honey, I think everybody has a million problems."
"I don't know that, like, you,re supposed to solve them all, because the simple truth of it, sweetheart, is we're married."
We made a commitment to each other and to our families.
And to myself.
And I meant it.
"Shane, honey, wait."
"Jennifer, I don't need this."
I'm done with trying to make you like me.
I'm not gonna be the man you want me to be.
I'm not gonna do things the way you want me to do things.
I'm always gonna wear my heart on my sleeve because that's who I am.
And I got a lot of friends that like me just because I'm the way I am.
- Why?
"Oh, I don't know."
I-
I've had sort of a strange premonition.
"I don't know exactly how to explain it, but-"
"Explanations belong 5,000 miles away."
I only have one question... and I only want one answer.
You know the answer.
I don't want to know the answer.
I want to have the answer.
"It just struck me, Mr. Blake."
"Now my back please, Kali."
"I say, Mr. Blake, it's just struck me that so far..."
I've taken this entire matter on trust.
I believed your story and put up the money for this outfit.
"I still believe your story, but I think it's time... you gave me a little more positive proof."
"You should show us the map, Mr. Blake."
When I asked you in Dawson City to help finance me...
I told you I knew the location of a very rich mine.
I still know where that mine is.
I'm taking you there.
"But the map, Mr. Blake-"
Why do you continually refuse to show us the map?
I see.
"Well, what's to prevent our taking it away from you?"
The possibility that such a map may not exist- except in my memory.
Violence will do you no good.
You've come this far... and now there's nothing you can do but go all the way.
You'll gain nothing... by killing me.
"Now, now."
Who talked of killing?
"We're not pirates, my dear man."
"A brilliant bloke like him, too."
"Cutter, we got to do something."
Come here.
- What now?
"- Look, Mac... for four days we've been waiting for them Thugs to start something."
Four days in this cruel heat and horrible tension.
- What's that to do with Ballantine?
- I'm coming to that.
Go on.
"Three hours from where we're sitting, by a secret trail... there's a gold temple waiting to be sliced away and carried off."
Have you started after this buried treasure again?
"Just a minute, Mac."
This one ain't buried.
"According to Gunga Din, it's standing right out in the open."
"According to Gunga Din, eh?"
I thought he might have been at the bottom of this.
What's the idea of this lushing?
- Give me that bottle.
- Wait!
Just a minute.
"MacChesney, I'm here to speak, and I'm going to have my say."
"You want Ballantine to stay with us, don't you?"
- Of course I want him to stay.
- All right.
Just a minute.
It's as easy as parting your hair.
"We take Bal to the temple, show him the gold... and the moment he starts slicing at it... marriage and the tea business will whiz from his mind."
"MacChesney, versus that, you can't think of a single argument."
"Cutter, I'm warning you."
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?
I'm sick of it!
- What can you afford?
"100 a year to their mother is better than losing 1,500 at once."
Should she live longer than 15 years we'd be completely taken in.
People live forever when an annuity is to be paid them.
"20 now and then will amply discharge my promise, you're right."
I'm convinced that your father had no idea of giving them money.
- They will have 500 a year.
- What more could they want for?
"No housekeeping, carriage, horses, few servants, keeping no company..."
How comfortable!
They will be much more able to give you something.
Marianne.
can you play something else?
Mamma has been weeping since breakfast.
I meant something less mournful.
A visitor in my own home!
It is not to be borne.
Elinor.
"- Mamma, we have nowhere to go."
- John and Fanny will be here soon.
Do you expect me to be here to welcome them?
Vultures!
I will start making inquiries for a new house at once.
"Until then, we must try to bear their coming."
"Margaret, are you there?"
"Come down, John and Fanny will be here soon."
Why are they to live at Norland?
They have a house in London.
"Houses go from father to son, not father to daughter."
It is the law.
"- Come, we'll play with your atlas."
- It's not mine.
"That would be easy for you, wouldn't it?"
"You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at est."
"No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan, but I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave me."
Mr. Jennings.
Can I help you?
"As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can."
"Have a seat, please."
I won't be staying long.
What is it you want?
I want you to stay away from my daughter.
You want her to stop coming to church?
That's right.
That's between you and Paige.
"Well, I..."
"I think you can help with that, and I think you will help with that."
"I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings."
It's a sanctuary.
I can't turn anyone away.
That's the whole point of this place.
Is something wrong?
You took $600 from her.
I thought you knew about that.
We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve.
"I-I'll write you a check right now if you want, but... that's not why you're here."
"No, it's not."
"Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings?"
For $600?
For your daughter?
I would do anything for my daughter.
I would do anything for my daughter.
The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger.
"I'm not here to be saved -- not by you, Tim... or your God."
I understand.
Perhaps you could make your operative aware of our concerns.
Blackmire has a very sophisticated counter-surveillance program.
George Browne is an ex-CIA agent.
"If you have an operative in there, they will be exposed."
You don't have anything to be concerned about.
I don't have an operator in any kind of direct exposure.
Good to hear.
"If you could call me tomorrow, after you've spoken to your superiors,"
I'd appreciate it.
You can reach me any time.
Thank you.
I'll be giving you a call in the morning.
- Good night.
- A pleasure.
Likewise.
Call Julianna immediately and tell her she's not going on her trip with George Browne.
Anything I can do?
Call the FBI and start screaming.
They've been sharing our intel with the CIA.
It's Inspector Spalding.
I've had a visit from the CIA regarding our Blackmire operation requesting we drop it.
Please advise me what course to take.
She's not answering.
Is there wire on Julianna still up?
Is Julianna at her place?
She's just leaving with Browne.
- There they go.
- You got everything?
And that's it.
"All right, gentlemen."
Here's your financial statement.
"Come on, dude."
The line is moving.
It's been half an hour.
There are extra classes at school on Saturday and Sunday.
We have to come to school 5 days a week and stay behind for extra lessons 3 times.
"Besides this, you still have a lot to catch up with from past years."
I've made a list of books that you should buy.
Be sure to get them as soon as possible.
"Preparation for Student Selection Exam, The Exam Questions of the last... 10 years, Writing Guide, Turkish Texts 1, Applied Math 2..."
Dictionary of Idioms.
What's all this?
Perfect for a start.
We should get started in an easy mode.
Easy?
Yes.
I got the Lotto Papers.
What do we do now?
Fill it out right away.
We don't have much time left.
Hold on a second.
Let's catch our breath.
You have a maximum of one minute for each question.
Pay attention to the questions.
The choices are full of tricks.
Which of the options below is not meant in this paragraph?
Which of the following is not even there at all?
Be careful with negative and reverse questions.
They will do their best to make us fail.
Bastards!
I never knew there were so many tricks involved.
I'm exhausted.
Let's sit down somewhere for a few minutes.
This is not how the Nazis started!
Exactly like this.
Honkytonk Man!
It's...
Don't keep saying it - we heard you the first time.
It's a genuine film.
"I expect a text from you tomorrow, from all of you, in fact, just going,"
"""I'm sorry."
"I got home, I looked it up."
It's a really good film
"""and it was very sad at the end."
"He coughs up blood."""
I don't think it was probably released here.
It was!
"I don't want to start a beef with Brian May, and that's a sentence I've never said before, but the badger is Ireland's most dangerous wild animal in terms of attacks."
I am listening.
I'm just looking up Honkytonk Man.
"Oh, come off it!"
You'd have to go out of your way to find the badger and then poke it with something.
"OK, this is what I've heard."
"There's a time of year when the badger mates and during that time, if you walk onto their turf, then they will come..."
Turf?
"Yeah, they will..."
Literally.
Badgers in Harlem.
That was a good film.
"Now, that one I saw."
Clint was brilliant in that.
So the badger has a locked jaw.
"If you're walking through the woods and...so the badger, ""Oi oi!"
"This could be a mate rival!"""
So the badger comes and attacks you because it thinks you're going to shag the other badger?
I heard that.
Hey you're not supposed to be talking while you're driving!
Well I already lost Jesse to Hannah.
And now I can't go to college.
Because I was busy selling out stadiums.
And meeting the Queen of England.
Instead of holding a spit bucket for the girls wrestling team!
Ow!
Look I know.
I was really thinking about this.
You know what if you said you were Hannah Montana's assistant?
I mean that way you still did all the stuff but as her assistant.
You couldn't have thought of that 200 miles ago?
"[Singing to the tune of ""On the Road Again""]"
In the car again.
Miley Stewart's back in the car again.
Driving places she has already been.
Miley's arriving back to school again.
Yee-haw!
Today our topic is heartbreak and disappointment.
Who out there has lost a boyfriend recently or a good friend.
Or maybe didn't get into the college they wanted to get into?
I.
Nice try honey.
I'm a visual manifestation of your over-stressed subconscious.
And I'm with you for the next 200 miles.
So you're a mess.
Let's start from there.
Hannah Montana's assistant?
That sounds fascinating.
Why didn't you include that in your application?
Miss Montana likes me to keep it very low profile.
-Do you see him here in this courtroom?
-Yes.
Will you please point him out for the jury?
"Let the record show that Mr. Hill identified the defendant, James Conway."
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?
-Do you see him in the courtroom?
-Yes.
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record show Mr. Hill identified the defendant Paul Cicero.
I have a document....
The hardest thing was leaving the life.
I still loved the life.
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.
We had it all just for the asking.
"Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along."
I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.
I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.
People call them rats because they will do anything to survive.
-Objection!
-Objection sustained.
-l know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it!
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.
Free cars.
Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.
I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend then blow the winnings in a week or go to sharks to pay back the bookies.
Didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything.
When I was broke I would go rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.
Because I read at night.
I've read all your travel guides.
"It was like traveling for months with you at my side, telling me things no one tells you on journeys."
My favorite is the one on Havana.
I really identified with those people who've got nothing and invent everything.
"When you describe that Cuban woman leaning out a window by the ""Malecon"""
"waiting uselessly, seeing how time passes and nothing happens..."
I thought that woman was me.
"Good morning, ma'am."
I'm Benigno's friend.
"- Are you Marco, the Argentinean?"
- Yes.
I'm the concierge.
Benigno rang to tell me you'd be renting the apartment.
- That's right.
"- It'll be very dirty, because he strictly forbade me to go in and clean it."
"I wasn't going to charge him a cent, but..."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of that."
- Shall I give you the key?
- Yes.
I'll see if I can find it.
Have you seen him?
Yes.
And how is he?
Fine.
The poor thing didn't even have any luck in jail.
He got very little publicity.
"Not one lousy television came here, nor one lousy paparazzi."
"With all the trashy shows there are, not one bothered to come and interview me."
"It's sad the state of the ""masses-media"" in this country."
"Yes, you're right."
- The keys...
He lives above his head a little.
I am reminded of Louis the Whatever's finance minister:
De-something.
He built this chateau.
Nicole and I saw it when we went to Paris.
"It even outshone Versailles, where the king lived."
"In the end, Louis clapped him in irons."
"Look, Tony."
"All I can promise you is, I will look into it."
"I understand you got to try to feel out your old man so he don't give you 'a mazz'.... you know, for sticking your nose in."
I haven't been afraid of my father for quite some time.
Fair enough.
"But, Carmine, bear in mind, he came onto my turf."
He tried to recruit my mulignon.
"And worse, he roughed up my appraiser."
If the proper response is not forthcoming in a business-like time frame... my next move will not be further conversation.
I get it.
You should know that my next call will be to Johnny Sack... to let him know that we talked.
He shouldn't feel blind-sided.
Hello?
I'm here for the masoner job.
Me no speak the English.
Mi dispiace.
-There ain't no bear back there.
-Fellas!
"Well, the way I feel right now, I'd like to meet a bear."
What would you do if you did meet him?
That bear would have just as much chance as this pork chop.
Where you boys all going?
It ain't over.
Somebody's going to get something they ain't expecting.
Tony...
He's the owner of the delicatessen.
Saying that the voice was a mars.
"But, the below average height and the fact that the voice was disguised and it was muffled by the mask..."
All indicate at least the possibility of a doubt as to the gender.
"The lab is going to be running some more tests on that makeup, so I'll report tomorrow."
"You should be on salary, sir, with these hours."
I feel I am.
Good working with you.
Thank you.
(COLUMBO HUMMING)
(KNOCKING)
(CONTINUES HUMMING)
(CLEARS THROAT)
"I guess I just got carried away, sir."
I hope you don't mind.
"No, no."
It's all right.
"These shoes, sir, they're really terrific."
"Now I know why, Lieutenant Lucerne, he always look so tall."
"Yes, well, I would appreciate a certain amount of discretion in that matter, Lieutenant."
"Public image, you know."
"Oh, right, sir."
"Oh, well, you don't have to worry about a thing, sir."
"As far as I'm concerned, you're four inches taller than I am."
And that's the end of it.
"Thank you, Lieutenant Columbo."
"My pleasure, Lieutenant Lucerne."
"Sir, I got the second lab report on the mask, so I hurried right over."
Yes?
"It turns out that it probably isn't a woman, sir."
"You see, it was actor's makeup."
"Figured I'd keep tabs on you, you know, in case something popped up."
'Cause she misses us.
PATTON:
Agent Gregorio!
Hey!
Good to see you.
"You, too."
Let's pretend you didn't.
I have to get back to the Garcia case before I don't have a case to get back to.
Good luck!
I thought she hated beignets.
She does.
"So, we got four robberies, all connected to the racing circuit, marked money in Jared's garage."
Neither Russ or Dana are talking.
Hard not to think that they're the bank robbers.
"Yeah, except Dana seemed more scared than guilty."
Check Jared's leave record.
See where he was on each of the robberies.
Copy that.
"Hey, you might want to check, see if any of 'em are cyber geeks."
I dove into the specifics of how they manipulated that car crash.
"Whoever did it, they are good."
I'm talking Mensa hacker level good.
"Yeah, but..."
it wasn't Jared.
"According to the marines, he was TDY on three of the four robberies."
So he couldn't have been a part of the crew.
Maybe he found out about it and tried to do the right thing and got killed before he could.
Still doesn't explain why he got stabbed or why Dana was too scared to talk.
Maybe we ought to take another run at the father now?
This time with a warrant.
(keys jingle)
When did that happen?
In the womb would be my guess.
Any chance we may bump into your old coworkers?
"Or even Wendy, perhaps?"
Wendy and I decided to leave it alone for now.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Turns out Ol' Blue Eyes was wrong.
Love isn't always lovelier the second time around.
"In fact, it's kind of painful and strange."
- Yabba.
"- Enough chit-chat, Ziva."
A man's got to work.
- McGee.
- Wallet was found near the body.
No cash.
Victim is Caleb Adams.
"23, petty officer second class on the DD-350 Hagen."
It's a destroyer docked for liberty at Chesapeake Bay.
Check for surveillance in the area.
Those two with him?
They said they found him this way.
I'm still getting the details.
Doc?
Abrasions on his hands and face indicate the possibility of a fight which was ended by this single stab wound.
Ugly.
"That's it, Tony?"
Only one word?
No wisecracks about wayward sailors on shore leave?
No obscure On the Town references?
Is that a movie?
I understand that sailors often refer to this liberty as their annual beer-and-crabs week.
"Good, good... that's what I like, willing footmen."
Bend over.
"""Oh, they're so naughty!"""
Early scientists also used kites in an attempt to harness electricity from lightning.
Foxsmith is preparing a tribute to these brave men.
He's also hoping to generate a spark among the group.
"So, are you going to go for Everett then or what, Miss Hopkins?"
No.
No?
No.
Why is my love life the topic of today's discussion?
- Really.
- I'm sorry.
"I just I mean,"
"I'm quite happy being single, thanks."
I think Mr. Everett's great.
He has a heart of gold.
He's just an all-around great guy.
This place is like living in a fairy tale... and...
"I could see myself being swept up in it all and... it scares me... it really, really scares me."
Kite makers...
"Sorry, I was on my way to my bath and a letter's arrived which I thought we'd all like to hear."
It's rather good news.
"Um, it's from our friend Mr. Carrington."
Who is coming back to join us.
"He enjoyed his time so much at Kentchurch over the weekend that ""I can't wait to get back there and be amongst such illustrious company."""
So isn't that good news?
Very good news.
Everyone happy?
"You know, it'll be nice to have some music back in the house."
And that's the only reason?
"And a nice, happy, smiling face."
People actually cheered for us.
- How about the Hansons?
"- Yeah, the Hansons."
Killed them.
Didn't see them put one in the net.
"Hey, I looked for you after the game."
What game?
All I saw was a wrestling match.
Got to give people what they want.
"Put butts in seats, win the vote."
Yeah?
"Well, keep playing that way, you won't be seeing this butt in the seats any more."
Interesting style of play.
"Had to let them know we meant business, sir."
That's how it was when I was a boy.
Hard-nosed hockey.
"I admire you, kid."
I do.
"But if all this is about the vote on your home,"
I don't see much hope in hockey changing their minds.
What if I told you we already changed one?
A big one.
"It seems these boys have been inspired by rumours that Mayor David Kenneth plans to support their petition to save the Newman Home when he returns from his vision quest in Peru, if he ever returns at all."
"Man, that's awesome."
I can't believe this!
I want names.
Good newsman never reveals his sources.
There isn't a good newsman within 50 miles of here.
"I'm just trying to capture the spirit of the thing, Bernie."
Is it true?
"Well, no, no, no, no, hang on a tick."
Our office was not contacted for this story and the mayor is unreachable.
"Well, I don't think that the sky should be the limit."
But I do think that... magazines offer an escape in innovation and...
I hope to always hope to find fantasy and novelty...
- on the pages of Skirt.
"- Thank you, just as I thought."
"Thank you, but fantasy doesn't come cheap, sweetheart."
"Please, I don't wanna hear the ""c"" word."
"- Hello, darlings."
- Don't you dare throw that away.
Don't you know people are starving at Vogue?
- Take it.
"- Jocelyn, did you finish testing... all of the mousse in the closet?"
"I was almost done, I just wanted to grab a bite."
"Charmingly naive, but don't you think problems are so important... that you shouldn't take time for lunch?"
"Besides... if you haven't noticed, these are all editors."
"Take it easy, Antoniette."
Be nice to her She's the best intern you've ever had.
Over here!
I'm so glad you got my signal.
I really need your help.
You blew it.
They got you again.
"Cock-sucking, hussie, cocks'n pants..."
"I know, but I need your help."
Is there gonna be another leak?
"- And if so, what's story?"
"- Think deeper, think FDR."
"East River Drive, traffic jams..."
- squeegee boys.
- Think deeper...
- think tacky blond bombshell.
- Sharon Stone.
But if you deal with something else steadily meanwhile...
This is totally vainness.
Waste of time.
"I learned it on the front at my own crew, what the fact that somebody finds the time to think means."
"The one like this becomes the plaything of their own thought and they are due so then, than Tót lord."
The red one is spotted with a butterfly.
"I get true one in everything the respected for major lord, but I believe it so, it is not possible to prevent it if something wants to occur to the man."
But could be.
Why not could be.
It is necessary to modify the circumstances only.
And this our start goes by.
What there is an obstacle to this?
You understand it the thought procession?
I believe it yes.
Well...
I do not take something here and there yet.
"Me, too only here and there."
"Oh, be thinking now, Tót."
"Well, Tót?"
Did something occur to you already?
Yes.
Now.. something...
But no.
"You like thinking though, Tót."
It is an occasion here now.
"Here you go, Tót."
There is time now.
"You think onto our Gyula and strain the your sluggish brain, my good Lajos."
Do not whisper Ágika!
"I do not whisper, major lord."
"Unbutton your jacket, if some more comfortable."
- Maybe then now.
Should have told me you were doing this.
I didn't have the time.
I was with George until one hour ago.
You spent the day with him?
"Yes and every night this week, so far."
I am becoming the expert in George Browne and the Blackmire Group.
"I could be making living at it, no?"
You are doing some very risky things without telling me.
And I have serious concerns about that.
You don't want me to tell you what he is doing?
You don't want... the briefcase?
I want you to inform me of when you see him before you see him.
And I want to debrief you at regular intervals.
You are working under my direction.
Do you understand that?
"Well, if I am working for you full time... then I need to get paid for it."
"I still owe money to Katarina and... if I can't work for her because I'm working for you, then... she needs to get paid."
And... you need to leave.
He is going to be here in 5 minutes.
We'll talk about all this tomorrow.
You're gonna call me first thing.
"- That is him now, probably."
- Is the wire up and running?
It will be.
Come on up.
"In the morning, first thing."
Take the stairs!
"There's not much here, just some small talk."
"No mention of the Blackmire Group, at all."
Then they get into bed.
Did he mention anything about his briefcase?
He wasn't interested in his briefcase.
You're back here.
That's the only victory that counts.
That's why I was deluged with all those letters.
"- Bea, now look..."
"- Oh, I know."
But if I ever go away again and you don't write just because you're ill...
"Oh, don't you see how much more worried that would make me?"
It all amounts to this.
"February is a long way away, and your father will simply have to listen..."
"If you don't stop looking at me like that, I won't be responsible for what happens."
- Aren't public places awful sometimes?
- Awful.
- May I interrupt this loud conversation?
"- Oh, here you are."
"Sir Charles, glad to see you."
Sorry you weren't in.
You look fine.
It's nice to be back.
You're looking well yourself.
"Sorry to be late, my dear."
In an argument at the club.
What's on the program?
"I thought we'd go to Stewart's, if that's agreeable."
Excellent!
"But, while it's on my mind, Harry there's something we must straighten out."
I've gone through enough with Beatrix over this.
"I may be getting old and crotchety, but I won't put up with it anymore."
I'm afraid you must take her off my hands as soon as possible.
"Oh, Father!"
"Well, Sir Charles, that's..."
"Of course, I insist on all the trimmings:"
"Wedding at St. Margaret's, Bishop Manners, reception."
"- Yeah, I was in there yesterday."
- You were in there yesterday?
It's the DEA building.
"Yeah, why were you in there?"
"I was by there, yesterday."
I drove by.
I know the building.
Thanks for this.
Rene says the building we followed the guy into is where the DEA has offices.
"So he's working for them, or working with them, or using their facilities."
"- Somehow, he's connected."
- Looks that way.
- How do you know he's DEA?
"- I don't know, that's the point."
"He was seen going into the DEA building, so he's got a relationship of some kind."
"Come on, you've got to help me out."
"All right, I'll look in to it."
"I had a conversation with Dante, planted the idea of him partnering with Phan's crew."
- He's thinking about it.
- Good.
We have another problem.
"We gotta deal with this DEA agent, or whoever he is, who's looking to kidnap Reardon."
We need Reardon here and able to play.
I don't wanna make that call.
Let me see if I can work some back channels.
"I can poke around, see if the DEA cares about this guy, or what his game is."
It's Julianna.
"I am allowed to talk to my lawyer in private, I think."
I am in the immigration jail.
They say I am in violation of my visa and they are asking about working for the escort service.
- Can you help me?
- All right.
"You should feel great, ma'am."
"That was a solid, important defeat."
"I'm gonna go change my clothes... croak to the nation, and then I'm going back to bed."
This is good.
Moyes is threatening to go to the floor for an official investigation into what happened today.
- This is bad.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm in the middle of this.
"Does this mean I'm implicated, too?"
You know what.
Just say no even if it does.
"Well, Gary, you said you were important."
I can testify to that.
"Ben, this is one of those little hiccups that you said was not gonna happen, so I'm gonna leave this in your capable hands."
"Mike, you have to deny this like you've never denied anything before."
So lie?
The one thing I've been trying not to do?
"Look, I wouldn't ask you to do anything I wouldn't do myself."
"And while that isn't true, find some comfort in it."
"- Okay, Gary?"
- Nope.
"I will work on putting forward a new, streamlined"
Families First Bill before Congress in the near future.
She sounds like an underwater Bob Dylan.
It is actually quite difficult to understand what she's saying.
Children from impending climate Armageddon.
Which may be a good thing.
And God bless America.
And we're out.
"Thank you, ma'am."
Okay... oh.
"Okay, thank you very much, guys."
"Well, I can't even remember the name."
Flett-giordano syndrome.
And you're welcome.
What?
You started the rumor?
"Well, now you can beat the dead girl... at her own game."
But-- but you can't just say that I have a disease.
I've never even heard of it.
"Well, no one has."
That's the beauty of it.
"Uh, Victoria Chase."
"Yes, I'll hold for people magazine."
Elka.
I need a list of really fun things... to do in Cleveland.
"Will's coming, and we haven't really... spoken much since the divorce, and I really wanna reconnect with him."
"So if you were a 20-year-old boy, what would you wanna do with your mom?"
Watch her buy me beer?
"Hey, joy."
Where you been?
"Okay, don't go all Melanie on me, but I decided to take your suggestion... and I met with a couple of potential therapists."
Wow.
How did it go?
They're all so nosy.
Asking me questions about... my childhood and feelings and sex... and saying I need to come in four times a week.
"I mean, who can talk about themselves for that long?"
"And then at age 12, I decided becoming an actress... would be the best way to serve humanity."
"No, no, no, thank you."
"Oh, Elka."
You are a genius.
"Elka came up with this Internet rumor... that I have this very, very promotable deadly disease."
"Well, I'm sure nothing could go wrong with that."
Oh.
Fuckin' figure it out.
Better not forget those fuckin' all-dressed chips.
No ketchup chips neither.
WAYNE:
Figure it out.
Somebody really ought to write a letter.
"They do got six different types of Cap'n Crunch, though."
How do you know that?
Saw a comedian talks about it on the Juste Pour Rires.
"Can't remember his name, though."
"Good guy, though?"
A little long-winded for my taste.
"But, yeah, a pretty good guy."
"Well, glad to hear he's a good guy at least."
They have running water down there?
"Anyhoo, the evening went so well that, uh, we got up to a little bits of a foolin' around."
Did you French her?
WAYNE:
"Kind of out of line there, Dary."
- Did you go up her shirt?
"- Now you're really out of line, Dary."
"We did French, that much I will reveal."
"Well, you already revealed that much, might as well just tell us if you went up her shirt."
"It's impolite to kiss and tell, Dary."
"I don't like to kiss and tell, but..."
"The Frenchin's tooks a hard left turn, from which I have yets to recover."
Do you wanna know what?
"I'm not asking you to kiss and tell, 'cause that's impolite."
But...
I'm kind of curious.
"Yeah, Dan, kiss and tell."
I'm sure you boys have had a couple  of curve balls thrown your way betwixt the sheets.
"Right there, it's good."
All right.
"My brother Drew loved karate, and he didn't take lessons."
"All he had to do was see somebody do something, and then he could copy it."
"Today, you'd call that a ""music producer."""
Chris!
"Breathe, breathe!"
Ahhhh...
What are you doing?
Practicing karate.
What are you going to do with karate?
My father didn't see the reason of learning anything that didn't get you a job.
"So how's school, Chris?"
"You working on anthropology or paleontology, something complicated, I bet."
My mother thought I was learning all kinds of things 'cause I went to a white school.
"Nope, it's just regular arithmetic."
Y'all hear that?
White kids are working on arithmetic.
"Around here, they're still doing math."
My mother always thought bigger words meant something better.
"Okay, say the blessing, baby."
Where's the meat?
We don't have any.
Didn't you buy some porchops?
"No, that meat was too expensive."
I know we got some canned Spam or some Vienna sausage or bacon...
or beef jerky.
"Some... mean, what kind of meal is that without meat?"
It's a vegetarian meal.
Do I look like a vegetarian to you?
I work 60 hours a week.
I lift papers and boxes all night.
The Baroness was his mistress once.
"It was said, yes."
"I am sure of it, but it is precisely to deprive me of this suspicion that Norbert maintained the evening."
"You must get out of the bath, Princess, or you will be late."
"No, little Nadine, wearing an opal bracelet is old fashioned."
I'll take this.
And this.
"This way, you look like the Holy Virgin."
I am neither one nor the other.
This syncopated melody which contrasts with the constant rythm of the drums is really exciting.
"To dance, perhaps, but it's not worth Mozart."
"Dear friend, one can love Mozart and jazz."
The only thing interesting you is religious music.
"Dear Mr Fandor, I devour your articles."
This Dollon case is very exciting.
So you like that much crime stories?
"Yes, when I do not live them."
"It's true, you have been visited by"
Fantômas in your bathtub a few years ago.
"Do not talk about it, especially tonight."
I hope that he will be hanged very soon.
"Dear princess, I think you should not provoke him."
Even in word.
To hell with him.
Do you believe in the devil?
His supreme skill is to convince people he doesn't exist.
- Sorry.
- You're hurt?
"Madam, I am confused."
Excuse me.
It is nothing at all.
I'll freshen up.
Until hit means you're alive!
We know the hiding place of Mickey.
It is an hour that we feel the stench.
"Understand, understand."
"Excuse me now, first and after."
I did not know how to reach you.
"Before the fuse burning, you were gone."
I remember.
I tried.
"LeBaron has found hanging in your window and thanks to a photo of your cousin on ""him"", take him to the apartment in the face that I had to empty."
"- It's the most, have not understood anything!"
- And Mickey?
You have done?
I destroy everything I love.
"We repeat, chin."
"Watch the Venini, it's not destroyed at all."
"Indeed, you know that was a lover of my mother?"
He discovered that the love had no money for this animal.
He was a thug that proved that he did not have the means to offer what he thought it could throw away.
"And now, no longer, does not want more, do not know."
"Thank you, I do."
Here is the soup my first Venini mistreated.
Mickey has shaken the tree
Matalon and the bad the gate waiting to ...
"If you are a man, don't continue lying there."
He is the man under discussion now.
"A dirty affair between men, of honor, of power."
Complaints?
Complaining about my mother?
I listen to my tears ...
Want to taste my love?
Love makes miracles.
"Well, he's coming to work with me, so I guess that's the plan, if that's still the plan."
Up to you.
There are a few things around here that need repairing.
"All right, kids, go get your things for school."
I'll be at the car.
- Michael.
- I call front seat!
Come on!
"My turn, Jared!"
You got it yesterday!
"Now, you're released into my custody until this case is solved, Michael, so if I let you stay, you do understand you can't leave."
"Yeah, of course, I'll do whatever you want."
That's the least I owe you.
"And, listen, I'm, uh,"
I'm sorry again for putting you through this.
"After today, this is all behind us and you can get back to focusing on your repair shop."
You find a space?
Got a few I'm looking at.
"I'm gonna pay you back every dime, you know-- with interest."
And free repairs for life.
"Hey, tell your man Gibbs I'll miss him."
You lay off Special Agent Gibbs.
This hasn't been easy on him either.
"Eh, I don't like the way he looks at me."
He looks at everybody like that.
"Where is he, Leon?"
"According to my morning brief, you recovered a knife from the suspect."
It came back negative;
it's not our weapon.
Then what next?
Could Michael be a flight risk?
He's at my house with his sister.
Come to the window
"All those windows out there, I'm behind one of them"
What do you want?
I've had it I'm getting out
"Don't leave me, Elizabeth"
Where are you going?
Somewhere you'll never find me
I'll find you I don't give up
"Sweet dreams, Elizabeth"
How many?
Two thousand tenants.
Fascinating.
"In addition, we can handle up to 5,000 visitors a day."
That's a lot of people to have over for drinks.
"You have 80 miles of wiring, piping, cables..."
- In this apartment?
"- No, over the whole building."
That's a relief.
There's a restaurant in the foyer which serves what we consider the finest seafood.
We also have a gift shop and a wedding chapel.
- Mother will like that.
"- Oh, Mother wants you married, huh?"
Mother wants herself married.
It's looking pretty good now that she's got this aluminum siding salesman from Toronto.
I think they're going to move here.
She wants to be close to me.
Maybe we can show her one of our two-bedroom apartments.
"Well, I'm afraid not."
I was lying.
No aluminum siding salesman.
No mother.
I've developed this strange sense of humor and it sometimes gets me into trouble.
"You know, I got this one Pseudochromis a pain in the ass fish of all time."
"If I move a piece of coral two inches, he won't eat, he don't socialize."
If I change his food mix a bit he acts like you're a heinous criminal.
- This fish aggravates me so much--
- What's the point?
The point is that someone has to ask themself:
"""Is the fish worth it?"" That's what it comes down to."
"Is it worth the aggravation, his pain in the ass ways?"
You're not a fish.
"You are a person, and you can talk."
I should have expressed myself better.
I should have said:
"""It makes me nervous, you giving me something."""
"And,""I'll get used to it, though."""
"And,""Thank you very much."""
How am I communicating?
Good.
- Who did you go up there with?
- Just some friends.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- Yeah.
You asked about Greg today.
- His marriage has problems?
"- Yes, he was asking what it was like to be separated."
"If I was glad, did I do the right thing?"
- What did you say?
- That it was tough.
"That I was unhappy, but if I got a shot at something again I might be able to do something with it."
I've learned a lot too.
"And I know what you mean, feeling like you'd take better advantage if you had another chance."
"Johnny, I'm seeing someone."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Let's go home together.
I have a friend waiting downstairs.
Welcome back Father!
"Well, hello there."
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
But I came to greet you.
How did you know I was going to be here?
"Well, you said in the letter that you'd be coming back on the train with someone from the museum, so I thought you'd be here."
That's pretty smart.
I have some business to attend to.
It won't take long.
Would you like to come along?
We could get something to eat.
Wouldn't I be in the way?
No.
I'm going to meet someone from a textbook publisher.
They want to use something I wrote for a Japanese textbook.
"Keep your elbow up, but keep this shoulder down."
"Father, Numata is really annoying."
Why?
Because he hangs around mother.
Because he's her manager.
"If he says something he shouldn't to mother or Shinako,"
I'm going to challenge him to a duel.
A duel?
That's pretty extreme.
The ruins of our family's old house are overgrown with weeds.
"Mother and Shinako are thinking of putting a dance studio here, right?"
"Yeah, but not if they don't have the money."
"By the way, when I was in Kyoto,"
I saw a camera magazine with Shinako's portrait in it.
Takehara probably took that picture.
"Thank you, sahib."
"- Hello, boy."
"- Hello, mate."
"You're alive, anyway."
What's this?
I'll chop you down right away.
"So there you are, you white-livered elephant-stealing treasure hunter."
"Look at you, hanging there like a lamb in a butcher's shop."
Where's the troop?
"There's no troop, and the Guru has us."
We right walked into it.
You mean to tell me you didn't bring the troop?
What a brain!
"I round up every Thug in India, and you mess it up with that pygmy brain!"
I couldn't face my own men if I brought them to witness your shame... disgracing Her Majesty's uniform.
Shame?
They're doing this to me to find out where the column is.
They plan to ambush and massacre the Colonel and the whole troop.
"- You didn't tell them, did you?"
- Not me.
So I suppose you think you're a hero?
- That's right.
- A hero.
Don't make me laugh.
Every man at the post looking for these blighters... and I reconnoiter adroitly and encounter them... while you cowards hide behind your telegraph poles in Tantrapur.
Who's a coward?
"- Untie him, will you?"
- Yes.
Untie me.
I said untie him!
"Sgt. Ballantine, untie that man!"
"You displease me greatly, and I ignore the both of you."
Girls like that
This is good news for Bebi
This means similar boys will pop up
What are those guys called?
Fakes?
Correct!
"For Bebi, it'd be like:"
"""These fake Otakus..."""
"""...barging into our territory"""
"""Anime isn't a fashion item."
Hey!
"Don't come!"""
But it's all a matter of perception
Let's consider things differently
What?
Who is better?
Fakes or the real thing?
"Well, obviously the real thing..."
Oh!
"A fake and real Otaku, there is no competition"
This victory came only because you held out so long
You are the classic case where society caught up to you
Success in your youth is horrible.
Shinsho wouldn't have been a master that way
So start now!
Go work hard and fuck everything
A spearing soul is justice.
"Take your spear of sexuality and swing it to the heavens, like the spear of Longinus"
"Now it's your turn to hunt the female dragon... no, a pussy cat"
"Me, the hunter..."
"Yes, of course"
Ok!
"I'll give you a lift, whereever you're going."
"Tell your fucking Minister,"
I clean up this city all by myself.
That I defend the law in spite of the laws.
Raising the rats against each other.
It's an art rarely appreciated.
Are you going to get me my medal?
I'll tell everything!
I can't go further on.
Candy?
Don't swallow the pit.
one last detail you've missed.
Mary...
I tracked her down less than a year ago.
I'm her father.
"Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Libya!"
"Albania, Egypt, Nicaragua: ""War."""
"""I often have this strange and penetrating dream of an unknown woman..."
"""Whom I love and who loves me..."""
"""Do not spoil this tender act of being or being not."
"""For I have lived up to our pact, awaiting heart is all I've got."""
"""Wisen up, Pain, and hold still."
"""Were you demanding the night?"
"It's coming down, at will."""
"""Black air, envelops the city, bring peace to some, and to some the pity."""
He's been in there for hours with that bitch of his.
Do you want to unbind him?
"He keeps the door closed, and says nothing."
"Try to shake him up, for fuck's sake, or we'll miss the big barbeque in the white city."
You are the only one.
And you didn't do anything.
"Léo, it's the Prince of Idiots."
It's only one loaf!
Sometimes it happens to be the l--l--last loaf on the shelf.
"Customer comes in and says, ""I'll take that last loaf off you."""
And I have to turn down a sale.
Do you realise wh--what it does to a shopkeeper to turn down a sale?
I know what it does to you.
You get nasty.
That is a secondary symptom.
The first thing that happens is m--me top lip goes numb.
It goes absolutely lifeless.
It lies there as dead as if it had been n--nationalised.
-
- Me moustache loses all its lustre.
-
- It's looked like that for years!
Never!
"It's been very lively in its time, has this moustache."
"No, it's me lips where rigor mortis s--suddenly sets in."
"Well, they're due for a rest, anyway!"
"It's not funny, Granville!"
"It's a hell of a place for something to die on you, right under your nose!"
A very peculiar sensation.
L--l--I have...
I have d--difficulty f--f--formulating my words.
Really?
I'm sure it's not noticeable!
Me finger ends get all constricted.
Tried taking them out of the pockets?
I don't g--go around with my hands in me p--pockets!
Not your pockets -- other people's pockets!
"Listen, if you want to succeed in business, you have to have a streak of ruthlessness."
Either that or a rich wife!
"When Stone stepped out of the front door, his career would be over."
"Good luck in the polls, Mr. Stone."
"Mr. Stone, what is this about an alleged--"
Hey!
Hey!
I don't know.
I didn't do anything!
"Then, as the cameras flashed,"
Melissa had the mother of all sneezing fits.
[Sneezes repeatedly]
"Mr. Stone, what did you do to your intern?"
I didn't do anything!
What happened back there?
Do you have a comment?
Melissa suffered from...
"Otherwise known as ""achoo syndrome."""
Achoo syndrome.
It's a genetically inherited condition.
"An exposure bright light can cause you to uncontrollably sneeze,"
"50, 60, 70 times."
"The violent sneezing caused an injury to the lining of her aorta, causing the blood to actually go between the leaves of the heart valve itself, and blood being spewed out into her chest cavity, dying within seconds."
Melissa played Stone like a pro.
I need everyone out front at 7:30.
She set him up to knock him down.
[Sneezes repeatedly]
But then she went down.
Get that thing out of my face!
"God bless ya, bitch."
What do you say we run through this one?
"- Yeah, one more time."
"- All right, let's do it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry and the Atrics."
How long's my lunch hour?
An hour.
"Meanwhile, Jay really had arranged some great work experience for Simon, freezing his arse off at a disgusting plant-hire yard."
This is shit.
I don't wanna do this for a living.
"Nah, it's all right!"
"We'll be able to drive the diggers soon, I reckon."
Jay?
Why have you stopped?
"This is work experience, not standing-around-being-a-useless-twat experience."
You don't need any experience at that - you're the expert!
"Sorry, Dad, we only stopped for a moment."
This is well knackering.
"You'd better get used to it, cos with your brains you'll be fucking lucky to get a job throwing shit into a skip!"
This isn't exactly how you described it.
"Get many Valentine's cards, Simon?"
- Just the one.
- One more than Jay's ever got.
- I got plenty.
"- Don't worry, there's a girl out there for you."
You just need to find a desperate bird that likes the smell of BO and blokes with tiny cocks!
"Now get back to work,"
I ain't paying you to sit on your scrawny arse.
Nice.
- All right?
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you should be at work?
- They let me go home at lunch.
You jammy bastard.
"Si, what's all this I hear about you having a fight with Danny Moore?"
What?
!
"If I sell my Porsche, that'll buy me at least six months."
"Maybe by then, my investment will start to pay off."
"I guess it's pretty scary, huh?"
"I'm so sorry, Sebastian."
Pete?
Pete!
- Hi.
- Maggie.
You seriously didn't have to come see me off.
"- No, I did."
"- No, you didn't."
I've got pretty good instincts when it comes to breakups.
They teach us situational awareness in boot camp.
You were sending some very clear signals.
No!
"No, I wasn't sending clear signals."
That's the thing.
"Uh, you barely dressed up to see me, wouldn't even kiss me, and that diner..."
- Kind of the opposite of romantic.
- I know.
I know.
I...
I've been trying really hard to keep you at bay so I wouldn't screw this up like I have my other relationships.
What are you talking about?
It's just...
I've made a lot of mistakes in the past.
And I don't want to repeat them.
So I'm just gonna be honest with you and hope that you don't want to break up with me after I say all this.
"The fact is, I sleep with people way too soon..."
Or people who are just wrong for me and think it's love.
"Because I totally confuse sex with love, and then I get my heart broken or make huge mistakes."
And I really like you.
If the key was already in the keyhole... then how did your fingerprints... get on the middle barrel of the key?
"I mean, if you had only turned the key, like you just said... then your fingerprints wouldn't be there, right?"
The fact of the matter is... when you broke the pane and put your hand in... the key was already in your hand.
I...
I didn't do...
"Natasha Malhotra, you are hereby arrested on the charges of murder of..."
Don't even think about it.
Kabir?
No.
Lqbal Chand Malhotra.
The mastermind of this game.
That's right.
Place your pistol on the table.
Out.
"You too, Mr. Menon."
"If I had a pistol, you wouldn't have been alive right now."
"In that case, thank you for not carrying a gun."
Natasha.
Her gun.
"May I ask you something, Mr. Menon?"
When did you piece the puzzle together?
At the hospital.
If I hadn't seen the photograph...
I wouldn't have known that you and Kabir were identical twins.
"And they say, twins... don't give birth to twins."
"It's over, Malhotra."
Game over.
It's your game that is over.
Coming here alone was a huge mistake.
Natasha... go and wait for me on the boat.
Some things aren't meant to be done in the presence of children.
It could corrupt their minds.
Wait.
"Look, they only had a few seconds."
It wasn't enough time to get an exact location.
We're fine for a little while.
Where are you going?
I have to stop a train.
I-80 is secured from Cheyenne to Grand Island.
We now control the area between Kearney and Hastings.
I-70 is turning out to be a challenge.
There are organized road gangs controlling much of the interstate.
I've also been told by a patient in our medical unit to expect a significant skirmish between two towns in northwest Kansas:
New Bern and Jericho.
What is the location of those towns?
"CZ-12, Quadrant Four."
We've tracked the terror suspect to within 200 miles of that area.
Capture of this suspect is a top priority for President Tomarchio and the administration.
Do you understand?
"Should I re-prioritize, sir?"
Immediately.
Go to Jericho and crush the skirmish.
"Once the area's clear, we will begin our search for the terrorists"
I'm gonna ask Mimi to marry me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
She can't cook;
she's never seen nine innings of baseball in her life;
she hates my clothes... but I love her.
And I'm happy.
"Jake, I don't want to die today."
You're gonna make it out of here.
That I promise.
Hawkins!
"Forgive us, Captain."
We will maintain your life-support conditions while you return to your ship.
Please accept our apologies.
Captain to Enterprise.
Captain to Enterprise.
"[ Spock ] Captain, we're receiving you."
"Beam me up, Mr. Spock."
We're free to go.
"Warping down, Captain."
Our warp factor--4.
"Approach channels clear, Captain."
"Colony Beta 6 clears us for normal approach, sir."
"Normal orbit approach procedures, Mr. Sulu."
Captain.
"Still thinking about Trelane, is that it?"
"For the record, how do we describe him-- pure mentality, force of intellect, embodied energy, superbeing?"
"He must be classified, sir."
"God of war, Mr. Spock."
"Well, I hardly find that fitting."
"Then a small boy, and a very naughty one."
It will make a strange entry in the library banks.
He was a very strange small boy.
He was probably doing things comparable to the mischievous pranks you played when you were a boy.
"Mischievous pranks, Captain?"
"Yes-- dipping little girls' curls in inkwells, stealing apples from the neighbors' trees, tying cans on--"
Forgive me...
Mr. Spock.
I should have known better.
"I shall be delighted, Captain."
You'll enjoy Commodore Travers.
He sets a good table.
"Ah, ah..."
"Wow, my favorite little kids are not so little anymore."
Are you staying long this time?
He's not staying.
"Kayla, Jared, go get ready for bed."
I'll be there in a minute.
I want him out of my house now.
The only time you ever go over my head is because of Michael.
"Jackie, calm down."
What problem are you bailing him out of now?
It was a misunderstanding.
Always is.
"He was trying to do the right thing, he ended up a murder suspect."
A murder suspect?
"We have the killer in custody, Jackie."
He didn't do it.
"Of course he didn't, but how does he get in these messes in the first place?"
And with you dragged into it?
- This is different.
- Is it?
"I mean, his whole life has been one bad decision after another, always knowing that you're gonna be there to save the day."
People change.
"Leon, you have fathered him long enough."
When are you gonna let him stand up on his own two feet?
"He's getting ready to open a repair shop, Jackie."
His repair shop.
And two years ago he was going to finish college.
"A year before that, he was, he was selling that, that, that miracle drink."
"Well, at least he's trying, Jackie."
He's come a long way from where he was.
You do not need to remind me where he was.
"You know that I love him and I always will, and I had to let him go and I ju..."
We've saved a piece for some friends in Nevada to make sure that things go smoothly back home.
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
"So, enjoy!"
-Happy birthday!
-L'chaim!
I saw an interesting thing happen today.
A rebel was being arrested by the military police.
"Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade he had in his jacket."
He killed himself and took a captain of the command with him.
-Those rebels are lunatics.
-Maybe so.
"But it occurred to me, that the soldiers are paid to fight, the rebels aren't."
-What does that tell you?
-They can win.
This country has had rebels for 50 years.
It's in their blood.
"I know, I've been coming here since the Twenties."
We were running molasses from Havana when you were a baby.
The trucks were owned by your father.
Michael.
I'd rather we talked about this when we're alone.
The two million never got to the island.
It mustn't be known that you held back the money because you worried about the rebels.
"Sit down, Michael."
Sit down.
"If I could only live to see it, to be there with you."
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.
"Here we are, protected."
"Free to make our profits without Kefauver, the goddamn Justice Department and the FBI."
"90 miles away, in partnership with a friendly government."
90 miles.
It's nothing.
What are you drinking?
Water.
Seriously?
"If it was a joke, would it be funny?"
"No, no, I mean, to each his own."
We interrupt this game to bring you this breaking news story right now.
"Jim O'Bannon, host of The O'Bannon files, a sometimes controversial news and opinion show viewed by millions, was found dead just minutes ago outside a downtown restaurant."
At this time...
Barkeep.
...police tell us that apparently he was shot to death at close range alongside two of his bodyguards.
Jim O'Bannon was 58.
We now return you back to the game.
"So Jim O'Bannon, huh?"
"That's kind of crazy, him getting killed."
"Him being a big TV star and all, don't you think?"
Fame doesn't make you invincible.
"Yeah, and I always thought he was a bit of a jackass, but nobody deserves to die, you know."
I'm Allan.
How you doing?
"What is this, some kind of fag bar?"
"No, I was just..."
I'm sorry.
"I was just trying to make some friendly conversation, that's all."
"It's like I got ""Everlast"" stamped across my face, man."
Like a human punching bag.
"Can I have another one, please?"
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
"Whatever, man."
It's cool.
"When I spoke to you earlier,"
I must have given off the impression that I was game for conversation.
Any why would that happen?
Kyle's covered all the angles.
I'm sure he has.
Then why don't you just relax?
"Kyle's plan has to work, otherwise he won't get to Amanda before she's gone for good."
?
"Think about Amanda, how much you want to see her, to hold her... to touch her."
"Josh, eww."
What?
He needs an emotional trigger.
The other thing I need is silence.
Good idea.
"Lori, out!"
What did I do?
This is man's work.
I so wanna make a joke right now.
She could have stayed.
"Yeah, but I'm about to get all mushy, and I didn't want her to hear it."
"Listen, Kyle,"
I get how messed up you are right now.
"If anybody told me I couldn't see Andy ever again,"
"I'd be a mess, too."
But you've got to pull it together.
You really think I can do this?
Knowing how much you care about Amanda?
Zero doubts.
Come on.
"Deep breaths, just take it slow, one bulb at a time."
"By focusing,"
"I could control the flow of electrons along the wire, much like driving a car along a narrow road."
"In this case, the road led into the Trager house's electrical system, which in turn connected to the neighborhood transformer."
"Through the transformer, I was able to reach Amanda's house and gain access to the house's electrical system."
My father made me promise no fighting outside the academy
That's pretty useless
I'll teach you
Come here
Hold this
Grab this tight Hold it in front of your belly
Hold it really straight
Lift it straight up and...
Bring it down
What's going on here?
Shinbo's practicing vengeance
For the play?
"No, the genuine article"
Swing it down hard And shout
Oto san What would you do in his place?
I'd learn how to take a punch without getting hurt
How's that?
Let 'em hit you where it doesn't hurt and call it quits
Who taught you that pathetic trick?
"My dad, before he died"
What a legacy!
Your mom's a real terror...
"Yup, it's come in real handy."
"Thanks, Dad"
Don't force it
"Give it here Hold this, straight, straight"
When you're ready to strike...
That's it
"Shinbo, come on, hit me like you mean it"
"Hey, that's dangerous"
"Come and get me, crybaby"
"You want to win, right?"
Maybe she still won't go out with you.
"Oh, god this is a fucking disaster."
"No actually, it's OK, it's fine."
- I can move away and change schools.
- My night hasn't been brilliant either.
"At least next week will be better, get my teeth into some journalism."
"Oh, yeah, the paper want to keep me on so there's no room for ya."
Tell me you're joking?
They said I was the best work experience they'd ever had.
This is an urgent message for William MacKenzie.
Please make his way to the front entrance as his mother is here to pick him and his friends up.
This is an urgent message for William MacKenzie.
Please come to the front where your mother is waiting to collect you.
"Oh, for fuck's sake!"
It had been a strange week.
"I hadn't experienced much actual work, but I had learnt some valuable lessons."
Never work with children or animals.
Don't call your valentine a porn star.
You're a nasty little virgin.
"And despite what I'd thought, a girl touching your penis is not always a good thing."

I love martinis.
They heal all wounds.
After about 1000 of them I'm still amazed.
But your poor liver has had to work so hard.
"I know, I know."
- I'm very proud of her.
- Your liver's female?
I was bowled over by her journey.
And that was priceless.
Stop sticking your weenie into what's not yours!
"You know other ways to prove your cocksmanship, don't you?"
Shut it!
"Watch it, Albert..."
The good lord rears his ugly head when a prick tries not to understand.
"As long as you punch me, Albert!"
When you're punching me I know you're alive!
"At last, we got the address for Mickey's hidey-hole!"
We've been in the know for an hour.
Savvy?
You'll understand.
Sorry for now.
Sorry for before.
Sorry for after.
I didn't know how to get hold of you.
"By the time I snuffed out the fuse, you'd disappeared."
I called back.
I looked.
"Le Baron tracked you down, he looked up the name of your cousin, thanks to her centerfold in that nudie mag."
"He bought out this apartment, just across from yours, because I asked them to."
Top dollar!
They never understood my caprices!
And Mickey?
What did you do to him?
I destroy everything I love!
"I told you, I am a liar."
"The Venom is here, not entirely eradicated."
"By the way, did you know he used to be one of my mother's lovers?"
"He just found out that you can't put a price tag on love, this venomous man."
A small time punk proved to him that he couldn't keep something that he thought he could junk.
really?
"well, you know that wink's gonna die, and you're gonna get promoted."
- i can't believe wink never promoted me.
he promised.
"baby, he promised."
- what a loser!
"you know, i thought, of all the losers in all the different trailer parks, that wayne was gonna be different."
"- he would've been, too, but behind every great man is a great woman."
- are you saying i ain't a great woman?
- you think it was better for him to buy you a harley than to go to college?
- it was for me.
"- oh, look around."
you really think that this was better for you in the long run?
- let me guess -- that's me in the box.
i ain't afraid of dying.
- look around.
funeral parlor's pretty empty.
- so?
it's not like i'd be around to care.
"though, actually, i did think wayne might be here."
he was pretty good about obligations.
- wayne died a year ago.
saw a commercial for i.t.t. technical college and began crying so hard his throat done closed up and couldn't get no more air.
strange occurrence.
suffocated to death.
- hmm.
see?
look.
somebody loves me.
here comes bob.
"he's always good about obligations, too."
"- i have laid awake many a night, thinking to myself,"
I'll give you back your man-goggles.
Here.
"I just thought we might run into some cute boys on the way home, but it's probably best we didn't."
That's a pretty angry lip you got there.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
Wow.
Does everybody's get this red?
"Well, you had quite a bit of growth."
"I was gonna have that lady take a crack at your arms, but she had already sweat through her apron."
"Oh, my gosh!"
I already have 100 likes on my picture of my new nails.
"Um, FYI, I'm..."
"I'm sort of in the background there, screaming mid-wax."
400 people liked this photo.
I was not one of them.
"My art teacher made a pithy ""blue period"" comment, and my top prom prospect suddenly found a girlfriend in Canada."
Do you think I could get my sneakers back?
"Ohh, I threw them away with the rest of your clothes when you were in the changing room."
"I thought about saving them for the housekeeper, but I couldn't remember if she had a son."
"Look, I've tried really hard to put up with a lot since..."
What's going on?
"Oh, I just had so much fun with you!"
We don't do this enough.
I just wish there was something that you could teach me.
Uh-huh.
"Wait, what about your Judo stuff?"
Uh you're not interested in that.
No!
No!
I am!
Come on!
"As soon as he got pinched, he ratted everybody out."
I know where he is.
He's hiding out.
Know what I'm sayin'?
Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that?
"No, not at all."
"That way they got nothing, uh?"
Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before.
But now he's asking me to go down to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.
That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.
"Wherever you move me, I asked once and I'll tell you again I don't wanna go any place that's cold."
You don't have a choice.
"Ed, come on."
Whoever fucking controls it just no place cold.
Do that for me.
"He's bronchial, that's why."
If he's legitimately bronchial we may take that into consideration.
I'd like to go someplace not cold.
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?
What about them?
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?
Don't I have some kind of contact with them?
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
"You mean to tell me if something happens to my parents and they get sick, I can't see them?"
Maybe something could be worked out if they're sick.
"If there's extraordinary circumstances-- l can't do this. I can't do this, Henry."
I can't leave my parents.
"Karen, I told you before."
Where you been?
- Heaven.
- Tell me where you been.
"What, are you fucking wearing lipstick?"
When'd you start wearing lipstick?
Where you been?
Tell me where you been and don't lie.
"Don't tell me you been at Tina's, 'cause your mother already colluded on that lie and I'm not buying it."
"- I don't have to lie to you, I don't have to tell you anything."
- You're dating that nigger again.
"- Yeah, I don't date niggers, Dad, I just fuck 'em."
- There's something wrong with you.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- There's something wrong with you.
"- Yeah, what's wrong with me?"
- Somebody should put you away.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- She's got a mouth on her.
"I mean, the way she talks."
You know what I heard?
"That all teenage girls, they got, like, a hormonal imbalance, so no matter what you do, you know, you could smack 'em and smack 'em."
"beat the shit out of them, tell them right from wrong, it ain't gonna get through."
- That's true.
"She gonna be married in another year anyway, Horace."
Let some other guy smack her out.
"- Your people do that a lot, donât' they, George?"
- Say what?
- You smack the shit out of your kids.
"- Well, I just do what my daddy did, man."
- A teenage girl hates her father.
She's supposed to.
It's a biological imperative so she doesn't fuck her father.
You complain to the collector?
Face the consequences

Why do you place the tar barrels at my door?

"Sir, are there no female members here?"
-Swarnam
-Yes coming
What do you want?
We have moved to your opposite house
We are doing house warming today
All of you must come
I may not be able to come why don't you go and attend?
Mom said a senior like you should conduct the Pooja
OK we will come
Why do you look through a lens?
Who?
Who paid you?
Stop!
You're hurting me.
Who paid you?
Marzio.
Marzio!
Marzio Catalano?
The castle guard?
He's the one who cut the balcony palings.
I saw him leaving Don Francesco's room with a saw in his hand.
"I didn't understand what he was doing at the time... but when the lord died, he gave me some money..."
A lot.
So I wouldn't talk.
"Then, at the trial, he gave me some more."
"I didn't want to hurt Beatrice, or you... but I was afraid."
There was nothing else I could do;
he threatened me.
But who gave him the money?
Marzio doesn't have a penny.
That I do not know.
Ask him yourself.
"Having examined all the evidence... the court of Rome finds Beatrice Cenci guilty of the murder... of her father, Don."
"Francesco Cenci, Roman patrician, and decrees that she must pay for this unnatural crime with the death penalty."
"In light of her age, and as a sign of clemency... punishment by quartering, which is expected for patricide... has been commuted to a less painful death by decapitation."
There were two of them.
They shot me.
Then it was Giacomo.
He ordered you to cut the balcony palings.
He gave you the money to bribe Martina.
- He's a rogue.
"I've always been a faithful servant, and I would never betray him."
"Mondale and Ferraro, path to equality."
"No, thanks."
"What are you, a Republican?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, did you catch it from your parents?"
I hear it's hereditary.
I guess I did.
"Well, if you don't want a pamphlet, here, have a pin, on me."
"I might wear it, but only because it's stylish."
"You know, if you're not a pamphlet reader, I could take you to coffee tell you all about why Mondale and Ferraro are gonna lose."
"If you're so sure they're gonna lose, why bother?"
"I don't know, it feels right."
So... coffee?
KIRSTEN:
I guess I had fate on my mind when I got you this gift.
Where on Earth did you find this?
I turned the house upside down.
"If it hadn't been for Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro, there never would have been a Seth Cohen."
There wouldn't be a Ryan.
And whoever this is going to be...
All because of that one day.
My lucky day.
My lucky day.
"Okay, I admit it-- I put way too much stock into that poem."
I'm not the girl that you thought I was.
You're not.
"You, Summer, are better."
"See, back then you were just this fantasy."
"You were this little girl, who, when I would see, you would either ignore me, or make an obscene gesture and keep on walking."
"Yeah, I kind of remember that, sorry."
But now look at you.
You fight for sea otters.
You've befriended Taylor Townsend.
Eh?
- Ah!
Talk to the manager.
- Eh?
"Say I'm your friend or something, anyway, do some negotiation."
"If you do, I'll give you this."
Also.
- What else?
Is that guy new?
"Ah, he's a recently joined apprentice."
I don't think the tempering is going well.
"No one seems to be checking it,"
I think it should be redone.
- You can tell by looking from here?
I can tell.
"Ah, he's here."
Eh?
"Wrapped up in the fragrance of chocolate, without good or bad feelings, she pops in my head."
"A chocolate that all the passion is poured into, like an extension of my own being,"
I want her to hold it in her mouth.
I want it to pour into her body.
"These kinds of dirty aspirations, brought me all the way here."
Saeko-san.
I will definitely become a chocolatier.
No matter how many years it takes.
I will become a chocolatier that everybody acknowledges.
"I will become famous enough to stay in your mind, to make you think ""I shouldn't have abandoned him back then""."
I will make you regret it.
"And then, after stealthily eating my chocolate, you will say ""C'est bon""."
That's my dream.
"Even if that voice,"
never reaches my ears.
There's paint over here too.
"Doc,give me a hand with this."
Okay.
You're right.
This is where he hid his stash in 1954.It's been waiting for him.
What are these guys thinking when they come back?
Were they all asleep?
Paint's still wet.We just missed him.
Mines are the exact same size.
Why is he painting them?
"Sandstone paint,rubber tiles... oh,my God."
Playground turf.They use it all over the city.
So the next target...
Could be any elementary school or park in San Francisco.
Whoever killed the security guard has got to be the same nut job planting land mines.
City gets a ransom note.Some crazy Korean poem in it.
"Guys says give him $651,000 and change,and he'Il tell us where the rest of the mines are."
- Pretty specific number.
- Yeah.
"Wait.How is it that you caught up with this guy,but everybody else seems to be clueless?"
I got a secret weapon.
Who are you again?
- Surprise me.
- We found where Paxton Petty's been hiding his bombs.
- And Petty?
- He left a dead security man in his wake.
And we found playground turf and spray-paint.
"Now we don't know what the spray-paint means,but the turf..."
- what color was the paint?
- The turf means he's gonna hit up a school or a park.
We don't have enough information to narrow down the search 'cause there's too many of 'em.
What color was the paint?
Just let me assure you that I am informed of everything you do
"It was Corbett, wasn't it?"
"Now, don't try and change the subject, Merle."
I would like an explanation.
What exactly did you think you were doing?
- Eloping.
- Ha ha ha.
"Well, we'll forget all that romantic nonsense for now."
But your Mr. Danny Pierce can consider himself fortunate if I don't have him arrested.
How did you know his na--
Why can't I get married?
Because you are still a child.
I'm nearly 21.
"I wasn't referring to birthdays, Merle."
"Some girls are ready for marriage at that age, but others, like yourself--"
Well... what I'm trying to say is I'm afraid that you should never get married.
You're--
You're just not well enough.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
But it's better to face it now.
There will always be unscrupulous men after your money.
No.
Not Danny.
I'm afraid so.
"I'm having him investigated, and I'm sure we will find he's nothing but a cheap fortune hunter."
That's not true.
You're lying.
Now that's enough of that kind of talk out of you.
You'll go to your room immediately.
"For punishment, you wanted to wear Grandmother's diamonds to the party."
I'm afraid that's out of the question.
I don't care.
"What is your desire, master?"
"Okay, that is a long list, but for now, if you noticed anything unusual the other night, when the families viewed the evidence, that would be a great start."
"Come to think of it, there was this one thing."
The new haircut is dreamy.
"Look, there's not a single thing funny about this, so sit down and shut up."
"All right, what do you got?"
The jewelry went poof.
Never made it to the lockup.
Did you see anyone hanging around that cart?
Sorry.
"Long gone to eBay, bro."
Get your piece of a bona fide sociopath.
You know what I'm not?
- What?
- Surprised.
I'm having serious concerns about the integrity of law enforcement right about now.
And the crapstorm keeps on coming.
"Victim's brother was at a wedding in Carmel, and he's in all the pictures."
He didn't shoot DeBray?
Came home and found his motorcycle stolen.
It's not revenge.
It's a partner.
What?
"I got to go, but new haircut is dreamy."
Roll the citizen video.
They're just loading DeBray's body on the gurney.
Can you stop right there?
"Hey, guys."
Do you got anything good here for me?
"Hitandrun, worked with specialneeds kids, won Teacher of the Year..."
great humaninterest story.
Not for us.
Why don't we toast something interesting?
Like what?
Like Geronimo there.
He's interesting.
In a pig's ass.
Don't you read the papers?
"They put Geronimo in jail, where he belongs."
"Let me ask you something, Tex."
Who's Geronimo next to Jim Corbett?
Geronimo's a man so great... that Corbett there'd have to stand on his mother's shoulders to kiss his ass.
Frank.
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.
"Do you have a gun, Tom?"
"- No, I don't."
- Good.
Then you're gonna get exactly what you deserve.
I don't know where you come from... but the manners that you arrived with are just awful.
I'm trying to imagine how you could make such a reference... to the mother of the future heavyweight champion of the world.
You ain't champion yet.
"Besides, you're acting like an asshole."
- I could go to the penitentiary over you.
"- Now, wait a minute."
"Before we start this fight, I wanna ask you one question."
- Is it about my mother?
- No.
I've said enough about her.
"If I win this fight, am I the champion of the world?"
You're not big enough.
Then what are you picking on a little fellow like me for?
"You get in a fight in a public bar, they'll discredit you from your profession."
I'm gonna save you from that.
'Give him some roses
'She loves them so.'
We'II start taking statements.
"I'm Gary Racine, Detective Sergeant provincial police."
"Jacques PIante, also Detective Sergeant."
We'II take your statements.
They mentioned 4 witnesses...
including him?
"No, it's..."
Josée Morin.
She's still in there with the doctor.
- Detective Sergeant Racine.
"- Yes, yes..."
We mustn't talk too loud.
"It's not good for her, even if she's sedated."
You gave her some...
Sedatives?
"Yes, yes."
I had no choice.
She's in a terrible state of shock.
But did she talk to you?
Yes.
She had a very bad night.
She can't remember...
"The way she speaks isn't very coherent, but I still managed to get a few bits of information on what happened."
"First of all... one, she's a woman who was at the hotel and who was having drinks with some... alcohol, and who suffered a terrible shock, which would have been preceded by a perturbation of an emotional nature... which was followed by a sort of blackout."
"But she will recall some elements, always the same ones."
I have noted that.
really?
Which ones?
That she found herself in this bedroom.
"Then... that her right cheek was tumefied,"
Do i get flowers even after a rehearsal?
"Well, i've got to send them here until i'm able to hand them to you over the footlights."
"Well, you've always got some excuse."
"Oh, jim, really, you're spoiling me with presents."
Every day it's something new.
No wonder mr.
Boyd criticizes me.
"Oh, now, he doesn't."
"Oh, yes, he does."
"No, he criticizes me because he thinks i don't know anything about women."
"Do you, jim?"
I know all i want to know about one.
But why does he avoid me?
"If i bring him here, will you be nice to him, josie, for my sake?"
"You know, it kind of worries me, the way you two have always got your claws out."
"No, i don't think you'd better... let's forget about mr."
Boyd.
Here he is!
We looked for you at the theater and the rehearsal was over- we knew sooner or later we'd find you here.
"Well, stop moaning and tell me what's up."
Vanderbilt's got the law on us.
What?
He got an injunction so we can't print any more stock.
An injunction?
It's worse than that.
We've sold more stock than we can deliver.
We're cornered.
I told you to watch out for that.
He that sells what isn't his'n must pay it back or go to prison.
"Oh... don't worry, everything is fine, josie."
Certainly- we're in a fine fix.
And this is a fine place to do business.
Are you kidding?
"And waste a chance to know something they don't, something this huge?"
"I'm the best thing that could happen to your mission, 'cause I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know about Earth."
Can you teach me how to make my human stop yelling?
Dani?
I don't think anyone can do that.
"I'm Cody, by the way."
- I'm Blades.
- Boulder.
Classified...
- That's Chase.
- And I'm Heatwave.
"So, Cody, now that you know what we are, name one good reason why we shouldn't leave this planet right now."
These tunnels like this one all over the island.
And they all end in the bunker.
Great for sneaking out of the firehouse.
Wow.
That's like a million optics set in carbon.
- So beautiful.
"- I guess, it kinda is."
So why would you ever wanna leave?
This is what everyone would expect you to act like.
See?
"Lock your legs, stick out your arms..."
You try.
Really?
"I don't know where you learned that, but no."
"Look, Cody, I understand what you're doing, but what I don't understand is how ""talking-like-this"""
has gonna make my rider long respect me.
The trick with Kade is to make him think he is in charge.
"Trust me, I've been doing it for years."
Is that part of the film?
"So we need to get in, get the number without her knowing about it."
How?
We need a woman.
Like Mr Ray Charles says... ..we've got a woman.
You must be joking if you think
"John, how many other birds do you know?"
We meet again.
Thanks again for everything you did to help me.
"Oh, don't just thank me."
How else would I know which hotel you'd be in?
"Which amoeba, scratching his crutch, not a million miles away, might know that you kept your private stuff hidden behind a map of the world?"
And tell Lenny when you were leaving?
"What is it you do for them again, Calum, you miserable little snitch?"
"I got used to having your big, cheery smile around."
Didn't want to see you leave.
And what do they have on you?
I'm guessing that sex with strangers in hotels wasn't really top of your career list.
It wasn't.
Advance warning.
I'm getting ready to do a runner as well.
"Well, as long as it's not in my direction, Calum."
I was once a police officer.
"I bet you looked lovely in that uniform, PC Rose."
Was Lenny your guv?
"Undercover, actually."
So do you think you can get us into the house?
"Yeah, I think I might just be up to it."
Sweet.
"Oh, that's the front door."
"Darling, I'll speak to you tomorrow."
OK?
I'm awfully sorry to disturb you.
"She was very nice, your girl."
"Yes, she is."
She's very nice.
"So like I said, I just want to cross a couple of T's, little stuff."
It's all just part of the process.
"By the way, sir, I was real impressed with your graciousness..."
- on the whole Senator Hanson thing.
- Oh?
"You know, in supporting her."
Real gracious.
"Well, as you know, I withdrew my name from consideration."
Right.
Right.
And I think she's a real fine choice.
Anybody that knows her knows that.
How long have you known her?
"- Oh, well, actually, I don't really..."
- I'm sorry.
"When you said, ""Anybody that knows her""..."
- I know people who know her.
- Uh-huh.
"- I'm happy to give you their names, if you'd like."
- Great.
"I don't really know her, but I've seen her several times at functions... and, uh, I think she'll do a real good job."
"Sir, can I just say that..."
I was really hoping you'd go for the position... especially after what happened on the Apachaway.
"I think people would think, in the back of their minds..."
"""This here's a guy who takes risks when the right thing's at stake."""
- Lifesaver?
"- No, thanks."
"Anyway, some real bad luck, your being right there."
Not if I'd been able to save her.
- In his office.
"Well, what have you got to say for yourselves?"
- We didn't get the plans.
"- Yes, go on."
"We trailed the girl, but she ran into a house occupied by a Bertie Wooster."
We waited all night but didn't see her come out.
"This morning Wooster appeared with his man, got into their car and we followed them."
"- Go on, go on."
- We stopped them on the road... posed as Scotland Yard men and searched them but they didn't have the plans.
They're coming here and that's why we hurried ahead to warn you.
"Yes, Mr. Manville?"
"If Mr. Bertie Wooster arrives, let me know immediately."
"So you followed the two men, forgot all about the girl, eh?"
"No, we left Burton there to watch the house."
He's going to have a long wait because I happen to have the lady in this hotel.
- What?
- I met her when she arrived and arranged to have lunch with her.
She thinks I'm going to help her find Mr. McDermott.
Now listen.
This is what I want you two to do.
And let there be no slipup this time.
Go to her room and make a thorough search of everything.
- We will.
- Just a moment.
And keep an eye on that Wooster fellow.
That's all.
- All right.
- I'll see you later.
"That's not bad, Jeeves."
We did the last mile in exactly one minute and 12 seconds.
"Begging your pardon, sir."
I think that's inaccurate.
Thank you.
Go with happiness.
"Oops, excuse me."
"Hey Tris, I really like your hair by the way."
Did you try to cut it all short and weird like that.
"Peter, why don't you take your food and sit down huh?"
Or what?
Besides I think we all should stick together now that we are officially fugitives.
Wait what do you mean by officially fugitives?
Oh you don't know?
You didn't tell Caleb?
"Yes, now Jeanine is saying that the attack on Abnegation was orchestrated by a group of regenade Divergents and their sympathizers."
So they're blaming this whole thing on us?
Yeah.
And Jeanine needed a reason to petition the council to institute martial law.
And now she has one.
Staying here at Amity is our best option for now.
We need to keep an ear to the ground and find out where the rest of Dauntless are.
- Then we can make a move.
- We need to kill Jeanine.
"I know, we're not ready yet."
"- Beatrice you're not being serious, right?"
- No I am being serious..
I'm not gonna stop until she's dead.
Tris you can't just go around killing people.
"No she's right, listen to your sister."
"Tris, I think you should go to"
Erudite and kill Jeanine yourself.
I'll stay with Caleb so you don't get him killed too.
What?
"Come on, you know... like you did your parents."
Stop!
Babs.
Call me Babs.
Or Coach.
Or whatever makes you feel comfortable.
Never.
I will never call you Coach because I promise you I am never going to enter that contest.
"Well, what about T.C. and saving the Island Hoppers?"
What about Roger and me?
"I mean, this whole deal depends on your entering this contest."
- I mean...
- Good morning.
"I am sorry about all that, believe me, and I'd do anything for T.C..."
"anything else, I mean."
Oh.
And maybe we can work something out about finding Roger.
"Oh, no, I could never accept charity."
"Well, then pay me later, but just don't talk to me about this contest."
"Ah, the contest."
"The excitement, the anticipation, the agony."
"Now, here are the items you requested, courtesy of the household account."
"Protein powder, vitamins with an emphasis on """" B"" complex, tuna for tuna shakes."
"It sounds positively revolting, but I'm sure it's quite nourishing."
"Higgins, what is this?"
Paying out of the household account?
You never pay for anything for me out of...
Wait.
How'd you find out about this?
T.C. told me his plans when I let him in last night.
"For once I agreed with him, and so does Mr. Masters."
It's a capital idea.
Robin?
You talked to Robin?
- Play the band!
ABCDEFGHI...
Matter is little serious.
No!
Hit high pitch!
How long will you sing the same line?
Come to the point.
"Boss, we've memory loss..."
That's it!
"Boss, we've memory loss..."
Past has vanished...
life is at full blast...
Hit the lucky chance...
What's this in between lines from film 'Chandramukhi?
"I don't remember anyone, I've lost my memory..."
Not like Rajini but like Ghajini...
Brain is empty...
totally it's gone...
"I'm having a good time, don't keep your face dull..."
Ex-girl friends who have left me...
And those silly clashes...
I'm saying thanks to the mental peace I'm enjoying now...
"Good or bad, sweet or bitter, she's not seen  flash is not leaving me..."
Life without love is better...
Who will bear that nonsense all the life...
Poor Devadas fell for Paru...
Your lover is somebody else's wife...
This life is better...
It's better than intoxication...
Silence is much better...
Spend life with empty heart...
Always fresh is the base of life...
"Just because a man has one perfect rose in his garden at home, it doesn't mean that he can't appreciate the flowers of the field."
-Does that make sense?
"-Oh, sure."
"But while you were out sniffing around these other little wildflowers, didn't the rose kind of fade?"
Practically out of the picture.
That's why I reformed.
"Hello, Brandon."
I'm very glad to see you.
"Rosa, this is Isabel Lorrison, an old friend of mine."
-Rosa Senta.
-How are you?
I think I'd better be getting back to my friends.
"-Yes, why don't you?"
-Isabel...
And thank you for keeping Mr. Bourne amused.
You're good for a few laughs yourself.
So long.
You've answered all my questions.
"A year of travel hasn't improved your manners, Isabel."
Was it my manners that interested you?
What interests me now is what you want.
Nothing that should frighten you.
"If you have something to say, say it at once."
-I haven't much time.
"-Oh, not here."
Why not?
Is your Mr. Dawning jealous?
Naturally.
"I may be a year older, Bran, but I haven't lost my touch."
"Let's go for a little walk, for old time's sake, or even just to prove that you're not afraid of the dark."
"You see, Bran, it's not so very dark."
"On the contrary, it's the blaze of noon, Isabel, revealing everything."
"As for my abandoning Claudia, she and I have come to terms with that."
And I really don't want your opinion on that subject either.
"Well, I should think you'd be happy for her."
"At least now, she has a real man in her bed."
I know what you're trying to do.
And it won't work.
What you and Claudia do is your business.
"I don't wanna hear about it, I don't wanna know about it."
So much for congratulations then.
Adam.
My congratulations to you.
My condolences to Claudia.
"- Hello, darling."
- Claudia.
- You look radiant.
"- Oh, thank you."
You must have had at least four job offers since this morning.
"No, job hunting is a thing of the past."
This came when you left the house.
Listen to this.
"""This is to advise you officially that you've inherited the oil well titled Blaisdel-Lankershim One at the bequest of Walter Lankershim."
"Your late husband's partner."""
It's incredible.
Congratulations.
"Now, have you decided what you're gonna do with your money?"
Aside from buying me an extra Ferrari or two.
But I don't even know how much is involved.
I know there's a lot of it.
I know what I'm gonna do with my independence though.
"Nobody's ever going to treat me like Claudia, the poor relative again."
I'm gonna use it.
"- And you know what, darling?"
I was looking to catch.
I didn't know it was human until I checked the snare this morning.
- God rest his soul.
- (knocking on door)
- (indistinct chatter) - ♪♪♪
(woman):
My detective agency is at your disposal.
"- I appreciate that, Miss Pink."
- How can I help?
I have just learned some distressing news about the baby William and I adopted.
"Well, about his deceased mother actually."
What is it?
She wasn't born with a complete reproductive system.
She couldn't have been Roland's natural mother.
"Well, that must have been a bolt out of the blue."
It never occurred to either of us to question his parentage.
And what do you want me to do?
Find out if his natural mother is alive.
- Can I ask for your discretion?
- Absolutely.
What do you know about the mother and her husband?
Not much.
Nigel Braxton was a safecracker from England.
"His wife, Joanne, was from Stratford, Ontario."
I think her maiden name was Perly.
And they have no surviving family.
- How old is the child?
- About 9 months.
Are you sure that you want to know the truth?
What do you mean?
It's a question that I ask all of my clients.
What I find out for them isn't always what they'd hoped for.
Tells off a Cabinet member like that he's your enemy for life.
Secretary of Urban Development that's the hand that feeds the cities.
"You know, Senator they say a man's stature is determined by his enemies, not his friends."
It also got you the cover of Time.
You're going national Mayor Pappas.
People magazine next.
"That ""stature"" thing."
Who said that?
"I believe I did, a minute ago."
I was having an acute attack of self-importance but it's about to come to an end because here's the man to cut me down to size.
"Kevin, we missed you."
"Sorry, folks."
Didn't mean to interrupt you.
"Kevin's been busy today, I'll bet."
This must be Mrs. Marquand.
It's been quite a day for you.
We don't want any stray bullets around Madison Square Garden.
Ignore the senator.
He keeps a little anchor to windward.
Don't we all?
Shouldn't we return to the burning issue of the day?
The convention?
We'll turn this city upside down for you.
We'll stage the right kind of convention.
What kind is that?
The kind that'll reelect the President.
Where will you go?
"Second cities, like Chicago?"
Resonating with memories of Hubert in '68?
California?
"The land of Jerry Brown and Tom Hayden, that nominates a Mondale."
"You could go to Miami, but it's Casablanca."
"In here, with us."
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
"Could you help an old altar boy, Father?"
"Your mother is in here with us, Karras."
Would you like to leave a message?
I'll see that she gets it.
If that's true then you must know my mother's maiden name.
What is it?
What is it?
"Hello, Daddy?"
This is me.
Thank you.
"Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing her more harm than good."
Nothing you could do could make it any worse.
I can't do it.
I need evidence that the Church would accept as signs of possession.
Like what?
Her speaking in a language she's never known or studied.
What else?
I don't know.
I'd have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts.
You probably know as much about possession as most priests.
Your daughter doesn't say she's a demon.
She says she's the devil himself.
"If you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd realize that's the same as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte."
You asked me what I think is best for your daughter.
Six months under observation in the best hospital you can find.
"You show me Regan's double same face, same voice, everything and I'd know it wasn't Regan."
I'd know in my gut.
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter.
We would both welcome an end to this war.
"By the way, you will let me have that book back if you've finished with it, won't you?"
Sir...
[Distant gunfire and men shouting commands]
[Airplane]
Your unit number?
"I need your name, rank, and regiment..."
[Men speaking indistinctly]
"I'll see if I can help, sir, if that's all right."
Go ahead.
[Airplanes]
[Speaking indistinctly]
I didn't expect to see you here.
"Well, they told me you were back."
And you thought you'd come for David before he scarpered.
No.
I've come to tell you that I know he had nothing to do with the murder.
We picked up 15 of our boys... 15...
And there were thousands of them there.
You've never seen anything like it-- white sand stretching out for Miles...
Ships everywhere-- hundreds of them.
"Motorboats, trawlers."
Picking up 15 here and 15 there.
"You know, we're gonna get the army out of there."
We're gonna do it.
There were bodies.
You saw them on the beaches.
"And as we went in there, the Germans were coming after us-- stukas, dorniers."
"I was lucky, though."
There was some sort of refinery burning and the smoke-- it protected us for a while.
Where is David?
I told you I'd bring him back to you.
I was terrible at chemistry.
I'm more of a humanities guy.
- How did you find me?
- We should talk about that.
"It should be much, much harder for people to track you down."
My PI charged me for three hours so I seriously doubt it took him more than one.
"So this is, what, blackmail?"
"Walter, I'm your lawyer."
Anything you say to me is totally privileged.
I'm not in the shakedown racket.
I'm a lawyer.
"Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?"
Especially drug dealers.
"So, what, you're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart?"
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?
"By the way, where do you keep the money?"
Is it in your mattress?
Is it in a jelly jar buried in the side yard?
This kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up but he won't be the last.
"And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?"
I don't understand.
What exactly are you offering to do for me?
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?
I'm no Vito Corleone.
No shit.
"Right now, you're Fredo."
"But with some sound advice and the proper introductions, who knows?"
"I'll tell you, you've got the right product."
Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch you're on to something special.
And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.
"Food for thought, yeah?"
"That must put the total around 500,000 yen."
"I think that would be about right, but I'll check."
"No, need to do that."
Just deposit it for me.
I'll do it.
"When Japan lost the war, it lost its spiritual beauty."
Yagi says that Freedom has been haunting Japan for quite some time.
"Does the curse of that old ghost cause your troubles, too?"
Yagi is really worried that the jobs and kimono will run out.
There isn't much left.
"I'm even going to sell the ""Hana."""
"Namiko, let's make a clean break with the lies of our twenties."
How?
Leave.
Leave and do what?
Come live with me.
Why didn't you say that twenty years ago?
"I thought a woman's happiness was in marriage, so I held back."
But it's still true that a woman's happiness is in marriage.
We've been seeing each other as friends for twenty years.
We can't live this lie any longer.
"For Yagi's sake, for your children's sake, please."
Leave him.
For twenty years I've lived for my daughter.
I wanted her to be a ballerina.
"That is my great, unfulfilled wish, but it's only been an excuse to live."
It didn't make me happy.
My wife left me with a child.
I want you to be the mother of my child.
I don't want to hear that.
You don't know what I'm going through now.
Stay in your position after your pirouette.
How about our favorite croupier?
"Mr. Stone was arrested when the ship docked in Miami, along with Mr. Stancati."
The cruise line is very grateful.
They even offered you all a free trip.
"If it's okay with you, Charlie, I think we'll stick to dry land for a while."
"Congratulations, angels, and, Kate, I want you to know how proud I am of you."
"Thanks, Charlie."
Interesting place to meet.
Somehow it just felt right.
How's rehab going?
- Slowly.
- You're a fighter.
"You know, I'm never going to be able to repay you."
Why did you help me?
"- Always with the questions, you."
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"It's, uh, it's a force of habit."
"You know, I tried to tell myself that taking dirty money was just a one time thing..."
"That I could walk away, but I couldn't."
"Once your story broke, it helped me realize who I had become."
That's a first.
I have never been thanked for destroying someone's career.
"I wish I could say,"
I took those bribes because I had no choice.
"Fact is, I thought I was putting bad money to good use."
Spent it on the people I loved.
"Put my brother through school, paid my mom's mortgage..."
"Called myself a hero, but I wasn't."
"Well, to be fair, you got mixed up with a very bad crew."
I think I've got much better taste in friends now.
So this new career...
I need another.
- I'll do it.
- Go climb at the terrace... and stand on the other side of the balcony rail.
"Pierre, mon cher, we need a vision."
"The year, 1323, no... 1324."
The setting:
"A stony alcove in the alps of the Capuleto... hanging from the rocky, gelid cliffs of Stratfordshire."
"Meteorology: 50 degrees, with a post perceptive chilling the air."
"The tempest has fled to bomir pastures, but its icy kiss lingers."
The mood:
Unbridled passion... a passion that unravels nature's tiring volcanoes... and rumbling earthquakes.
This deeds are acts of gods... so is this union.
You need to show Romeo and Juliette how to pose.
And you can bet your sweet ass I will.
Romeu:
"You've just been running in from Mars... you're hot and sweaty, but you're taking some danger."
"Juliette is looking hot, you know what I'm trying to mean?"
"I want the body language to be a lot more charged, okay?"
So move a lot tight closer together.
"Look into your Juliette's eyes and...""Oh!"
"Romeo, Romeo""..."
"""where art thou"", boy."
"Come on, open your heart... and show some love, some affection for her."
And Juliette... you love this man!
Oh!
Yes!
You know he's your knight in shiny armor.
I like that!
"Hold that, I'm gonna take some Polaroid photos."
"Alex, move your ass."
Move your ass.
"Out, please."
Go!
Go!
Move!
Move!
Go!
"This is yet another liberal attack on our values, our families and on our way of life."
"On the subject of gay marriage, remember this, people."
This is not about the union of two people of the same sex.
"This, this is clearly the work of liberal judges who are trying to force their will on you, the American people."
Society at large is better served by maintaining the sacred tradition of marriage.
As in a man and a woman joined together by holy matrimony.
The people know it.
You know it.
And I know it.
This is Jim O'Bannon reporting.
"Good night, everybody, and thanks for watching The O'Bannon Files."
Yeah?
"Arbor's gone, sir."
Missed his assignment in Seattle.
What happened?
I'm not sure what happened.
He just vanished.
"So the guy doesn't complete his assignment, and you have no fucking idea where he is."
This is unacceptable.
Do you understand?
I understand.
I'm gonna make it right.
I have Senate Oversight all over my ass.
And I'm meeting with the director tonight.
The last thing I need is a failed assignment by a rogue agent who disappeared and didn't follow orders.
He is your man.
He is your responsibility.
It's not bad.
But it was slightly unexpected.
"You weren't the person I knew, and you were really lively."
What's wrong?
It's fun.
"Drawing art, and chatting with everyone while streaming."
I want to hear more stuff like that.
I hardly know anything about you.
The reason why I started drawing illustrations was because Mom taught me.
I was naturally doing nothing but drawing since I was little...
And I was a professional before I knew it.
"Mom complimented me, saying it was amazing."
"After Mom was gone,"
I couldn't draw at all.
And I couldn't leave my room.
"But one day, I saw someone streaming."
That person was happily drawing while chatting with everyone.
I was jealous.
"I wanted to be like that, and tried it out."
I see.
It was really fun.
"After seeing the illustrations, they give me their opinions, like ""so cute"", ""so amazing""."
They ask me to draw more.
"I'm still in my room, but I can play and chat with people all over the world like we're friends."
"That, really, really makes my heart race."
I see.
It's the same for me.
The reason I became an author was because the people posting their novels on the internet seemed to have fun.
"There was a time when I wrote novels on the web, too."
That was a great story!
I drew a picture of the Hero Masamune!
"And, I got my first fan mail ever."
Give me the whip!
"Adios, senor."
"Adios, Satipo."
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I cannot take away.
And you thought I had given up.
You chose the wrong friends.
"This time, it will cost you."
"Too bad the Hovitos... don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
"Yes, too bad."
"You could warn them, if only you spoke Hovitos."
Jock!
Start the engines!
Get it up!
"Jock, the engines!"
"Start the engines, Jock!"
"There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!"
"Oh, that's just my pet snake Reggie!"
"I hate snakes, Jock!"
I hate 'em!
Come on!
"Show a little backbone, will ya?"
"""Neo,"" meaning ""new"""
"and ""lithic""..."
"I-T-H I-C, meaning ""stone."""
"All right, let's get back to this site:"
"Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton."
"Contains a central pas-passage and three chambers, or cysts don't confuse that with robbing, in which case we mean the removal of the contents of the barrow."
This site also demonstrates one of the great dangers of archaeology..
"not to life and limb, although that does sometimes take place.."
"no, I'm talking about folklore."
"In this case, local tradition held that there was golden coffin buried at the site, and this accounts for the holes dug all over the barrow and the generally poor condition of the find."
"But the chief - the one with the white hat, not the ones with the yellow hats - the one with the white hat came over to me and said,"
"""Did you stop the traffic?"""
"And I said, ""I thought I ought to,"
"""because I was worried it was going to explode."""
"And he said, ""No, that was a really heroic thing to do."
"Well done."""
"So, I go, ""Yeah, well, you know."" LAUGHTER"
"""Who WAS that man?"""
And um...
"So, I go home and Jane said, ""What did he say?"""
"I said, ""Oh, you know, he called me a hero - fairly standard..."
"""It wasn't..."
Doesn't really matter.
"""We'll forget about it."
"The less said, the better."""
"But, yeah, he said that was an amazing thing to have done, and, um...he said that he wished he could be like me."
But I gotta get back in the game.
So...
I'm gonna have to borrow your trust fund.
Wait.
You came all the way here to ask me for my money?
"Well, that money is mine."
"See, I gave it to you, so I can take it back."
"Actually, legally, it's my money, which means I get to decide what happens to it."
"Look, it's just gonna be temporary."
All right?
Just to get the blood-sucking bankers off my back.
And what have they ever created?
"They're just living off of guys like me, and now they won't give me what I need to make it back."
Maybe they're worried you'll lose it again.
"What, you think this is easy for me... come here looking for help?"
It's not.
"Look, both your brother and sister have entered the best universities."
"Kaan, if you tried a bit harder, you could succeed too."
He's got no discipline.
How was life in Germany?
It was like a ticking clock.
You grew up there too but this rascal isn't like that.
"Once he lifts his head away from the books, he instantly thinks of his guitar."
I can't control you all the time.
You have to want it yourself.
"I agree dad, you are absolutely right."
I feel ashamed instead of you.
It's such a shame!
Is this behavior suitable for you?
Don't you want to attent to university.
Of course There are many universities I can be registered at with my scores.
What do you mean?
How are you going to get into the Faculty of Medicine?
Stop pushing him.
"Maybe, he would like to study something else."
Is that so?
Don't you remember fantasizing when you were a kid?
You kept on saying you'd become a doctor like Aunt Nesrin's cousin.
"- Who's Aunt Nesrin's cousin, mom?"
- Don't you know?
What was it?
Mesut.
"Yeah, Mesut."
He graduated from medicine.
"Dad, he didn't finish medical school."
The school finished him.
Don't you remember him looking like this every time he came to us?
"Now, he's calling him an ox."
[Siren chirping] It's Trevor Nigel.
What...
You're gonna have to move that.
"Trevor Nigel, you're under arrest."
Excuse me?
We found the knife that killed Phillip Harris.
Along with a rather ghastly collection of human body parts.
I admit nothing.
Neither did your partner before he was killed.
Jordan is dead?
"He gave me up, didn't he?"
I knew I should never have partnered with a screenwriter.
"No, Trevor."
You gave yourself up.
"Back when your studio was doing Heatwave,"
I gave you notes on that horrible script you commissioned.
But you sent it back to me with a handwritten note detailing why my ideas were stupid.
"I never forget a bad review, especially one with such distinctive handwriting."
Hayley:
It's the same handwriting on your serial killer partner's screenplay.
"Richard, you're a pretty good writer, but you should really read Jordan's work, because it is inspiring."
"After I read his ""Gemini Killers"" screenplay,"
I knew that I had found a kindred spirit...
Someone with the same desires as I had.
And his script laid out...
[Handcuffs clicks] the perfect plan for us to kill...
Ow!
...
Without attracting suspicion.
"Sadly, he could never nail the end."
"Well, we did, and you've reached it."
Maybe you should do the rewrite.
Aka award magnet.
You know I can't compete with death.
"Oh, it's my son."
He's driving back to college from L.A.
And I begged him to stop here on the way.
So he's gonna be here this afternoon.
"Well, how's he doing?"
"You know, I don't know."
He rarely speaks to me.
I get the occasional grunt on mother's day.
"Oh, kids can be so ungrateful."
"I mean, you get them the best nannies money can buy... and then they blackmail you with threats... to write a mommie dearest."
"Oh, look who's back from Hollywood."
What was it like doing Brad pitt's eyebrows?
Does he smell like fresh cream... on a fine spring morning?
'Cause that's how I imagine it.
"Elka, celebrities are just like everyone else."
You take that back.
"Oh, I'm just starting to wonder... if there isn't more to life... than removing celebrities' unwanted hair."
I think I'm having a mid-life crisis.
Mid-life?
"You know, if you really are having a crisis, maybe you should see a therapist."
The only therapy I need is liquid therapy.
Hello.
Victoria got another emmy nomination.
Congratulations.
She can't win.
She's up against a dead girl.
"You didn't have Susan Lucci killed, did you?"
No.
That was just trash talk. the oddest thing just happened.
My Agent says that there's this huge Internet rumor... that I'm dying from some disease called...
Because he wants to build up something new for the child.
"I need to leave him something, he says."
"That's how he is, my husband..."
"Not such a one as yours, who does not want it."
"But he's bound to notice it sometime, Mrs John!"
Will he?
- Yes!
"Only you and Bruno know about this, and he keeps his mouth shut."
My husband doesn't need to find out that that is not his child... nor mine... when I lay it in the cradle for him.
Mine?
"No, Mrs John, that's out of the question."
"But yes, it can be done."
"It will work out, it will..."
I've closely considered everything...
"I've read the books from the state library on childbirth, and I've sent you to the doctor to see that all is fine."
I've made good friends with the midwife.
"But Pauline, what could happen?"
"If one is so young, fit and healthy as you, one doesn't need to lose it like I did."
"No, Mrs John."
No can do!
But Pauline...
Both of you are helped by this.
Yourself and your Harald!
"When he asks you where the child is, you say that you've lost it, like what happened to me..."
But he won't ask anything.
"He doesn't want it, and neither do you."
You want HIM!
And without a kid he may take you back!
That's why he left.
Or do you want to go back?
"No, I don't want to go back."
"Isn't it true that you don't want the child, or did you never say so?"
"- Yes, but not to throw suspicion on him."
The girl was abused and killed and thrown in the harbour.
"If justice is all the perp wants in exchange for Emilie, let's provide it."
- Or what?
- She's right.
We have no leads on Emilie.
And we can't afford to adopt the refined manners of Special Branch.
"I gave him my word, and I believe he'll give us Emilie."
- But we must move now.
"- Yes, indeed."
"You will search the harbour, and Borch will assemble a team."
"No, no, we'll take care of that."
You can take the damned harbour.
"Well, now we seem to be cooperating again."
"He could have been in Copenhagen harbour two hours before he stole the car,"
- and he had plenty of time to hide Emilie.
- Search everything again.
There must be a witness or a camera.
Someone must have seen something.
"We 're trying, but Zeuthen's people are everywhere."
We're surrounded by security guards.
- Brix is trying to change that.
"- OK, what about Borch?"
Are you two OK?
"I know he's the one who fucked up, but he got us back on track when we thought the girl was dead."
"Call me if something turns up, Asbjorn."
It can't come as a surprise that there are things I couldn't tell you.
- Don'!
be like that.
I've been loyal.
"- It's coincidental, I know."
"It meant something to me, what happened over there."
"But, Daaga..."
- It's quite simple.
"Ifyou keep an eye on Vijay Varma, and find out details about  people he meets, then it is possible to identify his informer."
Did you read the news about your friend?
He risked his life in a dangerous chase and seized 8 millions in gold.
This kind of daredevily is his forte.
My friend is a incredible police officer!
He is an incredible police officer.
And you are a remarkable lawyer.
The only difference is that he catches criminals... and I free them.
Doesn't any misunderstanding arise bemeen you mo friends on this regard?
-No way.
No chance.
We don't mix our friendship with our profession.
I can give my life for him.
"Ifyou mo are such friends, please include me in your list too."
Who doesn't need a good friend?
"Madam, I have written your name in my list at first sight."
I must entertain you well.
How about one more coffee?
"No, thanks."
I must say something.
Our friendship seems to be a one way traffic.
ARer that pam I have come a dozen times over to your house.
But you haven't set your foot in my humble home.
Not even once.
There's nothing as such.
Someday I will certainly set my foot at your celestial abode.
Thank you vey much!
I want to speak to Mr Vijay.
Speaking.
Who is it?
"Not for any reason, I just..."
It's quite arty...
It's quite arty writing.
I wanted something different.
"I tried it in Chinese writing the other night, it looked very good."
Victoria was very impressed.
I copied it off of a Chinese menu.
"So I probably had ""fried rice"" and ""salt and pepper ribs"""
"and ""hot and sour soup"" on my arm, instead of ""Victoria""."
Aw.
He's adorable.
I don't understand.
Is that real?
Is that real?
"What do you mean, is that real?"
"I thought that was a Comic Relief spoof video, or something."
"No, that's a documentary he made back in 2000."
"Oh, my God."
"Also, he doesn't call them tattoos, he calls them arm pictures."
"Oh, my God!"
And he also had two weird square bowls with floating eggs in them.
"Yeah, he had two hard-boiled eggs in front of him."
Yeah.
In the water.
"Why, David?"
"You know those e-mails where he was asking for a effing knighthood, they were definitely doctored, because there's no way he could spell ""knighthood"", from watching that."
"It must be pretty hard, though, considering Sir Mix-A-Lot got one and he didn't."
"I don't think you should be angry about getting one, but I quite think I'd quite like to be a sir."
"I mean, I..."
Good luck with that.
"If anyone here is going to be a sir, it's going to be the king of daytime."
I bet the Queen watches Pointless.
You're also familiar how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
"Father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft?"
"From the witching end, not the hunting."
I once did a paper on it.
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
I know.
I read it.
AII of this desecration in the church do you think this has anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe.
Some rituals used in the Black Mass.
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?
In a fall.
Let me tell you how.
"Please, Father confidential."
"Burke Dennings, good Father was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M street with his head turned completely around facing backwards."
That didn't happen in the fall?
It's possible.
"-Possible, however--"
-Unlikely.
Exactly.
"So, on the one hand, we've got a witchcraft kind of murder and on the other hand, a Black Mass-type desecration in the church."
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Maybe somebody crazy somebody with a spite against the Church.
Some unconscious rebellion.
"A sick priest, is that it?"
"Look, Father, this is hard for you."
"Please, I understand but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist."
"You'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't."
"I mean, this kind of sickness, you'd know that."
"Most of them are Scalerians, you know."
- Utter rogues.
Corruption's a way of life.
"- Yes, sir, but..."
"Can't fight worth a damn, either."
"It's a security problem, General."
It means that whatever's up there must be able to take information from databanks anywhere in the Federation.
- Really?
"- Yes, sir."
"What, you mean, troop movements, that sort of thing?"
"An open book, General."
Then put a stop to it at once.
"Yes, sir, well, if you would authorise a search and destroy mission..."
Absolutely.
"No, Commissioner, the video system's been destroyed."
"All right, Leitz."
- See nothing's touched and inform the General.
- I already have.
He's here.
Good.
Tell him I'll take charge of the investigation.
We need an arrest before Headquarters are told of Practor's death.
"Somebody wanted to make very sure of him, eh?"
"Commissioner Sleer said to touch nothing, sir."
- Sleer's taking charge?
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, it's a police job, I suppose."
- You searched the apartment?
"- Yes, General."
The computer must have let him in.
So the killer is somebody Practor knew.
I'd say that limits the field a bit.
Adriana!
"No, wait!"
"Yes, he is quite free for the night!"
"Lucrecia,"
Lucrecia!
"Yes, Luigi?"
"Come immediatedly, I must speak with you."
"I am coming, just a moment."
Luigi?
"What is wrong, why so nervous?"
"Its one of the models, I remember her from somewhere, but don't know where!"
Which one?
The red headed one.
"You are imagining things, Luigi, she is one of our must trusted models."
"Do you think that all the precautions our organisation has taken, are useless?"
Its that we must not take any risks.
"Has it dawned on you that it is insane for all of us to remain here, together?"
"Any slight error, can finish our organisation, with one blow."
You know it is necessary.
"I have been working here for the last two months, and nothing abnormal has happened."
"All is rolling along, please Luigi, do not worry."
"Say, Lucrecia, when do you go on stage?"
"In just a moment,"
Don't you enjoy seeing me as an entertainer in a night club?
You would enjoy it even more to see me as a designer of swimwear.
"can you help me , please?"
May I?
Thanks
I must congratulate you.
You swim quite well.
"I have already thanked you, what else can I say to you, Mr. Dinamo?"
"Ah, you know my name, that means you have heard of me."
We neutralized the last zombie specimens.
"Thanks to Hybra Tech, there hasn't been a single zombie outbreak in over 10 years."
"Hybra Tech, chemical solutions for the entire planet."
THE RETURN OF MORTOS PART 4
- NECROPOLIS
Entry to the exclusion zone without permission is forbidden.
You like the singing?
Nathalia Lavina.
She is the Russian Britney Spears.
How much further?
"Don't be so nervous, we will be there in a couple of minutes."
You are sure that they are here?
"Yes, they are here my friend."
This is the best place to keep them safe.
This is it.
"Don't worry, the Geiger-Counter is a precaution."
The level of radiation is the same as a ray-x of teeth.
Bullshit you hear about this place...
Just to get more money from you Americans.
What was that?
Don't worry.
Suppose someone finds us here?
Everything is fine my friend.
I have made arrangements for the security for this place.
We are in the base of the main reactor.
"You can make a ""tour"" if you like."
Would you like to see the place where they make the big boo-boo?
No!
Let's cut the 50 cent tour and tell me where the hell they are.
Behind you.
The last of the Trioxin-5 canisters.
Is this all of them?
"Hilarious, right?"
Totally.
You look like some suburban mom who drives a minivan filled with stale Cheerios and empty juice boxes... probably makes chili mac and Frito pie for dinner... smells like that menthol cigarette that she snuck while she was waiting to pick her kids up
from hockey practice.
Get over here!
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
You guys will not believe what just happened.
"On my way here, a taxi jumped the curb and it pinned this old lady."
"And I just went into this, like, crazy adrenaline mode and I somehow lifted it off her."
"Oh, my God."
"Ted, your wrist."
"Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen."
I must've strained it lifting.
I believe our dear friend Lily was referring to your other wrist... the one wearing the male birth control.
"I was gonna go with ""chastity bracelet."""
"God, is it possible to love you more?"
Really?
Really?
"I just saved someone's life, and you guys are focusing on this?"
"Yeah, you know what, guys?"
Leave him alone.
- All right?
He's a hero.
- Thank you.
Do you think that your super strength came from wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?
"Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff, I have a date."
With some hand lotion and the Internet?
It is possible to love you more!
She exists.
And she's right outside.
- Great.
But I know someone who can beat the Shaolin.
Which chamber does he belong?
He's not a priest.
He's Chao Fung-wu.
Chao Fung-wu!
"According to our regulations, a guilty person cannot be our representative."
"Furthermore, Chao Fung-wu isn't our student..."
He's the only one who knows how to fight the Chin Kang Fist.
"If he can represent us, he can win."
Then all charges will be dropped.
That's a good point.
"If he wins, he'll be pardoned."
"$50,000, they do pass."
"$50,000, they don't."
I smell a rat.
Been dead at least 24 hours.
My sensors detect the vehicle is armored with my protective shell.
He took the bait.
We hooked him real good.
I was always strongly attracted to you.
"Michael, he's coming right for us!"
"Knight Rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist."
"michael Knight, a young loner, on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless, in a world of criminals who operate above the law."
"michael, I've searched my data banks thoroughly,"
I can't find one redeeming quality about gambling.
"KITT, look at it this way:"
gambling is all odds.
It's pure mathematics.
"Come on, I'll show you."
I'd rather not.
"A little computer blackjack, $1 a hand."
I backed up after that.
"- So, how did you end up at Skirt?"
- I just love Skirt.
"They have the best photography of any magazines, really... the most innovative, stylish, artistic shoots around."
How did you end up in magazines?
"I had an excentric uncle... who was my idol when I was growing up... he was a sort of black sheep, hip, rebel type."
"While my parents are always trying to drag me off to polo, blablabla... he was always abducting me and taking me..."
- on the most amazing adventures.
- Sounds like a cool uncle.
"Yeah, he was."
He was pretty much my savior when I was a child.
"My parents had a messy split, and he saw me through that."
He knew I liked to paint and he always encouraged.
So why don't you paint full time?
That's what I'm trying to do... but I like graphic design and it helps pay the bills.
So I made a routine out of that.
"Furthermore, I don't think anybody would like to buy my paintings."
Except maybe a pizza parlor.
I'm sure people would buy your paintings.
I have to get out of here!
I'm being harrassed!
These little beasts keep snugging me... begging for an autograph...
- annoying me!
- They are children.
And I'm not the fucking Pied Piper.
I don't want them following me.
Shoo!
- Get away!
Go!
- Calm down.
I'm gonna be... half an hour more at this.
Then we take...
I went up to him and told him I admired him and what he stood for and while I was thanking him he asked me if I liked stone crabs.
Halfway through dinner I had a job.
"At the end of dinner, I felt like I had a new home."
And here we go.
I hear the curve in your voice.
I've been with Pappas for 3 years and I finally found a place where you can make a difference.
"Well, you did."
You made a difference to Elaine Santos.
"You cleared Eddie's name, got their pension."
"Yeah, but not so fast."
We got to keep Wakeley on ice till I find that report.
We don't need the report.
We just take Wakeley's deposition.
"No, that's all you need."
I got to get that report see where it leads.
"What if, while you're playing detective Wakeley decides it'd be healthier to disappear?"
Then we're left with nothing.
How's Elaine supposed to feed her kids?
That's a risk we must take.
I don't need you to get Wakeley's deposition.
If you talk to him on your own you'll feel the full weight of the mayor's office upon you.
It's not a pleasant feeling.
"You're a mean prick, you know that?"
"Where I come from, that's a compliment."
Hold on a minute.
To what?
Your ambition?
John Pappas' coattails?
"Burger, fries, Coke and a lemon pudding."
I'll take these.
The mayor's boy gets the lemon pudding.
Mr. Schwartz?
But we'll fight on.
"That's what Mr. Churchill says, and I believe him."
"I think you must be insane, father, if you believe what these people say."
They're sick.
And they don't know a thing.
[Door slams]
"These notes are very good, very thorough, milner."
"Thank you, sir."
I'm afraid they don't tell us the one thing that we need to know-- who fired the shots.
Or why they were fired in the dark.
And if Spencer was the actual target...
That's very likely.
Why wait for an after-dinner meeting when everyone's around?
Easier and less risky to wait until he's left or leaving the hotel or even gone up to his room and shoot him while he's asleep.
"Yes, I know."
I wondered about that.
Why wait for the exact moment when the lights go out?
Because you can't be seen.
"Well, you can't see either."
How do you know you're getting the right target?
You spoke to woolton?
"Yes, it was his gun, but I don't believe for a second he fired it."
"And it was thrown away, wasn't it?"
He'd have taken it with him.
"How about David Lane, sir?"
"He could have taken the gun, made his way through the hotel."
Maybe the lights went out just as he was about to fire.
"They were all in the room, the room was blacked out, the door was closed."
Stanley was sitting right outside.
Then he'd have seen him.
Exactly.
What about Stanley Ellis?
Um...
Mandora Schwartz attorneys at law
"Ma, nothing to worry about."
I spent the day sitting on a rooftop playing sudoku on my phone.
- You can do that?
I need a new phone.
- Yeah.
"I got to go, mom."
Call you later.
"Well, well, well."
I heard you took a bullet.
Do you know how pissed I am that I wasn't there to see that?
"Bunch of us are dropping by the cove, try and wipe the day away."
You gonna come?
Nah.
The thing about a drink after the battle is you got to be in the battle.
"So I'm gonna go home, take a hot bath, and play the most violent video game I can find."
- Later.
- Later.
"Hey, I'm glad you're not dead, butt-head."
Me too.
"The rampage left 12 dead, 23 wounded, and many still in critical condition."
"The alledged gunman, a former I.T. advisor at the company, was evidently embittered over being recently let go"
Due to company downsizing.
He apparently entered the building... that was insane.
"Yes, Glenn."
A man walking into a building and shooting people in the head is the definition of insane.
They give you a nickname over at the station yet?
"We'll call you ""dictionary."" You walking around here defining things."
"I'm just dicking with you, man."
That was a thick one out there.
"You think that was insane, shoulda been at Katrina."
But who sees it in your eyes?
How am I going to behave?
"Those boys are only friends, aren't they?"
Do you think they like it when someone clings to them?
"You'll see, someone will appreciate that more."
Maybe. I haven't yet met anyone who appreciates it more.
They always talk to the kind who cling to everyone immediately.
"The other day your registrar said they pay sixty crowns in Moravia, and us only fifteen."
My sister-in-law's sister said that in Central Slovakia they even pay a hundred.
- l've heard that too.
- Us fifteen...
That's despicable!
"I'm telling you, it's only in Nitra they pay so badly."
"Elsewhere, as you say, it's at least fifty."
"You understand, we're qualified, you're in that society... the Committee for Civil Affairs."
"As a member, they only got me from the music school just to..."
- l feel so worn out...
- You're tired?
- How many more?
- lt's dragging on today.
- Nothing's on time!
- They're saying goodbye at home.
- And have they even paid?
- That photographer...
"Yes, yes..."
- How lovely!
- What's lovely about it?
Really.
What do you see in it?
Look at this... here...
"Don't take it off, if we put..."
"We'll put something blue here, blue buttons, that'll make you a bit slimmer..."
"Pint of lager, please."
Something local.
- Thank you.
- GLEN:
All right.
"So, a local lager for Mr. Brando and a Caesar for Sandy Bullock."
I love those orders.
Be right back.
I didn't think they'd have it at Four Dancers.
"Yes, I didn't think they'd have it at this resto-bar."
- Gastro-pub.
"- Says ""resto-bar"" on the sign."
It's more of a micro-bistro.
"Says brasserie on the menu right there, too."
It's more of a bistro-brasserie.
When I came in they asked me if I wanted to sit at the resto-bar or the gastro-lounge.
I'm glad you chose the resto-bar.
This is actually the gastro-lounge.
"Do you know what an emergency call is, Wayne?"
- Negative.
"- It's when you have a friend call 10, 15 minutes into a date to be sure the date isn't a total bust."
"And if it is, then you can play the phone call as though it's an emergency and leave the date."
"Well, that's fair."
I guess we are first cousin to an emergency here.
A good one.
And you shouldn't be afraid of it.
I think we could do good things here.
"I'm going to call my friend and cancel her pending emergency call, and when I get back, let's talk about your feelings, Wayne."
- Okay.
- Let's really talk about them.
- Okay.
"- I wanna take 'em, and I wanna talk about them."
Will you please point him out for the jury?
Let the record reflect that mr.
"Hill identified the defendant, James Conway."
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?
Yes.
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record reflect that mr.
"Hill identified the defendant, Paul Cicero."
"Your Honor, I have a document..."
"See, the hardest thing was leaving the life."
I still love the life.
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.
"We had it all, just for the asking."
"Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along."
I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.
I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.
People call them rats because rats do anything to survive.
Isn't that right?
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about being a rat.
"Objection, Your Honor."
In view of the violence...
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.
Free cars.
Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.
"I'd bet $20.000, $30.000 over a weekend then blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay the bookies."
It didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything.
INTERVIEWER:
So what are you looking over here?
"It's a short-term, I believe, contract-- 21 days."
And it looks in order.
But I'm gonna read it just to be sure.
Make sure I don't have to give up my first-born
Or something like that.
INTERVIEWER:
And what will that be for?
"I'm gonna be Toxie's double whenever they need it, I guess."
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yo, you're supposed to stop"
People from going up here.
"You see, if they fall down, break their neck with babies."
So stop them from going through.
[Chatter]
We're gonna have a little problem
"Today, because people are going to be going up that step."
We're shooting now.
"If somebody goes up the steps when the cameras are rolling,"
"That's very bad, because it means we waste film."
Yeah.
"Because you know what'll happen,"
"They'll look at the camera behind them,"
And then that screws it up.
Because then people know that they aren't
Supposed to be in the movie.
"So have to make sure that the pedestrians, very politely,"
"Are told to go around the back, that we're making a movie,"
That we're going around the back.
"I don't want women with tiny babies coming through here,"
"Tripping over wires, bumping into people."
"Mr. Moreau, what should I do with the Atomium?"
Ludovic!
Wallonia declared its independence!
Belgium fell apart!
"Their declaration reads, ""We are fed up."""
With what?
The Flemish are arrogant.
They humiliate the Walloons and don't understand them.
They are fed up.
We have to go back immediately.
It'll take us 90 minutes to get to the airport.
Hello!
"Please, come again."
"No, His Majesty wants to talk to the Prime Minister of Wallonia."
- Ludovic?
- There is no signal.
What about the speech?
I will take care of it before we arrive in Brussels.
"No, Ludovic."
I will write it myself.
"But we have to discuss all the political and diplomatic aspects with the chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, and there is no signal."
"With federal ministers as well,"
I don't remember who exactly.
"Sire, we have to be very careful about every word and every move."
Prudence is key.
"At the coronation, the king swore to preserve the integrity of his kingdom at all times."
And I am the king.
Unity means strength.
Unity secures power.
I'll add that.
"Some people have foresight, some have a dream."
"Sire, what is your intuition tells you?"
- She didn't mean anal.
"Should I have told you that day in People's Park... when we saw that woman arguing with a trash can, and you said:"
"""I want you to meet my mom""?"
"And we laughed, and it was funny, except that could have been my sister."
"Yeah, you feel like crap?"
"Yeah, well, welcome to my world."
Heh.
Wanna know what real guilt feels like?
"When my sister finally went to the hospital,"
I dreaded her coming home.
"It was a relief when she was gone, and we..."
We were happy.
We felt like a family again for the first time.
"- Lucy, that's not true."
- It's okay.
- Honey.
Honey.
- It's okay.
Well... at least the chicken was good.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
"If you were really sorry, you wouldn't have said that in a room that didn't have doors."
"Look, I didn't mean to be cruel."
"Yes, you did, Allie."
You've wanted to tell me that for a really long time.
Do you realize that you're furious at me for being sick?
"I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
It's a very common theme in group.
See?
Anything I feel is invalid because you are the sick one.
"Nobody ever seems to remember that when my sister who I idolized, by the way, was supposed to just be laying with me in bed, was instead using my nightgown to strangle me."
- You have to stop taking that personally.
"- Oh, my God."
No!
That Randy's happy without me.
What am I doing?
I'm dragging you all over the country after some guy who isn't even interested in me anymore.
This is my worst idea since I told DeNiro to stick to comedy.
"So, what are you saying?"
I'm saying this is a mistake.
Let's just go home like you said after that hyena knocked you to the ground and tried to hump you.
Can I get $12 on number four?
And on which aisle can I find tucking tape?
"Okay, I will just have these Slim Jims and a Ho-Ho."
It's not like I have to fit into couture today.
- Stop hitting me.
- Stop hitting me!
"Girls, stop fighting."
I hate to see women fighting each other.
"Well, unless, of course, it's Hoda and Kathie Lee over the last glass of chardonnay."
That's RuPaul!
From RuPaul's Drag Race!
We love your show.
We used to watch it through our neighbor Jeff's window.
"But then he met Dean, and now all they do is cook naked."
So we just watch that now.
"Oh, you poor babies."
"So, why the cat fight?"
Did she steal your size 12 stilettos?
'Cause I would cut a bitch for that.
We were actually on our way to Texas to see if she and her ex could patch things us.
"No, we're not going to Texas."
We're going back home.
Sometimes you got to admit defeat... and that there is a very live junebug in this macaroni salad.
"Oh, no, honey."
I think Mom and your dad are wrong on this one.
I think... .
"I think if you want the operation, it's your hand."
The only one who knows how it feels is you.
Did I really just hear you tell our son that you think he should get the surgery?
_
"This is not what we do, Lena."
"What happened to ""unified front""?"
"- I, honestly, I disagree."
"- Fine, but you do not go undermining me with our son."
- Our son?
- Yes.
Or your son?
"Look, Brandon is 16."
He's old enough to know that we don't always agree on everything.
"And I wanted him to know that if he still believes in this dream, then so do I."
"It's not a dream, Lena, it is a fantasy."
Do you really want to see Brandon devastated again?
We can't protect our kids from disappointment.
"And if it happens, and I'm not entirely convinced that it will in this situation, then we help him, we help him to learn from it."
"Well, you have fun with that, because after all of the disappointments he's had over the last few months,"
I am sick and tired of teaching him that lesson.
Hey.
So guess what?
Moms just bought me Dawn of Armageddon 4.
Haven't even played it yet.
We can open it when you come over.
I can't spend the night tonight.
"Oh, ok."
What about Saturday?
I kinda can't sleep over at your house... ever.
What?
"I promised him, no plums in the basket."
Okay.
I made room for some of Mike's stuff in the hall closet.
I'm gonna take these things over to goodwill.
Don't you dare.
Those are your dad's clothes.
You can't give those away.
"Mom, he died 25 years ago, and this leisure suit passed away ten years before that."
I don't care.
You're not giving them away.
"Oh, it still smells like daddy."
Hai karate and hot sauce.
It's gonna be so weird having another man living here.
"By the way, I was wondering if you guys could clear a little space for him in the bathroom."
"Ooh, that big man in our little bathroom?"
Yipes.
Don't worry.
"All he's got is a razor and a toothbrush, and for some mysterious reason, a shower cap."
It's not about counter space.
We're worried about the beating that toilet's gonna take.
Mom.
Why don't we make him use the downstairs bathroom like we did with dad?
There you go.
"Just throw in a good, industrial-strength plunger and a big scented candle."
"Citronella, like they use at campsites."
Or we could just rent one of those porta potties and put it in the backyard.
Good idea.
Then it becomes the neighbor's problem.
"All right, this is the last of it."
We got a dreamsicle and what is either a frozen tamale or a pair of yellow dress socks.
I will have the dreamsicle.
I'll spin the wheel on that tamale.
Many ended up lying on the street covered in blood.
"In Australia, over a hundred soldiers had to..."
I don't think they'll buy it.
When do you think it'll get sold?
"It would be a miracle, it's been so long..."
Don't you get bored?
No.
Can you come tonight?
Ok...
"Bring some milk, I ran out."
"Ok, see you later..."
Bye.
"Good evening, and welcome to the Bombay the next song is one of my favorites I hope you like it."
Thanks... and now a song dedicated by La Loba
"No thanks, I'm done for today."
"The only thing we have left is the spirit... and woman, right?"
She applies the real Ten Commandments:
"Give me, I need, you owe, you have to pay, I saw, I liked, I want, buy it and you are screwed."
You can't do anything about it.
"It's like when we ask forthe dinner, right?"
"We are tired and we ask how is it going How was your day, honey?"
And they are always grouchy.
- Do you really want to know?
No man!
"It's hard to deal with them every day but it's life's circle; in which we have to live and exist, don't you think, Miss?"
"- Hey, Beto!"
"- Hey, beautiful!"
I don't get why living in this mansion we have to fuck in this room...
Did you like my stockings?
"Yes, they are cool."
"I have really nice legs, right?"
- Legs are not important.
Our Emperor wishes to give you a chance to serve the Han.
"He requests you send 1 0,000 soldiers."
This is an opportunity to show your allegiance... and restore our estranged friendship.
We know what His Majesty is like.
He'll never send reinforcements.
I agree.
But he still hasn't given an answer.
He usually does immediately.
Maybe he has different plans.
"(Jinyong, Tax Minister) I doubt it."
It's probably because of the recent trade issue.
He's worried refusing the demand might lead to another salt scare.
- Chief General.
- Yes?
"Can we afford to send 1 0,000 soldiers?"
Not from the city and the borders... but there will be no problem if we send the Sachooldo soldiers.
"(Heukchi, Chief General) The King knows that."
Prime Minister.
What can we gain from sending reinforcements?
It could solve the trade issue.
We could even demand steel weapons.
Why don't we demand they arm our men and pay for their expenditures?
"(Bulgae, Court Minister) That's a great idea."
But I doubt they will comply.
We must wonder... whether the Han can win the war as Yangjung says they will.
We mustn't send men to a losing battle.
Did you check up on them?
Yes.
The subjects are still discussing whether they should comply or not.
They can discuss all they want but isn't it up to King Kumwa?
- Dongsun.
"- Yes, Governor."
"But you know, you know how men do."
"You know, a lot of men don't get their stuff together until they 50, you know?"
You know.
You know what I'm saying?
They go back to school.
"Now they want to get their degree and shit, and the wife's sitting there like,"
"""Now you wanna do it, nigga?"
"""You wanna do that shit now?"
"""I done been telling your ass for 20 years."
"You wanna do that shit now?"""
"My pop is cool, man."
I just think that sometimes he puts blame on other people for his shortcomings.
"Which is cool, you know?"
We all do it.
"Like, every time I go home and he has a bad day he's like,"
"""Ugh."""
"I was like, ""Dad, what's wrong?"""
"""These crackers keep holding me down, son."""
"I said, ""Daddy, the crackers ain't holding you down."""
"""That associate's degree is holding you down."
"""Maybe you need to go to school a couple more years and upgrade."""
"'Cause an associate's degree is basically like the college saying,"
"""Yeah, we associate with you."
"We just don't fuck with you,"" you know what I'm saying?"
"It's real stuff, man."
But it's about the parenting.
Okay?
"You ain't gotta whup your kids, you know?"
"Change your personality, scare the hell out of them."
That's what it's about.
"It's about scaring them, putting that fear in 'em."
You ever ran away from your damn mom or your dad in the mall?
"Yes, to show what I imagined to be the essence of Britain..."
A sort of orthogonality which isn't british at all...
But which could be...
It could be...
With this wall containing these trees...
With this way of...
"This very british shyness, this very british grayness..."
"This calmness, this british distance..."
"This big distance, so gentle and british."
Eminently british.
I'm quite proud of this one.
It's a break-up picture.
"It was taken in Venice, in rather dramatic circumstances."
"It's the suit, tie and shoes of a man I loved."
In an apartment in Venice where we stayed.
"My shoes nearby, not at all aligned with his."
"That still aren't aligned, even less than before."
That are the only element of disorder in the picture.
And this colored shade...
It's a picture I sent him as a break-up letter in a way.
An ironic picture also.
Don't you think so?
Ironic?
I don't know.
This one is strange...
I don't like it very much...
It's a field in Corsica with...
A superimposed man in a bed in Aix-en-Provence...
The whole thing re-worked in Paris...
Already stained by humidity and weather.
It's a juxtaposition of a man...
Here below is a man in his bed...
"The point is, we have cut off their troops communications, and we've put our own troops on the ground."
"So as soon as the centurions retrieve the Eye, you can take out Galactica."
"Okay, here's the deal."
We're out of options.
"The cylons have got us pinned on this rock, and our only way out of here is to hold this place until Galactica can send a rescue party."
"So I've divided you into two teams, okay ?"
Team one is gonna be distributing ammunition throughout the camp.
Team two is gonna be making homemade tylium mines.
"I know that's not glamorous work, but we gonna need the extra firepower in case the cylons decide to take a shot at us."
"Look, I know some of you are scared."
"And that's okay, 'cause"
I'm scared too.
"But if we keep our heads, and we do our jobs, we can do this."
We can all get out of here in one piece.
And Berley has a list of your names and your assignments.
Make sure you get with her.
See you outside.
That was good.
Honest.
You'd make a good officer.
"An officer, huh ?"
Like you.
"Someone who swears an oath, and knows how to keep it ?"
I'm not really sure
- what you think is going on...
"- Don't insult me, okay ?"
I'm not stupid.
I know my wife.
I know how she is.
We been married for a year and a half.
"What, do you think you're the first ?"
I chose to marry Kara.
I'm going to tell her we can't make it.
"Oh, no."
You have to go.
I don't understand.
I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
You are-- with hair that smells like strawberries.
And we're going to use that to our advantage.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
"By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp."
"She could ferret out Priya's tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as:"
Leonard's no stranger to back-alley cockfights.
I don't know.
I'm not a very good liar.
They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
Don't worry.
I'll teach you.
I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.
"Okay, I don't know you people."
I'm just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.
How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
I don't want anything in my ample bosom.
"Come on, Strawberries."
Take one for the team.
"♪ Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state ♪"

"You are strong with the force, little one."
"Thank you, master."
"Thank you, master."
Master!
Revenge.
I must have revenge.
I can sense the darkness within you.
I will teach you the ways of the dark side.
But you must prove yourself first.
"Master, I need your help quickly."
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.
"No, I will destroy the jedi."
I'll show you.
You have failed me for the last time.
And now you shall die.
Dooku.
[Exhales]
"You count on the salinity, the salt coming from the parmesan, or did you add additional salt?"
"I backed off the salt just a hair, because of the salt in the parmesan cheese, yes."
"(Gordon) Come on, Derrick."
(Derrick) I'm running out of time.
The only thing I can do is just keep looking at my oven and see how my souffles are doing.
"(Gordon) How long, Derrick?"
"Uh, momentarily."
One minute to go.
"(Derrick) They're rising, they look good, but they still need a little more time."
"(Gordon) Derrick, 30 seconds to go!"
(Announcer) Share the joy of cooking with your kids with cooking kits as seen on MasterChef.
These oven-ready kits are chef inspired for kids who cook by Kidsline.
One minute to go.
"(Announcer) Derrick is the only home cook to make a second batch of souffles, but with only seconds left, will his decision leave him with nothing to serve?"
Ay yi yi.
"Dude, you haven't done any of these yet."
I know!
But who cares?
I got all the time in the world.
"I mean, I'm only turning thirty."
Thirty?
No one's thirty.
Where did all these unsupervised children come from?
"So you wanted to talk to me about your appendectomy, Mrs..."
Appendectomy?
Now that ain't right!
"Look, fifteen percent of all surgical complications are anesthesia-related, so I would like to use hypnosis instead of the traditional anesthesia."
"Well, I'd like to sleep with Beyoncé instead of my wife tonight, but that ain't happening either, you know what I'm saying!"
?
"Tell you what, I'll think about it."
My appendectomy patient wants me to use hypnosis instead of anesthesia.
"Lookit, I'd like to throw it in Gwen Stefani tonight instead of Jordan, but that ain't gonna happen either."
Dr. Cox!
Dr. Cox!
No!
Awful!
Hypnosis is a very powerful tool.
It's helped people with depression and weight loss it helped me quit smoking.
Hypnosis is for birthday parties and bad Vegas lounges.
"Now, you go tell your patient to let you do what you do best:"
"Knock her out, and then start digging around inside of her like a blind man looking for a nickel."
I think you should do it.
Knock her out and dig.
Do it.
Dig.
Do it.
Dig.
Yeah.
Lindsay?
Thank you.
I'm sorry for disturbing you.
What's this about?
I'm afraid I've heard that you've been absent from work.
"I'm concerned that you're not coping and, if you were to get into trouble again, you'd return to prison."
- I'm never going back to prison.
- Mm.
But you can't afford to lose that job.
What did you expect for ten quid?
I was trying to help you.
20.
Don't you try making up any lies about this because it's all on video.
You can't do that!
It's illegal!
"You're saying that I can't record you without your prior knowledge, as a breach of Article 8 of the Human Rights Act?"
I'll take your Human Rights Act and I'll raise you Section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and your offence under that act carries a maximum prison sentence of five years.
I'll see you in court.
Where's Maneet?
"Off sick, I heard."
Some forensics I've asked her to chase up.
It'll just have to wait.
"Oh, Kate's got a postmortem report for you, if you're interested."
Thanks.
"Yeah, if you just get a couple of..."
You've got a new PM on Oliver Stephens-Lloyd?
Yeah.
Are you going to get round to telling me?
Yeah.
The new autopsy found significant differences from the original.
Both arms were broken and there was a severe skull fracture.
"Good luck, 'cause it was here when I moved in."
"So, what are you doing with this sofa?"
"I tried to give it to goodwill, but apparently, they have a too many stains policy."
I'm surprised they took your shirts.
"Samuel, it's yours if you want it."
"Uh, thank you, but my roommates and I have more of a southwestern motif."
"You know, now that you're moving in with Molly, we won't be able to hang out like this anymore."
What are you talking about?
You guys can come over there.
It's gonna be my place as much as it is hers.
Hmm.
"Yeah, that's what those Indians thought when they waved at that first boatload of pilgrims."
Exactly.
No more spearing fish and peeing in the woods.
It's tea cakes and Bible lessons for you.
What the hell are you talking about?
Those women are gonna civilize you.
"No more fingers up your nose, no hands down your pants, and forget about sitting on the couch, drinking from a can of pork and beans."
"Please, Carl, I'm not an animal."
I've lived indoors before.
Really?
"You want to lift these couch cushions and play food, filth or fungi?"
Tamale?
Frozen plantain.
I'll eat that.
See?
"Doesn't take up a lot of space, and it fits in with all your Asian decor."
Samsung.
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do with this?
Good question.
Where do you keep your bobbleheads?
We were told Kevin Grey dated her before she left him for your dad.
"Detective Clayton, I like to think you knew my father very well."
He had a girl in every bar in town.
It was hard for me to keep track.
Is there any reason why you would want to protect Kevin Grey?
Not that I can think of.
Miss Lau has answered your questions.
I'd like to draw this to a close.
"Miss Lau, I did know your father well."
And you know what I smelt on him the last time I saw him?
Fear.
- Fear?
"- He knew, didn't he?"
He knew he was going to be killed.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.
Freddie wasn't a man that scared easily but someone had him on the run.
"If you say so, Harry."
"Yet you - you seem completely unaffected through all of this, cool as a cucumber."
- Why is that?
- I don't like the direction you're taking this.
Almost as if you knew you were going to be left untouched.
"- Unless you charge my client, we are leaving."
- What did they promise you?
Miss Lau?
"You're playing a very dangerous game here, Harry."
"The truth is, you're in no position to be questioning me about any of this."
And why is that?
- What's that?
- What's the matter with it?
"My father died very soon after he called in your debt, Harry Clayton."
And you were there in the casino the night it happened.
"Okay, we're all gonna get through this, okay, mom?"
"And i gotta go, all right?"
"Mama, what's wrong?"
You don't look good.
"Marcus, what really happened between you and regina?"
- Oh.
"- I know you let her go to make a point,"
But couldn't you have held onto her
And made your point in another way?
"Your family has fallen apart, son."
I did what i thought was best at the time.
Regina knows how i feel about her.
But our marriage wasn't important enough
For her to make the compromises she had to for the family.
It was all about her career and not about us.
"She wanted more, so i let her go and find it."
How long and how hard can you hold onto someone
Who is selfish and wants to be free?
"She's a grown woman, mom."
I can't hold onto her against her will.
"I understand, marcus."
"But whatever you do, don't let her divorce you."
Try and hold onto her for all of our sakes.
The ball is in her court and she knows it.
She's always known that i'd take her back.
She just has to say the word and i'll act as if none of this ever happened.
"I hate seeing her this way, but i can't make her want me"
Or want a life with me.
"I love her with all my heart,"
But i can't stand in her way if she wants to be free.
Okay?
"But really, i gotta go, mom."
-No.
He didn't tell you what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests are pretty tight-mouthed then?
That depends.
-On what?
-The priest.
"I mean, what if a person came to you, you know, that was a murderer or a criminal of some kind and they wanted some kind of help?"
Would you have to turn them in?
"Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, I'd say no."
-You wouldn't?
"-No, I wouldn't."
But I would try to convince him to turn himself in.
"And, how do you go about getting an exorcism?"
I beg your pardon?
"If a person's, you know, possessed by a demon, or something how do they get an exorcism?"
"First, I'd have to get them into a time machine and get them back to the 1 6th century."
I didn't get you.
"It just doesn't happen anymore, Mrs. MacNeil."
"Oh, yes?"
Since when?
"Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia."
All those things they taught me at Harvard.
"Mrs. MacNeil, since the day I joined the Jesuits I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism."
Not one.
"Yeah, well it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed."
And needs an exorcist.
"Father Karras, it's my little girl."
Then that's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Why?
I don't understand.
"To begin with, it could make things worse."
This is awkward.
"Bad career move, in fact."
"Hey, forget it."
What?
I don't need the new shift commander PO'd at me.
It's a woman to woman thing.
- Is this about Beau?
- Yeah.
How does that go?
"Sleep with a cop, sleep with his partner."
I'm the only one who knows.
I'm the only one he told and I made him tell.
And you don't approve?
See it from my end.
"I'm still on the street, closing my cases 100%... because Beau and I are in tune, in sync."
I got Beau covering my back.
"You two can't be a secret forever, it will come out."
"There'll be jokes, snide remarks, bitching about favouritism, and one of you'll be transferred."
"And it's not gonna be the new female shift commander, so that'll leave me solo, with no one except maybe his wife and I to cry on each others shoulders."
What's she like?
"Caucasian, 5"" 6', 105Ibs, no distinguishing marks."
"Nothing distinguishing at all, except a husband who made it out of South Baltimore to become a homicide detective."
It's a world she doesn't understand and can't compete with.
I'm not competing.
That's what winners always say.
She wants him back?
"With all the upstanding, eligible bachelors craving a mother with three small children, what's she need Beau for?"
Frank?
- We may have a witness.
- Witness?
"Yes, she said she saw who killed Marilyn Callisto."
"Oh, yeah, right."
Everyone seems to be leaving me.
Home was my haven.
Now everything there just reminds me of everything not there.
Chuck.
"I mean, Charlotte."
Her room is how she left it.
"Clothes in the closet, her books on the shelves."
"Her special pillow, still at the head of the bed."
I didn't know she had a special pillow.
It was her father's.
"I'm sure it's teeming with fungus and microscopic bugs that feed on flakes of human skin, but she was fond of it."
"I know you loved having Charlotte safe at home smiling on the other side of the room, but she's gone."
She's moved out.
Hm?
I mean on.
She's moved on.
Maybe it's time for you to move on and get rid of that pillow.
As the Pie-Maker considered Chuck's worldly belongings  and how Vivian clinged to them  Olive was clinging to her own.
"Uh, excuse me."
Mother Superior.
Hi.
I have been here for a day and was told the porter would come for my things.
- Do I need to tell him what room I'm in?
"- The poor, sister."
The poor will come for your belongings.
Part of your vow of poverty?
I thought that was a temporary vow since I'm only gonna be a temporary nun.
Don't you have some kind of storage facility?
This is your home for as long as you're here.
"And as long as you're here, you will live as a nun."
But I like my belongings.
That's why they belong to me.
She would get very frustrated.
"Anne, you know, lives two blocks from my home."
I see.
And Harriet too would call.
"Yes, and Harriet would call."
"- And so, what would you do?"
"- I mean, he would be, like, MIA."
And sometimes I didn't know where he was or what he was doing.
"But he'd just say, ""I'm not in the office,"
"""so tell them such and such,"
"""or tell them you don't know where I am."
"So, you know, whatever."
"He would tell me what to do, and I just did it."
"So you... you remember, then, the day that Lou left for India the last time?"
"Oh, yes, yes."
You were here to see Lou off with your mother.
Yeah.
How did you know that?
"Well, I was in the office with you, because we couldn't push him out the door."
I came to the office because
I knew he wouldn't...
he'd miss his plane.
And he did the same thing.
He changed his clothes in the room where the Xerox machine was and came walking out all disheveled and left money... foreign currency from another country... all over the place.
And you and your mother literally had to push him into the taxicab.
"And once he got in the cab, then I could go home."
My own memory of that night is somewhat different.
He was working on the model for the Capital of Bangladesh.
We left him at the office at around 10:00.
He waved down to me from the top of the stairs.
The last thing I saw of him was his hand.
"""Dearest boy o' mine,"
She's mad.
She saw us together last night.
I'll talk to her.
Explain to her how bored out of my skull I was listening to you and my dad talk about dead writers all night.
You okay?
You just seemed kind of weird when your dad called me over.
"He had just told me about this horrid job he's taken in New Zealand, so he's gonna be gone for like ever now."
"Well, did you tell him not to?"
"When we spoke on the phone, you told me it was crucial that you speak to Julia in person."
"Yes, and I changed my mind."
I-I spoke to her over the phone.
About what?
About Kelly's disappearance.
I asked her if she would check Alan's cell phone and see if there were any recently made calls.
And?
She wouldn't do it.
"You don't take no for an answer, Sherry."
What aren't you telling me?
"Nothing, David, I swear."
What have you been up to since we last talked if you weren't at Milliken's?
Making calls.
You could have made them from here.
"Yes, but I didn't."
"I parked on the side of the road,"
I started making calls because I didn't want to wait.
I told you we have a small window of opportunity here.
I wanted to exploit the fact that Milliken may not have had time to cover his tracks when he had someone grab Kelly.
All right.
I have other things to attend to.
Okay.
Is there anything else?
That's it.
This should be a good show.
"Yeah, it's just like Morgan, going out with style."
"S-s-so, Annie was a doll."
Glad you two had fun.
We had some interesting conversations.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Mm-hmm, about the business model."
"What we've been doing right, wrong, how to expand, where to get more pento."
I had a feeling you'd get her back onside.
I can be very convincing.
Mmm.
I love funerals.
Nothing like staring death in the face to make you feel alive.
"Watch the Series Premiere of The Blacklist Redemption, Thursday on Global."
Scottie Hargrave is in charge of a global intelligence gathering operation.
"You should know, I have anger issues."
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Take it easy.
You're hired.
You want me to work for you?
We could do incredible things together.
You really know how to push my buttons.
Welcome to the family.
"Your sister's response is a typical consequence of loss, numbness that follows a period of intense grief."
"Losing one's parents, especially so suddenly, can be deeply disorienting."
Rest is what she needs.
"At Rosewood, she will have the benefit of time and privacy to recuperate."
"I don't see why, if rest and recuperation is what you prescribe, we couldn't simply repair to the coast as usual."
"Or if warmer weather is what she needs, we could go to Italy."
"He's a racist and a little shady, maybe, but a murderer?"
"It may be just a feeling, but I know he's in this."
We just need to figure out how.
Iayudame!
Iayudame!
Shot execution style just like all the others.
Why put him in there?
There must be something symbolically important.
There's something inconsistent about the staging.
"It's not remorse, and it's not a forensic countermeasure either."
Each of these families were registered gun owners.
That must be how he's selecting his victims.
He wants them to fight back.
It's propaganda for his race war.
He's turning the families into martyrs.
And the fall guy takes the blame.
"But now he's lost control because his fall guy got away, and he's devolving."
His name's Ramon Gomez.
He's an undocumented immigrant from Mexico City.
And he's pretty freaked out.
"Well, that's understandable."
Was he able to give a description of the unsub?
Just of the vehicle.
His English is not good.
We put an APB out.
Hola.
Mi nombre es Emily Prentiss.
Preston campaign headquarters.
This is...
And please tell everybody that I appreciate all of their help.
"Sometimes I don't have a chance to do it personally, so it's really great what they do."
"Hey, uh, Clark, you got a second?"
- I'd rather not.
It's late for Buddy and I ought to finish these socks.
"Come on, Frank, you and Ruth can chaperon us."
Lay off.
I told you I don't wanna go.
What are you gonna do?
Stay and make faces at yourself all night?
Will you go on to the movies and let me alone?
Come on.
No job's worth eating your heart out.
"But it was my job, wasn't it?"
You said so.
"I said so, but the company didn't."
They got their own ideas.
Where did they get the idea Dombrowski was so hot?
"Well, he invented that oiling system that they're using now."
He's saving them dough.
They figure that a guy who could do that could save them in other ways.
He's got his nose in a book and going to school while we lay around and listen to radio.
You gotta hand it to him.
"They've already handed it to him, ain't they?"
I suppose if I went around showing off reading books they'd make me president of the company.
"If you wanna be a sorehead, forget it."
Sorehead?
Sure I'm a sorehead.
Ain't I got a right to be?
How would you like it if you'd been counting on a break sure you was gonna get it and all you got was laughed at just because some guy's been sucking around the boss?
- Yeah?
"- Hello, Mr. Taylor."
This is Jenkins of the Zenith Auto Sales Company.
I showed you the car this afternoon.
"Well, forget it."
You think we're being bugged?
[Beeping stops]
"We aren't sure exactly what or who we're looking for out here, so I figured, we can't be sure who's looking for us."
"So, what tripped the alarm?"
Maybe the sensor's turned up too high.
"[Beeps, whirring]"
"[Beeping] Ah, ha ha ha."
I'll be damned.
Looks like this watch is good for something other than taking care of checks at Korean restaurants.
Mm.
[Sighs]
Hello.
Someone has hard-wired a GPS transmitter to the watch's battery.
"You think it's CIA, left over from my Thailand mission?"
Possible.
Doubt we'll ever know for sure.
Can't we track down where it was purchased?
No.
"I'm afraid this transmitter's incredibly common, which makes tracking it almost impossible."
"But we have to try, right?"
"I mean, it's why we're here."
[Knock on door]
Kendall.
Wow.
You certainly have baited the hook.
"I had to, especially considering it's gonna be two against one tonight."
What are you talking about?
"Come on, Rick."
I know you're gonna sneak into Austin's house to look for evidence while Hayley and I distract him.
"I'm no fool, but you are if you think your little plan will work without these."
Schematics to Austin Elektra's house.
Where'd you get those?
I have Pyrellic poisoning.
Sleer's doing.
There is an antidote that prevents the poison's spreading.
"As long as I take it daily I get no worse, but Sleer, of course, controls my supply."
- So long as you manufacture Pylene-50.
- That is the threat always over my head.
To work for Sleer or to die in agony.
"But, from time to time,"
"Commissioner Sleer comes in here to taunt me, to gloat."
"Now, thanks to my outdated nitroglycerine, Dayna,"
I am ready.
I hope Leitz comes as well.
He usually does.
- Leitz.
- Almost as vile a sadist as Sleer.
"Yes, I should like Leitz to be here."
Is something wrong?
But Leitz told us he worked for the resistance.
"But he didn't tell us about that booby-trap door, did he?"
"And he must have set Hunda up, too."
"That story about the monorail tunnel, it's all a trap."
We've got to tell Hunda and warn him.
"Forbus, we came here to get a sample of Pylene-50 in the hope that someone can devise..."
"Somebody already has, Tarrant."
"These block the effects of Pylene-50, but unfortunately can't reverse them."
And this is the written formula.
- Forbus...
"- Don't waste time thanking me, my friends."
You must hurry.
"- Flight commander wants clearance to launch, sir."
"- All right, go ahead."
"Strike leader, this is Control."
Come in.
You look positively orange with loneliness.
"No, I don't see that catching on at all."
What are you doing?
I'm working on my three-person chess game.
"Oh, cool."
Can I play?
It's three-person chess.
Did you bring a friend?
No.
Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can't play three-person chess.
Can you believe this guy?
"Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need."
"No, thank you."
I'm fine.
It's not optional.
We're out of tea.
I hope you like bouillon.
"I, uh, I guess you're probably wondering what's got me down."
"Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece."
How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey-- the king's feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?
"I'm going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me."
"I'm such a basket case, I can't even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body."
"The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there's a one-in-five chance he'll kill himself."
"Sheldon, listen to me."
"I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared."
Yellow.
Go ahead.
A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they're testing.
He says it's the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
Fascinating.
What's in it?
Why should I wait for that?
- Did you find anything?
- Searching the containers takes time.
- Then hire more people.
- It's not people we need.
We're still negotiating with a few less-than-cooperative shipping companies.
- Just solve the problem.
- Would you excuse us for a moment?
I've spoken to the Board.
"Everyone wishes you the best, but we have no managing director, prices are dropping, rumours are rife."
"They can voice their complaints to me, otherwise, just do as I ask."
"I'm paying you to do as I ask, so, do it!"
That wasn't necessary.
- Here's the TV script.
- Thank you.
Neither the nanny nor Cart and Emilie's teachers have heard of the gap.
Isn't it just a game they've made up?
- Are they ready'?
- Yes.
The police called.
They advise against doing it.
No.
Come.
You can help save Emilie's life.
- I'm sure your voters will forgive you.
- I've already answered questions.
"As you know, Emilie's kidnapping is closely tied to an old murder case, which your friend, Assistant Public Prosecutor Schuitz was responsible for."
"I was appalled by the whole story, but I have explained our meeting."
- According to a witness...
- The meeting was about Louise Hjelby.
Seifert is totally unreliable.
Is he really the cause of this meeting?
- Have you had a fight?
Scum!
He came for beer.
I told him the store is shut.
He took it perforce
He even broke the statue of The Goddess!
Bloody half-caste!
"I say Lajjo, thank God that you and your daughters... haven't been marred by this British ness!"
"Else, you would've been nowhere!"
Dam these scoundrels!
"Set sail in stormy waters, and you're in danger of sinking"
You were so little when we brought you here.
And now...
They said that a grown-up daughter is a burden on a man
"But a daughter like you, makes a father's chest swell with pride!"
You're my good girl
Will you give something if I ask you?
- Whatever you wish
I want to take a look at Europe
Eurail is offering a month's tour.
All my friends are going
Please don't be cross.
"I have never disobeyed you, Babuji"
I'll be going away to a land I have never seen
The man I'm going to marry is a complete stranger.
But...
I have no complaints.
You must've considered it in my best interests
But I won't get a chance like this ever again.
I don't even know whether I'll ever come back... whether I will have these friends later on
"Besides, it's only for a month."
"In a month, I will have lived a lifetime"
Now I'm turned on by a sale at Target.
"If I could just get a guy to touch me at Target, I'd be gold."
So have sex.
I can't.
It's complicated.
"You know, I'd have to find a boyfriend who likes kids, and then I'd have to make sure that Ritchie likes him, and what if he has kids?"
"I mean, whose house do we stay over at?"
"You don't need to have a boyfriend to have sex, Peggy Sue."
Have a one-night stand.
Get one under you belt.
Do you know that you are the second person to use that expression.
Ever?
"No, not ever."
"God, a one-night stand."
I wouldn't even know where to begin.
"I mean, where would I go, what would I do, go to a singles bar?"
You could.
But that would mean hopping in a time machine and going back to when singles bars existed.
"Well, I mean, where do you go?"
I get most of my action at the grocery store.
Really?
God. 'Cause I go to the Ralph's on Pico and it's all skateboarders and lesbians.
That Ralph's is dead.
Try the Whole Foods on Fairfax.
I can't remember the last time I left that place alone.
"I have to say, I feel really uncomfortable about this."
"Well, I need company."
It would seem too whorey if I came to a grocery store to pick up a guy alone.
And bringing your brother along makes it seem wholesome?
And why are you even doing this?
I just want to feel like a woman again.
"Help me be a woman again, Matthew."
"We got Bossman in the cabana getting his balls rubbed, and you're out here asking for the fucking tartare?"
You know the surgeon general just said that stress is more dangerous than smoking?
Maybe you should think about that.
"We miss Wayne, we're fucked."
"Oh, there he is."
It's about fucking time.
Look at him saunter.
"God, that must have been some release, huh?"
"Oh, all right here we go."
"( chuckling ) Long way from home, Dorothys."
I'm gonna need you to reconsider cutting Vernon.
"I've been spending far too much time and getting far too little in returns, Spencer."
"I know I said this before, but this time, it's guaranteed."
Vernon's out of the weed business.
Nothing like getting a guarantee for the second time.
"Ah, no, that first time was a promise."
This is a guarantee.
Totally different thing.
"Bossman, come on, he's a good kid."
"Hell, I know he is."
I'm actually quite fond of him.
Do you gentlemen have any idea how difficult it is to operate the greatest brand in sports?
"You own the New England Patriots, too?"
I'm totally kidding.
"No, we don't."
People are always looking for new ways to knock us down.
"( chuckles ) Yeah, I can relate to that one."
"Hmm, some would say you have it coming, though."
Word is you've been sniffing in the tall weeds with a short snout.
I'm not quite too sure what that even means.
Me either.
"I've never heard that one, no."
"You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him."
Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too."
Yeah.
That isn't true!
"Okay, that's totally true."
"But, you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids."
"Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack."
That was supposed to be my power-up pack.
"I'm Scott Malkinson, I have diabetes."

Mr. Gueermo?
What?
!
We're from child-protective services.
There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child.
What?
!
Who the hell's been saying that?
!
We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.
His name is Stan Marsh.
You better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car 'cause there's a world of hurt about to come your way.
Mr. Gueermo we need to come in and have a word with your son.
"Oh, by all means."
"You got the balls to come in here, do it."
Do it.
"Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly."
"We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes, if that's okay, and just maybe--"
"Yeah, there it is!"
What do you mean?
The instrument for your ship's destruction has already been placed aboard her: : :
And by a member of your own crew:
[Laughs]
"Discover him in time, and you will have won all:"
Reardon:
"The man we picked up here was a fake, wasn't he?"
And Wilma... the real Wilma...
took him on board the Searcher:
And it was he who was able to tell this creature how to duplicate our ship:
[Laughs] You are indeed worthy of admittance to my masters' planet!
Such intuition is a rare thing:
"We are sick and tired of playing your stupid game, old man:"
"I want some answers from you, and I want them now!"
How is Reardon going to destroy the ship?
How's he gonna do it?
"Oh, perhaps not so intelligent after all:"
Anger and violence do not provide solutions:
"Tell me, old man:"
I overestimated you:
[Clicking Tongue]
What a pity:
[Explosion]
Gone like the others:
We gotta get back to the ship:
"Searcher, this is Captain Rogers:"
Do you read me?
Over:
"Yes, Buck:"
What have you found?
"We're returning to the ship, Admiral:"
You've got a saboteur on board:
Even with a family.
Now I'm just filling in time.
"What have you got, Jack?"
A medal in a drawer.
I should think hard before you hold your hand up for the sacrificial lamb.
You know where I live.
"Always keep your door locked, George."
People get mugged this way.
"Jack, you know I'm not allowed to talk to you."
I don't want to be landed in it.
"Well, neither did I, did I?"
"But I am, right up to my neck."
I didn't ask to work with them.
"No, but I'm bloody glad you are."
"Come on, what's green mean, green, green...."
Sheridan's adamant that he wasn't at the hotel that day.
He was at home with the wife.
A very handy missus for alibis.
So how was Superintendent Bailey?
"Well, I'd like to be able to say that she's every sort of cow under the sun, but unfortunately I think she's quite a good copper."
"Now that Mrs. Sheridan gave quite a good performance as a woman scorned, and she's his only alibi."
She was dodgy once you'd better check the hotel.
I have.
I've been on the phone.
The manager clearly knew
"Mrs. Barr, and Sheridan by sight."
"The description of the man she was with that day is a bit hazy, but it wasn't Sheridan."
What about the bill?
"I've got it here somewhere, I think."
Here we are.
"It's for a meal, and a double room for the night, he thinks they left by six that evening."
"Oh well, thank you very much George, well done."
We know how to deal with the mob.
The yakuza's are very different and dangerous.
They get a food hold in this country and we are screwed.
"The campanela people will do for us in twenty four hours, what would take another two months in the field and three years in court."
I know these people.
"It's pretty damn clean, actually."
When is this going down actually?
"As far as we know, immediately."
I'd like to thank you agent brant for your hard work on this project.
I'm sorry it couldn't have gone to better use.
Maybe next time.
♪ Dark music ♪
I know what you're thinking.
Get the fuck out of my way.
You can't interfere in this.
"Sam, how can you sit back and let innocent people get slaughtered?"
Innocent people?
"Jesus Christ man, have you lost your mind?"
"They're not innocent people, they're the yakuza's."
They're the bad guys remember?
"Yeah, I remember."
"Good, then maybe you'll accept this as a professional."
Littlman has you booked on a flight to Hawaii tonight.
Littlman has you booked on a flight to Hawaii tonight.
Look it's for your own protection.
You did such a good job that even campanela is fooled.
He thinks you're yakuza.
"And if he's hitting the tendo family, you're going to be very high on that list."
Ok.
"Now listen, you're going right?"
"I'm going, I'm going."
Hey thanks.
"Spencer, if you don't wanna admit what you're doing, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."
"Bossman, I'm not afraid to talk about anything."
I just thought that that kind of transparency between you and I would put you in an awkward position with the league.
Let me worry about what position I'm in.
"Fine, it's true."
I'm guilty of sniffing in the tall weeds.
With a short snout.
I wanna bring a team to Vegas.
"Reaching for the brass ring, huh?"
"Well, admittedly, it's a little outside of my expertise, but, yes."
"I always knew you had big balls, Spencer, but I didn't know your judgment was this questionable."
How do you figure?
The league's just approved you and you're already biting its hand?
Didn't even call for approval?
That's just plain wrong.
The upside's worth it.
I suppose we'll see.
"The way I see it, there's only one way to take a team to Vegas, and that's big, even by Texas standards."
That's the only way we do it.
"Big takes vision, Spencer."
Do you have a vision?
I do.
"But even if I didn't, Wayne Hastings does."
"- Wayne Hastings, huh?"
- Yeah.
"Well, that boy there's a proven visionary."
He's like the me of Vegas.
"- Oh, you're more handsome."
- I could use your support and definitely your wisdom to get this whole thing done.
"Yeah, approval comes through Texas."
Everybody knows that.
And how far in is Wayne?
That's not a very friendly greeting after I broke my back getting here.
"Hi, Joey."
"Say, there's a blizzard blowing up, big one."
Got a drink?
I'm froze.
"You're nowhere near froze, with all you've got in you already."
I see the Navy hasn't cured you of drinking.
Cure me!
"Honey, the Navy's taught me tricks you never heared of."
"Sure made a lot of changes around here, ain't you?"
"You bet we have, Lucas."
"And for a start, you can pick up your things and go."
Ain't nobody gonna tell me what I can't do in my own house.
- This isn't your house anymore.
- I don't care.
"This is still my place, and don't forget it."
Did you just come back here to make trouble?
"- You heard about Ma, didn't you?"
"- Yep, heard about her."
"Hey, Joey, here's a quarter."
"Run along now, huh?"
"Come on, pick it up."
"- Pick it up, Joey."
"- Lucas, you leave him alone."
"Oh, honey... ."
"No, don't start a fight."
Me and you got to know each other a little too well for that.
"Say, I didn't think you could improve, but you sure have."
"It ain't like I was your real pa, you know."
"- You dirty, filthy animal!"
"- You're still a little wildcat, ain't you!"
"As we worship together this Easter morning and more, as we pray to him who died and rose again that we might have life and have it more abundantly let us remember especially those who have gone from this country and town to live and die in far-off places for a like purpose."
It's never good-bye.
Could've been different if the injury didn't occur.
But it did occur.
- And that was the big difference.
- I'm proud of what you did.
- Okay.
- I expect you to do a lot better.
I don't want this to be the-
- Yeah.
"- You know, the highlight of your career."
You've got a lot of bigger and better things to do.
I'll see you later.
Good luck.
"Well... another one walks out the door, and another one comes in the door."
That's what it's all about.
It came through for me.
- Got the score I needed.
- All right.
"And, hey..."
I'm eligible.
"You know, this is one of the greatest feelings in the world."
That's about it.
I mean -
"After five attempts, William's composite score of 17.5... is rounded up to 18... and he can finally accept a scholarship to play at Marquette."
"I think my mom... all through high school really, really was proud of me."
"She said, ""Everybody's throwing their dreams into you... but you got to throw your own dreams into yourself. '"""
"When I gave her the diploma after the graduation... she was, like, ""This is it, one of my proudest moments. '"""
My baby graduated.
"Curtis always wanted to go to Marquette... and his grades weren't good enough for him to go... and now it's like he got the grades,you know?"
"Excuse me, Curtis."
You gonna give anybody else a chance?
What two countries are we competing with for world trade?
And this material is identical to that of the suit.
It's been established that Mr. Somers was located in bungalow number 3.
"Where were you, sir?"
"Here, two doors down."
What time did you check out?
"I'm a salesman, see?"
And I like to travel at night.
So it was about 20 past 9 when I put the bags in the car.
That's when I saw him.
Saw whom?
Him.
"Let the record show that the witness pointed to the defendant, Axel Norstaad."
What was he doing when you saw him?
He was running like a scared rabbit out of the cabin.
How can you be so sure of your identification of a figure you saw running away into the night?
"Well, I ought to be able to identify Axel Norstaad."
I've been selling him a line of paint specialties for years.
"This is how it was, Mr. Mason."
First I went to see the bartender.
"Then I went into the office of the motel, and I saw the register."
And Somers is room 3.
I knock on the door.
There is no answer.
"But the door is open, and the radio is playing, so I go in."
"""Somers"", I say,"
"""if you try to make trouble for Edie like you do for me--"""
And then I see him on the floor.
I bend down to look.
And it was while you were bending over him that you got the blood on your trouser leg.
Yes.
"And when I saw that... also how it would look if someone come in and find me there, then I-"
- How do you say it?
"So, I refused to front him the money, because I didn't want to encourage him."
"But maybe he did, anyway."
If he did...
The escort agency-- you got the address?
"Well, yeah, we need everything you got."
Sooner the better.
What's going on?
Your text said you were looking into an escort agency.
That was the idea.
He's on the phone with the fire marshal.
"Based on the weathering of this tape and the graying of the ash, the place was burned down two days ago."
No question it was arson.
Agency's computers and paperwork were all covered with gasoline and lit up.
Problem is finding who did it.
Agency employees all vanished.
"Paperwork's gone, and the names that I could find are fake."
The whole thing was owned by a shell company.
- Sounds like organized crime.
- Yeah.
I wish I could tell you which kind.
Office manager was named
"Carla Petro, but nobody who met her thought she looked Italian, and her name is as fake as the rest."
Is he okay?
He's fine.
"Your arsonist was driving a fully-restored, vintage Ford Mustang, model year 1965, '66, '67 or '68."
Color unknown.
How can you know that?
You say in your report you found a charred wastebasket inside.
You thought it was used to splash petrol around the office.
So?
"So, why did the arsonist use a waste basket?"
Why not a gas can?
"Now, inside this Ark is a relic of Atlantis itself."
The Torch of Truth.
Where is the director with his key to open the blasted display case?
"Uh, professor,"
Kelly discovered something you might want to--
Professor Atticus.
I've just been on the phone to the Balkan Embassy.
They say that you and Mr. MacGyver are thieves.
"Oh, do you hear that, MacGyver?"
"First we are spies, now we are thieves."
"They claim the Ark is a national treasure, and demand its return."
You can't return it to those butchers.
It belongs to the world.
You have no say in the matter.
"I'll remind you, Professor Atticus, that you no longer work here."
"Oh, Mr. Director, this Ark contains the missing link to Atlantis, an unknown chapter in history."
If you'll just open the display case and let us get hold of that medallion.
"Excuse me, can I see that?"
The medallion's magnetic.
"Yeah, so's the Ark."
A magnetic lock and key.
Impossible.
The people of Solon's time had no concept of the physics of magnetism.
"Ah, but legend says the people of Atlantis did, and Solon somehow must have learned it from them."
Pure speculation.
Ha-ha-ha!
You won't think so when you see what's inside this Ark.
"That's it, this is it."
This is it.
It works.
"It works, it works."
"Oh, after all these years, MacGyver."
"regina just left,"
Which is probably a good thing
Considering how she's been acting these days.
"Yeah, i just saw her flying out of the house for her morning jog."
"I called after her, but she just kept running."
- Oh.
- Kind of like she does in life in general.
"Georgia: well, she probably couldn't hear you"
Because she's got on her ipod.
It's a good thing she got out of here when she did.
Things were getting a little heated in here.
- What happened?
"- Well, we had a little tiff"
About regina and her taste for the good life.
"Well, that's nothing new."
I meant what happened to all the furniture?
"Oh, i'm not surprised that she didn't tell you."
She lost her job
About six months ago.
- What?
"- She's broke,"
Stubborn and won't let me help her.
And they repossessed her car too.
And today we got a foreclosure notice on the house.
"Now i've gotta do something,"
Because i am not going to be homeless
Because of her bad decisions.
"Well, i was coming over to tell her some good news,"
But i guess she won't be in the mood to appreciate it.
"Oh, give it to me, because i do need it."
"But just don't tell me you found a new woman,"
Because that won't be good news for her or me.
I'm...
I'm wondering if I'm also going to be tangled up in Detective Im's case.
It's true that I hurt your feelings.
I know that as well.
Are you planning on doing something to me too?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
"I would appreciate it if you left me out, Representative."
I only did what I was told.
"Detective Im didn't do anything either, but if he was falsely accused..."
Then it will be easy for you to do the same thing to me.
Who was falsely accused?
"You know better than anyone, that Detective Im did nothing wrong."
- He did... nothing wrong?
- Yes.
- Detective Im didn't commit any crimes.
- He's a murderer.
- That's what you're making them believe.
- That's not true.
"That's not true, this isn't true."
You've created all of this.
He's a murderer.
Im Tae Ho is a murderer.
Do you know what your biggest problem is?
"You're wasting your life doing useless things, thinking useless thoughts."
You can't even pass the exam to become a police officer...
Yet you pass up the opportunity for special employment with the agency.
I didn't know you would do that.
"You think your 20s will last forever, don't you?"
I think you wasting your life is a bigger crime than committing a murder...
Who are you accusing of participating in a murder?
Will it be the same...
as what happened three years ago?
I know that I say that I could make a haul worldwide delicious parking in the city.
But I am not a good God
"I am his secretary, all."
One more thing.
I am not as those of your world.
Come.
Did I leave it where you want.
Tell him that your friend Minister
I clean up the city by yourself?
Who defend the law against the law?
"Instigate those carrion against each other, is an art ... seldom rewarded."
"Then, about a medal?"
I tell everything.
I can not leave you more closely.
A sweet?
Do not swallow the pit.
You still lack one last detail.
"Marie, I found less than one year."
I am his father.
"Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua,"
"Albania, Egypt, the war!"
"Albania, war!"
"Egypt, Nicaragua!"
I often dream this strange and shocking for a woman unknown and I love and who loves me ...
"Do not miss this tender time, sweetness to be or not be ... because I have lived nell'attendere and my heart was not that your hand."
"Be wise, my pain, stay more calm."
"Relied on the evening falls, here it is."
"A dark envelops the city bringing about a peace, to those who worry the ..."
It is from within hours with the dog.
I do not want to disconnect?
"Do not open more eyes, does not say anything."
Try to shake shit.
"Yeah, and I said to him, ""Come to our house, you'll see he's nice."
"""Our address..."""
And I gave him our address.
"So, I don't know if that had anything to do with it."
LAUGHTER
"Then, after that, Scotland Yard said, ""You have to take precautions now"
"""and when you leave the house,"
"""you have to look under your car to check for bombs."""
"And my dad's like, ""OK, I'm a writer, I totally know what a bomb..."""
"Unless it's round, with TNT written on it."
It's fizzing.
"So, before school, we'd all look under the car like this and my dad's going, ""I'm not a mechanic."
"""I have no idea what it's meant to look like."
"""Get in, get in."
"We'll see what happens."""
"And he'd turn the engine on, we'd be like..."
"""No, we're all right, yeah, we're cool."
"We're going to school."""
He got you in the car and then tried it.
"Yeah, yeah."
And he didn't take on any other precaution.
"After that, I thought my dad would pack up writing and go and work in a chip shop, but he never did."
So does he still get death threats?
Is he still getting...?
Only from my mother.
LAUGHTER
Matthew.
Hello.
Can you tell me about not going to see Morrissey?
Why is it significant that you didn't go to see Morrissey?
"Well, because my wife turned 30 this year, and I thought, as a nice birthday treat, we would go and see Morrissey - it's her favourite singer - in concert."
"So, we booked a holiday to Brooklyn, cos that's where he was playing."
Two feds and an unnamed party.
"Got to be a foreign leader, protected witness or fugitive."
All possible targets for someone.
That changing flights at Dulles would be a vulnerable moment and the killer's one chance to exact revenge.
"It's a great catch, Abbs."
"They're escorting Hector Gomez, a high-level member of Cartel Dominguez."
Wanted for the murder of a rival cartel dealer.
"Gomez was captured hiding out in Wales, of all places."
Colombian authorities were extraditing him this morning.
"That outgoing flight to Bogotá, do we have a manifest?"
There isn't one yet.
Must have been a private charter.
Who in that terminal is Colombian?
"Tell me about recent trips to South America, e-mails, anything."
Cross-referencing DEA and CIA.
That's a needle in a haystack.
A haystack controlled by the world's most dangerous drug cartel.
"Hey, so, are those your fancy flying pajamas, or just your everyday casuals?"
"Dude, I'm not getting re-screened."
Uh-huh.
Why's that?
What...
Don't.
That's not mine.
Go get re-screened.
Dude.
"Um, it's the London flight, Tony."
Our killer is waiting for it.
Who's the target?
Hector Gomez.
Who?
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're pleased to announce the arrival of flight 3182 from London, now de-boarding at gate 212."
"Yes, but you got to wait in line with the other kids."
"No, you don't, buddy."
"Up you go, champ."
Get your hands off me!
I don't want my picture taken!
Right now.
"The girls asked me to make sure you're feeding him, and here you are pimping him out like... this isn't my wheelhouse."
"Famous pimps, anyone?"
What?
How dare they not trust us.
This stops now!
"Unless your boy, Han, gets a little taste of the horse-play."
Here.
What's going on here?
Nothing.
I know a shady deal when I see one.
I was one of the loudest voices against the Louisiana Purchase.
"Earl, what are you even doing here?"
I thought you lived at the diner.
"Well, thank God the girls asked me to check on Han checking on you too 'cause now this black male is about to blackmail you."
"Okay, Earl's in too."
At a lesser percentage because odds are he'll forget about all of this momentarily.
"Excuse me, manager."
"We've been wronged, and not just generally by life."
I don't know who to complain to about that.
Is there a problem over here?
I'm the pit boss.
I also do the mentalist show in the John Wilkes Booth Ballroom.
Still lots of tickets available.
"Yes, there's a problem here."
"We just got cheated out of our winnings, and I was already cheated out of much of my 20s, but again, probably not your department."
Why don't I send a complimentary bottle of champagne to your room?
Oh?
And?
"We'd like you to come with us, Luke Stokkart."
And if I refuse?
Milk Callaud will not live.
I see.
I thought it was strange that Ryner Lute would take the captain with him.
So that's it.
The ones who abducted her were all of you.
And your aim was me?
What are you babbling on about?
Come quietly!
This is...
"Yes, it's a Magic Trap."
"Ah, I'd recommend not moving."
"If you lift a foot, you'll be blown away without a trace."
"After all, I'd rather not have fellow servants of Roland die."
How did you?
I can tell from the way you carry yourself.
You're all people who received martial training in Roland.
"And the person who has employed men like you, who has abducted Milk Callaud, and who has business with me, would likely be none other than Miran Froaude."
I'm impressed.
"You've done your research on me, have you?"
"Lord Froaude, my deepest apol..."
"You are Lieutenant General Miran Froaude, I presume?"
"It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Sergeant Luke Stokkart."
I'm well aware of your strength.
Undefeated in twenty battles.
And all in situations with numerical inferiority that should have spelled certain defeat.
"You've done impressive research, considering that in most of those battles, I never gave my real name."
It seems men of this caliber weren't even enough to properly test you.
Where is Captain Milk?
"How could a subject ignore the King's command, and how co n such insolent man be allowed to lead the military?"
"Your Majesty, criminal of high treason Yi Soon-shin must be executed!"
"Defending high treason is also high treason, hence there must be consequences for the Left Minister Yu Sung-ryong as well."
"No, Your Majesty!"
Sincere council cannot be confused with treason!
Are you trying break my will as well?
Your Majesty...
Leave!
Your Majesty!
I said leave!
Do not attempt to break my will!
Or you will be punished regardless of who you are!
How foolish they are!
If in excess even nectar is poison.
What do they think they can gain by acting like they care more about the country than the King?
His Majesty will forsake Yu Sung-ryong as well.
"The world is as good as yours now, Minister Yoon."
Not yet.
I need the two of you to fight the Japanese and win for me.
"You don't have to worry, Minister Yoon."
I am counting on you.
You had once admonished me telling me that the world hasn't changed.
Do you recall?
How about now?
Has the world changed now?
"No, Your Majesty."
Nothing has changed.
Where is the Left Minister?
Your Majesty...
Is he still by Yi Soon-shin's side?
"I'm afraid so, Your Majesty."
Minister Yu... the heavens will not forsake you.
She said she was going to.
I assumed she had.
Who's Gina Gilbert?
I don't--
She's a girl I know.
"Just a friend, that's all."
"She a friend of Merle's, too."
Objection.
"Your Honor, if counselor gets much farther afield, we'll--"
"I'll discontinue this line of questioning, Your Honor."
And I'm finished with this witness...
for the moment.
"You're excused, Mr. Pierce."
"Call your next witness, Mr. Burger."
Then I call Mr. Julian Kirk.
That's right.
My house is next door.
It was the guest house on the estate when my grandmother was alive.
She left it to me in her will.
Was that all she left you?
Some other odds and ends of property.
All the real money went to Olivia-- I mean Merle.
Then you were familiar with the situation that existed at the Langley house?
I was certainly aware of how completely Olivia dominated Merle.
It's not the girl's fault she's neurotic.
"Are you by any chance a trained psychiatrist, Mr. Kirk?"
"Well, no, but all you--"
Then you're certainly not qualified to judge the defendant's mental condition.
"Now, then, was your knowledge of the situation of the house next door based on personal observation?"
Mostly.
"But the chauffeur kept me informed, too."
Did you witness a quarrel between the defendant and her aunt a couple of days prior to the murder?
"Do you think when your marriage is over that you're gonna find somebody that just caters to you, no matter what?"
That you're not gonna have to work at it?
"That's gonna be, like, psyched to go to Applebee's with you every Friday night and hear the same football stories about how you rocked in high school?"
I did rock in high school football.
You want to check tape?
"But whoever that person is, you have to listen to their stories, too, or they're not gonna go to Applebee's with you."
You're not gonna have someone to go to Applebee's with.
"You'll be sitting by yourself, eventually, at Applebee's, all alone."
And who wants to go to Applebee's by themselves?
You know what?
"If anyone should be mad here, guys, it should be me."
"I am having a real fight with my wife, okay?"
And it's not a fun feeling.
Look it.
I'm talking in circles.
I'm on an island.
I'm getting island fever now.
I'm starting to lose my mind.
This is an early sign of things to come.
And what we need to do now is get focused and stop pointing fingers.
You're a problem.
"You're a real, real problem."
Is that Salvadore?
Does this guy think he's a mermaid?
What is his deal?
Oh.
"Please, excuse my nudity."
I was expecting no company.
Allow me to put something on.
"I would have asked you to join me, but the water is a little chilly."
But perhaps this will warm up the evening.
And what is that?
I try to imagine the men who wrecked here half a century ago.
How did it feel to be marooned in such a place?
The wreck of the Otavi is so inaccessible that
Claytor is probably the lonely vessel's first visitor in decades.
His book promises to be a guided tour of the middle of nowhere.
May 16th
Today is the 894th day since I left home.
Sometimes I worry that I will become to comfortable being alone.
"Already,"
I can't imagine what it would be like to be in a room full of people.
I miss the most unbelievably trivial things.
A bookstore.
A movie.
A long hot shower.
A pillow.
The only sound I hear is a hyena in the distance.
I wonder where it is.
But I relish the quite...
the solitude.
May 17th.
I wake up at dawn and it's freezing.
I brush my teeth and break down camp.
"And then, almost as though it were a part of myself"
I see to the plane.
What I'm doing.
But of course I think about it.
I check everything and the I check it again.
Three pilots I met in the Faroe Islands were recently killed when their helicopter crashed.
That makes 15 pilots... 15 friends who have died since I started flying.
There's so much of flying that's completely out of your control.
So I try to concentrate on what I can control.
Despite the dangers and perhaps also because of them Claytor loves to fly
"Mr. Nash, come in, come in."
What a wonderful surprise.
"I wasn't expecting anybody but you're very welcome, I'm sure."
"You won't believe this, but I was just writing a letter to you."
Wait a minute and I'll go and get it for you.
"Now, isn't that a coincidence."
If you'd given me a little warning...
I might've fixed up a tiny bit.
I never was so surprised to see anybody in my life.
"Well, here it is."
By special messenger.
I was beginning to get worried.
"But I didn't tell them anything, like I promised."
Not a word.
They never asked me if you were there the night of the murder... so I didn't think it was wrong not to tell them anything.
"Well, Mr. Nash, whatever are you doing?"
Mr. Nash!
[screaming]
[Lottie gasping]
[baby crying]
"And now, I suppose you babies who have just put the sitter to bed... are wondering about Mr. Nash."
"He escaped in his automobile, but not for long."
He was soon arrested... for failing to yield the right of way.
"Well, he wasn't exactly arrested."
"You see, it was a train that he failed to yield to."
"And now, children, if you aren't naughty... and if the rabbit doesn't get drunk... drinking too much carrot tea... and fall on the elephant's trunk... next week I'll tell you another story."
[baby crying]
Good night.
"Good evening, and welcome to Alfred Hitchcock Presents."
Thank you.
See you next year.
"But I have to, I am under contract."
Did you tell Simon ?
"When I leave for so long, I'm scared scared, that something might happen to him while I'm gone."
Thank goodness he's stronger than he looks.
"You know, a little while after I met you,"
Simon told me :
"Mom, I'm glad you met François that you know about the two of us because I couldn't bear that if something happened to me, nobody explained it to him."
Always worrying about the others.
It is true that it was not the life I wished for him but I am glad you're here.
"Come on, eat before it gets cold."
I can't imagine the way I looked when you told me that you were a sailor.
"Me the literature student having an affair with a sailor,"
I thought it was a bit of a cliché.
You mean you were scared that I was an stupid.
You can say it..
I've always seen right through you.
You've always been like an open book to me.
However the way you hid the truth about your condition
Bingo !
It could have won you an oscar.
I didn't want to lie to you.
I just wanted us to be happy.
Come on !
I'm coming !
"Good morning madam, this is doctor Seguin from the cardiology department of Brest hospital."
Yes !
We have just found a perfect donnor for Simon's heart transplant.
Yes !
I'll get him ready.
Thank you.
"And then, little by little I came back to life."
At the beginning everything seemed to be normal.
"Here I am, this little kid, I can't even see over the steering wheel and I'm parking Cadillacs."
"But, it wasn't too long before my parents changed their minds about my job at the cabstand."
"For them, the cabstand was supposed to be a part-time job."
But for me it was definitely full time.
That's all I wanted to do.
"People like my father could never understand, but I was part of something."
I belonged.
I was treated like a grown-up.
Tell him 519.
Every day I was learning to score.
"A dollar here, a dollar there."
I was living in a fantasy.
Did you have a good day at school today?
My father was always pissed off.
"He was pissed that he made such lousy money, he was pissed that my kid brother Michael was in a wheelchair."
He was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house.
Tell me about this.
It's a letter from school.
It says you haven't been there in months.
In months!
You're a bum!
Want to grow up to be a bum?
"But after a while, he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand."
He knew what went on at that cabstand.
And every once in a while I'd have to take a beating.
"But by then, I didn't care."
The way I saw it everybody takes a beating sometime.
I can't make any more deliveries.
What do you mean you can't make any more deliveries?
You're gonna fuck everything up.
My dad said he's gonna kill me.
Look.
If you can help your neighbor light that at the other end.
(coughing)
Oh!
Who's next?
We're about to go into a... into a dispensary.
Is this it?
Is this the...
"Oh, okay."
Okay.
I'm off to the dispensary.
We are much further along than I ever imagined us to be.
Morris:
Andrew Freedman is the Director of Marijuana coordination in the Colorado governor's office.
Freedman:
There are more dispensaries than there are Starbucks.
"We estimated the size of the industry in its first year to be about 700 million, and now we think it tops one billion dollars as an annual revenue source."
What makes this massage different?
This massage is different because our massage cream is infused with THC and CBD.
"All right, I think I'll try the extra strength."
Great choice.
Is that pressure okay?
Yeah.
Morris:
"Maybe it was the extra strength THC oil, but I started to wonder, where is all this weed coming from?"
I'm standing in what may be Colorado's largest cannabis grow operation.
"It's so enormous,"
I can't even see the edges of the room from where I'm standing.
Look at what we've created here.
"I mean, is this something?"
"This is John Seckman, the COO of LivWell."
This is the most exciting thing I've ever done.
"It's a business, and it's a new exciting business."
Back to your places now.
Guess how much the Camembert was.
"- I don,t know."
Five francs?
- 4.35.
"Where,d you get it?"
I got that...
"Have you seen my tape, wolfgang?"
Where the hell did I put that damn tape?
And he plays Mr. Nice Guy!
"He only wants to be the object of positive transference and affection, and I get all the negativity!"
Give me a break!
Know what your problem is?
"At first you wanted to be the aII-powerfuI phaIIic mother manipulating love and hate, but you never responded to their demands for love and bonding because you couldn,t stand being part of the very tests you reject."
Your subconscious spilled over into your work.
"You swayed the experiment in the couple,s favor by being aggressive, because deep down you no Ionger want to be a ,tool, a mere ,technician,!"
"You always oversimpIify, sweetie."
"It,s much more complicated."
What if I was doing it on purpose from the start?
Right!
What did I do with that tape?
Did I erase it?
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, good morning!"
"I,II be showing you some images, and I,d like to know whether, if the thing or person shown disappeared, you,d be happier, less happy, or indifferent."
"Happier, less happy, or indifferent."
Okay.
If what?
"If the person disappeared, would you be happier or less happy?"
Ready?
Here we go.
Happier.
Happier.
And maybe you better say them outside.
"Take it easy, Axel."
I'm the one he's throwing the sour grapes at.
You bet your life I am.
The slide trombone of the furniture business.
"Well, Norstaad, according to your bidding rules, the highest bidder is supposed to put down $50,000 before the contract is signed."
Have you seen one penny of Somers' money yet?
I've got the check right here.
- That satisfy you?
- No.
I think Mr. Hadley is being quite hysterical.
"Axel, a deal is a deal, and I see no justification for the slightest delay in signing the contract."
Good.
Let's do it right now.
"Lisa, give to me the contracts."
There's no fool like an old fool.
"When first I see sketch like this one month ago,"
I say yes.
This is what Children's Hospital should look like.
"And then I say, ""Mr. Reed, it is like you look into my mind and into my heart and put on paper what you see there."""
Now it is all done with blue paper and arithmetic.
"Edie, you like it?"
"Yes, I like it very much indeed."
"You don't know how happy I am to hear that, Miss Morrow."
Why shouldn't you hear it?
Isn't Edie friend of yours?
"I tell you a secret, Latham."
"When you bring me sketch and idea, this is very good."
But next thing you do for me is even better.
"When I say ""Where we will get the money?"""
"you say ""I know beautiful lady who knows all about how to raise money."""
"Axel, please, you're getting carried away"
Because I always thought there was a kind of almost telepathy between the two of us.
-Like a sixth sense.
-Or maybe just a boring old fifth sense.
-Sorry?
"-We're talking about Janice, aren't we?"
When did all this start?
When she was wiping the chocolate off your shirt or....?
"I know, it's a complete nightmare."
What with the kids and Malcolm and everything.
"That's all been falling apart, apparently for sometime, so at some point or other they're gonna have to sit down and have a very serious talk."
"And in the meantime, the two of you have just been...."
What?
-Around here in the afternoons while he's at work?
-You make it sound so sordid.
I suppose it is.
Anyway.
Nice to know the Ysatis was a hit.
"Perhaps, I'll pass... on that cup of tea."
Huh.
-What?
"-No, it's just.... 1 00% nylon, that's...."
"You really haven't had much luck with women, have you?"
-Just lately.
"-And this would be an iron bedstead, then."
You've obviously been meeting all the wrong people.
Only I'm thinking that too much friction for me at the moment might be a slight problem....
"Hey, look."
Relax.
"I'm not gay or narcoleptic, or Catholic or covered in tattoos."
"I'm just your ordinary, everyday dental surgeon... who happens to think you're very special."
I bet you say that to all the guys.
"Actually, Gil... you're the first man I've ever made love to."
Got any words for your audience?
- Point the camera at Shannon.
- OK.
"So, Shannon, tell us why we're in the middle of a chase scene."
Because Kyle Weathers is a glory hunter who only wants fame and he doesn't care what he destroys to get it.
He has taken two beautiful wolves out of their natural habitat to make himself look good and make money.
And I'm not going to let that happen.
We're not going to let that happen.
Sorry.
"You can edit that out, right?"
And this bit too?
Pesky kids.
I'm not moving until you let the wolves go.
Didn't Mummy and Daddy teach you that we can't always get what we want?
They taught me to stand up for what's right.
Then they did a much better job than my parents.
Go home and make them a cuppa to say thanks.
You said you were just like me.
"Oh, sweetie."
No-one's that weird.
So everything you said was a lie?
"Finally, you get it."
Now will you move?
I should have known you were too good to be true.
"And because I trusted you, everything mysterious and magical is over."
"Yeah, cheese factor 50."
"Are all teenage girls like this, or just the crazy ones?"
I'm glad I'm not like you.
"Shannon, if your plan was to appeal to my better nature, it's not going to work."
I don't have one.
"Yeah, that was Plan A."
Plan B was to keep you talking long enough for Tom to sneak round the back of your truck and let the wolves go.
Something's weird.
An old lady from somewhere came to visit Grandma.
So what?
What's so weird about that?
"But you see, they just sit face to face."
That's it.
"They don't say a word, for all this time."
And it's been one hour already.
"Grandma, see if this letter is all right to send to Hawaii."
"""Hello there."
"Grandma is now inclined to go to Hawaii. """
This is just in diplomatic language.
"After all, we have to consider their feelings, too."
"""But before that, she says she wants to make sure about Suzujiro."
"""Even with the picture you sent, she doesn't remember..."
"""due to his age, and his looks after being ill."
"""If you have a picture taken when Suzujiro was young..."
"""please send it as soon as possible."
"""And ask Suzujiro to try and recall the names of his brothers."
"""If he recalls the names of Tetsutaro, Dozaburo and Jushiro..."
"""those names would match Grandma's memory."
"""And it would mean that Suzujiro is definitely the elder brother of Grandma."
"""In haste, respectfully... """
That's a great idea.
"Tateo, you are something!"
"This is all right, isn't it?"
- Thank you for all your trouble.
- Then I'll send it right away tomorrow.
But it's possible that letter will cross father on the way.
"He's got a job, and it's about time for him to be coming back."
"No, he won't be coming back."
"There's the pineapple farm, even if he gets fired."
"Gun, man, he's got the gun!"
"I know, Billy, I'm trying."
Just go!
What were you thinking?
Come on in.
Coach got something he wanna tell you.
The board called.
They've decided to suspend you for three games.
Suspend me?
"But they can't do that, can they?"
They can and they have.
Is this 'cause I told that reporter the truth?
"Baby, that didn't help."
That's the rest of the regular season.
How the hell we gonna get to the playoffs?
How we gonna make it to State?
"I'm sure there were moments, when King Arthur regretted pulling the sword from the stone."
But he never gave up his quest.
So why did you?
Or have you already found the traveler that you and the less fortunate members of Veritas were looking for?
The traveler.
Why doesn't it surprise me that you've fallen for Patricia Swann's vivid imaginings?
I didn't imagine the deaths of Virgil Swann or Oliver Queen's parents.
You think I can control the fate of individuals?
You give me too much credit.
You certainly controlled mine.
It wasn't an accident we were in Smallville the day of the meteor shower.
The factory was just a cover.
You were really there to meet this traveler that Veritas wanted to protect.
"I remember evething, dad."
Those are the memories of a small boy in shock trying to cope with the trauma of a meteor shower.
"So, that's kite drowning."
Yeah!
LAUGHTER
Was this recently?
"Yeah, it was quite recent, yeah."
Cos I've...
"With my kids, one of them, particularly, she wanted to have a go as well, so she joined me."
How old are your children now?
My kids are now between 16 and 22.
"So, it was Phoebe who was doing it with me."
I think she was 17.
"So, I..."
I got into the position where I was meant to...
Standing in the water with the kite.
"And he said, ""Right, now position the kite so that it will pull you."""
I did this and I just...
I was taken across the water horizontally with this kite - horizontally for...
Are you in a wet suit or something?
"No, because it was..."
Or just in a suit and tie.
"LAUGHTER As always, yeah!"
"We weren't supposed to get, really, that deep into the water."
"It was a hot day, it was going to be fine."
Trunks were the order of the day.
Where was this?
Where did it happen?
Down in West Sussex.
We were...
"I was being pulled along for what must have been, like, half an hour,"
"And all I could hear was this instructor running along, trying to keep up, saying, ""Pull the emergency thing"
"""to release you from the harness."" And I couldn't do that."
"What happened then was that, instead of being dragged along on top of the water, we took a detour and I ended up going up onto the beach, but still horizontal, so I wasn't able to get up."
"Oh, no, you don't have one, do you?"
- What?
- Hey!
And now some fisticuffs.
A good old donnybrook.
And it's a massacre folks.
It's just like the time you got your butt kicked by my piano teacher.
"Nope, this is definitely worse than that."
Much worse.
"That goal light needs a new battery, and ref's arms are getting tired as the Hounds just keep pouring it on."
Goal!
"Tremendous tactics, terrific teamwork, and a vastly superior genetic makeup giving Binghamton the edge today."
"And that, mercifully, is the end of the game."
"And by the looks of it, the end of the Zenovators."
- All right.
"- Zen's a journey, it's not a sprint."
"It's a journey, stay with it."
It's gonna get better.
"Come on, stay with it."
So much for sharing our souls.
"Ladies and gentlemen, if I can draw what's left of your attention, at the end of the arena, you'll see three famous jerseys, number 16, 17, and 18, the Hansons."
"Jack, Steve, and Jeff."
"There they go, they're being retired."
Let's give them a big hand.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Hanson brothers."
"Hello, Charlestown."
Thank you for your support and retiring our old jerseys.
- But we're not here to talk about hockey.
- What do you mean?
"Lt's just a dumb game where you bleed a lot, and a total waste of time."
Get off the ice!
"And so, right now, you all should be meditating on your inner chi."
- Let's do it.
Got some wire hangers at my place.
"Oh, great, well, let's steal a car, go to your place, get the wire hangers, come back, steal another car, and just drive off."
OK.
I feel like it wouldn't be weird for you to kiss me right now.
Every girl's so beautiful to me.
I don't wanna think about her at all anymore.
- You should have followed her.
- She wouldn't have me.
"And besides, she's moved on."
"And in a way, so have I."
"Just not actually, of course."
"Well, I speak from experience when I say that it is horrible... to be treated in a way that only points out how meaningless you are."
Never thought of it that way.
(♪ INDIE DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
He's here.
MAN:
"Yeah, he just walked into your bedroom."
"Oh, hey, how's it goin'?"
You're a monster.
I hate you.
Then I doubt you'll mind me being gone through December.
I don't even know how to respond to that.
I've been offered a position teaching creative writing at Lambert College.
I'm moving there for the semester.
You stood in my way when I had so many opportunities.
I guess that's why I'm telling you about this after I agreed to it.
So you decided to sneak back in the middle of the night?
"It's not the middle of the night, Ashley."
It's 10:00pm.
"Besides, I had some meetings in the city that ran late, and I considered just buying new clothes, but I needed to get some books I wanted to re-read."
"Also, I want my car."
Whichever one of you solves his murder will be invited in.
S08E14 G.D.S.
Phillip Harris was right. [Door closes]
There is a phantom serial killer murdering people on both coasts.
That's clever.
Splitting up his hunting ground kept everyone from knowing his existence.
- Did the boys get any leads?
- Just one.
His sister said that Phillip Harris was working undercover at Zenith Studios.
Alexis:
"Oh, they're the ones that ruined the Nikki Heat movie franchise."
Not ruined...
"Destroyed, terminated, extirpated, vaporized, eviscerated."
Do you plan on running through the full thesaurus?
No.
I think that'll about do it.
"Anyway, Phillip thought someone at Zenith Studios was The Phantom."
Makes sense.
Plenty of people connected with the film industry are bicoastal.
"Directors, producers, cinematographers..."
"And actors, who are all borderline sociopaths, by the way."
Don't have to tell me.
"Hey, did anyone at Zenith know that Phillip was working there undercover?"
Just one...
Head of the studio.
Ah.
Let's go talk to him.
Thank you.
I am so going to get that spot in the Greatest Detective Society.
"I mean, there's no way Kendall has access to the kind of details that I have."
"Oh, don't get cocky, Rick."
You haven't solved the murder yet.
"But nobody can know about that base, so who knows what really happened?"
Maybe some contra went nuts.
[Men Speaking Spanish]
[Woman] Today was a shitty day... with my shitty kids and my shitty husband.
I love them.
I do.
"But, damn, they get on my nerves."
[Group Laughs]
I wanted to...
Everyone knows what I want to do.
What I want to do every second of every day.
I don't even have to say it.
"But then I remember the last drink that got me here... two years, one month, 10 days ago."
"And I didn't, and..."
"I'm just grateful, I guess... to have this place."
And that's all.
[Phone Ringing]
"Um, the surveillance reports that you requested."
"Alexandria, Virginia, the week of January 23."
There's a list of every person at the meeting... and the names of all of their security personnel.
"Thank you, Martha."
I included the local police reports from that area as well... as the D.O.D. Meeting was on the same day as that horrible murder.
There was a ton of extra police around... so maybe someone saw something useful to you.
You mean that couple and their... and their daughter?
That scared the hell out of me.
I thought it was a Charles Manson thing... but I think they've ruled that out.
You know what?
Get me all the files and physical evidence connected to those murders also.
Sure thing.
You think they're related?
I think I can't rule anything out.
##[Speakers.
"Well, I have plenty of glassware at my place, so we'll just donate this stuff to goodwill."
"Whoa, hang on."
You realize some of those are collectables.
Really?
And which is the higher ticket item...
Bam-Bam or Mayor McCheese?
"McCheese, of course."
I think that one's still good for one free refill.
"All right, we'll keep this one and the Sammy Sosa travel mug."
And my cereal bowl.
Holds the perfect serving size.
"Plus, you can wash a baby in it."
Yeah.
"Don't worry, I already packed your cereal bowl."
Now what are we gonna do with your tv?
"Well, you don't have a tv in your bedroom."
"Nah, I don't really like having a tv in the bedroom."
You know who says that?
People who have never had a tv in their bedroom.
Or people who like to read or talk.
"Fine, but while you're reading or talking, what am I supposed to do?"
I don't know.
Digging through your belly button seems to take up a lot of your time.
"So, the only place to watch tv will be downstairs in the lobby?"
"In my house, we call that the living room."
"Yeah, but your mom and your sister are down there, so I'll have to put on pants."
"If I'm gonna put on pants,"
I might as well go to the movies.
"Alright, you can put the tv in the bedroom."
Thanks.
"But if I ever walk in wearing a sexy nightie, and you give me one of these,"
I'm snapping that finger off and any other body part that looks like it.
"Such intimate and important things happen in life, they seem to me to be outside of all control."
Especially outside of a Director's control.
It is life that imposes itself on Cinema.
"We have to show life, not artificial life."
We should restore life rather than destroy it.
"""Canned life"" Cinema, fabricated Cinema is very fine work."
"There's nothing wrong with canned goods, but they are what they are."
How to find the links?
Seeing and believing
You recognize those films in the sound and in the lighting.
"I believe, unfortunately, that Cinema, when it shows too much, ends up by showing nothing."
The spectator is impoverished after such a film.
People usually question in order to understand something.
"People say: ""I don't understand the end of your film. """
"I know why they don't understand, because as soon as we question, we feel that we haven't understood."
"We should ask questions, not answer them."
"Hey, Jer emy, you got that staple r emover that we'r e all --"
"Hey, J.J."

- Hi.
[ Chuckles ] What's up?
Not too much.
You r emember when I said don't worry about it?
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
Should I close the door?
Come on.
"Rae Plachecki, this is Jack Bauer."
"You know the drill. I´m gonna ask you some questions, but I´m on your side."
We wanna establish that this heroin addiction was a necessary part of your cover.
It was necessary to maintain my cover.
Are we done now?
"Sit down, Jack."
This is Rae Plachecki.
The time is 2.31am.
"lnterrogation of Jack Bauer, director of field ops, CTU."
Ryan Chappelle is present.
"Jack, tell us how you established your cover with Ramón Salazar."
I first came in contact with the Salazars approximately two years ago.
They were an up-and-coming narcotic cartel in Mexico.
(Tony) So when did you meet Amador?
Did you know him when you were working at CTU?
"Tell me something, Nina."
What kind of a deal do you think you´re gonna cut?
"You´ve betrayed everybody you know, including me."
You murdered Jack´s wife.
You helped terrorists smuggle a nuclear bomb into this country.
You´re helping to unleash a deadly virus into the general population.
Help me understand this.
What do you want?
What is it you get out of being a mass murderer?
Your neck is bleeding.
"- Dalton, what have you got?"
- So far the only reactions are subliminal.
If she won´t talk we need to be plugged into her vitals.
"We can take her to seven, do a passive-response test."
Seven´s not secure enough.
She stays here.
"Now,wouldn't a guy like this want to see the terror in their eyes?"
"Instead,he keeps them in the dark."
He's covering their faces and setting them on fire.
It's an execution.
it's easy to see why he sets fires down here.
It's completely isolated.
"He can beat,torture,or burn somebody and nobody would hear it."
I never thought the fbi would be here for our fine city's tradition.
I'm al garner with the dfd.
Agents morgan and prentiss.
"I guess devil's night keeps you pretty busy,huh?"
Not as much as it did in the eighties.
"Used to get up to 600,700 fires back then."
- In 3 days?
- Down to 115 last year.
"It still takes everything we got, but fortunately we've had some help."
Have the police increased their patrols in the rivertown district?
"I wish they could,but the city's reeling from budget cuts."
No.
Detroit's finest is a community group with over a thousand volunteers.
a thousand volunteers?
"Well,that just added another thousand names to garcia's list."
- Do you think he's one of them?
- Can't rule anyone out.
What is this place?
It's an old engine factory.
It's massive.
And medieval.
"From the industrial age, when this city was pumping out more cars and hit songs than anyplace else in the world."
This is where we found tony's charred remains.
The char pattern tracks back to here.
That's where he stood when he started the fire.
"Well, I have to admit, young lady, that I gave you those instructions just to keep you busy."
Luckily they were the right things to do.
"Well, I felt something was different."
"But if this is Sally, then where's Judy?"
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
"Now, look at that, Doctor."
Judy really is sorry.
She wants to give Sally her favorite doll.
(CHUCKLES)
"I'm sorry, Judy, that's government property."
The scientists back at Cape Kennedy want to study it.
(CHATTERING)
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll send you a brand-new one.
How 'bout that?
Ok?
"Miss Tracy, I'm going to see that NASA sends you a special letter of commendation."
You made just the kind of diagnostic tests that were required.
We couldn't have done better ourselves.
"Actually, Clarence is the one who deserves the letter."
"After all, he saved Sally from that leopard."
"I'm afraid we're overlooking the really heroine of this recovery program, and that is Judy."
"If Judy hadn't found Sally,"
Sally could've been taken by a predator in the bush.
"By Jove, that's right."
If you chaps are going to commend anyone it ought to be our little Judy.
"Yes, she's a clever little person."
"I mean, chimp."
She certainly made monkeys out of us.
"Judy, how would you like to come back to America with us and train to be a real space chimp?"
(CHATTERING)
I'm afraid you lost a volunteer.
"Mr. Dinamo,"
Yes?
"I did not know that not only are you efficient, and a good observer, you are a photo enthusiast."
What?
May I see your lighter?
My lighter?
"Yes, your photographic device."
"Very well, you lot already found out?"
I only wanted to take pictures of the important people attending the conference.
That was all.
Mr. Dinamo
"It is logical that you should fail as a vulgar detective, unlike us, who are specialized agents."
So I would suggest for you to not move!
"It was a good idea of yours, that."
"My picture could have been identified by the intelligence service, but I can assure you, that will not be so."
"Freeze, Mr. Dinamo!"
"It seems you fail to understand that behind this book is a machine pistol with silencer, ready to fire."
"Very well, I will demonstrate."
Lucrecia?
Report in.
"Calling HQ, calling HQ?"
"Go ahead, Lucrecia."
We have Dinamo.
"Understood, hand him over to S.O.S. so they can take care of him."
"S.O.S. recieving,"
"Agents S.O.S. one and S.O.S. two bring Dinamo onboard, alive, or dead if necessary."
General advisory!
General advisory!
"We will hold a meeting immediatedly, over."
"Mr. Dinamo, thanks to you, we will have to rush our plans."
Take care of him!
"Very well, shall we?"
You promised us something.
Have you brought it?
Big fella here's been very quiet while you've been out - which is only to be expected considering who he really is.
"Know what this is, big fella?"
I do not understand these markings.
"A map of the London Underground, 1967 - key strategic weakness in metropolitan living, if you ask me, but then I have never liked a tunnel..."
Enough of this.
"We are powerful, but on this planet we are limited."
We need to learn to take human form.
The Governess is our most perfect replication of humanity...
What's happening to its voice?
Just stripping away the disguise.
"No, stop!"
"Stop that, cease, I command you!"
It sounds like a child.
"Of course it sounds like a child, it IS a child."
"Simeon as a child, the snow has no voice without him."
"Don't listen to him, he's ruining everything!"
How long has the Intelligence been talking to you?
I was a little boy.
He was my snowman...
He spoke to me.
They're silly.
"But the snow doesn't talk, does it - it's just a mirror."
"I don't want to talk to them, they're silly."
They're silly.
It just reflects back everything we think and feel and fear.
I don't need anyone else.
Don't need anyone else.
"You poured your darkest dreams into a snowman - and look, look what it became!"
I don't understand.
It's a parasite feeding on the loneliness of a child and the sickness of an old man.
Some look good.
"The ones that look good, you don't know about."
What if you got involved with a woman?
How do you tell her?
"The way they make them, I'll never have to tell her."
So you keep it a secret your whole life?
"Then at your funeral, the mortician comes out, "" Mrs. Costanza I thought you might want this."""
It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house.
"If this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do if I can get this whole thing off the ground, then I think I'll have something for you."
"- Oh, Mr. Lippman."
That is so exciting.
"I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks."
"By the way, those are great glasses."
"- Oh, really, you like them?"
- Very unusual.
"- Well, you know what?"
- What?
- You can have them.
"- No, no."
"No, no."
Go to that place on the corner.
They'll change the prescription in an hour.
Take them.
- Really?
- I have no use for them.
- Honestly.
- I could use a new pair of reading glasses.
- They're from Malaysia.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- Fabulous.
"Well, Mr. Newman, in all my years on the bench I have never come across anything quite like this."
"I have given this matter some serious consideration, and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly yourself, is for you to keep your car in a garage that is conveniently located next to your home."
They make me.
"Ronan Murphy was killed by a police officer and Murphy was a prime suspect in the murder of Tommy Hunter but, for some reason, that's been hidden from AC-12."
Bring in the officer that killed him.
- He was killed a couple of weeks after.
- Why?
"Oh, come on, Steve."
"Best guess, he was breaking open a paedophile ring."
What?
Don't you see?
Ronan Murphy was interviewed by the team investigating Tommy Hunter's murder.
And where did you get that from?
"I'm not at liberty to say, sir."
Here we go again.
Tommy Hunter was involved in grooming underage girls and pimping them out and he was about to turn informer.
The people who ordered his murder didn't want what he knew about child sexual exploitation to come out and that's exactly the same motive as the murder of Danny Waldron.
They're connected.
Sir we know Hunter's murder was orchestrated by the Caddy and there's ample evidence that someone was pulling Hari Bains' strings.
Using the exact same methods as the Caddy.
"Voice contact only, multiple phones."
"Yeah, but... why couldn't this be the Caddy?"
DC Cole is dead.
"Well, the Caddy is my inquiry, sir, so maybe I should be the one to look into it."
"- Yeah, I'd be grateful."
- Sir.
- Sir...
- What?
Something to say?
"Well, you're not at liberty."
Sir.
"Well, I know exactly who we should speak to first."
Who?
"We'll be fine, thanks, Steve."
"I ask you again, sir, here and now under oath... were you at any time a member of a crime organization"
led by michael corleone?
I don't know nothing about that!
I was in the olive oil business with his father but that was a long time ago.
We have a sworn affidavit.
"Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered on the orders of michael corleone."
"Do you deny this confession, and do you realize what will happen if you do?"
"The FBI guys promised me a deal so I made up a Iot of stuff about michael corleone, just to please them."
But it was all lies.
Everything!
"They kept saying,"
"""michael corleone did this"" and ""michael corleone did that""."
"So I said, ""Yeah, sure."
"Why not?"""
"Mr. Corleone, would you kindly identify the gentleman sitting to your left?"
I can answer that.
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
-Is he related to the witness?
"-He is, I believe, his brother."
-will he come forward and be sworn?
-He doesn't understand english.
He came at his own expense to aid his brother.
He's not under subpoena and has an impeccable reputation.
-He knows nothing about this?
"-To my knowledge, nothing."
I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.
-The witness is excused.
-Senator!
Senator!
This committee owes an apology!
This committee owes an apology.

India is the largest democracy on earth.

"In fact, a recent un report predicts that, globally,"
"Without dramatic change in the way we manage our water,"

"And you can smell the shit, brown water,"

"When you heard the name Max, why were you certain that was George?"

That a bent copper is worse than any criminal.

"Look, I'll get Goodfellow to throw you out if I have to."

It's about time somebody blew the lid off of this thing.
"Well, call me the can opener, 'cause I've finally cracked the Da Vinci code of what those wacky rug riders have been up to."
Turns out they were trying to blow up city hall.
"Fortunately, yours truly was there to scotch the deal."
"Now, do I call myself a hero?"
"Well, some would, of course, but I'm..."
[ She turns off the radio. ]
"Well, at least we found a new place for the mosque and Rayyan just told me it's not getting demolished."
- Ah!
"- That is a big surprise, Amaar, because I was kind of hoping that, huh..."
"I mean, congratulations!"
I didn't think you'd pull it off.
Hurrah!
"Well, technically I haven't."
"Not yet, anyway."
We still need to raise some money for the mosque.
"Amaar, I know it seems like I've been pushing you away, but Muslim or not, you are my son now and I am behind you 150%."
"Thanks, Sarah, and you know, I'm always here for you, no matter what the crisis, faith or not."
"Well, I wanted you to know that I finally sold Yasir's business."
- Congratulations!
- And I want to put all the money towards the new mosque.
Wow!

Eri-- actually...
I feel like Italian.
Carb cleansing's so 2005.
Ouch.
I can't believe that...
I actually thought that I was friends with him.
"Yeah, I kinda figured out he couldn't be trusted when I found his nail file sticking straight out of my back."
"Erica, it's awful, I know, but it is what it is."
Maybe if I could just talk to him away from here... or maybe you just need to accept that fact that your friendship has changed.
Probably for good.
Here it is.
Thanks.
"Hey, so, uh... how is this?"
"It's a little high on the left, you think?"
Maybe you didn't get the message when I walked out of here yesterday.
"No, I got it loud and clear."
Do you know the last time I saw you was at mom's funeral?
I guess that's the way we do our family reunions.

I was thinking more about a physical injury.
"No, this guy is like a physical injury, doc."
"Uh, ten minutes after meeting him,"
"I get shot and blasted backwards through a window, okay?"
"A few hours after that, he drives a car,"
"I'm not joking, on to the deck of a Chinese freighter ship."
"And, yes, I was in it."
"The car, not the ship."
- He drove a car onto a boat?
"- Yeah, he's an animal."
And I sort of get the feeling that he's just getting warmed up.
- Ouch.
- Yeah.
"- Uh, so how do I fix it?"
- You get a new partner.
"Yeah, I'd like that but I don't think that's gonna happen."
"Well, I'm seeing a slight tear on the ACL."
"So you're gonna have to stay off that knee for a couple of weeks, physical therapy, and I'll put you on some anti-inflammatories."
"Can I get those, uh, to go, please?"
I'll be back.
"Hey, stay."

Yes.
"I have decided,"
I will not be sending reinforcements.

Do you realize that your decision will catalyse the collapse of BuYeo's diplomacy with the Hans?
"This decision does not lie in your hands, but in mine."
"However, if the Hans will forsake our ties just because of this, then it only goes to show how unreasonable they are."
You have gone too far..
"Compared to... the way you have insulted BuYeo over the years,"
This is nothing.
I will give you more time.
Do think this over carefully.
"Even if I think it over a thousand more times,"
My answer will remain unchanged.
Dismissed!
Those barbarians who dare stand up against us Hans will disappear like ashes from the face of this world.
"And after this, the Emperor might consider doing exactly the same thing to BuYeo."
PREPOSTEROUS!
"You go back and tell your Emperor,"
BuYeo will be well prepared for it.
"The one that will turn to ash is not BuYeo, but the Han Dynasty."
I will convey this message.
Listen up!
"Regarding my decision,"
Don't ever bring it up again.
"Yes, Your Majesty."
Chief General!
"Yes, Your Majesty."
"From this moment onwards,"
Move the entire BuYeo's military into battle position.
We must stand prepared for any provocation from the Hans.
That's what inspired me to get it.
Really?
"No, I'm making that up."
"No matter how you dress that up, you're still pooing in a little cupboard, aren't you?"
The poo in the RV is what motivated me to sell the RV.
True story.
"First day of filming Storage Hunters, right, very first day, back in the States, I'm all excited, wake up early, my wife and I..."
We were living in the RV at the time.
We drive the RV to our TV show.
"Rare that you're living in a van and you have a TV show, and getting out of the parking lot, it gets wedged between two poles, stuck."
I had to go find someone to cut the pole down.
That took a while.
Then we get to the set and they decide it would be great to film inside.
One of the cameramen bumped the stove.
We left.
We didn't realise he'd bumped the stove and turned the gas on.
The RV filled up with gas.
"I come back to change my clothes, I smell the gas."
Luckily the heater hadn't kicked on.
"Opened all the doors, shut the stove off, right?"
Thank God
- I saved it from blowing up.
"I extend the bedroom out, cos you do with these extensions, where you hit a button and it goes out, right?"
"Go in, get my clothes out of the closet."
"It's cool, right?"
"I change my clothes, I go back, we do some more filming."
"That afternoon, after about 10 hours of filming, we get in our car, three-hour ride home."
On the freeway everyone is honking at me.
"I'm just giving them, ""It's big, it's slow"
- I get it.
"Go round!"""
That's not why they were honking.
The theme is something your generation doesn't believe in
Marriage
I'll marry you
I'll be yours forever
Whatever you want...
"I'll always do, I swear"
Oh how I wish...
"""you'd make love to me all your life..."""
endless love
I'll marry you
I'll be yours forever
Whatever you want...
"I'll always do, I swear"
Oh how I wish...
"""you'd make love to me all your life..."""
endless love
"""My first romance, my first love..."""
"""without you, my love life's miserable"""
In the pursuit of desires...
"""I too have learnt how to wake sleepless nights"""
"My love, my darling..."
I'll marry you
I'll be yours forever
Any girl will die for me
Every girl pines for me
"""Day and night, I chant your name I pine..."""
I'm dying to take you in my arms
"Then tell me, why this distance?"
I'll marry you
I'll be yours forever
Oh how I wish...
"""you'd make love to me all your life..."""
That's what I do.
"Sometimes they say the smartest thing, sometimes they say the dumbest thing, but either way, it's fucking awesome."
"I was watching the other day, and this rapper was just like this."
"He goes, ""Yo."""
¶ I put the iron to your dome like I'm ironing clothes ¶
"I was like, ""Yeah."""
"Steam that nigga, yeah."""
"But sometimes they say stupid stuff, right?"
"Like, I'm watching the other day and this rapper goes just like this."
"¶ Yo, I'll melt your face like mozzarella ¶"
Proceed.
Then he was like... ¶ So be cool 'cause it's some real werewolves ¶
¶ Around you Bella
"I said, ""Wait a minute."""
"""Werewolves?"
Bella?
"""Since when do gangsters watch Twilight?"
"What the hell?"""
And this is what messed me up.
"As soon as he said that lyric, everybody in the battle at the same time was like,"
"""Nigga!"""
"""We just saw that on demand this morning."""
"I said, ""Gangsters watching Twilight?"
"That makes no sense."""
And don't think it's all fun and games with me though.
'Cause I watch CNN.
Makes no sense.
"You got people that get robbed, stabbed, raped, and killed."
Some of them can't even get the front page of a newspaper.
"Meanwhile, you got Kim Kardashian who seemed like she had more exposure for her divorces and marriage than Barack had his first year in office."
That didn't make any sense to me.
"Even Barack was like, ""Uh..."""
Teen accuser:
"I have often seen the operation of Martha Coery, and she very often afflicted me by her acts of witchcraft."
Judge:
"Martha Corey, tell me why you hurt these persons."
Narrator:
Martha's only hope is that the judge will see through the girls' hysteria.
[man speaking: the Devil coming to rule] [screams]
Martha:
I know nothing.
I am a Gospel woman.
"[screaming, crying]"
Martha:
I am a Gospel woman.
girl:
You are a Gospel witch!
[sounds of a wagon]
Narrator:
"In Salem, over 100 hundred people are accused of witchcraft, among them a four year old girl."
20 executions.
"Fourteen years later, one teenager withdraws her testimony, claiming to have been deceived by Satan."
[voice:
It's time.]
[music]
Narrator:
Mercy Lewis never speaks of it again.
Salem is among the last of the mass witch hunts.
The era of fear and superstition is ending.
"Now, the hunt for profit is opening up the wilderness, beckoning a new breed of pioneer, in search of the earth's natural resources:"
"hunters, frontiersmen."
Dolin:
"Much like explorers and adventurers of today, they had a certain mettle to them, but they were also driven by the desire to make money."
Profit is a amazing motivator.
"Most of the Association will be there, and they're all anxious to meet you."
Okay.
Pipe down.
"Ladies and gentlemen, in this age of quarter-section pastures... and tinhorn legislators who is riding our old trails... it's a real pleasure to welcome a vestige of that heroic era... that we just about lost."
"Standing beside me, right here... is the legendary tracker and interpreter of the Apache wars..."
Tom Horn.
"You're welcome, sir."
"Tom, this is Arlo Chance."
- Tom.
- Ora Haley.
Howdy.
- lan MacGregor.
- Proud to meet you.
"What's the matter, Tom?"
- What is it?
- It's a lobster.
I'll be darned.
I've never eaten a bug that big before.
That's a Maine lobster.
"Broiled alive, packaged in seaweed... and shipped out here by train."
"At every station, the conductor drains the melted seawater off of them."
- You getting the hang of it?
- I'm trying.
"Tom, I don't know whether John here told you... but we've got a hell of a range problem here."
The damn rustlers have completely wiped out our herd profits... not to mention... what the buzzards and the predators have done to our cash crops.
We got people homesteading our rangeland... and raising sheep on our grass.
"Right at the present time, Mr. Horn, what's your primary source of livelihood?"
Mr. Coble offered me to ease up at his place for a while... and I said I'd earn my keep.
That's good enough.
"Tom, you met Joe Belle?"
United States Marshal.
Hello.
I know.
"You want the truth, you're going to get it."
"All right, I guess I should have figured this would have something to do with aunt Marie."
"Nick, I've been inside your aunt's trailer."
I've seen all the crazy stuff in there.
I don't know what you expect to show me that I haven't already seen.
"Juliette, please."
"Look, if you want to understand why"
I was attacked in our house...
Run!
[Screams]
If you want to understand why my aunt was attacked on the street...
[Growling]
And if you want to know why you were kidnapped by that crazy woma..
Time for you to scream.
- Time for you to scream.
- [Groans]
You're just going to have to trust me on this one.
Okay.
How often do you come here?
Whenever I have a problem I can't figure out.
What kinds of problems would lead you here?
Something started happening to me around the time my aunt died.
I guess it was destined to happen.
I just didn't know about it yet.
"I started seeing things I couldn't explain, and I thought I was going crazy."
"But before she died, she told me that some of my other relatives have this same problem, ability-- whatever you want to call it."
This trailer is filled with things you can't believe.
It's the history of my ancestors who were-- now stay with me-- sort of like hunters.
What did they hunt?
"See, this is where it gets a little difficult to explain."
"Yeah, you're going to have to try."

What happen with that girl?
An alone girl came to a strange city
She came to the biggest night club of Istanbul
They give her a job of dancer lt was just a fake.
Mr. Menon's real face was drugs
Then he forced her to sell drugs
You know I was about to say this is not true.
You are misunderstanding
After few months she went to India
Her death was held in the country whom she born
Will you tell me?
Did you know that girl?
He did not know her.
But he killed her
Who told you this?
Money is everything.
You can buy anything
Like I bought your make up man
Vikram Kapoor was coming from a party
He was drunk but he had to drive
Then an innocent girl came infront of his car
It was an accident
But after that it was not an accident
We have to bring her to hospital
I cannot do this
There's not one thing in my life that I don't filter through what coach Smith would do and what he did.
- Was he a great humanitarian?
- Was he a great mentor?
Was he someone who I loved dearly?
Was he someone who I loved dearly?
"Was it someone who, I carry today, many of the lessons when I try and instill it in my children or young people that I mentor?"
All of that.
His impact was so far-reaching.
"Coach Smith, to me, is always coach Smith, so, um..."
I know how fortunate I am.
I know how lucky I am.
I've had 50 wonderful years of a relationship with a man
I've had 50 wonderful years of a relationship with a man that I have nothing but love and admiration for.
"In the 5000 crore-worth fake title-deed scam case at Chennai beach road, ...distributor Ravi was arrested day before yesterday."
"As he tried to escape en-route Puzhal prison to court, the police shot him dead."
My son would not have attempted to escape
He has been framed and ecnountered to save some big shots
Hello.
Can I get a smaller piece?
"Please wait, let me check"
Is he dull-witted or what?
"He has taken a toy gun, that too out of cover"
How much is this?
How much?
"Madam, can I help you?"
"Oh, I am sorry."
I assumed you were a sales boy.
-You can take it.
"-Please No problem, you could have it."
-Please you could have it.
You have it.
What?
"I don't think there are enough holes here, from that first time me and Daisy came out blastin'."
Is that important?
Could be.
In any case I've a feeling that my partner is not exactly holding' up her end.
I've never... actually... really ever killed anybody.
I've been using blanks.
I just make sure me and Violet don't share ammunitions.
"Like I said, she's so fierce and thorough on the job."
"I could pack a squirt gun, it just wouldn't matter."
"How do you mean, holding up her end?"
"I mean, that I might be the only one takin' up the trash."
- Means it looks like she's been packin' blanks.
- So what?
- So what?
"- Yea, so what?"
"Even if she isn't taking people out, isn't it better that she's with you?"
You think your partner's having two targets instead of one?
but it saved you behind a time or two?
"Do you understand, she's risking her life as well?"
Do you think your friendship might've helped keep you sane?
- as you wandered through this life of yours?
- There's still the principle.
"We have rules and what she might've been doin', is a big no-no, no matter how you slice it."
Cos one day you're packin' blanks and the next you're wearin' the wire.
So what you're going to do about it?
"I might've to take her out, if my suspicion is true."
I thought Daisy was your friend.
I'm not sayin' I'm gonna like it.
I thought you said she was like family?
She is.
"But she's a business woman too, so she'll understand."
"Natasha... trust me, you don't want to do this."
- Shut up.
"- Natasha, now go."
Natasha...
I'm warning you.
"Natasha, I said leave now."
- Feeling better?
"- Much better, thanks."
Tell me something... why did you suspect that it wasn't a gunshot?
I'm allergic to gunpowder.
"Especially, the type used in small explosives and fireworks."
It just... shoots up my nose.
Like mustard.
That's it then.
What a story.
Afather who did it all for his daughter... and a daughter who did it all for her father.
"Quite a... faithful bunch, these Malhotras."
Do you ever get serious?
Once.

His flight is going to be land in Athens
I have decided to make a film that will be the biggest film in history
Only you deserve to be a lead actor of this film lf you can come to Samos this friday than we can finalize this deal
I dont know what he said
Today people are asking for our party's funds
Their doubt can be dangerous for us
But I have an idea to make their doubt wrong
Which idea?
The place you have reached in politics I really respect that
I believe Malhotra lnc. and your people party can increase Thailand's economy lf this friday can you come at Samos than we can discuss further
We need this type of clean money this time
"I've got a lot of weed in production, I need the pipeline."
I'll give you a piece of every pound we move.
"But I've got to let you know, we're talking to other people about that."
"That's why I'm here, to let you know I'm interested."
- Consider it.
- Beautiful.
"Anyway, I just wanted you to know I'm back in business and flushed with cash."
- So let me know.
- All right.
We'll be in touch.
Take it easy.
You heard what he said.
"I'm telling you, there's something way bigger than us going on here."
Katarina tells me you're threatening to leave her... and work for me full time.
Katarina doesn't own me... and neither do you.
You can't be talking to people about our relationship.
"Not Katarina, no-one."
I apologize.
- What's this?
- That is the... agenda for the Blackmire Group's meetings in the Mexico.
I took it from George Browne's briefcase this afternoon.
This is the things I'm talking about when you act without consulting us.
"If you took it from his briefcase, he's gonna discover it's missing."
And you risk exposing my entire operation.
"If he finds the briefcase, but he won't."
He left it in the taxi.
"And now you have George Browne's briefcase, because?"
I called the taxi company and I go to pick it up.
I'm giving it back to him tonight when I see him.
- You're seeing him again tonight?
- In about 15 minutes.
We need the wire van outside of Julianna's immediately.
I'm gonna give you guys 20 minutes for questions and answers.
"So keep them short and, hopefully, sweet."
And you can roll starting now.
"I'll introduce him in five... thousand... four... thousand, three... thousand, two."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States."
Welcome.
Good afternoon.
Please.
- Thank you for coming here on such short notice.
"- Laine Hanson, from Ohio."
As I embarked on the task of selecting a vice president...
"I was driven by the emotion of wanting to make a choice... that would've made Troy Ellard, my friend, proud."
Senator Laine Billings Hanson of Ohio is that person.
"Sherri, you are first."
"Ms. Hanson, do you feel being a woman played any type of role in the president's decision?"
"Well, I, uh..."
First I would like to say... what an honor it is to be here before you in this position.
And I hope to serve up to the standards which President Evans set for me in that introduction.
"Thank you so much, sir."
To answer your question...
"- First rate, Mrs. Hanson."
- Thank you.
I learned a lot from Will.
"Ah, yes, Will."
"You, sir, are gonna have to make yourself scarce."
"- No, of course."
I'll give you your privacy.
"- No, I mean scarce."
"During the confirmation period, I want you out of sight."
- Pardon me?
- A wife there behind her husband... is perceived as supportive.
A husband following around behind his wife is perceived as a puppeteer.
- But we want to
"""How can you call her Anshumali when she is Anshumati, answer!"""
Am I under you that I should answer you.
I am going
"""Listen a little, I have come here as per my father's order"""
"""When did I ask you, as to by whose orders you've come here."""
You hear little but talk too much
-Me and talking more.
Why are attributing your characters to me?
-Listen now
One great sage gave an appearance to my father...
"""...yesterday and told him that today here at this time, one..."""
...handsome young man will come in yellow clothing and he...
"""And he, he... what is that?"
"-My friend means him only!"""
Again he!
Listen Anshumati means to say he is only he!
What are you doing!
-This will tell you everything
Got the old banyan tree.
Let me see the sage's miracle now.
Got the pot of gold coins.
The sage told us the truth.
Our sage had told me that you belong to a royal family.
"""With his blessings, I am bound by oath to conduct the marriage.."""
...of my daughter Anshumati with you.
"""Before taking such an important decision,U should know about me"""
"""You are of royal family, talented alsomodest."
"Is 'ntthisenough"""
I just belong to a royal family.
My parents died after my birth
"""l look talented to you, but I feel I am an unfortunate one..."""
A woman better be pretty damn qualified to have nobody to answer to... and Laine Hanson is not that.
Look me in the eyes and tell me... that Laine Hanson is your first choice for the vice presidency.
Laine Hanson is my absolute first choice.
I'd so want you in my poker game.
Country needs a smooth confirmation.
The president needs a smooth confirmation.
The country needs a competent vice president.
Excuse me a minute.
There's only one person in the world that has that phone number.
So who's the second choice?
We haven't really settled on anybody yet.
"Tell me, if Laine Hanson were to be hit by a flying car... who would the president then select?"
"I think the president still likes Jack Hathaway, Congressman."
You know...
"Jack Hathaway, there's a good man..."
for a Democrat.
There's a man I would say would have... a smooth confirmation.
- Jack Hathaway?
- Smooth as a baby's ass.
"- He's already taken himself out of it, so..."
- Right.
Right!
"Well, who the hell knows?"
Perhaps Lainey will shock the world... by pulling out her brilliance... and erudition at the hearings that none of us know she has.
"So, Shelly, can we ask for basic fairness?"
"- Fifty-fifty, Democrat and Republican at the hearings?"
- Of course you can.
Congressman!
Congressman!
Mr. Runyon.
Just wanted to steal you for a second.
I'm Reg Webster.
"A new carriage, 40,000."
"A silver locket, 7,000."
"Wine, 2,000."
All of these were placed against the King's account.
"A total, over 100,000 pounds and should have been paid one month ago."
"Well, I am sure, when the King returns, he will settle any outstanding debts."
"As you know, anyone unable to pay their debts loses their allowance and is automatically banished from court."
Her Majesty seems ignorant of the fact that we are not in Spain and we do not have Inquisitions in France.
"Sire, it is a pleasure to see you return."
Where is Her Majesty?
"She is in conference, Sire."
The King!
Clear the room!
The Marquise de Montespan shall remain.
"You have been missed, by none more so than myself."
I missed you too.
You did not reply to my letters.
May I ask why?
"While I was at war, I thought back to the vision I had when they laid the first stones of this palace."
The dream of an eternal empire with Versailles at it's center.
And I realized that my dream was suffocating.
"Versailles was dying, and I was dying with it."
"And the person ,who had been my companion for so long, was blinding me to my true purpose."
"His Majesty is weary, perhaps."
I would be alone.
"Solange, please close the door."
"No doubt, the war has taken it's toll and he is in need of rest."
He was in good spirits?
Indeed.
The King's thrown himself back into matters of state and the construction of the palace.
"Well, no doubt, he was delighted to see you."
"Solange, please ask the maid to prepare my bath."
Conservative politician - politicians generally are arguing with each other which is the best situation but nothing ever gets done and they use the argument to delay it.
They probably think Lowestoft doesn't deserve it.
Really?
Yes.
"Of course, the town needs another bridge - everyone agrees on that."
The people can't build it themselves.
It will cost a fortune.
It has to be a political decision.
And the politicians have been squabbling about it for 50 years.
No wonder the people are angry.
"So, the bridge is closing."
"Any minute now, the town is about to get on the move again."
Where's it going?
"Well, nobody's quite sure."
What they are sure of is that they can't rely on the politicians to take them there.
They know that they will have to do it for themselves.
Are they hopeful?
Yeah.
There's plenty of hope.
You can catch up with all four-parts of this Panorama series on BBC iPlayer.

come quickly I'm waiting
I always said face your enemy with a smile but todaydestruy this enemy
it will be much more fun finishing you off on my own
Today you won't face Boss but a son
Kurukshetra!
Situated in the heart of India... clustered by Haryana and... surrounded by the Saraswati river... is this historical place.
The Kaurava's and the Pandava's... fought an epic battle at this very place.
Centuries have passed ideologies have changed... but the battle is still being fought here.
These days there's one warrior in Kurukshetra... who fights to protect the honour of truth.
Tauji!
We also know him as Big Boss.
Although he's called the transport king... of this area but the Big Boss' real job... is to abduct stumble and deliver bad guys.
Big Boss conjures blessings... as well as enemies.
Today he's off to Mirzapur in regard of anew contract.
But Big Boss doesn't know that... life has already put a death contract on him.
Move the car.
Why did you park it here?
Lallan.
Did you have to take the station road?
What to do Big Boss?
The highway's closed.
This is the only alternate route to Mirzapur.
Big Boss can I go pee?
Or else I'll wet my pants.
Go on.
Hurry up or you'll pee in your pants.
Big Boss.
For you.
It's really hot.
Give one to my men as well.
I thought Sandy said it was safest for us to stay where we are.
"No, no, no, Sandy said that it's safer for all of us to be together."
"All right, folks, we got to remain calm and we got to remain here."
"Anyone in need of medical attention, please identify yourself to this gentleman, and everyone who is willing to help anyone who might need it, please come over and introduce yourself to me."
"The good news is, we got everything we need here."
"We got shelter, we got food, we got water."
"We got fine literature, chips and salsa, so if we all stay together, we can get through this no problem."
All right ?
This is like Berkeley 1989.
"Oh, you say that so warmly."
"Not that I'm fond of natural disasters, but there is nothing sexier than your husband calming an angry mob."
"Now, are you okay ?"
"Yeah, I know I've been complaining about Newport a lot lately, but it just breaks my heart to see it like this."
I'm going to pass these out.
All right.
Hello ?
"Oh, hey, Sandy, I'm glad I finally got a hold of you."
Are you with Ryan ?
"Oh, no, Frank, but he's at the Cooper house with Taylor."
"He's fine, we're all fine."
That's great news.
"And Julie and Caitlin, they're at the house too, right ?"
That I don't know.
Do you have any idea where they might be ?
"I'm sorry, I don't, but I'm sure they're going to try to get in touch with you, and if I hear anything at all, I'll call you."
"I... yeah, yeah, thanks, Sandy."
Great.
"Okay, Gary, how's it look up there ?"
Can you climb down and get some help ?
Um... not really.
Why not ?
What's going on ?
This is scary.
This isn't natural?
This is all fire?
FARHAN:
This is not natural at all.
DICAPRIO:
I've never seen anything like this.
ALLEN:
There are three big tropical rainforest areas left in the world.
"The Amazon in South America, the Congo Basin in Africa, and the South East Asian rainforest which spans"
Indonesia.
"In Indonesia, we're seeing fires being intentionally set in order to create palm oil plantations, which grow the cheapest vegetable oil in the world."
"It's in cooking oils, in processed foods, in your cosmetics, in your detergents."
This really cheap commodity is making companies tremendous profits.
DICAPRIO:
Just as far as you can see.
Rows of palm oil.
"They have destroyed so much of this forest, it's unbelievable."
DICAPRIO:
What a beauty!
DICAPRIO:
I can't even comprehend what these forests must have looked like.
Forests where rhino and elephant and orangutan would be populated into the thousands.
DR. SINGLETON:
These guys are a byproduct of the forest lost because of the palm oil industry.
"You know, they're effectively refugees from forests that no longer exist."
DICAPRIO:
"Wow, that's a good grip."
Yeah!
Strong.
"Hey, I'm gonna get you some fruit, don't be scared."
The carrot or the fruit?
What?
Well so far all you've given me is she could be having bloody lunch with her bank manager.
"Anyway I'd rather see the real thing, this is a photocopy."
I know but that's what was in her bag.
That's interesting.
"James Barr, what do you think of him?"
"Oh, I don't know,"
Father Sullivan's a bit concerned but.
"This is dead as far as DI Moore is concerned, isn't it?"
I think I'll keep it.
"Jack, if I were you I'd stay out of this."
"Well thank goodness you're not me, George."
Just take it easy.
Yeah I think I will.
"I think in fact, I'll take it very easy tomorrow."
I might go for a drive in the country.
"Stop off somewhere you know, have a spot of lunch."
"I hope everything was satisfactory, sir."
Very nice.
The waitress told me you were asking for some information about guests who have stayed here.
I have to say that we are not in the habit of discussing our guests with all and sundry.
The Bedford Arms has a reputation as one of the best...
Yes well most hotels I know who rent rooms by the afternoon have a reputation as a knocking shop.
I'm a policeman.
Sit down.
Perhaps we could um...
"Perhaps we could take a walk, or..."
"Yes, just as you like."
"If someone books a room for the night, and checks out early, it's hardly my business."
There are emergencies.
"Mr. Ragdale, and Jeanette Barr's been coming here over a period of months with a man she was having an affair with."
"They left at six o'clock every evening, now what do you call that, a predictable emergency?"
-- I lose my head and run away.
"Do you believe me, Mr. Mason?"
No.
But you're getting closer to the truth.
"Since I am grown man, I do not lie, big or little lie."
That was before you met Edie Morrow.
- How many times--
- Axel!
You heard everything in court.
"Now, do you still think you should hide the truth just because it might implicate that woman?"
Of course I do.
She is good woman.
"I do not kill, so how you think I can possibly--"
"No, no, I--"
I do not know so much.
"Got it, Perry."
You find that man at the bank?
Yep.
"The certified check was issued, all right, but so far it hasn't been cashed."
"Now that the weekend's over, other checks are starting to come in."
"With that 50,000 earmarked by the bank, there's just not enough money in Somers' accounts to cover them."
But I don't understand.
"Somers never intended that the certified check be cashed, Della."
He had it drawn up in case anyone made inquiries at the bank.
But he intended to return it after the weekend to cover his other checks.
He was just stalling for time.
"How do you explain the $7,000 found in Latham Reed's pockets?"
"Planted on him by Somers, of course."
"Somers just wanted the poor guy to think he'd cashed the check, just as he wanted everyone to think it."
"Why, that stinker."
Item 2:
"The State's dug up an airlines clerk who says that the day before the murder, two tickets to Copenhagen were reserved by the Somers office in the name of Edie Morrow."
I was supposed to see a guy and think they were twins.
"And about a day before, you, Peter, came over and said that you couldn't decide how to shoot it so we weren't gonna do that scene but we had Kevin Corrigan and what do we wanna do."
"And I have a thing with turkey sandwiches so we talked about it and we talked to Kevin who in a really, like, intense way decided that he wasn't gonna say anything during the scene."
"Yeah, that's kind of..."
Turning the scene on its head.
- Last minute.
- Hilarious.
"I was like, ""Oh, my God."
He's not gonna say anything.
"What am I gonna do?"""
"- Oh, Ari."
- I'm sure everyone was freaking out because it was so late and there was no script.
I was just babbling about a turkey sandwich for like hours.
I would love to see Kevin Corrigan get some kind of award for this scene.
He's so genius.
His face...
I wish...
I wish at some point in the DVD you can put a thing of him flipping his hat over.
"Remember, when he would like do this huge body twitch and his whole hat would flip?"
"Oh, my God."
"Ari, you..."
You two.
I'd love to see it in the movie with these characters.
I think the two of us should write something.
Caroline and Silent Guy's Infinite Evening.
"Ari, this right here, when you almost throw up a few times I don't know how you freaking do it, but it's so disgusting and so accurate."
How do you...?
How do you...?
How do you make a noise every time?
- How do you?
- I don't know.
- It's one of those hidden talents.
my lord...
What noise is this?
Not dead?
Not yet quite dead?
"Desdemona dies a victim's death, it's very pathetic."
"She dies nobly, she dies forgiving her husband... denying even that he had killed her."
Othello is also the victim.
"He is the victim of lago and it's Emilia who brings that home to the audience... as it gradually dawns on her finally... how wicked a man, her own husband is."
In the final scene Emilia realizes the full extent of lago's ignominy.
She realizes it as it were simultaneously with Othello.
She is the one who is battering at the door to get in... she is the one rebuking Othello for being so stupid... and then she is the one who is silenced by lago... first verbally and then physically by killing her.
"That's very shocking but it is also, if you like, the 'nadir'... the lowest point of male/female relationships in the play."
"Oh Emilia, come in."
What's the matter with thee now?
"Oh my god lord, yonder's foul murder's done."
- What now?
- But now my lord!
It is the very error of the moon:
"She comes more nearer earth than she was wont, and makes men mad."
"Cassio, my lord, hath killed a young Venetian called Roderigo."
- Roderigo killed?
And Cassio killed?
"- No, Cassio is not killed."
Not Cassio killed!
"Then murder's out of tune, and sweet revenge grows harsh."
"O, falsely, falsely murdered!"
- What cry is that?
- That?
What?
"Out and alas, that was my lady's voice!"
Help...
"O, lady, speak again!"
Masterson Construction's pissed about this prison case.
Still?
You handed it off like they asked.
"No, they wanted the thing gone, not handed off, and now it's turned into a class action, and it's going to trial tomorrow."
"Listen to me, it's not your job to make this thing go away."
"Harvey, I'm their attorney."
"They had a problem, they wanted it fixed, and I didn't fix it."
"Bullshit, you got Pearson Specter to drop it like a hot potato."
That's all you could've done.
"No, what I could have done was kill the whole damn thing."
"And since I didn't, they found some inmate at another prison to break the case wide open, which is why I just had to eat a ton of shit."
- What did you just say?
"- I said they found a witness at another prison, and now I'm gonna lost my goddamn client."
Where you going?

We'll need to make sure of the dimensions of the building first.
I already talked about it.
How big do they want it?
"Including the basement, about 130 pyeong*."
(*one pyeong is equal to 3.954 sq yd or 35.586 sq ft)
They also want a noraebang and wine bar in the basement.
And the amount?
They don't care.
They visited Chairman Oh's house at Pangyo.
"They're friends, and it looks like they're rivals."
They want it to be better than that house.
I said it was our first project and they were shocked.

All right!
All this area through here is our new computer labs.
We'll take you through all those rooms.
Arthur's first recruiting visit... takes him to a junior college in Southern Missouri.
The strength that I see here is the tremendous teaching that goes on here.
have you decided what you want to go into?
"Uh, communications."
Are you more interested in the overall communications -
"That, and, uh - I like that and accounting."
- Like business.
- Oh.
Okay.
"We enjoy winning things, but the primary purpose is your education."
"What are some of your career goals, may I ask?"
"I want to fall back to, like, make - have my own business."

"I was like, ""He's going to be traumatised,"
"""he's run to the front of this room and had this amazing song"
"""and he's running out of fucking words."""
"And my thing to help him here, was to make a joke, like,"
"""Whoa, someone hasn't got the..."" I couldn't shit on it, I couldn't make a joke, he was really in it, everyone in the room's rooting for him to nail this song, and I just thought, ""You know what?"
"""I've had a thousand bad gigs, I can do this"", so I just stood up, no jokes, this is not funny, I'm in the room, straight-faced and I'm like..."
# And you can tell everybody...

And then the room starts joining in.
# Hope you don't mind!

The couple...
"So, no-one's laughing, everyone's totally in this and I'm like, ""Do not laugh, just be here."""
The couple I met on the first day then burst into tears.
"""This is our wedding song."""
"It was like an emotional orgy, it was the whole room singing."
ALAN SINGS INAUDIBLY It was insane.
"But breakfast the next day, it's like..."
Awkward.
"It is like a one-night stand, yeah."
"Everyone's like, ""How you doing?"

"""There was a lot of singing, you're right."
"""We should meet up and go on a walking holiday""."
"""I never want to see any of you again."""
"But, yeah, and whenever anyone says, ""What's the worst gig...?"", that flashes into my brain."
"Nothing is as bad as having to not smile and to not make a joke of it, and hold a note and sing along to this guy who didn't have, like, an awful evening."
You've saved him.
I did.
"It was traumatising, it was really traumatising."
"Well, I loved that story."
The perp wanted him to give up Tendu's location.
HOLMES:
O.G. submitted.
"The killer goes to Tendu's room, tries to enter."
He's delayed by the security latch on the door.
Fresh abrasions on the metal suggest that it was forcefully engaged and then defeated.
"Only, by that time, Tendu had escaped."
"So the guy comes up empty-handed, but he isn't ready to give up, so he finds the kid's club and he takes it back to Owen Tuchman's room."
He couldn't kill Tendu.
He settled for framing him.
My niece mentioned that there's some big gaming tournament this weekend-- the first prize is two million bucks.
Maybe somebody wanted Tendu out of the picture.
"We thought about that, but he wasn't due to play this weekend."
"So him being dead, or on the run wouldn't have affected the outcome."
Hmm.
What about this brunette you think he was with?
Any more on her?
HOLMES:
Not yet.
Watson's at home combing through Tendu's social media.
"Hopefully, we'll have answers to our questions soon."

"It turns out Tendu isn't big on words, but he loves photos."
"He posted a few dozen a day, every day, for the last five years."
"That's 30,000 pictures, give or take."
"Unfortunately, he only posted a few since he arrived in New York, none since O.G.'s murder."

"Hi, Officer Ravitz, I'm Abby."
"And that adorable man handcuffed over there-- uh, not the bald guy or the lady dude-- is my kind of, sort of brother-in-law, so I'm here to bust him out."
"Oh, legally."
"So I would like to post his bail, preferably using a combination of credit cards and gift certificates."
Bail won't be set for at least another four to six hours.
"You're being a tad unreasonable, Officer Ravitz."
"And you do not want to be known as ""Unreasonable Ravitz."""
I have known the pain of a hurtful nickname.
"Don't worry, buddy, we'll keep you out of jail."
"But if we don't, the first thing you do when you get in there is kick someone's ass."
That's how I survived space camp.
"Look, lady,"

And none of that really matters because I don't like him.
And I'm beginning to not like you.
"This is a power trip, huh?"
They give you a badge and a gun and you get to play God?
"Well, my sister is counting on me to get her baby daddy to the hospital."
"Now you're holding on to something of mine, so I'm gonna hold on to something of yours."
"Ma'am, give that back."
Why?
"Why, what are you gonna do about it?"
"""Abby's been arrested""?"
"But I love the idea of, like, authors having feuds."
"That, like, she's driving by Joanna Trollope's house in her Beamer, going ""What's up, Joanna Trollope?"
"""Bitches writing witches!"""
Why is she wasting her time arguing with people on Twitter when she's a billionaire?
"If I was a billionaire,"
I'd go in Argos and buy one of everything.
"I mean, that, that's literally everything we need to know about you in one sentence."
"Rich, have you read these books, the Harry Potters?"
I haven't.
"You know what, I do, I think, you know, she's made it OK for a whole generation of children to read again, which I genuinely think is a real shame."
"Because when I was growing up, you were allowed to just watch television."
Kids these days have to read.
"My daughter read all the Harry Potter books,"
I had to read some of them.
They...
It's fine.
"But I say to my son, ""Why don't you read this thing?"
"""It's good, it's got wizards, and there's like lots of deaths."""
"And he honestly goes, ""You know there are video games, right?"
"""Why on earth would you be reading a book when there's a video game?"""

I quite like it.
You can't help the truth!

"Because you don't have to do the thinking, it's there."
You know what I mean?
"And you know what,"
I think Steven Spielberg's got a better idea of what I want to watch than what I do.
I've got a pretty good idea of what you want to watch.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Are you flirting with me?
He died when I was 11.
The circumstances of his death have always fascinated me.
He was bankrupt and alone on his way back home from India.
"He collapsed in the downstairs men's room in Penn Station, New York."
"The police couldn't identify him, because, for some unknown reason, he crossed out the address on his passport."
"They took him to the city morgue, where he lay unclaimed for three days."
What was he thinking at the end?
Had he seen anyone?
Had he talked to anyone?
Had he really decided to leave his wife and come and live with us like my mother said?
"For years, I struggled to be satisfied with the little piece of my father's life"
I'd been allowed to see.
But it wasn't enough.
I needed to know him.
"I needed to find out who he really was, so I set out on a journey to see his buildings and to find whatever was left of him out there."
It would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questions.
"My father had been dead 25 years, so there wasn't much time left if I wanted to meet any of his colleagues."
I figured I'd start at the top:
the guy with the glasses.
- Mr. Johnson.
- Good to meet you.
"- Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you."
- You're Lou's son?
Yes.
"Generations go by quickly, don't they?"
I've just decided Lou was the most beloved architect of our time.
- Really?
- Yeah...
"Well, think of anybody else."
Frank Lloyd Wright was too cantankerous to love.
Mies van der Rohe wasn't...
you couldn't talk to him at all.
"I need to make time for Paige and Cooper, and Joe."
"Then, why do you seem more stressed out now than ever?"
"I mean, at least before, you weren't in it alone."
"Noah,"
"Tell me something, how can you feel so guilty... when nothing happened between us?"
Because being in sync with a man who is not your husband is almost as painful as not being in sync with your husband.
Don't you ever miss looking forward to something?
"You know, picking out your shoes, your shirt for somebody...everyday."
Don't you miss that?
"Sarah, is your hand bleeding?"
Oh God!
Oh!
I suck!
- What?
- Hawaii...my daughter is Hawaii.
"Noah, I'll call, OK?"
He needs to go into a treatment program again.
"I agree, even if it's outpatient."
"You know, a partner of mine just came back from Hazleton, Minnesota."
I'm not sending my son to Minnesota.
Very cold there this time of year.
"He needs some kind of professional help, Mom."
"I'm not saying he doesn't need help, Kevin,"
I'm just saying now's not the time to theorize about your poor brother as if he was some sort of case study.
"What needs to happen is we need to get down to this Oceanside place and get him out of jail, and take him home."
Why didn't you tell me your father was going to insult him like that?
"Oh, what would you have done if you'd known?"
"I don't know, we could've prepared him, we could've come up with a plan."
"As it is, you dropped it on him like a bomb."
No wonder he's gone off and done something to himself.
Are you serious?
Yes!
No!
Hamchunk?
"You always knew it could happen, didn't you?"
But I didn't want it to.
None of us did.
Was my Peter-san brave?
He was very brave.
Are you going to be?
L'll try.
I know you will.
And I'm sure that your Peter-san would want you to have that.
What will happen to me now?
"You let me worry about that, Green Beret."
You're what this is all about.

"Good morning, Mr. Phelps."
"We recently learned that, in order to carry out the underworld's policy of enforcement, this man, Burt Gordon, has set up an organisation similar to the old Murder, Incorporated."
"Gordon will arrange for the disposal of anyone, anywhere, for a price."
The victims always disappear with no evidence of foul play and the body is never recovered.
"Although we are sure Gordon is the man behind this murder ring, he has kept himself so far removed from the actual killings, we are unable to pin anything on him."
"Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to prove Gordon is, in fact, a killer, and put him away for good."
"As always, should you or any of your IM Force be caught or killed, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions."
Please destroy this recording in the usual manner.
"Good luck, Jim."
"- Good, very good, Rollin."
"- J ust a small sample, Jim."
"Well, I think that will appeal greatly to Mr. Gordon's nature."
"How about the effects at the house, Barney?"
They're in the works.
I also have the men.
Did you get eyes on Simon's project?
"I did, but it was a little hard to get cell reception 12 miles outside of Havana."
I know exactly where you were.
"Get me the latest GSA images of Lourdes, Cuba."
Yep.
Used to be KGB's largest listening station outside of Russia until they closed it in '01.
"From a bird's eye, it looks like the facility is still dormant."
I heard it loud and clear.
Heard it?
It's already operational?
Jesus.
"With the microchip substrates that Simon took, they can turn Lourdes into a cellular jamming station-- disrupt cell signals, FAA communications, military command and control."
This is huge.
And this is the kind of find that makes careers.
"Now, you got to get your ass back home so we can plan our next move."
Easier said than done.
There's a little problem with our art project.
"It got locked away for safekeeping, and I can't get out of here without it."
"Even if you could somehow sneak out without your passport, an escape like that would burn you with Simon."
It's just not worth it.
My host has a new friend.
"Is he 6'0"", 190 pounds, with a scar on his right arm?"
That's him.
"Yeah, that's Hector Serrano, FSB's top man in Cuba."
"Look, you know I'm not risk-averse, but Serrano's not the kind of guy you actively seek out."
"He's a former FSB hit man with two dozen confirmed kills, including one of ours."
"As long as he's on the ground, you are not safe."
Simon?
There you are.
"I came home, and you weren't here."
- I--
- Your foot.
- But not a requirement.
"- It's not, that's true."
- If Ray Spies interviewed me... he'd refuse to put me on the committee even for a minute... because he'd find out that when it comes to Laine Hanson...
"I went to my dictionary and crossed off the word ""objectivity."""
Are you suggesting Mrs. Hanson may not be your first choice for vice president?
I'm suggesting that Laine Hanson has stricken our party with policies and attitudes... that are best served across the aisle from where she came.
"I take it, like most members of your party... your selection would be Governor Hathaway."
Governor Hathaway's a great man.
"He's a visionary, a bona fide hero."
- But he withdrew his name from consideration.
- Minds can be changed.
- How much discretion can I count on from you?
"- A hundred percent, sir."
- Even from your own leadership?
- I said a hundred percent.
Good.
Good man.
Good man.
"I think if I make the rounds, do the Sunday morning talk shows... raise the level of the game a bit, outtalk her on the issues..."
Issues?
What kind of fucking campaigns are they running in Virginia?
Not the kind I'm used to.
"Jack, this whole thing with the girl drowning..."
It's bullshit!
"- I was there, Shelly."
The president told me himself.
- It's an excuse.
Jackson Evans has chosen to make putting a woman in office his swan song.
Laine Hanson is the only reasonable choice in your party.
He's not going with Boxer.
She's too liberal.
He's not going with Jones because she's older than he is.
But there would be plenty of reason for Merle to do it.
"And the murder weapon was still locked in her bag, so you can't very well say it was planted there."
"She admits putting it there, all right."
She planned to get rid of later.
She'd gone into Olivia's bedroom to get some traveling money from her desk.
She recognized the knife as one belonging to her Uncle Howard.
"You mean she swiped it and ran out with it, just to protect him?"
What else could she have thought?
It was his knife.
She tells me that Olivia was ten times as rough on Howard as she was on her.
"Yeah, but with a kookie kid like that--"
Merle seems about 14 years old only because Olivia deliberately held her back.
How would you have acted in that kind of situation?
All right.
Here's the rest of my report.
One of my men on another case accidentally stumbled on a messenger service boy who made a pickup at the house next door while the party was going on.
What time?
Late enough so the package could have been the necklace.
But I couldn't see the guy.
"I wouldn't know who it was, in the dark like that."
"He just handed me down this thick envelope from the porch, and I gave him a receipt and that's it."
Then you delivered the envelope here?
"Yes, sir."
The addressee was a dame in room 32 there.
I got it in the book.
Then what happened?
"Well, I knocked on the door, and she answered, and I--"
She answered right away?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I think so."
"Anyway, she opens the door, and she sticks an arm out, and I give her the package, and she shuts the door."
Just an arm?
"Oh, yeah, she gave him a no-bid contract to maintain all the parks and the medians the minute she got elected."
"He overcharges like Halliburton, but you've got to love the flowering jacaranda trees he put out by the ball fields."
And Tom Bender owns all of our school buses.
"He bought them from the town and then rents them back to us for twice what he paid, which was actually my idea."
But he went behind my back and made the deal himself when Dana and I were on vacation in Hawaii.
- Where did you stay?
"- The Four Seasons, Maui."
"- See, I prefer the Kea Lani."
"- Me, too."
But Dana likes the macadamia-nut pancakes at the Four Seasons.
Twenty-eight dollars for fucking crunchy pancakes that she takes two bites of and throws out.
- You want another one?
"- No, no,"
I should probably save that for the next council meeting.
"Oh, right, it's your vodka."
"Well, thank you for this, the 411."
I never realized there was such a method to your madness.
"Six years on a job, and you learn how things work."
"- Are you heading out, too?"
- Me?
- Are you leaving?
- Now?
- Should we go out together?
- What?
"Not ""should we go out together."""
"Just should we go out together, out of this office, outside?"
"Well, it is lunchtime out there."
Do you want to try this new little Mongolian-barbecue place before they go out of business?
- What was that?
- I don't know.
- I have condoms in my desk.
"- Do you have herpes, warts, anything?"
Solo Solo.
What are you doing?
You only have half an hour until you perform.
I'm not a scriptwriter.
I can't come up with any persuasive dialogue.
So that's why I'm doing other things to change my mood.
This is a voodoo doll I made myself.
"Whenever I'm in a bad mood, it works well for venting my feelings."
Do you want me to show you how to make one?
Put that away this instant!
Are you going to admit you've lost to those people?
"I'm not, but I don't know how to act out the scene."
"In that case, you shouldn't have parroted Mary just now and provoked those vicious shrews."
"I wasn't provoking them, but after listening to what Mary said,"
I agree that it's illogical.
Look at this.
"This jie jie* was the recipient of their mother's love, (*big sister) but as a result of her mei mei's birth, (*little sister) all of her happiness was stolen away in one night."
"In my mind, this jie jie should hate this mei mei intensely."
"But, this jie jie who hates her mei mei so much, has to coax her by saying,"
"""Daddy doesn't hate you at all, Mei Mei. """
"In other words, Jie Jie doesn't want Mei Mei to continue to suffer."
That means Jie Jie also loves Mei Mei a lot.
This character is too complex.
I can't figure it out.
"To be honest,"
I don't care at all what your thoughts are on this character.
All I care about is that you don't mess this up and ruin our Love Me Dept's reputation.
Hold on...
What reputation?
What did you just say?
I didn't hear you clearly.
Could you repeat that again?
It was opened by a warehouse worker named Manny Gresham.
"Upon his death 6 years ago, it was bought by a hedge fund company called First Advantage."
Why would a hedge fund company want a bar?
Let's see.
"Well, they bought it for a song, and, poor man, his medical expenses bankrupted him."
I guess that's why-- shut the front door.
"Clark Preston is on the board of First Advantage, which explains why the bar is on a short list of local businesses that support Preston for mayor."
Uh...
"Hey, Clark, uh, it's me again."
"I did everything like you said, just like we planned it, but something, something went wrong."
I don't know what to do.
Would you call me back!
Please?
"Ok, we missed something."
We need to go back over his staff and contributors again.
They all came up clean.
"Hey, Garcia, look up DMV records and find every registration in the area that matches the description of the unsub's vehicle."
"Ok, 79 names, and I'm way ahead of you."
None of them match anyone on Preston's team.
What the what?
"Oh, I'm good at my job."
A Pamela Mills donates monthly to Preston's campaign.
"Her son Trevor, his car matches the description, and it's registered in his name."
Got a photo and an address?
"Yes, I do."
I also have a place of work for Trevor.
He is a part-time messenger.
I'm sending it now.
"All right, JJ, Morgan, and Prentiss take the workplace, we'll take the house."
"And now in political news, with the mayoral race heating up, we caught up with candidate Hilary Ross."
Her comments on the recent home invasion...
I know.
What's the rest of the papers?
"There are thousands of papers stretching back over hundreds of years affecting belle Reve as piece by piece, our improvident grandfathers exchanged the land for their epic debauches to put it mildly."
"until finally, all that was Ieft-- And stella can verify that."
--was the house itself.
"And about 20 acres of ground, including a graveyard to which now all but stella and I have retreated."
"Here they are, all of them."
AII papers.
I hereby endow you with them.
"Take them, peruse them, commit them to memory, even."
"I think it's wonderfully fitting that belie Reve should finally be this bunch of old papers in your big, capable hands."
I wonder if stella's come back with my lemon Coke.
"I got a lawyer acquaintance, we'II study this out."
Present them to him with a box of aspirin tablets.
Under the napoleonic Code a man has got to take an interest in his wife's affairs.
And I mean especially now that she's gonna have a baby.
stella?
"stella, going to have a baby?"
I didn't know she was going to have a baby.
stella.
"Oh, stella for star, how lovely to have a baby."
"Honey, everything's all right."
We thrashed it out.
"I feel a bit shaky, but I think I handled it nicely."
I laughed and treated it all as a joke.
I laughed and called him a little boy and flirted.
Here.
"I was flirting with your husband, stella."
The guests are gathering for the poker party.
"-Hi, stella."
"-Hi, Steve."
I'm sorry he did that to you.
"Why, I guess he's just not the type that goes for jasmine perfume."
"Kyle, I'm afraid Mrs. Bloom has every right to send Amanda back whether she wants to go or not."
Just as she has the right to ask you to stay away.
And the hard truth is... it's really none of our business.
You know what Amanda means to me.
"If she's struggling with, or confused about something, how could it be none of my business?"
"I know you're bummed, but look at the bright side."
"Which, by the way, is my new M.O."
At least Amanda wasn't planning on dumping you.
How do you know that?
Mrs. Bloom blames you for ruining her life.
"It seems to me like Amanda flying home was a case of ""girl missing boy next door. """
But we don't know that.
We don't know anything Amanda's feeling.
No one's letting her explain.
Even Mom and Dad.
I can't believe they're siding with Mrs. Bloom.
I can't believe we're siding with Carol Bloom.
"She's uptight, narrow-minded-"
"Yeah, and those are her good qualities."
"Well, like it or not, we have to respect what she wants for her daughter."
But Kyle has shown nothing but love and concern for Amanda.
And now we have to keep them apart?
"The funny thing is, knowing Kyle, he'd make the situation a lot better if he were just allowed to talk to her."
You remember being Kyle's age?
When something like this takes over your whole life...
That's half the fun of being in love.
"Now we have to be the buzz kills, the grown-ups."
"Well, if this is what being a grown-up means-"
It sucks.
Why can't Mom and Dad do something?
They can't cross the line with Mrs. Bloom.
They're all about crossing the line when something's not fair.
"Inhaling it, exhaling it."
"And all of a sudden, boom!"
"Because I was invited to make this record with the Neville Brothers, we were rummaging through a bunch of cassettes."
And we bumped into a whole box of cassettes that were the Meters' rehearsals.
I couldn't hear a word they were saying 'cause I'm Canadian and they're from New Orleans.
"And so, Zig, the drummer, he's trying to describe something to the rest of the band in another language."
No!
"No, man!"
It sounded like some strange Japanese to me.
I always thought from the very beginning that this group were like song stylists.
And that's where we got our peculiar and extraordinary talent meshed together to come and make one whole music!
That's the thing I remember.
Don't mind me.
"I'm crazy, man."
Thank you!
They kind of invented a form for New Orleans...
"That beautiful Meters sound, you know?"
Not getting any cooler in here.
"Hawkins is glistening, man."
Look like a big ol' tray of deli meat left out in the summertime.
Dripping with the juices.
"""Taylor juice."" Au jus."
"Could I have some ""Taylor au jus""?"
"No, I'm all good, dude."
"All right, y'all ready?"
We are rolling.
"One, a-two, a-one, two, three."
"Without a doubt, the hottest performance of our entire career was at Jazz Fest, and I mean that in a meteorological sense 'cause it was fucking hot."
I looked at some of those gospel bands singing in those robes...
God damn!
"I remember being asked to play and thinking, ""God, do we belong there?"""
"I was honored to be asked, because all of the music was so real."
Leave it like that Don't let anyone else know about it
After that incident he has touched gold only today
My son lives like a guest at his own house
He gives his monthly salary to me
Otherwise he comes home for food and sleeping only

- Mom!
- What?
What was the length they wanted?
7 or 8?
I did not ask them
"Mani, come here"
Sit down
You got 10 fingers
Why only one finger is sweet?
The finger that touched you is sweet to me
All other fingers are starving
Oh bee of the bamboo forest The crab that jerks my brain
Am I the feast to contain the starvation of your 1 0 fingers
Oh Bandit darling The girl who commit light murders
Will I leave if you keep away?
I am obliged to hide my arrogant beauty
It's your ability to pluck with out unveiling the screen
It's cruel to hide the beauty
You got 1 0 fingers
Why only one finger is sweet?
The finger that touched you is sweet to me
All other fingers are starving
Oh man who pinches my mind
Do you know Cupid's lingo?
With the eyes that could penetrate the dress
Stroking upto the soul

The money was there forJai before he could ask
"Jagadish, I never discriminated between you and Jai"
I still haven't been able to repay what I borrowed forJai's education
"Wouldn't make a difference to borrow another 200,000 for my education"
It will make a difference!
But I'm not refusing you
I'm only asking for time.
"In a day or two... once Jai has signed his service bond, all our problems are solved"
No
I've worked out another way to solve all our problems
Sell this house
Sell the house and all our problems are automatically taken care of
"Yours, Om's and mine."
- I didn't send you to America... to lose your values.
Talk of selling the house?
Ma has spent a lifetime here
"The souls of my father, my grandfather rest here"
I respect your feelings.
"But that's your way of thinking, not mine"
Why is America on the ascent?
People over there don't think like you
What's this America-America about?
A short stay changes your attitude?
"With time, everything must change"
"Dispositions, demeanours and dwellings"
"What are you saying, Jai?"
Quiet!
Why?
Before This place was built... our ancestors must've lived elsewhere.
Given our disposition... would our house ever been built?
"- Please, don't fight"
"- Ned, what are you doing here?"
"- Filing, fielding calls, making coffee."
What happened to assistant Giancarlo?
"He had to, um, scoot."
What happened to Giancarlo was this:
After eating a slice of pie  from what he believed was a secret admirer in Accounting  Giancarlo experienced what could best be described as  extreme intestinal distress.
You pruned his pie?
"Sent him home, hid in Human Resources waited for them to call Happy Time Temp Agency, then canceled the order and showed up with a smile and a pleasant attitude."
I think that's the most romantic thing I ever heard.
He is stalking you.
You don't think I'm stalking you?
I'd be a hypocrite to judge you for dosing someone's pie.
- Why?
Are you stalking me?
- Depends.
"Now we're living our Parisian lifestyle, does that mean I can't be close?"
I feel safer now that you're here.
Then this isn't stalking.
"It's just good, old-fashioned chivalry."
Walk with me.
Cancel my appointments.
I'm leaving.
But I've got one more thing to do.
Have my car waiting for me downstairs.
With the Pie-Maker serving the perfect distraction  Chuck beelined for the stolen bee key.
She found the bee key exactly where Betty Bee put it.
Then she made an important discovery  of a different kind  before she herself was discovered.
Chuck.
I told you this was dangerous.
Alive again doesn't mean you can't be dead again.
There's a reason I don't let Digby play in traffic.
I suppose we can talk about this later.
Let's play Hive Minds.
All the answers are hidden in a hive which looks like this.
"And if the answer to my question was,"
"""What are the names of this week's teams?"""
"you'd be looking for Lutrophiles, that's how you spell it and Pascallywags, and as you can see, answers use adjoining cells, they can go in any direction and no cell is used more than once."
"In round one, as you're looking for answers in the hive, after two seconds letters will start to disappear and as they do, the points go down."
"So the faster you answer, the more you score but be careful, we've set a few traps."
We've laid a few false trails.
"So, Pascallywags, here's your first question, buzz in when you think you've found the answer."
You are looking for a UK motorway service area that shares its name with a 17th-century battle.
Reveal the hive.
"Agincourt... 17th century, never mind."
"Hang on, so... 17th-century battle..."
Nasby?
"Oh, Naseby."
Is that...?
I can see it.
What's your answer?
-Naseby.
-Show me your first letter.
"No, I'm afraid Naseby is a battle but not a service station."
-Oh.
"So I can throw it over to you, Lutrophiles, let's see what you would have been left with."
"For one bonus point, do you know it?"
Edgehill.
I'm afraid not.
"Edgehill is also a battle, not a service station."
I can't think why but your knowledge of service stations just isn't that great!
"The answer was Battle of Sedgemoor, climax of the Monmouth Rebellion, 1685."
The last pitched battle on English soil.
The battle between the Duke of Monmouth and troops loyal to King James II.
"So no points to either of you, I'm afraid."
"Left, right."
"Left, right."
"Look to your dressage, gentlemen."
"Chaperone Mrs. Enright, once an army officer herself, casts a critical eye over the troops."
"Well, it was the first day on the parade square but I thought Mr. Foxsmith yawning on parade was something I'd have had him marched to the guard room for."
"And as for Mr. Gorell Barnes, five minutes behind everyone else, ten minutes, 15."
They need to smarten up very considerably.
March.
"Left, right."
"Left, right."
"Left, right."
"Left, right."
And halt.
Halt.
"Apart from the pace and step, it was perfect."
"Oops, sorry."
Right... and halt.
Halt.
"Master of the house, Mr. Gorell Barnes, invites his guests to celebrate Napoleon's downfall."
"Joining them is historian Andrew Roberts, an expert on the wars."
I'd just like everyone to know this is a dinner in celebration of the fine victory at Waterloo.
And also I'd like to welcome Mr. Roberts to Kentchurch.
I hope you enjoy dinner and your stay.
"So, um... enjoy your dinner."
"Ma'am, this evening we have soupe la reine, escargot bourgogne..."
"Despite the conflict, it remained fashionable to pepper conversation with French words and serve French food."
So what do you make of the spread?
"After dinner, the table is transformed into the battlefield of Waterloo."
almost as much is psychology as is military strategy.
These action replays of the Duke of Wellington's finest hour were popular.
"Andrew Roberts describes the moment when, after ten hours, the tide of battle turned."
imperial guard marched straight through the center...
"So, let's both pray I get it right."
GIL:
"Well, in the immortal words,"
"""Here's another nice mess I've gotten myself into. """
All her adult life she's been saving herself for that moment?
It's like what's she saying?
I'm the man of her dreams?
I'm not the man of anyone's dreams.
I'm the stuff of nightmares.
"'Cause, you know, to look at her, you'd think she was so progressive and contemporary and experienced."
"And now, she's never had sex before."
She probably expects sparks to come flying out of her fingers every time we do it.
"But then, she's a lovely person, she's warm, intelligent and highly skilled."
You should be flattered she wants to be with you.
"And maybe it'll all work out and she'll turn out to be the love of your life, just the way you wrote it in the show."
That whole idea you got from Irene that day about the one human being on earth who's really right for you.
"Oh, God, Bob and Irene."
That's another whole can of worms I've got to open sooner or later.
"Sorry, Gil, just run that past me again."
The World Wildlife Fund.
"-Yeah, I just thought, you know, it would be...."
"-That's like pandas, rhinoceroses and tigers?"
'Cause I think you said once she always loved cats.
"-GBP1 7,000."
"-I mean, it's never enough, obviously."
"And they do so much great work 'cause you've got these performing bears, in Russia, and they rescue them, you know, and make sure they get a decent quality of life."
"So, if anyone deserves your mother's money...."
"The thing is, you've just got to try and snap out of it, Ali."
It's not rocket salad.
I've told you before.
"I mean, you read all this stuff about how you're supposed to deal with all your problems."
I know.
But the Hans will not agree to it so easily.
"The most important thing is, we must be sure that the Hans will win this battle easily, like what Yang-Jeong claims they can do."
Sending troops into a losing battle will not do.
Did you check up on them?
Yes
The ministers haven't left their positions... and are currently in a heated discussion over whether to send reinforcements to Han Nation.
"Even if they come to a conclusion on their own,"
Doesn't the final say lie on the King Geum-Wa?
Dong-Sun
"Yes, Governor!"
Arrange a private session with Dae-So.
I'd like to speak to him privately
Yes.
"If His Majesty refuses to send out reinforcements,"
Diplomacy between BuYeo and the Han Dynasty will surely crumble.
"Dae-So, you spent much effort at Hyeon-To solving our previous problems."
I'm afraid your efforts might come to waste.
His Majesty will make a wise decision.
Please don't worry.
No.
His Majesty will not comply with the Han's request for reinforcements.
It's different this time around.
"If he declines, the people will be adversely afffected by our lack of salt."
"Then, for that we will have to go to war."
I'm sure His Majesty is aware of this as well.
I can't stand it any longer.
How long are we going to let the Han Dynasty oppress us?
We are but dogs of the Hans.
That Yang-Jeong jumps at every chance to make things difficult for Father.
"Brother, why don't I just dispose of him already?"
Do you really want BuYeo to be annihilated?
Why don't you try using your brains to think for a while?

"The only time we fell out was over a man, and -- we're arguing over the Doctor."
"It was great because you would imagine that would happen, of who's seen the most, who's done the most, who's been there the most, and i.e. who was more important to the Doctor."
"There's this moment where they realize they're united in how special they are, for having had those experiences and they start laughing quite madly."
"Once they're past that territorial stage, they do then become great friends and I thought ""all right, that's good."
"""That's how I wanted it to be!"
Good!
"Glad we got there."""
River Song is better at operating the TARDIS than the Doctor is.
I just landed her.
She's unpredictable.
Moisturize me.
"I think that ""Doctor Who's"" one of the very few programs that writes brilliantly, gives excellent parts for female characters."
"They're not just screaming women, they're not just like they used to be, it's not a cliché, it's not sexist anymore, at all."
"In fact, the parts for women are better than the parts for men, a lot of the time."
"River Song is beautiful, glamorous."
"I think she's unpredictable and you don't know what she's going to do next and the fact she's a murderer and the fact she's good, but bad."
You always -
- I like a character like that.
River Song is basically the female Indiana Jones.
She is so awesome and badass.
She's smart;
"She's human, but not quite."

"Chief General Heuk-Chi, pledges obedience to Your Majesty."
"High Priestess,"
"His Majesty has rejected the Han's request for reinforcements, and has ordered the General to make war preparations."
"General Chun-Gu, make for SaChulDo immediately and initiate a check on the soldiers and provision."
The soldiers should be prepared to mobilize promptly at His Majesty's order.
"Yes, Chief General."
General Ji-Gu.
Order all officers in and outside of BuYeo to check on their weapons and provision.
"Yes, Chief General."
Are we all just going to sit around?
We should at least convince His Majesty to avoid going to war.
"Palace Emissary,"
It's already too late.
There's nothing we can do now.
"Instead of trying to avoid the war,"
Why don't we put our heads together and think of a way to win?
This is what a loyal minister should do.
No I don't agree
"If we cannot get His Majesty to change his mind, then we should seek the Governor of Hyeon-To and appeal to him for a truce."
Didn't you see how smug Yang-Jeong was?
"As long as we don't comply, there'll be no end to this."
The problem is salt.
"If we don't secure a supply of salt,"
I'm afraid the people and soldiers will perish.
We must find a solution.
"Your Majesty, the Priestess seeks an audience with you."
Invite her in.
What is it?
"Your Majesty,"

"Once again, you got carried away, Alex, there was no need to risk yourself like that, we had them trapped."
"I tought they would flee, and wanted to catch them red handed."
"Well, and did you find out how they smuggled the drugs?"
"Yes, Inspector."
"Look Inspector, inside the banana, and there is a good amount of it, don't you think?"
Quite ingenious.
Now we have all the suspects.
They will spend a good amount of time in prison.
"Alex, for your own good, don't get involved in my affairs."
They almost got away because you where too reckless.
"Very well, Inspector."
"I will heed your advice, for now."
"But, you know, I have a date in Quito, and don't want to dissapoint."
"Just one moment, Alex be careful with the skirts, they only bring more complications."
you think?

"When Dave mentioned we were going there,"
"I'm like, ""We're going where?"
"What?"""
"It's been like this kind of like, temple for me to go every time I stop in."
"That first day, I look at my e-mail of kind of what's going on the first day, just setting up."
"And it says, ""Dave, interview Allen Toussaint."""
"I'm like, ""What?"
"Holy shit."""
"I'm like, ""Oh, this is gonna be a really good week."""
Definitely a bucket list situation.
"Okay, the first question"
"I always ask everybody is, ""Where are you from?"""
"Oh, I'm from New Orleans."
"Very much so, yes."
"I was raised in an area called Gert Town, which is right here in town."
What do you remember about that time?
"You know, this city was still segregated in so many ways."
"That's true, but we would integrate with each other 'cause we had accepted the fact ""You're a musician, too."
"Of course we're gonna play something."""
"Like, I don't remember when Mac was ""segregated."""
"He and I were playing on recordings together, and from way back, we would just go find each other and play together in various places."
"It was actually on the law books that it was against the law for black and white musicians to perform on the same stage, you know, be in the same room, and all this kind of stuff."
"In fact, Mac went to jail from being in the Dew Drop."
I was really pissed off.
There was these two police.
"I'm thinking, ""Aw, shit."
"They gonna break my legs."""
"The story goes, he looked around and said,"
"""Y'all get ready to come back and get me next week, 'cause Ray Charles playing here and I'm coming back."""
It just seemed jive to me.
That's life back then.
He was a wonderful guitarist.
So someone was only after the one piece.
And know it's not worth more than the others.
"Well, maybe it's not about the value of the piece."
Maybe it's about what's in the piece itself?
"Only problem is, we don't know what was in the piece, because it's gone."
(Leo) Along with the negatives.
So how do we figure out what it looks like?
"Well, that's where I come in."
"Okay, I've isolated the missing paintings from the surveillance footage."
Now I'm going to try and identify the different photos Walker used to compose the piece.
Would it be easier for you if we weren't watching?
"(Dozer) Yeah, gimme a couple seconds here."
"So someone got Walker to use his pass code to steal the entire exhibit, but it was only a cover."
So they could take the one piece they really wanted.
Why would Walker agree to that?
And who would want that one piece?
Henry Calhoun?
I'm Colin Anderson's son.
I swear.
"Go ahead, ask me anything."
You could have answers prepared for anything I ask.
"Look, all I care about is finding out what's in the encrypted part of these papers."
Is that all?
All I care about is getting a million dollars and watching Pamela Anderson clean my apartment in that red bathing suit.
How about starting with you telling me what you know?
I know the U.S. was paying Russian spies for their secrets.
Alexi Karasyov was one of those spies.
"When the Wall went down, the United States wanted to send him back to Russia, but my parents,"
"Colin and Lydia Anderson, protected him."
"Now they're in prison for the rest of their lives, and there's something in these papers that can prove that they were set up."
But I don't know what it is.
Because it's in code.
Can't a managing partner have a drink with his favorite COO every once in a while?
"He can, but I got a ton of work to do, and I'd like to get home before midnight."
There's something I need to tell you.
"Harvey, what's going on?"
I've been seeing Paula Agard.
And not as my therapist anymore.
We've been seeing each other.
What?
What do you mean what?
I'm just amused that you think I didn't know.
Donna.
"The day you made managing partner, you drove yourself to work, not in the red car, but in the black Ferrari Daytona."
"And on top of that, you told me and Louis that you had things to take care of that night, but I know your schedule, and I know what happened was you drove yourself straight home from the office, you changed into whatever outfit"
"you thought would impress her the most, and then you went right over to her house, and you swept her off her feet."
But you just asked me the other night if something was going on because I've been acting different.
"'Cause I was trying to get you to open up, but you missed the signal, so I figured I'd just keep on waiting, and here you are, more or less right on time."
- More or less?
"- Well, I was giving you until tomorrow, so you're actually ahead of schedule."
"Well, that was Paula's doing."
"I'm happy for you, Harvey, and I want to hear all about it, but like I said, I've got a ton of work to do, and I want to get home before midnight, so..."
"Go on, finish."
We'll talk later.
I'm glad you finally told me.
"Thanks, Donna."
Me too.

I just got some news
DR. SALA:
"There are about 10,000 to 12,000 narwhals in this region."
"The numbers are stable here, in other regions are declining."
DICAPRIO:
Wow.
That's awesome.
DR. SALA:
"Yeah, they are waiting for the ice to open up, to swim in, so they can catch the flounder."

DICAPRIO:
"When I was 25 years old,"
I remember being asked to participate in this huge event in Washington for Earth Day.
"Temperatures are rising, coral reefs are dying, and not since a meteor hit the earth 65 million years ago, have so many species of plant and animals become extinct in such a short time."
I even got a chance to interview the President of the United States.
Why do you think this issue is so constantly overlooked?
BILL CLINTON:
"I think it's because it takes a long time for the climate to change in a way that people feel it, and because, uh, it seems sort of abstract now."
DICAPRIO:
"At the time, it was this huge push to get the word out on global warming."
Now a couple degrees' difference in today's temperatures may not seem like an emergency.
"Back then everyone was focused on small, individual actions."
"We all have to, you know, bring environmentalism to the American consciousness."
And it boiled down to simple solutions like changing your light bulb.
"It seemed like a positive thing at the time, you know."
Changing your lightbulb.

No.

was a very emotional moment for me because I remember Sarah so well.
"She was part of ""Doctor Who"" legend."
"I think it was around about her time when you heard less of the term ""assistant"""
"and it went more to ""companion."""
She was really a different kind of companion.
"She was a reporter, she was hardnosed, she actually, you know, she could do stuff."
"She and the Doctor had a chemistry in the '70s that the show had not seen before, or since."
"I mean, she's generally though of as the best companion, ever."

I don't even know cornelius vanderbilt.

Let me give them to you.
"Oh, dear."
I'm afraid in fourth place it's Peter with minus five.
- Minus five!
"- (Stephen) Oh, lordy Lord."
In third place it's Rich with three points.
"In second place, Julia with nine, but way out in front it's Alan with 23 quite interesting points."
(applause)
"Well, that about knocks it on the head for QI."
"It only remains for me to thank our four wise monkeys, Rich, Julia, Peter and Alan, and to close with this thoroughly positive and quite interesting thought from yet another great British Alan, the boxer Alan Minter, who reassures us:"
"""Sure, there have been injuries and deaths in boxing, but none of them serious."" Good night."

"Louis I. Kahn, whose strong forms of brick and concrete influenced a generation of architects and made him, in the opinion of most architectural scholars,"
"America's foremost living architect, died Sunday evening apparently of a heart attack in Pennsylvania Station."
He was 73 years old.
"Besides his wife, Mr. Kahn leaves a daughter, Sue Ann."
"When I first read that obituary,"
I have to admit I was looking for my own name.
"I was his child too, his only son."
I didn't know my father very well.
"He never married my mother, and he never lived with us."
But I can still remember every detail of the few times we spent a whole day together.
"On this afternoon, we had a picnic."
"He painted with watercolors, and my mother snapped these pictures."
"So, that was the measure of success in our family."
What sort of stuff was he doing to invoke that much rage from people?
He was...attacking the regime.
He was a satirist and he attacked the Khomeini regime?
"Khomeini's regime, yes."
And after that assassination attempt...
"I mean, it wrecked our peace of mind, because that's what terrorists do."
Killing you is the tip of the iceberg.
What did they try to do?
They tried to blow his car up.
Wow.
Yeah.
Was there an explosion?
"No, there wasn't, because Scotland Yard got wind of the plot and they said, ""OK, you have to go to Windsor."
"""We've got a safe house for you."""
"So, they took us away, and this was the era of Spitting Image, and my dad had an Ayatollah Khomeini Spitting Image mask, and as the police were gently telling us kids what was going on,"
"my dad came in with the Khomeini mask and a black robe, going, ""Argh!"
"I kill you!"""
It was really traumatic.
"So, um, they told..."
Do you think he really grasped the seriousness of the situation?
LAUGHTER
"No, I think my dad was like, ""Hey, he knows me personally."
"I'm so famous."""
"Because the trial of my father's would-be assassins was held in The Hague and I got transcripts of the trials, and my dad's death order was signed by the Ayatollah Khomeini himself, and on it was written, ""The writer Hadi Khorsandi is to be shot"
"""as he takes his children to school."
"""Neither of the children are to be harmed."""
"And I thought, ""That's so cute, right?"""
"Cos I'd written a letter to the Ayatollah and I said,"
"""We're getting death threats,"
"""but you need to know my dad makes up jokes about everybody - even me."""
"So, when you're ten years old or something like that?"
You've got some gall.
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) (GASPS)
(SCREAMS) Ow!
"(SINGING) By Christ, you'll pay for what you've done"
I guarantee I'll make you suffer
"I beg you, don't report me, sir"
I'll do whatever you may want
Make your excuse to the police
Tell me quickly what's the story
Who saw what and why and where?
Let him give a full description Let him answer to Javert
"Javert, would you believe it?"
I was lost here in the dark
When this prostitute attacked me You can see she left her mark
She will answer for her actions If you make a full report
"You may rest assured, monsieur She will answer to the court"
There's a child who sorely needs me
"Please, monsieur, she's but that high"
"Holy God, is there no mercy?"
If I go to jail she'll die
I have heard such protestations every day for 20 years
Let's have no more explanations
"Save your breath, save your tears"
"Honest work, just reward"
That's the way to please the Lord
"A moment of your time, Javert I do believe this woman's tale"
Monsieur le Mayor!
"You've done your duty, let her be"
"She needs a doctor, not a jail"
Monsieur le Mayor!
Can this be?
Where will she end
"The Impreza did it in one minute 30.1, which puts it there - faster than the Aston, just behind the Z8."
And how much faster is that than the old model?
Just under one and a half seconds.
One and a half seconds faster?
"But get this, the Mitsubishi Evo VIII, one minute, 28.9."
So that's...
Can you reach?
I can get that.
Quicker than a Lamborghini Murcielago?
A very fast car.
So if you want to go round a track quickly take the Evo VIII.
Which would you choose?
Impreza.
No idea why.
"None of these cars on our board find much favour among the Guardian set, let's say."
"Whenever I go to a dinner party the person next to me always says, ""Please sit somewhere else""."
"Then they say, ""We've got a 70mph speed limit in this country."
"Why do we have such fast cars? """
"Well, the thing is you can drive these cars quickly."
"All of the country's race tracks - Silverstone, Brands Hatch, Scotland, all of them now run things called track days where you take your own car along and drive it as fast as you want."
Bedford Autodrome - Palmer sport day.
"All over the country people are queuing up to come to these ""run what you brung"" track days."
"Because the whole point of a track day is to leave civilised roads - and let's be honest, civilised road behaviour - behind."
Why do you do it?
Because there are too many speed cameras around.
"And it's a way of venting your passion to drive fast because you can't in this country any more, and why the hell buy a car that'll do 155mph and not use it?"
"It's easy to see why these ""run what you brung"" track days are booming."
You don't need a race licence or join a race series.
"It's just you, your car and your helmet."
"A £2,000 Honda Prelude and this guy think's he's Jensen Button."
I have never seen such an ordinary car take so much abuse.
Thank you!
That guy is brushing his hand
Perhaps he is brushing his dentures
Look there
A beautiful woman like Iyengar's bakery's bun
Come let us see
Customers are coming in car to our shop
"Welcome, What do you want?"
Three packets of 'Murukku'
One packet of 'Kamarkattu'
Does this look like a snack bar to you?
Is this not a petty shop?
Look behind Kamatchi Silver Sales
Will you open only on Friday?
"OK, note down the list 1 kilo toe rings, 3/4 kilo nose screws and 1/4 kilo ear rings"
"Look, this contains Acid"
If I splashed it on your face It will be a bloodbath
Who are you and what do you want?
We have moved to the opposite house
I am Kanmani And she is Neelaveni
I am Thankam Will roar like a lion
But will look ugly
They deliberately pick up quarrel on arrival
"Mani, does it take so much time for shopping?"
I told you not to call me with the masculine name Mani
You have pierced my nose also at an young age
If you don't like it Remove the nose screw
But how can I close the hole?
Close it with calcium
If you call me Mani again I won't mind you are my mom
-I will punch you
-Will you?
Invite neighbours for tomorrow's house warming
So you did three tours in Afghanistan and you were wounded in the Kunar province.
"- Yes, ma'am."
- You received a Silver Star for pulling a Corporal Dawson from a burning Humvee?
There was an IED attack.
"Humvee flipped, we were taking fire, so I grabbed him."
- Why?
- I was a little concerned that he was getting a little too warm in there.
"It's funny to me, you still think glib is the way to go here."
Corporal Dawson is the nephew of the speaker of the house and when you were discharged a year ago he got you a job with the Capitol Police.
"Actually, on his protection detail."
If Special Agent Todd keeps making those sounds I'm gonna start looking at him.
"- Will you give us a second, please, Ryan?"
"John, why do you want to be in the Secret Service?"
I can't think of a more important job than protecting the president.
"Okay, this job requires a university degree."
You dropped out of GW after our first semester there.
- You don't finish things.
"- Check the file, Carol."
Two years in college night school.
A certificate of graduation should be in there.
Great.
"Yeah, John, you barely maintained a C average."
"I'm sorry, I didn't have our little study sessions like we used to back in the day, did I?"
Evaluations from your senior officers:
"""Cale frequently does not complete his field reports on time."""
Nothing to do with protecting someone.
"""Sergeant Cale demonstrates a lack of respect for authority."
"Sergeant Cale has raw potential but seems determined not to realise it."""
You can keep reading that.
That is not me anymore.
I'm not the kid you used to know in college.
I've buttoned up every single thing that I have to to qualify for this job.

- yea thanks oh yeah can you check the leak in the kitchen?
huh?
I think the perspective was very clear.
"And, also, I should say that..."
What was the title of it again?
I'll be honest.
That's not the main reason I'm here.
"Thank God, because honestly, I don't even think I've read yours yet."
"Or any of them, for that matter, so don't be offended."
I was hoping you could provide me with a letter of recommendation for an internship I'm pursuing at Paragon Press.
Okay.
Is that not possible?
"Look, I'll say this, and then we can proceed accordingly."
"Number one, internships are a waste of time, so you shouldn't bother."
"Two, that company sucks, and you wouldn't gain any worthwhile experience there."
"And three, I don't actually think that I know you very well..."
"Or at all, now that I think about it."
So I wouldn't be the best person to sing your praises.
Where does that leave us on the whole letter of recommendation tip?
I think they can be somewhat generic.
It's kind of a formality anyway.
Nah.
Does your publisher have an internship program?
"To be honest with you, I have no idea."
I'm not thinking about this right now.
Here's a piece of paper with some staples in it.
Wish I could be of more help.

Do I hear the thundering crash of a Laurasaurus on the rampage?
Laurasaurus was about to go on a rampage...
Yeah?
"But then she was distracted by the deep, musky scent of a T.Rex on the hunt."
"T.Rex forgot all about his prey... and gently, firmly... took hold of the Laurasaurus... in his powerful jaws..."

"Haskell DeBray's coworkers are in shock, describing him as quiet but fiercely loyal."
"Serena, since when do you watch the news?"
"They're releasing Jesse's new video today, and I thought maybe they'd show some of it."
"Well, how about this?"
"While we're waiting for the video to drop, remember, before Christmas, those Mexican hotchocolate cookies we were supposed to make, only somebody was, um, too busy at work?"
"Today, we are going to bake enough cookies to make Santa Claus beg us to stop."
Hoho!
Captain Kendra Sarneau was quick to give credit to the coroner at the scene.
Up.
You've always hated me.
"The confession, sewn into DeBray's jacket, revealed that he had been targeting mothers who had, in his view, abandoned their children."
"Records now confirm that several of his victims had, in fact, given their children up for adoption."
This is when Ruby finds out the teacher she loves is a killing machine.
This is when a normal uncle would drop in on his niece.
"Well, there'd be drawing instead of math and tree climbing instead of sports and..."
"No, they'd never have that."
"No, go ahead, say it."
"I can't say ""have the hots for Miss Braund,"" can I?"
That he favored Miss Braund and she should now reciprocate by agreeing.
"Now that his ship has come in,"
Sir Jeremy could have his pick of the women round the table.
But he remains steadfast.
"And for the penniless Miss Braund, this is, indeed, good news."
"I find him more and more endearing just because he's being himself and he's just being so sweet, yeah, I think if you persevere you can get what you want."
"I think there is something to maybe marrying your best friend, someone you can completely rely on, who will be there for you no matter what, who's not going to disappear at the first sign of trouble,"
who is going to be genuinely concerned about you.
"So, um... and I think Captain Glover has all of those qualities."
Ask you all to raise your glasses and toast Sir Jeremy.
Sir Jeremy.
Thank you.
Alias Captain Glover.
"Indeed, mate."
It's the last week of the Regency house party.
"Two months ago, our modern-day guests arrived hoping to find love, Regency style."
This is their last chance to form an attachment.
"In Regency terms, the glamorous but hard-up Mr. Carrington needs a wealthy wife to secure his place in society."
"Sneaking into the lady's quarters, he's risking expulsion to make his move."
Thought I'd do a warm gesture for a very special girl.
I think this might be something that would really make her day.
"It's kind of cool, isn't it?"
Bit of a path.
"I've said, ""You are..."
"""a... truly... special..."
"person."""
The lady in Mr. Carrington's sights is industrial heiress Miss Hopkins.
Her money would have made her a prize catch for any Regency gentlemen.
"As far as my feelings towards Miss Hopkins goes,"
I don't think they've changed at all.
"I'm still very attracted to her,"
I wish I could know where you go every day
Thank God you're my sister and not my wife
"It's daytime, so where am I going to go?"
To the office
- You look like you want something
- Of course...
"While you're walking around like always, checking out women..."
"Enough, Dawlat"
"I'm your sister, Zaki your sister, I know exactly what you do every day"
- What do you want?
"- My diamond ring... is being fixed by Papazian the jeweler, go pick it up"
"OK, the first thing I do today will be to get the ring... and I'll pay for it, too"
"- How are you, Mondy?"
"- Good morning, Zaki Pasha"
- Zaki Pasha
"- Hello, Hassouna, what's wrong?"
- My affairs aren't quite right
- What affairs?
"THE affairs, and you know everything, Pasha"
"I've been married for one month, but I feel like I'm not quite right"
At your age?
There must be something wrong?
Any problems?
No one doesn't have problems
"I'm talking about your problems, forget other people's problems"
"I'm in debt to some annoying people who don't stop asking and my boss fired me, and I don't know hwy in addition to my mother-in-law who's staying with us and my sister is divorced with 3 kids"
All these problems and you want to be OK with your wife?
"- No way, that's impossible"
"- I was thinking if you... had one of those pills, they told me that it..."
What?
Using pills at your age is certain suicide
"Listen, all the pills and creams in the world won't help you"
- I probably shouldn't get drunk.
I'll just start crying.
I feel obliged to say thank you for all the kind words.
Now I'm not the type that likes to hear my own voice   in such a well filled room.
But I am turning 48 after all.
"And there was so much I didn't manage to say when I turned 40   and much has happened since, so I think it's reasonable   that I be allowed to steal ten minutes of your precious time."
Because it is.
Time is precious.
The years have taught me that.
Helene...
I could stand here and brag about you for hours.
But don't worry.
I know you don't want me to.
"But I will say, that even though you can't always feel it -"
- I am extremely happy that you're with me.
"You are night and day, the heaven and the seas for me."
The time I'm with you and our wonderful children   confirms exactly what I would have said.
"Every acquaintance, every friend, every person   who has a place in your heart..."
It is the time with them   that really means something.
Nothing else matters.
"Apart from the firm, of course."
We've expanded a lot recently.
"We will continue to far into the future, I hope."
"Already today, cranes stand in London, New York and Singapore."
It shouldn't be long before we can sleep in our own buildings   when we visit Houston and Manila...
I'll anticipate things a little and invite you all to the opening   of our new headquarters in Singapore on January 5th next year.
"I'm sure my ten minutes are up, but I am very grateful to you   for wanting to spend the day with me."
And I would like to propose a toast to the future.
Cheers!
Jorgen?
I talked to the boys' teacher about separating them after the holidays   and moving Morten into a different class.
It sounded quite reasonable.

Heisenberg.
Werner Heisenberg was arrested by American forces on May 3rd 1945.
Germany surrendered 4 days later.
Heisenberg and 9 other German scientists were interrogated by MI6 near London.
"Welcome to London, Mr. Heisenberg."
"I'm Major Julie Smith, Special Operations Executive."
I'm in charge of the debriefing of the German atomic program.
If you care to follow me.
He reunited with his family in Germany 8 months later.
"Werner Heisenberg carried on as a scientist and died in 1976, 71 years old."
"It's a great pleasure, on behalf of Hydro,  to be able to give to the Homefront four million kroner."
Norsk Hydro kept producing and selling heavy water until 1988.
"The company today has 13,000 employees and an annual revenue of roughly 65 billion kroner."
This TV-series is based on true events.
Some of the depicted events have been dramatized and simplified.
"Likewise, some of the depicted characters are fictive."
We have Simenon on radio and Haukelid with two local guys to execute the mission.
"They will place 19lbs of high explosives below deck, something which ought to create an 11-square-foot hole."
"The ferry with all its cargo should go down in less than five minutes, too fast to get to shore before it sinks."
Right.
"Another attempt, another blast, another fuckload of people die."
That's war.
There's a price to pay for success.
"But how successful were we, really?"
We lost 41 men with Freshman.
"We sabotaged the factory only to have the Germans rebuild it in two months, then listened to the Yanks and bombed the entire valley."
All right.
And now... .. we're about to blow up a passenger ferry.
Very successful.
"It's war, Julie, you told me."
I have many memories here good and bad.
I never felt like I really belonged in Hollywood.
"At that time, they didn't quite know what to do with me, a black performer."
"So I usually just came on, sang a song and made a quick exit."
It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy things
"This was true of my first film in the studio, Panama Hattie."
"Yeah, I got to sing a great Cole Porter tune in a featured appearance but what I really wanted was to be given an acting role in the movies."

Just one of those things

"Catholics became a majority on the Privy Council,"
Catholics were appointed to the control of royal burghs.
Little was lacking from James's victory.
Only the United Societies remained.
He set a price on Renwick's head by proclamation.
"£100, dead or alive."
It was clear to Renwick what his God required of him.
"He would preach in the fields outside Edinburgh, he would even enter the city itself."
He would make it easy for the King's men to find him.
The authorities entered the house he was staying in.
"Renwick shot one of them, escaped, but couldn't or wouldn't run."
"He walked this far, to Castle Wynd, where he was captured."
He was too important a prize for simple execution.
"For two weeks, the authorities attempted to extract from him a confession that he had never done God's work."
This proved impossible.
His execution was finally fixed for February 17th 1688.
"On the scaffold, Renwick spoke for King Jesus at considerable length."
He recited Psalm 103.
"""The Lord has established His throne in Heaven, and His kingdom rules over all."""
"He read from Revelations, Chapter 19."
"""Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God,"
"""that ye may eat the flesh of kings."""
"And he concluded, ""Lord, I die in the faith that you will not leave Scotland,"
"""but that you will make the blood of your witnesses the seed of your Church,"
"""and return again and be glorious in our land."
"""And now, Lord, I am ready."""
Renwick's death made James feel safe.
He could ignore the Covenant.
"He was anointed by God, an absolute monarch, unchallenged."
And then he did what his brother had failed to do - he secured the future of the Stuart dynasty.
"On the 10th of June of that year, the King's wife gave birth to a healthy male heir, James Francis Edward."
A rhyme began to do the rounds.
Is this biriyani called milk cake?

Shouldn't they make biriyani as milk cake?

"When the King's head fell, the old world ceased to be."
It went mad.
The people were horrified by what Cromwell's faction had done.
$0 the English Parliament abolished monarchy.
"If there was no king, there was no crime."
They had beheaded a nobody.
No-one had asked the Scots if th ey wanted their king beheaded.
"Their Covenant needed a king, like King David in the Bible."
Their Covenant needed his signature.
A dead king could sign nothing.
"So within a week of the King's execution, they declared his son Charles king instead."
The 20-year-old Charles returned from France to take the throne.
It was imperative that he sign the Covenant.
"His ship arrived in the mouth of the Spey, in the north east, in June."
"It anchored, and before he had had a chance to set foot on land, commissioners went on board, presented him with a copy of the Covenant, and required his signature."
He signed.
Because he had to.
"But in Cromwell's world, there could be no kings."
"As long as there were kings, he was a regicide, a king-killer, which meant that Cromwell had a bone or two to pick with the Scots."
"In July of 7650, Cromwell came north."
"At first, his campaign went badly."
"He was forced back to Dunbar, his back to the sea."
One last push would secure his total defeat.
The Protesters mustered their army in Leith.
It was more than double the size of Cromwell's force.
"The godliest of the godly, Warriston amongst them, chose this moment to insist that the army be purged of its ungodly elements."
"The ungodly elements, tended, by and large, to be the professional soldiers upon whom the army's success had depended."
"""God can do much with a few,"" said Warriston."
He was right.
But God chose to do it for the other side.
"One morning in September, Cromwell broke out of Dunbar at dawn, killed 4,000, took 10,000 prisoner, and put the rest of the Covenanting army to flight."
It became one of Cromwell's most famous victories.
"It has the same handmade feel, too."
There are squeaks and rattles.
But there is one big difference.
"The normal Vauxhall VX, the 220, has a 2.2 litre engine which is fine in a ham sandwichy way but in this, they've added pickle."
"The engine is smaller, just two litres, but it has a turbo charger."
That means 200bhp.
"So, this may be a bit heavier than an Elise, thanks to its airbag and its anti-lock brakes and its soundproofing and turbo."
But it is hugely fast!
I like the feel of acceleration.
"There's a cosiness as your internal organs are marshalled by the G-forces into a little puddle in your spine, but in this, it's like you're being electrocuted."
0-60 takes four seconds.
It keeps on kicking you in the back of the head with its million-volt shoes all the way to 150.
Wicked!
It's so quick that on the press launch in Spain four of them were crashed by journalists.
There was a rustle in the hedgerow.
Remember when Marks and Spencer's launched that range of underwear that was seethrough and boudoirish?
This car is as big a departure for Vauxhall as those knickers were for MS.
Really.
And you know what?
We haven't even got to the best bit yet - its handling!
"I drove an Elise round this track in the last series, and I know I've got fingers of butter and fists of ham, but it really was understeery and this just isn't."
"Miles of oversteer, you can get it up to the limit and just hold it there."
Love it!
Brilliant.
One thing'll get me off this racetrack - if it runs out of fuel.
That's the first time I've thought that while behind the wheel of a Vauxhall.
"Lotus has responded to this car with a 190 Elise that we saw earlier in the programme, but that cost £33,000 - £8,000 more than this."
This has an airbag and is more comfortable.
I do believe this is the sports car of the moment.
"I'll give anyone a fiver if they can find the word ""Vauxhall"" written anywhere on it."
One more test.
The Stig.
You sound like Fireman Sam.
"""Great fires of London."""

Can you tell me about creamed spinach?
What's your relationship with creamed spinach?
I told a ridiculous lie for no reason.
"Most lies benefit someone... and it's one of those things, my ex-boyfriend's parents came round for dinner"
"- I'm still very good friends with him, and I was very honest and I said, ""Oh, no, I've just bought all this"
"""from Marks', I'm going to put it all in the oven""."
"I'm not a liar, normally!"
"And they were like, ""Oh, all right""."
"And then as I served it up, everything I served up, my ex-boyfriend's mum said, ""Oh, did you make this yourself?"""
"And I said, ""No, no, I didn't""."
"And then I served another thing up, she said, ""Did you make the carrots?"
"This is lovely"", and I went, ""No, it's still Marks'."
"""Everything is still..."
"It's all from Marks'""."
"And the last thing I served up was creamed spinach and she went,"
"""This is delicious, did you make this?"""
"And it wound me up so much and I don't know why I said, ""No,"
"""my flatmate made it"", which doesn't benefit me, doesn't make me look better, it's just sort of saying, ""I know someone who cooks""."
"And she was like, ""Oh, that's lovely""."
My flatmate wasn't in and she was my best friend.
"So we have this dinner, all the while I'm going to the kitchen, texting my best friend and my flatmate going, ""Please call me,"
"""don't come back yet, you need to know how to cook creamed spinach""."
"""Go learn how to cook it""."
"And then she doesn't text back, she doesn't call me, and then I hear the keys in the door and genuinely, I get like perve-lip, you know when you sweat so much..."
"I was terrified, she came in and was like, ""Hey""."
"I was like, ""Hey, how you doing?"" and she didn't even make eye contact with me, and she was like, ""Hello, hello."""
"And it was about five minutes, all of, like, talking like this and then my ex-boyfriend's mum went,"
they collect wines they have a lot so they said please have some while waiting serious?

Scotland had missed their king.
They'd missed his father James as well.
"After all, the Stuart dynasty might now be in charge of all three kingdoms, but it was Scotland that they came from."
"And now, here Charles was, processing down the Royal Mile towards his palace at Holyrood."
The crowds were cheering.
The Scots were pleased to see him... because they hadn't seen him before.
"Charles was ignorant of everything that mattered to his Scottish subjects, especially the Presbyterian Kirk."
It might have helped to meet some of its members.
"Someone, for instance, like Archibald Johnston of Warriston, a deeply religious young lawyer."
Warriston was as sure as his fellow Presbyterians that the Scottish Church was the closest to perfection on Earth.
"But equally certain that it was still sinful, because it was made of human beings, and humans fall short."
King Jesus is the perfect one.
King Jesus supplies the grace and mercy that we lack.
"King Charles, on the other hand, chose his first visit to Scotland to show that grace was not his strong point."
"The Scots had made plans for the coronation, but Charles rewrote them."
"He would not be visiting Scone, with its charmless and poky chapel."
"He would have the service here, in Holyrood Abbey, with suitable pomp."
"And the coronation service would be Anglican, conducted by an English priest."
A Scottish minister simply wouldn't do.
Clumsy.
But Charles sincerely believed he was God's anointed king.
"He sincerely believed that his Church, the Anglican Church, worshipped God correctly and that the Presbyterian Church did not."
A shiver ran down the spines of Scotland 's Presbyterians.
The King had forced change on their Church once before.
"Charles 's father had imposed bishops on them, but to the Presbyterians, every soul was equal."
Bishops were distasteful.
"The King's task was to defend the Church, not define it."
But it would take more than courage to say no to the King.
"Warriston kept a diary, a window into the mind of a man who would do just that."
"So, this is all diary in here?"

between children when they leave they make a lot of promises adults just leave without saying anything and praying for the other person's welfare
so yea...
Fujii-san won't choose Ishida Yuya

I understand the feelings you put in to writing these words
Good luck
You don't like work it's not work you like you like being alone

Only Stirling and Berwick castles remained in English hands.
Edward II began raising an army to reconquer Scotland.
"Edward mustered his forces at Berwick on 1 0th June - 1 5,000 footsoldiers, between 2,500 and 3,000 horse."
Edward's nobles were mostly absent and they hadn't sent as many knights as he would have liked either.
"So not exactly a vote of confidence then, but no matter."
Edward had more than enough confidence in himself to make up the shortfall.
They rode north.
"The Scottish forces mustered in the Tor Wood, south of Stirling."
The numbers bore no comparison.
"500 light horse, about 6,000 foot."
But size isn't everything.
"By now, the Bruce's army was used to war."
The men were used to each other.
"His brother Edward, James the Black Douglas,"
"Thomas Randolph, the Earl of Moray, were experienced, battle-hardened men."
"And the footsoldiers of the Scottish army had learnt to fight in schiltroms - packed together in close order, with spears and shields permanently presented."
"Like tanks, but made of human bodies."
"By Saturday 22nd June, the Bruce had chosen where to fight."
He'd had a lot of practice by now.
"He chose wisely - the edges of New Park, near the Bannock Burn."
"The trees limited cavalry action, and to the southeast, the ground was broken by streams and burns and rills."
"On either side of the road leading to the New Park, the Bruce modified the terrain."
"Just as he had done at Loudoun Hill, he made the ground treacherous for his foes, this time by ordering the digging of innumerable pits, disguised with grass and branches."
These would snap the legs of the English horse.
"The English army itself made camp to the north, and night fell."
"The next morning was a Sunday, so the Scots began it with a mass."
"The Bishop of Dunkeld presided, and when the mass was finished, he will have got his weapons ready."
"This would be the reckoning, the payment."
"For the Bruce had lost brothers and friends, family and priests."
"His wife and daughter, dear to him, had been imprisoned."
And those who gave allegiance to him had lost still more.
"And now, the English King was here, no more than a hundred yards away."
How would I know?
Hey...hey
I forgot to tell him the house is unstable
If your lifting kung fu is no good don't enter
why is there light there?
Let me take a look
what is this place?
It's so beautiful
"Strange, why is the lake water so cold?"
Yet it doesn't freeze
why is this frog red in colour?
And its body is so hot in the cold water
It's bitten me
These red frogs are obnoxious but they will taste good when cooked
"Feels so good, a warm current is running through my body"
Could it be because I've eaten these frogs
So hot
"You fool, you should know you can't win so you should stay out of trouble"
"Look, you've been bitten all over"
"Come, I'll get you some medicine"
So it's even more beautiful by day
"A pity there're cliffs every where, no escape route!"
what's the matter?
what's up in the tree?
In the tree
The Jiu Yang creed
Jiu Yang Creed is the martial arts world's treasure
It was originally in Shaolin
But 90 years ago when hero Guo Jing was the martial arts world's leader the villains wan Si Hak and Siu Seung Ji sneaked into Shaolin and stole the creed but they were discovered by Monk Guo Yuen and were pursued to the peak of Hua San
They knew they couldn't get away so they placed the creed on a baboon
After the two men died
The baboon carried the creed to a far away place and ultimately buried it here
Who... who... who told you that?
"Uh, yes, he did try and kiss me."
Stop it.
"But, you know, he's a very tactile person, anyway."
So this whole hands-off stuff doesn't seem to work with Captain Glover.
"No, he's, um, yes, twice, actually."
"At one point Mrs. Hammond did turn round and went, ""Are you kissing Captain Glover?"""
"And I was like, ""No, he's trying to kiss me."""
"Captain Glover has paid special attention to Miss Braund, a lady of modest means."
"With his prize money, of which she is unaware, he would be an excellent catch for her, but Miss Braund's affections have lain elsewhere."
"I really used to like Mr. Everett and I know that he really liked Victoria, and there was a whole kind of triangle thing going on and Victoria was trying to get me and Mr. Everett together."
I really had a crush on him.
"I thought, ""My God, this guy is amazing."""
"Now I just think, no, he's a really nice bloke."
But there's nothing more.
"Although it's really quite funny because, uh, me and Captain Glover had an argument just after the Mr. Everett thing."
"He did actually turn around to me and went, ""Why can't you just get over Everett?"
"Why can't you just get over him, and fancy me?"""
"I went, ""That would make it so much simpler, Captain Glover."
"The life would be much simpler if I could just fancy you."""
"We parted, and we weren't speaking very much the next day, and I think he winked across the table at me, and I thought, ""Okay, we're back to being friends again."""
"I think he's absolutely lovely and we're really, really good friends."
"So part of me just thinks, oh, why don't you fancy him?"
He's so nice to me.
"Come on, Geoff."
So is Miss Braund reconsidering her feelings for the tenacious Glover?
"The day after the fair, as the ladies are eating luncheon, the atmosphere is tense."
"For some weeks, there has been growing hostility between the hostess, Mrs. Rogers, and chaperone Mrs. Enright."
"Mrs. Enright, with her charge, Miss Conick, form the lowest ranking pair in the house."
She is the least important lady here.
"Her charge is the least important one, and she would be bending over backwards not to cause offense to me because she wants to stay here."
Because she just pisses me off.
Nice to meet you
"Listen, Abd Rabbu, first of all, I'm not just anyone secondly, no one can see us, here, don't upset me"
"But this is a lot, no one does anything like this"
I do this
I like to make people happy
"May God bring you happiness, sir"
"When you know me better, you'll be sure"
"God bless you, sir"
"Where have you been, Pasha?"
"- Good evening, Dawlat - ""Good evening, Dawlat""!"
What is it with you?
Do you think you live in a hotel?
Wait and talk to me
"- Yes, Dawlat?"
- Do you know what time it is?
I've been sitting here worried about you for 4 hours
- Do you think I'm a little boy?
- Am I going to worry about you...
- or about the diseases I have?
- I'm tired and I want to rest
"You're tired, Pasha?"
Tired from what?
From running after cheap women in the streets and dirty bars?
"At least think about your age, you shameless man"
"You have one foot in the grave, Zaki"
"Think about God in your last days and you'll be crazy if you think that there is one woman... who can actually like you, you dirty old lecher"
"Open the door, don't let me break it on your head"
You've dirtied your family history and ruined your father's reputation
"Open up, I want my diamond ring"
- What are you doing here so early?
- I'm waiting for you
"I was wrong, Taha but you have to understand"
Black and white Wrong and right
They call me two-faced woman
"In the early 1940s Hollywood began a fascination with things tropical and south of the border, and MGM was no exception."
Exotic rhythms and costumes transported audiences away from cold climates and the troubled times of a world war.
Many Latin artists were recruited to add an authentic sound to these films.
One of the most popular was Xavier Cugat and his orchestra.
"Ricardo Montalban became a sensation at Metro as the Latin lover, driving female audiences wild."
Here with Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse from The Kissing Bandit there doesn't seem to be enough Ricardo to go around.
From Nancy Goes to Rio comes the Brazilian bombshell herself:
The incomparable Carmen Miranda.
He's got the kind of appeal That turns your head like a wheel
And what a wonderful feeling That feeling you feel
Your heart will beat like a bongo
Just like was beating in mine
The heat of the sun may be 101
But you make it 109 And there is more to it yet
I'm gonna bet you a bet That you can pack up and go
But you'll never forget
"Carmen, of course, had her imitators but none quite like Mickey Rooney in Babes on Broadway."
"Hey, Ma"
It seems we've stood and talked
Like this before
One ofthe performers at MGM whom I admired the most was the legendary Lena Horne.
But I can't remember where
Or when
Some things that happen
For the first time
Seem to be happening again
It was a long time ago I stood in this very spot and recorded that lovely song.
When I first walked onto this recording stage in 1942 it looked pretty much as it does today.
Although the technology was prehistoric...
I recorded all of the music for my movies here and it is still considered Hollywood's greatest recording stage.
everything is quite heightened.
"I played bim very, very down under everytbing else being sort of operatic."
"Instinctively, Eastwood knew what to give Leone."
"He gave Him a myth, an archetype a figure who would be both more and less than Human."
Eastwood placed His performance not in words but in movement and gesture.
"For more than a decade in tHe business, Eastwood Had learned to Hold back to create a sense of mystery around Himself."
It was as if He said to His audience¸:
"""l'm no longer going out to meet you."
"""From now on, you come to me. """
Clint Eastwood was 36 years old and His career was about to begin.
clint said wben be was leaving:
"""I've done tbree of tbese movies..."
"""...and I'm going bome now and I'm going to bave my own...."
"""I'm going to do it myself."""
"And I tbougbt: ""Tbat's smart."""
"Back in tHe States, many critics dismissed the Italian Westerns as cynical and mindlessly violent."
And Eastwood was attacked for seeming cold and inexpressive a killer without scruples.
"But the public knew that something different Had come on the scene an action Hero who wasn't buying the old myths who was wised up, street-smart and dangerous."
"WHen He returned to Hollywood as a star, His agents and managers urged Him to build a career as a conventional leading man in studio pictures."
But Eastwood Had something else in mind.
Unlike the stars of the studio era He would not be a passive participant in His own career.
I came back....
I was offered a big film called McKenna's Gold a big expensive extravaganza.
"My agents wanted me to do it in tbe worst way but I never liked it, never liked tbe script."
"But I wanted to do this thing, Hang 'Em Higb."
We formed Malpaso and just went ahead and did that instead.
WHen Eastwood set up Malpaso He created the production company that remains His Home today.
Malpaso allowed Him to take control of His image.
THe second movie I made back in tHe States was Coogan's bluff.
I was looking for somebody new tbat migbt be an interesting cboice as a director.
"And I said¸: ""Well, they keep talking about a guy named Don Siegel. """
So I went back and I looked at some Siegel films.
"- Bring it yourself, Suad"
"Of course, Mr Selim"
In the name of God
- Is this your daughter?
- My daughter!
"She's an employee, my daughter is still in prep school"
"In the name of God, she must be your secretary"
"We don't have secretaries and all that, Hajj"
- Mrs Suad is very energetic
- She's a Mrs?
"And she has a boy about 6 or 7 years old her husband went to work in Iraq, He died there"
- God rest his soul
- I've no idea how he died
"= Here you go, Hajj A'azam"
- Thank you very much
I'll go make your coffee myself
- But with very little sugar
- At your service
"What is it, Hajj?"
There are pretty faces that give you a feeling of comfort
She looks decent
"You have a high average,"
Why'd you choose the police academy over other colleges?
"- To serve my country, sir"
- Even the engineering graduate...
- can serve his country
"- Of course, sir but if everyone serves in his field, his service will be better"
"Good, what are the characteristics of a good police officer?"
"Discipline, a sense of justice, determination, honor and above all, he must be humane in all his actions"
What does your father do?
"He's an employee, sir"
- An employee or a doorman?
"Well, yeah, I was in Tesco, I'd done some really great shopping and I was on the phone to my flatmate and I was like,"
"""Have we got enough margarine?"""
"And then, suddenly, I got whacked across my face, it knocked the phone out of my hand, and I couldn't understand what had happened,"
I thought someone had started on me.
"So, I sort of looked up and then there were four 14-year-old girls running away going, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"", and I almost never lose my temper - I'm a very placid person - but I lost my rag, so I started chasing them, but I'd been shopping"
"for like an hour, so I had loads of stuff, so I couldn't get up a decent amount of speed."
"But then as I was chasing them, which was more for show, really,"
"I was thinking to myself, ""I don't know what my options are,"
"""cos if I catch them, what am I..."
I give them a talking-to?
"""That made me feel very...very unsettled""."
"So I was running round with all this shopping, thinking,"
"""What am I actually going to say?"""
"And then I heard a lot of laughing from behind me and this girl's going, ""What are you going to do, what are you going to do?"""
and I turned round - and this shows how slowly I was running - cos she was actually in a wheelchair...
"..and she was going, ""I know them, what are you going to do when you catch up with them?"""
"And I was like, ""Well, I haven't decided yet but I'm going to tell them I was very unsettled by their prank""."
So then I chased them round the big Tesco in Cardiff for about what felt like half an hour.
"It was like a sort of Benny Hill but, you know, meets 999."
"And then they left and then I got on with my shopping and then I went to the counter, I felt very...still a bit troubled and the lady behind the counter said, ""Do you know them?"""
"And I said, ""Who?"""
"And she pointed, and they were all by the window going, ""Ha-ha-ha!""."
"So, yeah, that's happy slapping, it's a really fun game."
Did you ever see the little video they made of you?
"No, I didn't, Alan, not that I looked for it every day for about two years."
But I turned like a sort of 1970s West Walian head teacher.
"I was saying things like, ""Just you wait!"
"""Just you wait!"
"""I'm going to give you such a stern talking-to,"
"""And I hope you're proud of yourself,"
"""you've brought shame on yourself, your school, your family!"","
"I was doing all of that, I was 23."
"Oh, absolutely, they did, yeah."
"I was relieved when it happened because I knew something bad was going to happen and I was like, ""Oh, this is so great""."
"I remember being in jail in a wheelchair and covered in blood, and thinking, ""OK, now everybody knows"", and that's what I needed at the time and so that did the trick."
Were you doing stand-up at the time?
"No, in fact, it was only after that."
"It was about a year after that that I was like...was able to be like,"
"""You know what I really want to do"
"""now that I'm not in a wheelchair any more is stand-up""."
That was not...
"No pun intended, that would be a terrible joke, I would never...."
This lot loved it.
"I feel guilty, I want to, like, suck the laugh back out of you."
What were you doing for a living when you were drinking?
"I had several jobs, I worked in a warehouse and baby-sat, of course."
"Worked in a warehouse, baby-sat and catered, and in fact, the thing you said about me, the Lionel Richie thing, I was catering at a tiny party and there were like ten guests at the party,"
one of whom was Lionel Richie.
It was like a billionaire who was having the party and they had...
"It was a Moroccan-themed party, even though nobody there was Moroccan, it was, like, old, doddering white ladies in fezzes and Lionel Richie."
"And they had a little Moroccan band playing and the host of the party was like, ""Lionel, why don't you get up there and play with the band?"""
"And Lionel was like, ""No""."
"And then he was like, ""Come on"", and Lionel was like, ""OK""."
So he sat down with a three-piece Moroccan band - they really were Moroccan - and he sat down at a piano and they Moroccan'd around him.
And he played Hello.
"There were ten guests, and, like, me and a couple of other waiters and he beautifully played Hello by Lionel Richie and so just because of how few people were in there, several verses were directed right into my soul"
and it was one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me cos he's amazing.
I once was in Van Morrison's toilet...
..at exactly the moment he wanted to use it.
"Oh, wow!"
Yep.
"It was something like that, it was a private thing."
He was being honoured in Dublin.
"I remember, Bob Geldof introduced him and Van was quite happy to accept the honour but he's a notoriously difficult person and I was a big fan - that's why I was there - and earlier that day, he had asked for a 25-piece orchestra,"
No need for that
We're only showing our hospitality
Chief Mouna!
What?
"Chief Mouna, can you tell me something about Japan?"
I know you've been there before
"They have armies, cannons, machineguns airplanes and large steamers in Japan"
There are more Japanese people than the tree leaves in the forest than the pebbles in Jhuoshuei River
I know why you're asking me this
You don't really want to know Japan
All you want is to remind me how powerful the Japanese are
Don't worry.
I'll never forget
Humph!
You Japanese policemen took us on the ship for days to Japan but all they showed us were airplanes and cannons
"However, the policemen in Japan were much nicer and kinder than those of you here"
They feared we'd revolt against them so they tried their best to befriend us
But those of you here in the mountains always provoke us so much that I want to hunt your heads
"Chief Mouna, I'm still a Seediq"
Although I'm now a Japanese policeman
I never forget that the same blood runs in our veins
"Dakis, when you die are you entering a Japanese shrine?"
Or the heavenly home of our ancestors?
I heard that... in the school for savage children you beat up our kids like the Japanese do
I beat them up because
I don't want the Japanese to look down on them
You graduated from Normal School
You're more highly-educated than any other Japanese policemen
But how come you get the lowest salary?
Don't the Japanese look down on you already?
Beating up your own people makes them look down on you even more
During our stay in Japan the Japanese knew all of us chiefs from different clans hated one another but they made us sit together at the dining table deliberately
What happened?
any problems?
The Entire MLA party was caught with prostitutes and the media is in a frenzy

"In the middle of May, it was officially acknowledged... that the secret services existed."
And responsibility for anti-terrorist operations... was transferred from the Special Branch to Ml5.
"From its new headquarters on Millbank, a tunnel was being built... beneath the river to that of Ml6 at Vauxhall."
The cost of which had by then risen to ?
240 million... equivalent to that of eight new general hospitals.
"It seemed that every day, we were faced with some new reminder... of the absurdity of our circumstances."
"Sunday, May 31 was the 50th anniversary... of the allied bombing raid on Cologne in 1942."
"It was also the birthday of the late Sir Arthur ""Bomber"" Harris... leader of Bomber Command in World War II... the instigator of the saturation bombing of civilian populations in Germany."
"Ignoring protests, including a plea from the mayor of Cologne... the Bomber Command Association assisted by the Ministry of Defence... has gone ahead with its plans for the statue's unveiling."
The Queen Mother was to arrive at 12:00.
"Robinson remembered her in Humphrey Jennings' film... sitting next to Kenneth Clark, the art historian... at a concert by Dame Myra Hess at the National Gallery in 1941."
"As she was speaking, a group of people began shouting..."
"""Murderer, mass murderer!"""
"She hesitated while police suppressed the demonstrators, then carried on."
Robinson said afterwards that throughout the event... he found it impossible to stop thinking about his father.
"But I have never met his father, so I didn't know what he meant."
"On May 28th, the Canary Wharf Development... on the Isle of Dogs had been taken into administration."
Robinson had up to now avoided this project.
"But with its failure, he decided to adopt it... as a monument to Rimbaud in memory of his wanderings in the London docks."
"On June 4th, we passed through Leicester Square again... and found it being officially reopened by the Queen... who was to switch on a new electricity substation which had been built beneath it."
"We heard that earlier, someone in the crowd had shouted:"
"""Pay your taxes, you scum""... but there were no other incidents."
"The next day, we set out on our second expedition."
Wilhelm Kostrowitzky... a young man who later became the poet Guillaume Apollinaire... visited London in 1901.
"He had met an English governess, Annie Playden... while working as a tutor in Germany."
"When she returned to her family's home in Clapham North... he followed, hoping to persuade her to marry him."
The name of Landor was familiar to Apollinaire... from the work of Edgar Allan Poe.
And conjured up an image of idyllic domesticity.
Annie rejected him and emigrated to America... leaving strict instructions that he was never to be told where she had gone.
Robinson was following up a rumour... that Conan Doyle had once lived in the neighbourhood.
But he was unable to contact anyone who could help him.
"At Stockwell, he took me to the bus garage."
uh...
I wanted to ask for a long time what is little red riding hood about?
what?
you don't know?
yes
"ok so little red has 3 versions pero ver., grim ver., and now-a-day ver."
"the most famous is this, grim ver."
grim once upon a time there was a girl named little red and she had to go to her grandma's house but the wolf gets there first and eats grandma he ate her?
and then little red arrives but the wolf pretending to be grandma eats little red he eats her again is this everything you ordered?
"and then a hunter realizes the wolf ate them and he cuts his stomach and finds the two of them how's that possible, that's messed up but it's a fairy tale they're all like that, a little scary and reaching the truth of things"
there are explanations that it represents women who are single single woman?
"in some kind of country, women who weren't married had to wear a red hair thing and as this story says if a young girl is walking by herself she'll be eaten by a wolf or more like a guy, so be careful"
a guy eats her?
what a good story it's deep
can I ask you?
what?
about your relationship
I kind of understand what happened between you two and that it still continues
but I won't look into it it must be complicated
but from now on
"what you are doing now I want to know with him, what are you gonna do?"

The role of Dawlat was played by Isa'ad Younis
"In 1937, the chief Armenian in Egypt, Hagoub Yacoubian, built... a residential building and named it after his name"
The style was European and the architect was Italian
And the Armenian gentleman was so fond of it... that he wrote his name in Latin on the inside of the entrance
"When the building was still new, it had residents such as... ministers, high ranking Pashas and foreigners there were even Jews, two of them were from the Nosseir family"
"The building's roof was vast, it had a room for the doorman... and a room for each apartment for laundry and storage... and related things"
Everything was beautiful the country looked beautiful and the building was beautiful
"The revolution broke out, ending the era of the Pashas and the 1956 war was the beginning of the end for foreigners and Jews"
Apartments that became vacant after their owners left the country were taken by high ranking officers in the army... whose wives never forgot their passion for raising poultry and it was OK for the rooms to be residence for the maids
"and of course, the whole makeup of the residents changed"
"Along with the openness system, the streets started to change"
Stores changed their type of business and people changed as well
Just as the officers' moving into the building ruined it... their leaving it totally destroyed it
"They'd become rich and had moved to Mohandessin and Nasr City and the building became available to anyone with money and of course, the whole makeup of the residents changed"
"The roof became full, each room had a whole family in it"
Now sit aside.
We do not speak to drunkards at all.
I am a drunkard but not a hen-pecked husband.
How dare you say that to me?
Did you see what he said about you?
I am observing you since some time.
Why are you getting aggressive?
There the ladies have entered the arena.
You too enter the fray.
What are you ranting?
We agreed for this marriage.. ..since we did not know that you are worthless people.
See this sari that you presented.
Please do not tear the sari.
That sari is more than enough for your status.
"Madam, past is past."
Please keep quiet now.
"Who are you to speak in between, you bald fellow?"
How dare you speak to me like that?
If not a bald fellow we will call you a rotten fellow.
"Teacher, bald is better than rotten."
Oh!
Is that so?
Why dont you say loudly so that all can hear?
All of you please listen!
"My teacher is bald, not rotten."
"My dear bride, why dont you patch up for what happened.. ..by saying sorry to the groom once?"
You shut up.
Will a sorry nullify everything they did?
"Look sir, will you accept it if the girl you love insults you.. ..in front of all and then say sorry?"
I will not.
Every time this bus puncture at this place.
Is this a hotel?
Why not using it ?
"For too long, we are the laughing stock of Horizon 1.0."
We have an opportunity to regain our dignity.
We can't control it !
"Artheon is right, we can't use it !"
We have to sale it at the auction house.
"No, the cheated staff must be destroyed."
"Bandaid, delete it !"
"No, I don't want to."
It'll be a waste !
Imagine how much we could earn if...
"Delete it, if not I will kick you out from the guild !"
"Ho, dictator, tyrant, fascist, communist !"
OK...
But it's really not fair at all...
"Obviously, this cheated staff is indestructible."
"I'm the only one who can destroy it, or a game master, maybe."
"But for that, he will have to delete the avatar of the owner with it."
On no.
"The staff cannot be destroyed, by any craft we here posses."
"So let's sale it, it's the only solution."
Let us use it !
"With it, even Bandaid will be usefull."
"I say it again, this item is a gift."
We have one solution left.
"We have to bring it into the Vulca earth, and throw it into the endless abyss fault of the Arks."
What ?
This zone is only available from the level 45.
Every player falling into the Arks fault will for ever lose one of his items.
It's the biggest penalty in the game.
We just have to throw in Bandaid until his cheated staff disapears.
"No, this is crap, in that case, we can call a game master right now !"
Twist bubbles of the same about two inch size.
Twist a chain of two pink bubbles.
Twist a gray bubble.
I didn't twist one pink bubble.
OK.
Now we good.
Lock the free end of the seventh gray bubble with the free end of the eighth pink bubble.
Twist the seventh yellow and the eighth gray bubble.
Lock the free end of the seventh yellow and eighth gray bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the eighth yellow and the seventh red bubble.
Lock the free end of the seventh red and eighth yellow bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the eighth red bubble.
Lock the free end of the red eighth bubble between the seventh and the eighth pink bubbles.
It's important to make this connection working in the same direction around the row.
Changing the direction will result in making different shape.
We will talk about it in separate instruction.
Or just explore it on your own.
We have made the base of the cabin.
Here is the top view.
The front view.
The side view.
Here is the bottom view.
We have to fix the bottom a little bit latter.
First we will finish the cabin
"Again, there are various ways to do it."
Let's twist ninth bubble of each color.
And we lock free ends of ninth bubbles in one lock twist.
It is a way to make one of the simplest cabins.
Congratulations.
We have made the crane tower with a cabin.
We can cut off the rest of the balloons.
Or we can use remains of the balloons to decorate the crane tower.
combination words?
"So in linear combination words,"
do the linear combinations of the columns fill three dimensional space?
Every b means all the bs in three dimensional space.
Do you see that I'm just asking the same question in different words?
Solving A x -- A x -- that's very important.
"A times x -- when I multiply a matrix by a vector,"
I get a combination of the columns.
I'll write that down in a moment.
"But in my column picture, that's really what I'm doing."
I'm taking linear combinations of these three columns and I'm trying
to find b.
"And, actually, the answer for this matrix"
will be yes.
"For this matrix A -- for these columns, the answer is yes."
This matrix -- that I chose for an example is a good matrix.
A non-singular matrix.
An invertible matrix.
Those will be the matrices that we like best.
There could be other --
"and we will see other matrices where the answer becomes,"
"no -- oh, actually, you can see when it would become no."
What could go wrong?
How could it go wrong that out of these --
out of three columns and all their combinations --
when would I not be able to produce some b off here?
When could it go wrong?
Do you see that the combinations --
let me say when it goes wrong.
If these three columns all lie in
"the same plane, then their combinations will lie in"
that same plane.
There is no problem to convert it back to the flat base.
Use a permanent black marker to draw the face.
You can do it on front side of the base or front side of the cabin.
"Two eyes, nose, big smile."
Simple drawing.
OK.
I am going to cut off funny tails from the top of the crane tower.
It would make the sculpture simpler and our crane more recognizable.
Here is the crane with one funny tail on the top.
Instead of funny tails on the top of the crane.
I am going to twist soft about one inch bubble.
Lock both ends of this bubble in one lock twist.
Cut off the rest of the balloon.
This bubble covers all the knots we have made on the top.
"Congratulations, we have made the crane."
In this instruction we used different color balloons to make the crane.
Here is an example of a crane tower made of four green balloons.
You may notice some minor differences in this sculpture.
The crane's arm has extra bubble.
The cabin is different as well.
I added extra row bubbles to the green tower and the green cabin.
Here is the side view.
Here is the top view.
The front view.
Usually I don't use black marker to make any drawings on dark color balloons.
It is just wasting of your time.
Let me show it to you.
Black is hardly visible on a dark background.
"Anyway, let's finish the face."
We can use technique described in this instruction to make large scale sculptures or parts of large sculptures.
"For example we can use it to make a torso, a leg, an arm, a cake, a vase, a hat and so on."
Have fun and happy twisting :)
There's a kind of a lot going on now with the online and open access.
Right.
Can you say a little bit about what's gonna happen for in the future.
[laugh].
"But you described, [laugh]."
"You know, more, less paper, more electronic, [laugh]."
Publications.
It'll appear faster.
Yeah.
"You know, like e-Pub before, before it appears."
Right.
In the paper version.
There'll be more new journal.
"I keep getting emails from journals that just started up, you know, and they'll make it sound like it's your field."
And there's probably not such great peer review with them.
They wanna.
"This time they might get some known authors and publish but the, I have had a paper."
"You know which was submitted to a journal that's supposed to be peer reviewed and, and the acceptance came back in about five days."
[laugh]
Right.
You know?
"So I don't think it was really peer reviewed I, of course you know I'm biased but I thought it was a decent paper and, but I don't think it got the kind of peer review that papers normally get from good journals."
"Do you think peer reviews going to be, gonna change somewhat in the future because of this proliferation of online journals?"
Say that again.
"Do you think that the peer review process itself is going to change them like, because of the proliferation of online journals?"
"Well, it shouldn't, but it, it might."
I'm not sure how.
Yeah.
"You know, if they're really in a hurry to publish, they might say, you know, get your review back in a week or, you know."
Yeah.
A lot of people just can't do that.
"That fast, yeah."
"No, if we get caught with a cheated item, they're going to delete our avatars without warning."
We have to proceed on our own and in absolute discretion.
"Wait Artheon, you don't get into Vulca that easily."
"It is surrounded by the Lassierra mountains and in this place, there is an evil that never sleep."
"When the mobs see you, they harass you."
"And if somehow we get through this zone, we'll arrive on a devastate and sterile earth,"
"Covered of embers, ashes and dusts."
Even ten thousand players of our level won't handle it.
- It's insane.
"- And if we fail, what will happen ?"
What will happen when the GM will find out that Bandaid help us to rise up our level with a cheated staff given by Tenshirock the hacker ?
They will delete our characters.
"All of them, without distinctions."
"Why are you not listening to me, I told you..."
"Damn woman, did anyone ask you ? it's not like if we care about your opinion !"
"But, I can't believe my own ears."
It's me the boss so...
What kind of organisation it is when everyone does whatever they want ?
The chaos.
Here you see the effect of my evil plan.
"If I give overpowered cheated items to noobs, arguments will start in the groups,"
"The green-eyed monster, the demon of jealousy will tear them apart,"
"And then, bored, disgusted of MMORPG, they will return to the real life."
I'll do it.
I'LL DO IT !!
I'll do it.
I will jump into the Arks fault with the staff.
"If it's the only way to make you stop arguing, so I'll do it for you."
I'll help you carrying your load.
My sword is your's.
OK then.
"Mmm, I won't manage to persuade them right now,"
"Well, now that you do know, would you think it's possible... ...that Emily, in her psychotic state... ...might have activated both sets of vocal cords... ...so as to achieve the amazing effect we heard captured on your audiotape?"
Her state was not psychotic.
"Father Moore, you told us that in the exorcism we heard... ...you actually saw, once again, this black-robed figure... ...or demonic apparition, am I right?"
- Yes.
"But we couldn't see him when you played the tape, correct?"
"- No, of course not."
- Of course not.
"So that would be another supernatural aspect of the exorcism... ...your tape doesn't prove, correct?"
- Yes.
"Where is your dark figure, Father?"
Is he here now?
Do I look like your demon ghost?
- Your Honor.
- Counselor.
I have nothing further.
Does the defense wish to redirect?
"No, Your Honor, but we reserve the right to recall the witness later."
Very well.
The witness may step down.
"Your Honor, my next witness must have been detained."
If we could take a short recess so I could...
"You've made this court wait before, counselor."
I'm inclined to...
"Your Honor, please."
Dr. Cartwright came to us in good conscience... ...as an eyewitness to the exorcism on Father Moore's tape.
He can substantiate all of my client's testimony...
"Your Honor, the defense has already presented its exorcism testimony... ...in dramatic fashion."
Do we really have to..?
We have absorbed some extraordinary testimony today.
I think we'll take some time to consider it.
Court is adjourned until 9:30 tomorrow morning.
- You can't find him?
I've gone from one problem size eight down to eight problems of size one.
At this stage I'm at my singleton case.
So this is easy.
What do I do?
I merge.
"And the merge is, put them in order."
What do I do next?
"Obvious thing, I merge these."
And that as we saw was a nice linear operation.
"It's fun to do it upside down, and then one more merge which is I take the smallest elements of each one until"
I get to where I want.
Wow aren't you impressed.
"No, don't please don't clap, not for that one."
Now let me do it a second time to show you that --
I'm saying this poorly.
Let me say it again.
That's the general idea.
What should you see out of that?
"I just kept sub-dividing down until I got really easy problems, and then I combine them back."
"I actually misled you slightly there or maybe a lot, because"
I did it in parallel.
"In fact, let me just shuffle these up a little bit."
"Really what's going to happen here, because this is a sequential computer, is that we're going to start off up here, at top level, we're going to divide into half, then we're going to do the complete subdivision and merge here before we ever come back and do this one."
We're going to do a division here and then a division there.
"At that stage we can merge these, and then take this down, do the division merge and bring them back up."
Let me show you an example by running that.
I've got a little list I've made here called test.
"Let's run merge sort on it, and then we'll look at the code."
"OK, what I would like you to see is I've been printing out, as I went along, actually let's back up slightly and"
look at the code.
There's merge sort.
Takes in a list.
There's an S in there.
"The sparse diagonal matrix means what you're going to do is, you're going to basically so it's going to be a matrix fulls of zeroes, and you're gonna tell me which diagonals have stuff in'em, and put stuff on those diagonals."
"So, for instance, here's how you might put something in."
"So, first, you tell it."
Let me give you the structure here.
It's going to be an n by n matrix.
Doesn't have to be.
"You can tell it what size it is, but for us it's an n by n."
You tell it the location of where you wanna put this thing.
"So, for instance, if I wanna put something on the diagonal at zero, if I go to the right of the diagonal, it's one, two, three."
"Go to the left, it's negative one, negative two, negative three."
"So your location is predicated off that diagonal, to the right or to the left."
"So if you say zero, and what I'm going to do is put."
Lay down an E1 on that.
So right now what I've made is essentially the identity matrix.
Here's another command.
Spy.
"Spy allows you to look at the, all the non zero components, of the matrix."
"So if I do this, press go."
"There's my matrix structure, the blue dots indicate which things are not zero."
"By the way, by using the SP Diags."
The only things it saves is the blue dots.
"Notice the matrix is sparse, it's almost empty."
"If you were to save all these zeroes, right, order N squared matrix, the memory requirement would be order N squared for you."
"To save all these things as zeroes, if you save it as a sparse matrix, it's order N. 'Kay."
Be easy on your chip.
Try not to save memory stuff.
You're going to have to use your memory for other things besides saving matrices.
Okay?
"So, this is what's nice about this."
"So, hey, look at that."
I put down a diagonal.
What we're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species and put it into a completely different species and expect that to work.
"Well, we had no real reason to expect it would, and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these."
"And just last February, the last time we did these trials,"
I saw a miracle starting to happen.
"What we found was most of these eggs didn't work, but then suddenly, one of them began to divide."
That was so exciting.
And then the egg divided again.
And then again.
"And pretty soon, we had early-stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those."
"We even DNA-tested some of these cells, and the DNA of the extinct frog is in those cells."
So we're very excited.
This is not a tadpole.
It's not a frog.
"But it's a long way along the journey to producing, or bringing back, an extinct species."
And this is news.
We haven't announced this publicly before.
We're excited.
We've got to get past this point.
"We now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate, to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues."
It'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog.
Watch this space.
I think we're going to have this frog hopping glad to be back in the world again.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
"We haven't done it yet, but keep the applause ready."
The second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project.
"The thylacine looks a bit, to most people, like a dog, or maybe like a tiger, because it has stripes."
But it's not related to any of those.
It's a marsupial.
"It raised its young in a pouch, like a koala or a kangaroo would do, and it has a long history, a long, fascinating history, that goes back 25 million years."
But it's also a tragic history.
"So, avoid repetition, avoid excess verbiage."
And ...
"Yes, I've used it. ..."
I've written [laugh] editorials about that which I think you've used it.
I've used.
Yes [laugh].
"And Avoid, you know, sometimes people will write a rather long discussion in the introduction of the paper, where it's, really, the introduction should be."
"Brief, and say why you did this study and what you, basically what you what you tried to accomplish."
But leave all the discussion the review of the literature for the discussion section.
"Don't try to, to put too much in the introduction."
Some things are certainly you need some background.
As to why you did this study.
Which may involve citing some previous
"literature, but don't go into detail."
"At that's, in the introduction."
And .
Don't repeat numerical data in the text.
"You know, you'll have a table which has nice, numerical data with odds ratios and so on, and then there's, in the results, saying table one shows the blah, blah, blah and the odds ratio was this and that and, so avoid repeating that."
"We will often ask authors, you know, just describe."
The finding of the table in words.
And they can see.
The reader can see the numerical examples.
"Good, yeah."
So those are my main suggestions.
Those are good tips.
"Yeah, and you know, one of the, the fears I think that comes up often when I'm teaching a course like this."
"And it's already come up in this class is, a lot of scientists will say to me well I, you know, you know, I've been teaching them to write in simple and concise language."
And they'll say well if I simplify it to much I'm gonna dumb down the science.
It's gonna lose precision.
Mm-mm.
And.
So there's this kind of fear that a lot of scientists have.
"This question, that you want to find out."
"Because sometimes, there is so much distortion when you try to focus, that you'll forget the question."
It's like something is zooming in on really what is important.
"And what happens is that, that part of your mind or psyche that's trying to avoid, seeing the truth for what it is."
The mind as you come nearer to identifying the mind will begin to throw stones in the bush.
To trying to get you to look somewhere else.
"So, this will be felt , like a kind of distortion"
"'no, no, I can't cope with it' and all this type of stuff."
"So, write it down."
And hold the question in your consciousness.
And it will begin to burn something.
"You feel, feel it. what will be left is just a sort of spaciousness."
"And intense feeling of presence, just presence, and joy and space."
"Then , in this moment, you re-invite again the question , you see."
"'Now who wants, who wants this picture?'"
'Who wants to fulfill this picture'?
And see what happens then?
It will have no pulling power for you.
"So, this is really the effectiveness of the enquiry."
I want to go over it again for you.
Something is on the mind.
Something is coming up.
"In India sometimes, when it is intense. intensely personal, nothing can trouble you except you personalize it."
"If there is no identity, it has no power."
"You've to somehow spray your scent on whatever it is, to empower it."
You understand what I mean by this.
See Part Three
"The last couple of days, we had heard that Tyler had his head shoved into a wall locker."
They said he was a geek.
My concern is that you were making someone feel so unomfortable that they didn't want to be in school.
I feel kinda nervous on the school bus.
"I like learning, but I have trouble with making friends."
You can get some on the Ave.
"You know? for those of you who are far away from the Ave, I don't know where you can get incense, but we've got lots here."
"Maybe we can ship some to you, 'kay?"
"And then you can meditate upon this, okay?"
"But I'll just tell you that's your matrix A. And then, what we're going to do, is do exactly what we did in class last time."
"Remember this matrix a, it's 500 rows, 5000 columns, so it's, it's a big matrix with highly under determined, okay?"
"Oh by the way, well lets go back to that."
"Now once you get that, then, here you go."
This is exactly what we did in class last time.
"We're going to solve this, highly underdetermined system, in three ways."
We're going to use the pseudo inverse Command.
"We're going to say okay, find the suit [UNKNOWN] over in the first of this matrix a."
Multiply it by your sample signal.
"Get a v-, get the vector x out, okay?"
"We're also going to say, alright, how about just use the backslash."
Backslash solves large and indetermined systems.
"There it is, we'll call that X2 and then, here you go."
"Here's the optimization routine, and I've given you a link that you can download this."
It's a
little add-on in that .
It's just a generic convex optimization solver.
"What you're going to do is, Is the following."
"There's some variable x3 that's going to be our solution, and you want to minimize, so what you want to do, is you want to find the minimum l1 solution of this under determine system, so here it is."
"Minimize the norm x3, within one norm."
"There's the one norm right there, right?"
The l1 norm.
"Subject to x = b, right?"
So there's infinite number of solutions.
"Give me the one that satisfies the solution, but also has the smallest l1 norm."
That's what y ou're saying to do.
"And you know, from what we did last time."
"First thing is probably going to do, is say, hey, you know what?"
What does it say to do?
It says check to see if I'm in that base case.
It's the list of length less than two.
Is it one basically?
"In which case, just return a copy the list."
That's the simple case.
"Otherwise, notice what it says to do."
It's says find the mid-point and split the list in half.
"Copy of the back end, sorry, copy of the left side, copy of the right side."
Run merge sort on those.
"By induction, if it does the right thing, I'm going to get back two lists, and I'm going to then merge them together."
Notice what I'm going to do.
"I'm going to print here the list if we go into it, and print of the when we're done and then just return that."
Merge up here.
There's a little more code there.
I'll let you just grok it but you can see it's basically doing what I did over there.
"Setting up two indices for the two sub-list, it's just walking down, finding the smallest element, putting it into a new list."
"When it gets to the end of one of the lists, it skips to the next part, and only one of these two pieces will get called because only one of them is going to have things leftovers."
It's going to add the other pieces in.
"OK, if you look at that then, let's look at what happened when we ran this."
We started off with a call with that list.
"Ah ha, split it in half."
It's going down the left side of this.
"That got split in half, and that got split in half until"
I got to a list of one.
Here's the first list of size one.
There's the second list of size one.
So I merged them.
"It's now in the right order, and that's coming from right there."
"Having done that, it goes back up and picks the second sub-list, which came from there."
"It's a down to base case, merges it."
"When these two merges are done, we're basically at a stage in that branch where we can now merge those two together, which gives us that, and it goes through the rest of it."
But it turns out that this is not quite the same expected value as this.
But you don't have to worry about it for now.
So why even talk about the standard deviation?
"Well, one, the units work out a little better."
"If let's say all of our data points were measured in meters, right?"
If we were taking a bunch of measurements of length then the units of the variance would be meter squared. right?
Because we're taking meters minus meters.
This would be a meter.
Then you're squaring.
You're getting meters squared.
And that's kind of a strange concept if you say you know the average dispersion from the center is in meter squares.
"Well first, when you take the square root of it you get this-- you get something that's again in meters."
"So you're kind of saying, oh well the standard deviation is x or y meters."
And then we'll learn a little bit it if you can actually model your data as a bell curve or if you assume that your data has a distribution of a bell curve then this tells you some interesting things about where all of the probability of finding someone within one or two standard deviations of the of the mean.
"But anyway, I don't want to go to technical right now."
Let's just calculate a bunch.
Let's calculate.
"Let's see, if I had numbers 1, 2, 3, 8, and 7."
And let's say that this is a population.
So what would its mean be?
So I have 1 plus 2 plus 3.
So it's 3 plus 3 is 6.
6 plus 8 is 14.
14 plus 7 is 21.
So the mean of this population-- you sum up all the data points.
"You get 21 divided by the total number of data points, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
21 divided by 5 which is equal to what?
4.2.
Fair enough.
Now we want to figure out the variance.
And we're assuming that this is the entire population.
So the variance of this population is going to be equal to the sum of the squared differences of each of these numbers from 4.2.
A really nice algorithm.
"As I said, an example of divide and conquer."
Notice here that it's different than the binary search case.
"We're certainly dividing down, but the combination now actually takes some work."
I'll have to actually figure out how to put them back together.
And that's a general thing you want to keep in mind when you're thinking about designing a divide and conquer kind of algorithm.
"You really want to get the power of dividing things up, but if you end up doing a ton of work at the combination stage, you may not have gained anything."
So you really want to think about that trade off.
"All right, having said that, what's the complexity here?"
"Boy, there's a dumb question, because I've been telling you for the last two lectures the complexity is n log n, but"
let's see if it really is.
What's the complexity here?
"If we think about it, we start off with the problem of size n."
What do we do?
We split it into two problems of size n over 2.
"Those get split each into two problems of size n over 4, and we keep doing that until we get down to a level in this tree where we have only singletons left over."
"Once we're there, we have to do the merge."
Notice what happens here.
We said each of the merge operations was of order n.
But n is different.
Right?
"Down here, I've just got two things to merge, and then"
I've got things of size two to merge and then things of size four to merge.
But notice a trade off.
I have n operations if you like down there of size one.
Up here I have n over two operations of size two.
Up here I've got n over four operations of size four.
So I always have to do a merge of n elements.
How much time does that take?
"Well, we said it, right?"
Where did I put it?
"Right there, order n."
And that jumping to the front in the end are just a matter of updating that cursor position from zero to the size and whatnot.
The operation where things get a little more bogged down is on this insert where I need to insert a position.
"If I insert the X, Y, Z into the middle there and you can see it kind of chopping those characters down, making that space to insert those things in the middle."
"Similarly, doing delete operations, if I jump to the beginning I start doing deletes here."
"It has to copy all those characters over and deduct that length, right, so that the vectors do that work for us on remove that."
"That means that if the vector's very large, which is not a typical in a word processor situation, you could have you PhD theses which has hundreds of pages, if you go back to the beginning and you start deleting characters you'd hate to think it was just taking this massive shuffle time to get the work done."
So
let's see my - I'm going to bring in the display that
"- whoops,"
I don't like something here.
[Inaudible].
"Now, what do we have?"
"Oh, look at this."
"Well, well, we will continue on."
This inside - okay.
Hello.
[Inaudible].
I have no idea.
I'm not going to try to [inaudible].
Okay.
It's inside.
That's got me totally upset.
Okay.
We still have our old code somewhere.
Okay.
Why do I still have the wrong - what is - okay.
"Oh, well."
Today's not my lucky day.
I'm not going to worry about that too much.
I'm just going to show [inaudible].
Okay.
"So seeing what's actually happening, right, it's like just mostly kind of moving that stuff back and forth, and then having the vector do the big work, right, of inserting and deleting those characters, and doing all the copying to get the thing done."
And this is like the average that you're used to taking before you learned any of the statistics stuff.
You add up all the data points and you divide by the number there are.
The sample is the same thing.
We just use a slightly different terminology.
The mean of a sample-- and I'll do it in a different color-- just write it as x with a line on top.
And that's equal to the sum of all the data points in the sample.
So each of the xi in the sample.
But we're serving the sample is something
less than a population.
So you start with the first one still.
And then you go to the lower case n where we assume that
lowercase n is less than the big N.
If this was the same thing then we're actually taking the average or we're taking the mean of the entire population.
And then you divide by the number of data points you added.
You get to n.
"Then we said OK, how far-- this give us the central tendency."
It's one measure of the central tendency.
But what if we wanted to know how good of an indicator this is for the population or for the sample?
"Or, on average, how far are the data points from this mean?"
And that's where we came up with the concept of variance.
And I'll arbitrarily switch colors again.
Variance.
And in a population the variable or the notation for variance is the sigma squared.
This means variance.
And that is equal to-- you take each of the data points.
You find the difference between that and the mean that you calculate up there.
You square it so you get the squared difference.
And then you essentially take the average of all of these.
You take the average of all of these squared distances.
So that's-- so you take the sum from i is equal to 1 to n and you divide it by n.
That's the variance.
And then the variance of a sample mean-- and this was a
- Why do you think it appeared to you?
"I believe the demonic can appear as an apparition... ...much like a ghost, in an attempt to excite our fear."
"- Did it excite your fear, Father?"
- It scared the hell out of me.
"So this night, when you began to prepare Emily's exorcism... ...was it your first encounter with this demon ghost?"
- Yes.
- Have you seen it again?
I've seen it ever since.
No further questions at this time.
"Redirect, Your Honor."
"Father Moore, after you received the bishop's authorization... ...when did you proceed with an exorcism?"
October 31st.
On Halloween.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?
Halloween tradition is based on legends throughout history... ...that indicate a real increase in spiritual activity on that night... ...and I thought we could use the occasion to draw them into the open.
"- The demons, you mean?"
- Yes.
Father Moore... ...can you identify this?
It's my tape recorder.
I used it to record the exorcism.
Inside is the tape I made that night.
Why would you make such a tape?
Ever since the technology has been available... ...exorcists have used tape recorders to authenticate the ritual... ...and provide a record for review.
I offer into evidence this cassette recorder and audiotape...
Objection.
The people were not aware of the existence of this tape... ...until last night.
- Neither were we.
This tape is new evidence that came into our possession yesterday.
We provided counsel for the people with a transcript of its contents.
You mean this tape was not given to you by your client?
"No, Your Honor."
"We received it from a reluctant witness... ...Dr. Graham Cartwright, who will also be called to testify to its authenticity."
A pile of elephant dung is about this big.
Okay?
So that's what's going off in here.
We are deeply indebted to dung beetles. &amp;gt;
Believe me.
And to fungi.
What's going off here is respiration.
So that's energy.
"You know, you all use it up every day."
"You're using up somewhere between oh 3500 and 5000 calories a day, depending on whether you're on a sports team or not."
And so that's what's going off out here.
And this is coming off of every level here.
Okay?
So you can think of this as what's left over and this is the flow of all that ATP driven stuff on the planet surface.
Now how does that look in space?
"Well if you look at tons of carbon fixed per hectare per year, where green is a lot and yellow is a little, you can see that the forests are really important."
Okay?
"And the closer you get to the equator and the wetter it gets, the more efficient the forests are at fixing carbon."
This is for the terrestrial part of the world.
"If you could put the reefs in, they would be fixing carbon, and they would be withdrawing it on kind of a different timescale."
"Because the tropical forests, although they fix a lot of carbon, don't actually cleanse the atmosphere of CO2, at least not at equilibrium."
Why not?
Student:
As they're &amp;gt; they're actually they're also respiring.
Prof:
"They are respiring, yes."
What happens to a tree when it dies?
Student:
It releases a lot of carbon.
Prof:
"It releases a lot of carbon, right?"
So in fact you could grow up a big forest but you only get the carbon benefit the first time you grow it up; after that it goes into an equilibrium where the trees are falling down and the logs are rotting and they're releasing carbon back into the atmosphere.
You'll have one per week and a final.
You'll have deadlines for these
like in a real class.
And you must do these.
Apart from getting a certificate you'll learn.
Finally.
I want you to know how I've structured the class.
I think this is true of most courses or classes.
Its highly recommended to mimic the real world or face to face classes on some dimensions.
"So one of the dimensions is, I will release material one week at a time."
You will not be able to get into the ten week class and do the whole class in a week.
Why am I doing that?
For two reasons.
"One, I genuinely believe that you need time to understand new stuff and practice assignments."
Problems within the videos.
"And if you understand the stuff, you are better off, you can go to the next step."
Luckily Finance builds on stuff.
"So you have to know the first week to know the second week, and so on."
"Well, the second reason is probably more important of releasing one stuff, one week at a time."
"So synchronous, I mean not at a point in time, but for a week."
The second reason is that learning happens from each other.
"So when I do these classes live, all assignments are on a group, and they evaluate each other, not everybody gets the same grade."
"So, this I can't mimic online, but you can."
Join the forums and
learn from each other.
"In fact, I believe you learn far more that way than you'll"
learn from my videos.
And I actually hope that's the case.
Now content and materials is important.
The main material you will get from me is the video.
"For every week there would be approximately two week, two hours worth of video broken up into pieces."
Because Finance is so applied you'll have many opportunities to pause the videos whether I ask you to pause or not.
And there's a real reason why professionally produced narrative is so successful.
"You know, just watch the Oscars and get a sense of how important it is to society."
"My view is that--you asked the question, if"
I may answer it at the wrong order.
"The right way to answer the question is, What does the future look like?"
"And then, How does everybody's models adapt to that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"Well, we know what the future looks like. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"Well, let's say it, because I think people are often, are a little confused about it."
The fact of the matter is that mobile devices are going to be the majority of the way that people get information.
And the argument is relatively simple.
You already have them.
They're called your phones.
"And over the next five or 10 years, these phones, if you just-- a simple Moore's Law calculation--will have the capacity to do much of the entertainment and communication and so forth that you use in other media."
And you're seeing that today.
So you have a business model issue.
But there's not a question of how people are going to spend their time.
So let's go through what these devices look
like.
"They've got a GPS on them, so they know where you are."
"They're personal, so they know what you've seen and they don't show you the same thing over and over again, like my television."
You know?
The same show over and over again?
Show it just once.
"It's highly, highly personal."
It can do excerpts.
"And, of course, it's also summary form."
So the combination of all of that means a huge change in the business model.
And I don't think we know exactly how that'll monetize.
What we do know is those products are getting built.
And so the challenge and the opportunity is to figure out how to make money in that.
"But, you won't get there by suing your end users."
You won't get there by preventing this technology from happening.
She said that Father Moore had suggested she stop taking the drug.
"And what, in your medical opinion... ...was the result of Father Moore's suggestion?"
I believe Father Moore's suggestion killed her.
"Objection, Your Honor!"
The witness is asserting outrageous conclusions based on pure hearsay.
"Technically correct, but I'll allow it as part of his expert opinion testimony."
"Thank you, Dr. Mueller."
Your witness.
You said you observed a possible epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.
Doesn't this imply what you observed may not have been an epileptic focus?
"Yes, that's also possible."
"Would Father Moore's advice to stop taking Gambutrol be good advice... ...if Emily were, in fact, not epileptic?"
Of course.
But that's not the case here.
She was epileptic.
Really.
When Emily saw objects move on their own... ...and felt an invisible presence on top of her... ...was she experiencing symptoms typical of epilepsy?
"Not typical, no."
Are they typical indications of any other conditions?
"- Say, for example, psychosis?"
"- Yes, I would say that's correct."
But isn't psychosis an entirely different medical condition from epilepsy?
"- Yes, in my..."
- So aren't you selectively choosing... ...what parts of Emily's experiences fit your epilepsy diagnosis... ...while ignoring those which indicate something else?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
- Withdrawn.
No further questions.
We have to work fast.
They're only giving me an hour with you tonight.
Listen.
"Before we get started, there's something I have to tell you... ...something I should've said to you before I let you take the case."
Okay.
So you've talked a little bit about the benefit to the students.
Tell me a little bit about the actual scientific research program that you're doing with this grant.
Win Phippen:
Okay.
"As you know, here in illinois, we produce a lot of corn and soybeans during the summer months."
"But the rest of the year, the fields set empty."
"And so, some researchers over at the USDA over in Peoria have come across this crop that allows us to plant in the late fall, after corn comes out."
And it actually grows throughout the winter months.
"It gives us field coverage, so we don't get a lot of erosion in the fields during the winter months."
Beth Seaton:
"So it's good for the field, too?"
Win Phippen:
It's excellent.
So not only is off-season production but it also gives benefits back to the field for growing corn and soybeans.
Beth Seaton:
So when do you harvest this pennycress?
Win Phippen:
"We plant it in late fall, and then, sometime, in late May, typically, by the first of June, is when you would harvest this plant."
"And that allows you to then plant your soybeans right behind it, and there is no impact, then, on the soybeans."
So they can get a full season of soybeans.
"But what they are benefitting is, they have produced all that pennycress."
And why pennycress is being looked at...
"As you can see, it's a fairly oil-seed crop."
It has a lot of oil.
It's about 40 percent oil.
And so the intent of this is simply to help displace a lot of petroleum-based products.
"And that could be fuel, so this simply could be crushed, to get out the oil, to make a bio-diesel product."
"Or you can take this seed and add it to, let's say, plastics, and other, sort of, petroleum-based products. it's not going to alleviate us completely from the dependency on foreign oil, but it is certainly a step in the right direction."
Beth Seaton:
It sounds like an exciting research program for Western.
Win Phippen:
"I mean, that's -- that's definitely genetic modification."
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
We also have transgenesis.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
That's how people make GloFish.
"You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow."
And that's pretty cool.
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.
And now they're making Glow-rabbits and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.
I guess we could make a glow chicken.
(Laughter)
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.
But there's another thing.
There's what we call atavism activation.
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.
"You heard that occasionally children are born with tails, and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic."
And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen.
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.
And here's an example.
This is a chicken with teeth.
"A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth, and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens."
Now that's a good characteristic.
We can save that one.
We know we can use that.
We can make a chicken with teeth.
That's getting closer.
That's better than a glowing chicken.
(Laughter)
"A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,"
"Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University, is actually looking at atavisms."
"And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop, and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail."
But rats have incredible survival skills.
They can chew through cinder blocks... squeeze through spaces the size of a quarter... survive a fall of 50 feet... swim over a mile... and tread water for three days.
"One pair can potentially produce 15,000 descendants a year!"
Rats don't have many friends... possibly because they go where we go.
Rats are bad for the health.
"In the last 1,000 years, diseases carried by rats have killed more people than all of the world's wars and revolutions combined."
And there's every chance rats will survive
long after we've been wiped off the face of the planet.
Nuclear holocaust.
But rats can survive.
Eniwetok Atoll.
A string of tiny islands in the Pacific Ocean.
It was a tropical paradise for rats.
Until the U.S. military arrived.
"Between 1946 and 1958, 40 nuclear bombs were detonated on Eniwetok Atoll."
The largest explosion carved a mile-wide crater in the coral reef.
MAN:
It is now 30 seconds to zero time.
Put on goggles or turn away.
"Minus ten seconds, niner, eight, seven, six, fiver, four, three, two, one, T zero."
NARRATOR:
The destructive power of the test was roughly 800 times larger than the explosion in Hiroshima.
It seemed the island was wiped clean of life...
but not of rats.
"Shielded from the blast inside cable tunnels or under concrete, they emerged into the apocalypse."
"Two years later, scientists found the rat population had not only survived... but thrived."
They'd scavenged food on the beach and supplemented their diet with a little cannibalism.
"The rats appear healthy, normal animals."
But nobody's quite sure what mutations may have been caused by exposure to so much radiation.
All life needs water.
Southern Africa is ravaged by droughts.
Most fish die.
"So this is linear, order n and n is this sum of the element, or sorry, the number of elements in each list."
I said I was going to back my way into this.
That gives me a way to merge things.
So here's what merge sort would do.
"Merge sort takes this idea of divide and conquer, and it does the following: it says let's divide the list in half."
There's the divide and conquer.
And let's keep dividing each of those lists in half until we get down to something that's really easy to sort.
What's the simplest thing to sort?
"A list of size one, right?"
So continue until we have singleton lists.
"Once I got a list of size one they're sorted, and then combine them."
Combine them by doing emerge the sub-lists.
"And again, you see that flavor."
"I'm going to just keep dividing it up until I get something really easy, and then I'm going to combine."
"And this is different than binary search now, the combine is going to have to do some work."
"So, I'm giving you a piece of code that does this, and I'm going to come back to it in the second, but it's up there."
But what I'd like to do is to try you sort sort of a little simulation of how this would work.
"And I was going to originally make the TAs come up here and do it, but I don't have enough t a's to do a full merge sort."
"So I'm hoping, so I also have these really high-tech props."
I spent tons and tons of department money on them as you can see.
I hope you can see this because I'm going to try and simulate what a merge sort does.
"I've got eight things I want to sort here, and those initially start out here at top level."
The first step is divide them in half.
All right?
"I'm not sure how to mark it here, remember I need to come back there."
I'm not yet done.
What do I do?
Divide them in half again.
"You know, if I had like shells and peas here I could make some more money."
What do I do?
I divide them in half one more time.
"Let me cluster them because really what I have, sorry, separate them out."
"But that's the same thing as s squared over s squared, plus a squared over s squared."
"So it's s squared plus a squared, over s squared, y is equal to minus e to the minus st, times this whole thing, sine of at, minus 1 over s squared, cosine of at."
"And now, this right here, since we're doing everything with respect to dt, this is just a constant, right?"
So we can say a constant times the antiderivative is equal to this.
This is as good a time as any to evaluate the boundaries.
Right?
"If this had a t here, I would have to somehow get them back on the other side."
"Because the t's are involved in evaluating the boundaries, since we're doing our definite integral or improper integral."
So let's evaluate the boundaries now.
"And we could've kept them along with us the whole time, right?"
And just factored out this term right here.
But anyway.
So let's evaluate this from 0 to infinity.
And this should simplify things.
"So the right-hand side of this equation, when I evaluate it at infinity, what is e to the minus infinity?"
"Well, that is 0."
We've established that multiple times.
"And now it approaches 0 from the negative side, but it's still going to be 0, or it approaches 0."
What's sine of infinity?
"Well, sine just keeps oscillating, between negative 1 and plus 1, and so does cosine."
Right?
So this is bounded.
So this thing is going to overpower these.
"And if you're curious, you can graph it."
This kind of forms an envelope around these oscillations.
"So the limit, as this approaches infinity, is going to be equal to 0."
"And that makes sense, right?"
These are bounded between 0 and negative 1.
And this approaches 0 very quickly.
So it's 0 times something bounded between 1 and negative 1.
"Another way to view it is the largest value this could equal is 1 times whatever coefficient's on it, and then this is going to 0."
So it's like 0 times 1.
And zero ends three.
[sound].
"And now the problem is, we've changed which path is the shortest one."
"We added ten to the top path and only five to the bottom path and as a result, they've reversed."
So now the bottom path ST is actually the shorter one.
"So if you run Dijkstra on this graph, it's going to come with the path ST even though that's not in fact the shortest path in the original network, the one that we actually care about."
"Okay, so that's why you can't just naively reduce shortest path with negative edge lengths to shortest paths with non-negative edge"
lengths.
"Moreover on this very same, super simple thre e node graph, You know, we can try to run, running dikes for shortest path algorithm."
It's perfectly well defined.
It will produce some output.
But it's actually going to be wrong.
"It is not going to compute shortest path distances, correctly in this graph."
So let me show you why.
Unless of course initialization will work as it always does.
So it's gonna start by saying the shortest path distance from S to itself is zero via the empty path.
"And then, what's it going to do next?"
"It's going to say well we need to enlarge the set capital X by one vertex and there are two crossing edges, it's the"
XV edge and the ST edge.
And what's it going to do.
It's going to use the
Dijkstra Greedy score.
"So the score of this upper edge is going to be one, and the score of this bottom edge."
Is going to be negative two.
"'Cause remember, you take the previously computed shortest path [inaudible] of the tail, that's zero in both cases."
And then you add the edge lengths.
"So the edge lengths are one and minus two, so the scores are one and minus two."
Which of these is smaller?
"Well evidently, the ST arc has the smaller score minus two."
So what is Dijkstra's algorithm gonna do?
"It's going to say yes, let's go for this edge ST."
Let's bring T into the set capital X. T is now part of the conquered territory.
"For example, I can do something,"
I can cut my hair short to minimize my shampoo consumption.
"I can reduce my footprint by, for example, taking the elevator."
"Because when you take the elevator, you can be five time less bad"
"Because it takes, for a vegetarian, five times more energy to lift somebody by taking the stairs, than taking the elevator."
"In calories, it's five times more energy intensive than taking the elevator."
"So, whenever you want to protect the environment, take the elevator, because it takes so much less energy when you have an elevator, because you use calories so much."
"We can do a lot, for example, never drink sparkling water."
Because it's three litres of carbon dioxides.
"We can do a lot; we call it ""sustainability""."
"When I ask you, ""How is your relationship with your girlfriend?"
What would you say?
Sustainable.
(Laughter)
"Then, I am really sorry for you."
(Laughter)
"So, this is not about minimizing being bad; it's about being good."
We talk about reducing carbon dioxide emissions; but two thirds of all the carbon is in soil?
"Not in oil, not in coal, two thirds of all the carbon is in top soil."
"So, we want to be carbon neutral, but why don't we make a footprint which is beneficial, instead of carbon neutral?"
"People try to be ""less bad""."
"You will say, ""Oh yes! 'm 90% bad, 80% bad,"
"I make all zeroes carbon neutral""."
"For example, Europe has a goal to be carbon neutral in 2050."
You can only be carbon neutral when you don't exist.
This is the only way.
"Just by thinking, you are not carbon neutral."
"So how could you say, ""My biggest goal is to be carbon neutral?"""
"Out of all the environmental disasters,"
"- Seveso, Bhopal, The Love Canal, Chernobyl - the generated feeling is, ""it's better we're not here""."
"And when you are in, say, Amazon, we think, ""We are a pain for the planet""."
This is why we try to be less bad.
"At $60 the value of our option is $10, but we paid $10 for it."
"That's our break even, but then we make money after that."
This is from the perspective of the holder.
This is from the perspective of the holder of the call option.
This is the holder of the call option.
What would it look like if you're the writer of the call option?
If your the person selling the right to buy the stock.
"If this person right over here, if the holder has the right to buy at $50, someone must be selling them that right."
Someone must be agreeing to say hey I will essentially sell that to you at that price.
If you're the writer of the foot ... we have the holder in green.
The holder in green.
What if you're the writer?
You're essentially the counter party on that option.
You're the person agreeing to uphold that option.
"If the option never gets exercised, then the writer doesn't have to loose any money."
"If the option does get exercise, then all of a sudden, the writer starts to loose money."
"If the writer doesn't own the stock, and let's say the stock is at $60, this guy, the holder, can exercise his option to buy at $50."
The writer would then have to go buy the stock on the market for $60 and sell it for $50.
They would loose $10.
The writers payoff would look something like this.
Once again it's the mirror image of the payoff of the holder.
"If you think about the profit of the writer, if the option is never exercised, then the holder gets to keep the $10 that they were paid ... that they sold the right for."
"If the option is exercised, and they start to"
"loose money, and their break even once again is at $60."
"Anything below that, then they start to loose more and more money."
Once again these are the mirror images of each other.
If you were to add up these two line it would be break even.
These parties are the ones who are exchanging money between.
If this guys makes $10 this guys loosing $10 or vice versa.
Dr. Christopher R. Austin:
"Thanks, and it's great to be here."
I just want to make a couple of points.
I need super computers.
"So, what does Google do here?"
What does--why do we do this?
"Well, partly, at the end of the day, it's paradoxical."
We want to give people time back.
We want them to get you to an answer quickly.
"We want you to be more productive so that you can get back and give us the things that, that--the things that you enjoy, which"
I would argue or relay around people in society and culture and the things that all of us appreciate so much.
"So in our case, a new definition of Google would have--we're trying very hard to get you something fast."
"Never underestimate the importance of fast, quick, quick, quick."
We want it there.
We want it now.
We want to help you right now.
Speed matters because your time matters.
We make hundreds of improvements to search every year.
You see them gradually all over and over again.
The accuracy gets better.
The index gets much bigger.
You'll see some of the facilities in a sec now that we've done around translation and other kinds of annotation.
"We have one of the largest infrastructures now which we just introduced, which is internally known as Caffeine, which basically allow us to handle even greater, greater indexes and many more information."
"Now, what are we going to do with search?"
"Ultimately, search is a personal activity."
"So, ultimately, where search goes is it searches not just the web, but literally all of your information, your email--the things that you care about."
"This is with your permission, I might add."
"This is personal search for you and only you because ultimately, search is about finding what you want right now."
"And the next step of search, of course, is doing this automatically."
"So when I walk down the street of Berlin, I love history, what I want is I want the computer--my smartphone to be doing searches constantly."
Did you know?
Did you know?
Did you know?
Did you know?
This occurred here.
You're violating copyright.
I also encourage you to look at the other textbooks and don't worry about which edition it is.
The fundamentals are the same.
"So choose a reference for yourself, but please recognize I'm not following any specific textbook, page by page."
"If I were, this class wouldn't be very useful you know."
So I am doing the
"Essence of Finance at an introductory level, but you need to have some references and there are several options."
So make a choice soon.
Finally the material that is kind of come second in importance to the videos is all the assignments and I've talked enough about them.
But I would encourage you again to do the assignments.
Try them even before looking at the video.
"You k now, that's a, that's a kind of a challenge to try to understand what's going on."
Test yourself all the time.
"I'm going to now, talking about this thing, I'm going to move over to how do we evaluate."
Why are we evaluating you?
"Because we will give you a certificate, and the certificate has to have some criteria, right?"
I'm not a big fan of grading.
"In fact, I feel that's the least enjoyable part of my life, and partly because it's kind of boring, but also because who am I, You know."
"I mean you are learning, you should be able to grade yourself, and so on."
But the world is complex so lets talk about evaluation for a second.
"It'll be pass, fail."
So how do I determine pass or fail?
"You'll get a certificate if you pass, you will not get a certificate."
So my grading philosophy is very simple.
"It's not mine, it's borrowed from my reading of grading in particular."
"And basically the notion here is, do you know enough?"
Rather than do you get 100%.
So in each assignment.
You have to get 70%.
"If you don't get 70 percent on any one assignment, you cannot get a certificate."
"Similarly you have to get 70 percent on the final, which is in the last week."
"You don't have an assignment in the last week, but you have a final."
How much commercial relationship do we have?
There's the point of maintaining our values and doing things in a way that represents our values and be where people are.
There's often no easy answer.
In the past we had voted we will go where people are.
That's how we have impact.
We could be an open source project.
We were a very successful open source project in 1999 where we had thousands of people already contributing to Mozilla.
We were irrelevant to the marketplace.
We were irrelevant to consumers' lives and irrelevant to citizen's lives.
And we changed that with Firefox by consciously deciding to go where people are.
"We even did a commercial relationship with Google and Yahoo, which of course turned out after the fact to be what sustains us going forward."
But we did those commercial relationships because we wanted their searchs and we thought that they would be good.
"Now, after the fact, it turns out they generated the money that allows us to grow."
So sustainability is also an important piece.
How do you build those relationships in a way that have Mozilla values in them?
We've done that before and we'll continue to do that.
And now I'm trying to think about...
Do we wanna have questions?
Has everybody asked the questions they have?
I can keep talking or we can go on to questions.
"I do wanna close at the end, but go ahead."
[Question]
So we knew that... so we shipped Firefox 4...
"Firefox 1, in November 2004 and we had a goal of, I don't know, 10 million downloads in 30 days, which we past in 10 days."
So we knew by December that the amount of money we would be getting was beyond our expectations.
We didn't know how far it would go.
"So we had been hoping to be able to generate enough revenue to sustain those 10 people, or 12 people."
"At the time, we didn't even know how to sustain those."
"By January 1st, we knew that we would be able to do that."
The response to Firefox 1 was sort of the stuff of dreams.
"Now, it turns out, those were also stressful times."
What happened?
No.
"-There you are, you little silly, now it's time to die!"
"-Any last words, you cute little butt-heads?"
"-Yeah, why are you guys acting like Richard Simmons?"
"-Uh, oh no he did not just say that."
"-What the hell, man?"
All Italians are like that.
-[stammers]:
"But, I thought they were like,"
"""It's a spicy meat-a-ball-a."""
-Oh!
I can't listen to this racist little prick anymore.
-Enjoy being racist!
And gay!
-You're gay?
Eww!
"-Well, that was a quick flight."
"Oh, I'd like you guys to meet my new friends from Japan."

"-Oh great, let me guess, all Japanese people look and dress like Elvis, right?"
"-Uh, no."
We just got back from an Elvis convention.

This video gives a live demonstration of the recursive constructs in sequel that we introduced in the previous video.
"As a reminder, recursion has been introduced intosequal as part of the with statement where we can set up relations that are defined by queries that themselves refer to the relation being defined, and finally we have a query that can involve the recursively defined relations as well as other relations or other tables in the database."
The typical expression within a with statement for a recursively defined relation would be to have a base query that doesn't depend on R and then a recursive query that does depend on R. We gave three examples in the introductory video and those are the same examples that we'll be demonstrated shortly.
The first one was to compute ancestors when we have only a parent relation and the family tree could be arbitrarily deep.
"The good news is, that you'll get feedback immediately from the computer as you're taking them."
"And, and for the assignments, you have the whole week."
"Whereas for the final, I'll let you know how much time you have."
"The real good news however, is because I'm interested in you learning rather than just testing you just once and saying, forget about it."
This guy or gal doesn't know something.
"I'm more interested in what you know, rather than what you don't know."
So I'll give you two attempts at each of one of these.
"Each assignment two attempts, final two attempts."
"But you have to finish within the deadlines, both attempts."
Otherwise you cannot.
The score cannot count.
"We have to have some criteria, right?"
"Now, dealing with me or the teaching assistant and this is one of the things that I think is a little bit of a disadvantag e in the online class."
This class is really large.
I do not want to get into the numbers because I want you to think of this class as just for you and I mean I think that's the beauty of online class.
So it's a
"large class, what can't we do?"
"I would encourage you, please don't attempt to contact me, or my teaching assistant Nathan Brown."
And the reason is you can easily find our emails and shoot an email.
"It's not that, we don't love you."
I love you all.
"There's a heart that beats in each one of you and that's my requirement for loving, you know."
"And in fact even plants have lives, right?"
"So, but in anyway, I'm coming back to the basics."
"I cannot afford to answer emails and Nathan cannot, because it would become unmanageable at our end."
So we encourage you not to try to contact us.
So what will we do?
We'll provide all the resources on a weekly basis.
"They'll come, you'll know what you want, you'll know exactly what, what's needed to be done and the teaching assistant, Nathan, will monitor the class for any errors, and so on, so forth."
But our goal is to make this class self-sufficient.
How?
"There's only one teaching assistant, and only one of me."
Sometimes it is cheaper to buy five little packets of something than to buy one that includes five in the bigger one.
"And like I said, you don't think that that is the way it is going to be, but sometimes buying smaller times the number you need is more cost-effective than buying larger."
"And, if you go to looking you will see that they are doing that more and more now."
Okay?
So something to watch out for.
Then your chapter talks a little bit about warranties and you need to make sure and read those.
I'll tell you we don't buy a whole lot of warranties.
"Usually vehicles, products"
last as long as whatever warranty they are going to sell you.
"So, or whatever warranty comes free."
Usually it is going to make it that far.
I have found that computers is one exception.
We have bought warranties on computers.
When you use them you take them in.
"You know you are at college, you don't have your computer for a couple of months, I don't know."
"As cheap as things get, you just have to weigh the cost of buying a warranty and look at what all it is going to cover."
"Now, the next thing it talks about, it talks about researched based buying."
So many times instead of researching something we just go out and buy it.
"We decide, Oh, I would like to have a new TV !"
"Okay, let's go buy one."
"No, you need to do some research based buying."
Now four phases.
First the
Pre-shopping Activity.
There are things you do before you ever get there.
"Secondly, Evaluating The Alternatives Phase."
Then the Selection and Purchase Phase.
And then the Post-purchase Activities.
And there is a great deal of information given on all four of these different steps.
But phase I. If you will look on page 194 as you are gathering information there on the left you see key websites for consumer product information.
These are places you can go to learn about a product.
And these are from organizations that don't sell advertisements.
"So, it looks like this."
"The story can be told in multiple ways, but in English we have a phrase, ""What goes around, comes around."""
"On the religious side, there's the golden rule, ""Do onto others..."""
"And the story we heard earlier on the Polish farm, basically internalizing in economic systems, what is otherwise thrown away,"
literally makes certain or ensures that the resources that we have are reinvested in our present and our future.
"You wear, as I do, the same phosphate molecules that were in Socrates, that were in Copernicus, that were in Tyrannosaurus Rex."
"We're breathing the same carbon dioxide, the carbon cycles unrestfully pass through us."
"And we either reinvest the carbon in the landscape, we reinvest the resources, or they are gone."
Here's my sampling 100 points.
I'm going to turn off the light just to highlight this.
I want to highlight some regions here.
"Look I've got some sampling here, notice in here, I don't sample at all."
"Do you think I'm going to be able to get signal in there, because you don't want to go by Shawn's theory."
Shawn said.
"There is no way you have any business making a statement about what's going on in that, right?"
"You got no information there, how are you going to get frequency content when you've not sampled the ups and downs?"
"Oh, look at this region over there!"
"I got a huge stretch, 1.2 and I got all this stuff going on Okay?"
Nyquist would say you're screwed.
You're done.
"Like, why, what are thinking about?"
Like seriously?
Drop math now.
"Compress sensing would say wait a minute, but you told me that this is sparse signal."
Which means I have a constraint on the number of freq uencies that might be active which means.
I might be able to get it.
And I'm going to try to get it that optimizes the fit to what I have with a small number of frequencies that are consistent with the data I have.
"You get it, okay?"
"Actually, in this case you're, you're right at the edge of reconstruction, okay?"
"But still, it's we'll, we'll come back to this."
"It's pretty impressive, still, what you can kind of."
"Get out of this, piece."
"And that was talking about how if you stretch out heart cells, and all of the things within heart cells-- all the proteins-- that it actually changes the force of contraction."
"And actually, force of contraction is very much related to this length-tension relationship as well."
So I'm going to put that up here.
Force of contraction.
"And instead of using that terminology, though, we're going to use the term tension."
"I mean, you can essentially think of them the same way."
"But classically, the word tension is what everyone uses."
So we're going to use that same word.
"And then, as far as length, specifically the length that we're talking about is the length of a sarcomere."
So I'm going to write sarcomere here.
"And the sarcomere, just keep in mind, is really going from one z-disc to another z-disc."
"So to draw this out, to actually write it out maybe, we can start with myosin."
"And so maybe this is our myosin, right here."
And I'll draw some myosin heads here.
"And maybe some myosin heads on this side, as well."
"And, of course, you know it's going to be symmetric looking, roughly symmetric."
So this is our myosin.
"And actually, I'm going to make some copies of it now, just to make sure that I don't have to keep drawing it out for you."
But something like that.
"And we'll move it to be just below so that you can actually see, when I draw a few of them, how they differ from one another."
"So I'm going to put them, as best I can, right below one another."
"And we'll do a total of, let's say, five."
"And I think, by the time we get to the fifth one, you'll get an idea of what this overall graph will look like."
So these are our five myosins.
"And to start out at the top, I'm going to show a very crowded situation."
So this will be what happens when really nothing is spread out.
"It's very, very crowded."
"And you recall that you have actin, this box, or this half box that I'm drawing, is our actin."
"And then you have two of them, right?"
"And they have their own polarity, we said."
And they kind of go like that.
"And so, in this first scenario, this very, very first one that I'm drawing, this is our scenario one."
lignified carbon sequestration fertilization.
And if every farm in America practiced that we would sequester all the carbon that's been emitted since the beginning of the industrial age in fewer than 10 years.
Wow!
That's how efficacious it is.
"So when you eat your grass finished steak, not only is it good for you, it's good for the whole ecology."
"Is there also a movement in the beef raising industry towards this, because of the increasing demand?"
"Yes, and this is probably growing faster than the pastured poultry, the pastured pork."
Beef is probably growing faster.
"I don't know why, except that probably the beef industry has not been vertically integrated"
like the swine and the poultry industry.
There are still a lot of independent operators out there.
"Whereas the swine and the poultry industry have been, you know, Tyson's and Smithfield, they've vertically integrated it."
"So there's a lot more ability to be creative and move in the beef industry, and for sure there's a tremendous increase."
"And to increase the awareness, what should consumers look for?"
Should they look for grass finished?
Or is that term being bastardized too?
"Well, what they should do is go visit the farm and see."
But many people aren't going to do that.
"Well, they should."
"So that's the first step, visit the farm."
"Yes, visit the farm, see if there's any grain around and ask the farmer, ask around."
"But mainly, visit the farm and see if you see any grain."
"Cause most farmers will say, yeah, they're grass finished but we grain them the last 30 days."
It's more common than not.
"If you hear those terms, that is the cue to find a new farmer."
"That's exactly right, that is the cue."
"The question is, have they ever gotten any grain in their lives?"
Period.
"If the answer is yes, then find a new one."
"I mean, you know, not that there might not be a, for example, we buy a lot of calves."
"We don't know, some of these calves probably got a little bit of grain maybe when they were weaned from the cow, for a week of two."
"But that's way, way back, 12 months ago."
We just showed that at least one player can gain by changing strategy holding others constant.
The same would be true if we went the other way around.
"If we held B constant at 25, A could gain by changing his strategy, could go right over there."
This is not a Nash equilibrium.
"Then regardless of what state we go to, if we go to this state, it's still not a Nash Equilibrium."
"If we hold A constant,"
"B could improve by increasing his production; or if we hold B constant, then A can still improve by cheating even more."
None of these are Nash equilibriums.
"From any one of these states, if you hold A constant,"
"B could produce more; or if you hold B constant,"
A could produce more and get some gain.
"Over here, A's going from 130 to 160 and getting some gain."
You can imagine this keeps happening incrementally.
They keep producing more and more and more.
"We kind of go there, then we go there, then maybe we go there, then we go there."
"Then maybe A cheats some more, then B cheats some more, then A cheats a little bit more,"
"B cheats a little bit more, maybe a little bit more past that, then A cheats a little bit more."
"The whole time the whole economic profit pie, which is the sum of A and B, is getting smaller and smaller until finally A finally cheats and they're at zero economic profit."
Now let's think about whether this is a Nash equilibrium.
"Clearly, they won't want to move backwards."
"If you hold A constant,"
B would not want to move down.
Then he would
lose economic profit.
That doesn't work.
He doesn't gain by doing that.
"If you hold B constant, A wouldn't want to move to the right."
A would also lose economic profit.
Now you might say what if they produced beyond 37.5?
Why can't they keep producing and go beyond there?
"Holding A constant, if B were to produce more than 37.5 from this state right over here, then the total pie will get negative and it doesn't matter if B's getting a larger or smaller chunk of that pie."
B's chunk is going to be negative.
"I had two speedlights in the background, one just hanging under the ceiling, attached to a ceiling lamp."
The other one standing on the floor.
"Both shooting into the background, exposing the background so that it's white."
The mannequin standing in the middle in front of it.
The main light coming from left and right.
It's exactly the same setup left and right.
It's a white shoot through umbrella at roughly a height of 1.60 meter.
"Both speedlights, left and right, are on 1/4th, and because I don't want to have a harsh contrast, (there should be nothing in the shadows),"
I also have a fill light right above the camera.
"It's also going through an umbrella, filling in whatever shadows there could be."
"The camera is just on standard settings 1/200s, f/11 for nice sharpness, ISO 200 for good quality."
And that's pretty much it.
"The white balance is set to ""flash"" however, don't trust the white balance."
"I mean, if you do catalogue photos you really really need to have an accurate white balance."
"So shoot with a grey card, ideally even shoot with a color calibration target"
like the color checker passport or something.
"But at least you need a neutral gray target like a gray card, or I used this gray cube and that helps for having exactly the correct white balance."
You really need that.
Alright.
What other tips to I have for you?
"Before you put the clothes onto the mannequin, iron them!"
Use a steam iron.
"It is so much easier to iron clothes, iron out the folds in the clothes with a steam iron than it is to iron them out in photoshop later on."
So do it upfront.
Another thing:
"When you are shooting trousers, put the mannequin up onto a stool."
"That way you don't shoot so much ground, the paper that you have on the ground or whatever floor there is, you are shooting the trousers against the white backdrop."
Just like you shoot the jumpers or the sweaters or whatever you have.
That's already it.
I mean it is really simple.
It's that simple.
"So if you haven't done such a shoot, now you don't have any excuse anymore."
"This stream cipher consumes in the beginning both a key and IV, as we've seen, but does a computation 100 times to produce an internal state that is then mapped onto the output that's then XORed with the message is basically the output message."
"Interesting is this part, though."
Each of these links is such a small computation that you can easily reverse it.
"It is nonlinear, meaning you cannot really reverse it without 100% certainty, but it's such a small computation that you can just kind of brute force the input space."
[Dave]
Okay. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Carson]
Right?
So little--
[Carson]
But the input space is small.
[Carson]
"Yeah, just a few bits change in each of these steps, so you can just go through all the possibilities of input space and see which ones map back to your output."
Right?
"Now, you may end up with several, so it's not always that only one of the inputs would have produced."
That's exactly the nonlinear property.
"However, this may look as a complication at first but does, in fact, help the hacker because each of these also generates a key for some given IV that you assume."
"Well, at least some."
Some may be dead ends.
But at least in a lot of cases you can track one point that you store in your table back to different keys. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Dave]
I see.
Different starting key IV pairs lead to the same output.
"Exactly, and on average, for each value that you store in the table you have 13 keys that you find every time."
Only one of them will be the correct one.
Sometimes even all 13 are wrong. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Dave]
I see.
[Carson]
But if you do find a key it will just be one of them.
"However, storing this point in the table is equivalent to storing 13 points in this table."
[Dave]
"Right, and now each lookup is the equivalent of doing 13 lookups."
[Carson]
"No, the lookup is actually the same effort, but the storage is decreased."
The letting go one is the hardest one for people to understand because they don't know what they're supposed to let go off.
"It's not letting go of the grief, it's letting go of the person that doesn't want the grief."
It's letting go of the controlling.
"Because sometimes when people have grief, disappointment, broken heart, anger, fear, when we try and do letting go we think letting go means destroying those emotions."
That's disrespect to those emotions.
"Instead, we let go of that person inside who's trying to do something about this, the controller, the one who says ""I don't want these emotions, I have to get rid of them""."
That's the thing we have to let go of.
The control-freak.
"So if you have those emotions inside of you and you try to suppress them, get rid of them, destroy them, of course what happens - they get worse."
"If you're fed up and you say ""I shouldn't be fed up"", that's what we call being fed up about being fed up."
[laughter].
We have something called suffering - the word for suffering in Buddhism is dukkha.
We call such things double-dukkha.
It's like I'm angry
"- ""I shouldn't be angry!"
"I'm a monk!""."
You're getting angry at being angry.
"You're depressed, and I'm fed up with being.., I don't want to be depressed anymore!"
You're being depressed about being depressed!
Or you're afraid of fear.
Those are called double-dukkha.
Double-suffering.
And of course from double-suffering we go into the next stage of treble-suffering.
[laughter].
I'm angry about being angry about being angry.
I'm so sad about being sad about being grieving.
Now this is actually what people do.
"They actually build it up by their reactions of trying to get rid of things, controlling things."
"The first part of the Buddhist reaction, the wise reaction, is just accept this is your reality."
"Let it go, let it be if you like."
"So stop messing around with these emotions in this moment, stop adding negativity to the emotions you're experiencing right now."
"If someone is grieving for the loss of a child, or they're disappointed because a relationship they cherished is no longer viable, or if they're afraid - be honest to that fear."
"An emergency fund could take the form of cash, checking accounts, savings account money market funds or even certificate deposits at a bank or a credit union."
"These funds, should not be subject to any sort of major market risk."
"Some people might consider equity in their house or access to their credit part of their emergency fund, but, still a foundation of cash and cash equivelants is, is, still the best and very important, because access to credit could suddenly dry up or be hard to get in an emergency."
An emergency fund is also vital to tapping into assets I'm sorry emergency fund is also vital to avoid tapping into assets that may have been earmarked for your long-term goals.
"In the next lesson, we'll talk about setting some financial goals."
"Have you ever stood naked, in front of the mirror?"
And looked at yourself?

Time to get up
And what was I thinking planning that cruise!?
What am I doing?
I'm not going

You've been planning this for a years
"I've ironed the shorts, you were looking forward last night."
They're already packed.*
"Shorts packed, check"
I'm going to show you one last technique.
"And in fact, we're going to put quotes around the word better, but it does better than even this kind of binary search, and that's a method called hashing."
"You've actually seen hashing, you just don't know it."
Hashing is the the technique that's used in Python to represent dictionaries.
Hashing is used when you actually come in to Logan
Airport and Immigration or Homeland Security checks your picture against a database.
Hashing is used every time you enter a password into a system.
So what in the world is hashing?
"Well, let me start with a simple little example."
Suppose I want to represent a collection of integers.
This is an easy little example.
And I promise you that the integers are never going to be anything other than between the range of zero to nine.
"OK, so it might be the collection of one and five."
"It might be two, three, four, eight."
"I mean some collection of integers, but I guarantee you it's between zero and nine."
Here's the trick I can play.
"I can build -- I can't count -- I could build a list with spots for all of those elements, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."
"And then when I want to create my set, I could simply put a one everywhere that that integer falls."
"So if I wanted to represent, for example, this is the set two, six and eight, I put a one in those slots."
"This seems a little weird, but bear with me for second, in fact, I've given you a little piece a code to do it, which is the next piece of code on the hand out."
So let's take a look at it for second.
This little set of code here from create insert and number.
What's create do?
"It says, given a low and a high range, in this case it would be zero to nine."
I'm going to build a list.
"Right, you can see that little loop going through there."
What am I doing?
I'm creating a list with just that special symbol none in it.
So I'm building the list.
I'm returning that as my set.
"And then to create the object, I'll simply do a set of inserts."
"If I want the values two, six and eight in there, I would do an insert of two into that set, an insert of six into that set, and an insert of eight into the set."
And then this 1 is right over here.
"So now, I think we are ready to think about what would happen if we wanted to make 50 houses."
So let's try to do that.
Let me do that in orange.
This right over here is our 50th house.
So this is the shared left wall it has.
This is the 50th house right over here.
So how many total toothpicks for 50 houses?
"So if we have 50 houses, well, we can use the pattern that we came up with."
"It's going to be equal to, starting with our 6, the first house requires 6."
"And then we're going to add 5 for each incremental house, so plus 5 for each incremental house."
And how many incremental houses are there going to be?
"Well, there are going to be 50 minus 1 incremental houses."
Why minus 1?
"Well, you already built one of them with the 6."
Then for every extra one-- so there's going to be 49 extra houses-- you're going to add 5 toothpicks apiece.
So this is going to be equal to 6 plus 5 times 49.
And that is 245.
So 6 plus 245 is equal to 251 sticks.
And what's really neat about this pattern we just came up with is you could use it to figure out how many sticks you would need for a million of these little toothpick townhouses.
What is hypothesis testing in the constant expected return models?
So what are the kinds of things that we can test hypotheses about?
"So our model says continuously compounded returns are equal to a constant mean return plus a random, noise component that represents news that enters the market."
"This noise component is assumed to be, independent identically distributed as a normal random variable with mean zero and a constant volatility."
"And we also assume that covariances, contemporary covariances between assets are constant."
As well.
So there are a number of things that we could test in this model.
So here are some examples of. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Possibly interesting hypothesis test.
We can test for specific values.
"For example, we can test hypothesis that the mean return is equal to some particular value."
For example we can say we want to test hypotheses that the mean return on
Microsoft is two percent per month.
One last thing about prerequisites.
Algebra and Statistics are other formal subject matters that we need and I think even this for everything.
"With so much data available on anything under the sun, knowing Algebra and Statistics is very important, and I hope my treatment of the s ubject matter will motivate you to learn a lot more."
Rather than seeing it as a hurdle to understanding things.
So these are the formal things you could think about.
But don't worry about it.
"As I said, if you have curiousity and a bad attitude."
"And a bad attitude is one which says, you know, give me anything."
"I'll, I'll handle it."
"If you have that attitude, you will do very well in this class, and you'll learn a ton."
"Not just in this class, in life."
"And so, bring that attitude, and we'll be fine."
"Now, I'll talk about something that's very important and it's called Pedagogy."
How do I conduct the class?
"This class, because of the value of Finance being both theory, framework, and practical, is all driven by problem solving."
"I will always force you to do problems, because that's how you learn."
What does that mean?
Everything I introduce in class will not be preceded by a formula.
"Finance is a lot of Algebra, a"
lot of formulas but I will always tell you why we are doing something not what it's all about.
"Why is far more important in life than the what, the what you can"
Google right?
"So if you can Google and get what I'm providing you in the class, I'm not providing you much."
"So because Finance is applied, we'll emphasize problem solving, and everything will be introduced with an example."
"However, I want you to recognize that you have to do most of the work."
"I'm a coach, you have to do the work."
"I hope I'm a good coach and I motivate you and give you the main issues you need to worry about, right?"
"In life, there are not that many issues, four or five."
One is love.
"The rest is, kinda follows a little bit."
Number two is financing my book.
"But anyway, so you'll be doing assignments every week and I encourage you whether they're called quizzes or not, quizzes or assignment, do them."
For example:
Negative two fifths X equals ten.
In this lesson you will learn to solve linear equations by using the multiplicative inverse.
Let's review.
The equation is similar to a scale.
Both sides of the scale have to be equal in order for the scale to balance.
The properties of equality say that
"I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide the same number  to each side of an equation and it will be true."
"So, to solve the equation X plus two is equal to five,"
I will subtract two from both sides of the equation.
This will still keep the equation equal.
This leaves me with X is equal to three.
"It looks like three is the solution for this equation, but we won't know if it's really a solution until we try it."
"So, let's replace three for X."
"So, in our equation we have X plus two equals five."
"When we replace three for X, we get three plus two equals five."
"Five is equal to five, so three is the solution."
A common mistake that is made when solving equations is not performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.
The multiplicative inverse of a number is the reciprocal of the number.
"So, if I have a number, seventeen-fifths, its inverse is the reciprocal, which would be five-seventeenths."
"When you multiply these two numbers together, you get one."
"So, the multiplicative inverse of the number, times the number, gives you one."
What is the solution of four-thirds X equals four?
"We're going to solve this equation by multiplying  both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of four thirds, which is three-fourths."
"Now, don't forget that three-fourths time four-thirds doesn't cancel out, but it multiplies out to be one."
"So, I'm left with X is equal to twelve over four, or X is equal to three."
"Now, remember, in order for it to be a solution we have to make sure that we place it back in the original equation and it's true."
"So, to check my answer:"
I have four-thirds X equals four.
I'm going to substitute three in for X.
And I get four is equal to four.
"So, three is the solution for this equation."
And are you any more intelligent than a small little novice.
Why is it that these emotions they catch us.
And why is it?
"Because we don't see them coming, we encourage them too much."
"Every time we think negatively,"
"""oh, the ghost is going to come to us"" or we think negatively ""I'm going to lose my job"" or we think negatively ""I'm going to get that cancer."
I'm going to get it.
I know
I'm going to get it.
"Now I'm fine but I am."""
"When you think negatively like that you're building up the emotions, the emotions you get are built up by many many moments of unskillful attitudes and thoughts."
But now we have them.
So once you know where they come from you know they're actually created.
"At least if you know that you create them, you actually bring them together, even like grief.."
Why do you have to have grief when somebody dies?
Why can't we just celebrate that fact that we've known these people for such a long time.
What a wonderful time we had together.
Now we just let them go.
"You never cry for the person who's died, you always cry for yourself."
At your loss - nothing to do with them..
So when we understand that we can do something about these things it gives us a possibility to actually to transcend those negative emotions.
"Because when you think about it, reflect upon it, what good does grief do?"
It doesn't help the person who's dead.
It doesn't help yourself.
It's not what the dead person really wants from you - they don't want you to be unhappy and to cry all those hours and days.
"If someone really loved you and you loved them, they want you to be happy, to live your life in as much fullness and joy as you possibly can."
If you really revere their memory surely that's what you should do.
Not to grieve for them but to be happy for them.
"For you to be happy, for them."
"So when we can change our attitudes that way, when we can actually do something about our grief, or like our anger - what good does anger do?"
"Every time you get angry at your partner they don't do what you want them to do, they don't get better - they usually get worse!"
So why get angry and shout at them for?
"Now, what I want to think about is how these characters will change their state due to their incentives."
Then we'll talk a little bit about Nash Equilibrium as well.
"On this axis, up here, lets' say this is one of the competitors."
"This is where they produce 25, and let's say on the ultimate cheating quantity of 75, and this is somewhat close to the market, or that is the equilibrium quantity if this was perfect competition, they produce half of that, so this is them producing 37.5 units."
"As we go from 25 to 37.5 units, they are cheating more."
"This is more cheating and over here, this was no cheating."
We can do the same thing for the blue player.
I'll write them as B. This is them producing 25.
This is them producing 37.5.
"As we go up and up and up, they are cheating more."
"This is a lot of cheating, or more cheating."
"To think of it in a Game theoretical way, this is the Pareto optimal state right over here."
It's optimal in many ways.
This is they've maximized the total economic profit here.
There's no other state that one person would benefit without making the other worse.
"Now, let's think about whether this is a Nash equilibrium."
Let's remind oursleves what Nash equilibrium was.
"This was a state where holding all the other players constant, so in this case there's only one other player, a player can't gain by changing strategy."
"In this case, changing strategy is changing your output."
Let's see if that is true of this state right over here.
"Well, let's hold A constant."
"If A is constant, we're in this column right over here."
"Is there something B can do, is there change or strategy B can do, that would allow B to gain?"
Sure.
B can increase production.
That's what we saw in the last video.
We would go from this bottom right state to one right above it.
"Now B's economic profit is 280, A's is 200."
"The pie has shrunk, but B has got a larger chunk of it."
That was not a Nash equilibrium.
"There is, holding all others constant, there is a player that can gain by changing their strategy."
"The Nash equilibrium definition, just to make sure, they say it's a state where holding others constant no player can gain by changing strategy."
So that was 2001 when I was fired.
[Question]
Yes.
The question was:
"""The open web is here today it's easy to see why it's important back then in those days before the open web, how did you know?"
"What makes you willing to risk your job?"""
"We'd been working on a browser for a while, so we could tell that the browser was important."
"It was clear at that time, when Microsoft had maybe 90-95% market share in the browser, in the operating system and in the productivity suites,"
"Office and Excel, which were the only things that people used in those days."
"And so it was clear that in those days,"
Microsoft controlled access to the Internet.
We didn't call it the open web then but it was the Internet and we knew it was great.
"It was very clear that by controlling the browser,"
Microsoft controlled how individual people experienced the Internet.
"That the server side of the Internet in those days was developing, growing and becoming richer and more capable."
"But the client side was deteriorating and through that client,"
Microsoft was able to ignore formats to make vast quantities of content unavailable to people.
And to determine the business model through which you could access content and to have an immense influence over the entire structure of the Internet.
So that much was clear.
It sounds melodramatic but the future of the Internet was already an issue at that point.
It was very clear the browser was the leverage point.
We were very clear about our jobs.
"One second, I'm gonna tell a couple of stories and then I'll get you Chris."
But we were very clear that our jobs were on the line.
It wasn't just me.
It was everyone I named and Marcia.
Is Marcia here?
I didn't see her hand go up.
But we would have meanings as the small group that was mozilla.org when the tensions got really high and we would get together and we would say things like
"""What happens if AOL pulls the plug?"
What happens if we're all fired tomorrow?
"How do we keep Mozilla operating?"""
"For a while, we were real high alert."
We sat there in the airplanes with the...
With two of everything ready to go.
"And we put an extra 26,000 pounds of fuel onboard so we can carry like 90,000 pounds of fuel, so we can fly for a day and a half."
"Because if you found them, and you dropped the... you'd stay on station to... but it was all contingency and fortunately we never had to use it."
"They'd always come down, the Navy picked them up."
It was great.
"So, what you were doing - you'd, in the event they couldn't be picked up because of rough seas or something, you would - ?"
"No, we were there say they come down off the coast of Argentina"
"Okay someplace that they just circled the orbit or whatever and it might have happened, you know."
"So, all these orbits, you can see on the maps where they circle over Russia or over China."
"And like I said, our planes there, they didn't even hesitate, they just come right out... the capsule comes down in your territory, there'll be a C-130 within a couple hours right there and you don't touch it, you don't do anything, and you definitely don't touch the airplane coming in."
"And then if they can land, of course they would."
"Otherwise, the paramedics would jump out and do their thing."
Wouldn't need the flotation stuff but that was just a contingency because it was so primitive.
"You've seen the capsules, you know."
"If something malfunctioned, or functioned too good then they'd push those little jet streams on there and they either could go 2,000 miles one way or the other."
"So, like I said, it was a job."
And I don't know which ones I've met.
My flight orders don't show that.
"It just shows, you know..."
And it was partly to reassure them that you'd be there and the contingency that's why the astronauts flew with you
"Well, yeah, that, and just for their ideas."
Yes.
We were cargo haulers and we dropped thousands of parachute troopers.
"We dropped 80 at a time, 4 or 5 times a day."
You'd drop a couple 300 or 400 a day sometimes.
So we knew how to air drop and different ways of doing it.
"Low level, you know."
So that wasn't the deal.
The deal was you have to put these paramedics out at the capsule in the middle of the ocean and it didn't make any difference if - the army won't drop if it's over ten or twelve miles an hour wind.
We put these guys out in gale winds.
Ole:
It could of course be true
Martin:
But it is also different to compete in the artistic substance than just compete in who can jump highest; ... and run the fastest... is there a difference in these things?
Ole:
"Yes but unfortunately they did that too but they had competitions in oratory and theater and so on, as you mention but it is a competition where you will be honored by the community as well as there's competitions in the immediate self sacrifice for the community that isthe greatest honor that can happen to you"
"Whoever wins this contest winner on behalf of the community and it's not how competition works in our culture but it may well be that competition as a phenomenon has paid off just like the life struggle has done because if people had not been forced to work for a living, perhaps they had not created ​​the things they have"
Martin:
So it's a side effect we are talking about and not competition in general?
Ole:
"No, it's very complicated."
Martin:
But then you're now touching the whole basis of the free market
Ole:
What it has led to're highly problematic and where they have attempted to tie them through government controls have indeed created some absolutely terrible results
Martin:
So it could have been done otherwise?
Ole:
Then it really should be done otherwise!
You have to prevent a concentration of power and one can only imagine the slow transitions
Martin: but we havn't got the time..
Ole:
"No, we havn't got the time if we are to achieve it within your prediction horizon"
Martin:
What would you do first if you were to start a positive process now?
Ole:
"Then we should start tomorrow already by going out in town and tell every person you meet no matter if you know the them or not, something nice about them ...and then see what happens.."
It's actually not that easy..
Martin:
"It's probably not so easy, no... and if everyone did it at once.. it would be a great day for everyone.."
Ole:
"A fantastic day, right.."
New paragraph
I will leave my contact information in the description of this video.
"Okay, but just that you don't think that I trained Simon specifically for that text, I'm gonna dictate something ... ... from the web as well"
"So, let's actually have a look at The Verge... ... and let's pick the middle one for whatever reason."
And try to dictate that
Let's go ahead
"Google's made good on a promise today, rolling out voice calling through it's hangouts messaging service."
"Basically, it works just like video calling - you can call one person or many with a click of a button in ... ..."
"Google+, Gmail or the Chrome extension, and the whacky Hangouts effects are even in play - except it allows you to call phone numbers."
"You can even mix and match video and voice calling, so your friends without hangouts won't be shut out of your chatting."
"For having desecrated holy territory, exemplary punishment"
Uh... chief?
"You, shut your mouth"
You choose death or tchetche?
Whats tchetche?
Tchetche is....tchetche.
"Then okay, I'll take tchetche."
TCHETCHE!!!
"And you stranger, death or tchetche?"
Uh death...... please.
"Okay, but before that, TCHETCHE!!"
Welcome to the archeology news!
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, tonight we'll travel in time to shed light on an interesting event of past human history."
We'll use a biological time machine: cattle DNA.
The DNA is the code of life.
It contains all the information needed for the correct functioning of living organisms.
"Geneticists represent it as an alphabet, with four letters."
"They are chemical basis, represented as letters."
"These letters and the associated code are transmitted from parents to progeny, across generations."
The DNA duplication machinery is not error free.
Letters may be mistyped and errors transmitted to progeny.
These mutations create the genetic variation that is at the row material shaped by evolution and speciation.
"Of course, we need it for ATP, we need it to build the phosphate sugar backbone of DNA, and we need it for energy transmission and so forth; all life needs it for that."
But it is really pretty scarce in the crust.
So it is usually limiting.
"Now if you just go out there and you pour a bunch of phosphate into the landscape, this is what you get."
Okay?
"You get lakes filled with algal blooms, and that is showing you the dramatic response of-- the algal population and plant population in lakes is showing you that phosphorous really is the limiting factor."
"So phosphate fertilizer is very important in agro-ecosystems, and phosphate fertilizer gets washed into lakes and fish die."
Why do fish die in an eutrophic lake that has a lot of algae in it?
What's killing them?
Yes?
Student:
"Because when the algae becomes decomposed, those &amp;gt; will take a lot of it and change it into nitrogen. &amp;gt;"
Prof:
"Well you've got it right about anoxia, but you got the mechanism wrong."
"By the way, the bottom of a eutrophic lake is anoxic and the process you described is going on there."
But the algae don't have to die to do that.
Student: &amp;gt;
Prof:
Well the algae certainly are taking the sunlight out of the top of the water.
But when does the oxygen disappear from the lake?
"I remember the bad joke about the astronaut who was not so bright, who said, ""Ah, we are going to take our new spacecraft and we are going to"
"land on the sun."""
"And he was asked, ""How are you ever going to"
"land on the sun?"""
"And he said, ""Don't worry, we are going at night."""
It happens at night.
At night the algae are all there.
"They're not making oxygen because there's no photons coming in, but they still have to breathe themselves, and they just suck all the oxygen out of the water and the fish are asphyxiated."
They don't have to die to do it.
They're just naturally living their lives as normal healthy algae and they suck the oxygen out of the water at night.
"Okay, so some take-home points on ecosystems."
"Movement of matter and energy around the planet is really important, and there are some really interesting large-scale issues."

[Ball to You remix playing]
Captioned by SpongeSebastian
-And that will conclude Elmo's order.
Let's say I have an n-by-n matrix that looks like this.
So let me just see if I can do it in general terms.
"In the first row and first column, that entry has a 1, and then everything else, the rest of the n minus 1 rows in that first column are all going to be zeroes."
So it's going to be zeroes all the way down to the nth term.
"And then the second column, we have a 0 in the first component, but then a 1 in the second component."
And then it goes zeroes all the way down.
And you keep doing this.
"In the third row, or let me say third column, although it would've applied to the third row as well, the 1 shows up in the third component, and then it's zeroes all the way down."
"Essentially, you have the ones filling up the diagonal of this matrix right here."
"So if you go all the way to the nth column or the nth column vector, you have a bunch of zeroes until you get-- you have n minus 1 zeroes, and then the very last component, the nth component there will be a 1."
"So you have essentially, a matrix with ones down the diagonal."
"Now, this matrix has a bunch of neat properties and we'll explore it more in the future."
But I'm just exposing you to this because it has one very neat property relative to linear transformations.
"But I'm going to call this the identity matrix and I'll call this I sub n, and I called that sub n because it's an n-by-n identity matrix."
"I sub 2 would be equal to a 2-by-2 identity matrix, so it would look like that."
And I sub 3 would look like this:
"1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1."
I think you get the point.
"Now, the neat thing about this identity matrix becomes evident when you multiply it times any vector."
"We can multiply this guy times the n-component vector, a member of Rn."
So let's do that.
You might not know it at the time but I call them growing pains.
"Your heart is growing when it's crying, when it's hurt"
"- it's part of things, so allow it to be."
"Be with it and you'll find out why it was there for you, what it's teaching was."
When somebody dies it tells you the value of life.
When you break up with someone you love it tells you how valuable relationships are.
When you get disappointed it tells you just how your expectations were far far too unreal.
"When somebody dies, it shows that your time here is not that long, so I must make better use of it."
"All of these so-called negative experiences they're all teachers, so we should never reject them."
Allow them to come intro our heart.
Make good kamma with the bad kamma you're experiencing now.
That way we grow and those positive emotions become stronger and stronger inside of us.
"We become beacons to the world, people who don't get afraid, don't get angry, who don't have grief."
"But have lots of kindness, lots of joy, huge amounts of peace."
Positive emotions grow at the expense of the negative ones.
They grow and grow and grow.
This is actually the path.
What a wonderful thing it is to cherish and nurture these beautiful positive emotions of life.
"Understand where they come from, nurture them, grow them, the negative ones become less and less a part of your repertoire."
"You don't get angry, you get very kind."
"You don't get depressed, you just get wonderfully inspired."
"You don't get so fault-finding, you'd be grateful in the smallest of things, even in..."
"I shouldn't say that, I was going to say a small John Howard."
The smallest of things.. [laughter].
"I shouldn't give him a hard time, he's not a bad guy."
And that way we can have a happier
"life and we can understand the role of emotions in life, how to deal with them, how embrace them, how to generate the positive ones and have a happy time."
"So may you all have a happy time by developing the positive emotions, understanding the negative ones, and understanding how this all works."
"So that's the talk for this evening, thank you very much for listening."
Audience:
"Sadhu, Sadhu, Sadhu"
Ajahn Brahm:
"A high school reunion brings some 50 former students to Riceville, Iowa."
"Eleven of them--some with their spouses and children--arrive early for a special reunion with their former third-grade teacher, Jane Elliott."
This presentation is delivered by the Stanford Center for Professional
Development.
Hey there!
"Oh, we're back."
We're back and now we're getting down and dirty.
"We'll do more pointers, and link"
"list, and implementations."
It's actually going to be like our life for the next week and half.
"There's just even more implementation, trying to think about how those things work on the backside."
So
I will do another alternate implementation of the stack today.
So we did one based on vector and we're going to do one based on a link list.
"And then I'm going to do a cube based on link list, as well, to kind of just mix and match a little bit."
"And then, we're still at the end of the case study, which the material is covered in Chapter 9."
I probably won't get thorough all of that today.
"What we don't finish today we'll be talking about on Friday, and then we'll go on to start talking about map implementation and look at binary search trees."
How many people started [inaudible]?
How many of you got somewhere feeling good?
Not just yet.
"One thing I will tell you is that there are two implementations you're working on and I listed them in the order of the one that the material we've seen the most, right."
We've talked about link list more than we have talked about things that are tree and heat based.
So I listed that one first.
"But, in fact, actually, in terms of difficulty of coding,"
"I think, the second one is little bit more attractable than the first."
So there's no reason you can't do them in either order if it feels good to you to start on the second one before you come back to the first one.
"Or just trade off between working on them if one of them is giving you fits just look at the other one to clear your head, so just a thought about how to approach it."
Okay.
So I am going to do some coding.
I'm going to come back to my slides in a little bit here.
It just doesn't solve the problem and doesn't actually fulfill its promises.
"And just was it in January, when I was going off to Indonesia to give a series of talks I got to Perth airport and found that the Garuda flight was cancelled."
It was actually delayed by about 18 hours.
"And I was a monk so I just went up to the counter and said, ""Oh is it delayed?"
When is it going to leave?
18 hours.
"Okay, thank you very much,"" and I sort-of called the monastery and got a lift back to the monastery."
"But the people behind me they were thumping the counter - ""You can't do this to us!"
"I've got all of these arrangements and plans!"" I had arrangements and plans as well - thousands of people were waiting to listen to my talks."
But I couldn't do anything about it.
And you know all that anger and all that thumping and all that shouting.. it didn't make the plane leave earlier.
It didn't do anything good at all except making people upset.
"Themselves upset, and other people upset."
So really what is the use of anger?
You can intimidate somebody for a short time but they will always want revenge.
They won't respect you.
"And if you're a boss they'll only do what you want, they'll only do what you want for the time being, only because you're there."
They won't do what you've asked them out of respect.
Just out of fear.
And that's no way to have any sort of relationship or any sort of business.
Really anger doesn't make any sense to me.
So anger and fear and grief and depression these are negative emotions.
So first of all when these happen what should we do about them?
There's something in Buddhism called the second factor of the eightfold path.
The eightfold path is a way to happiness to enlightenment and the second factor is one of my favourite factors of that path.
It's called right intention or right attitude.
And I love that because it is an attitude which we have to everything we deal with in life.
Whether it's the physical world or the emotional world.
The path to enlightenment hinges on our attitude to things.
"So if you have depression or anger or grief, what should one's reaction be?"
"And the three parts of right attitude in Buddhism - second factor of the eightfold path - is letting go, kindness and gentleness."
The three factors.
I'll give you a couple of examples.
"Schools are still pretty much organized on factory lines - ringing bells, separate facilities, specialized into separate subjects."
We still educate children by batches.
"You know, we put them through the system by age group."
Why do we do that?
"You know, why is there this assumption that the most important thing kids have in common is how old they are?"
"You know, it's like the most important thing about them is their date of manufacture"
"Well, I know kids who are much better than other kids at the same age in different disciplines, you know, or at different times of the day, or better in smaller groups then in large groups, or sometimes they want to be on their own."
"If you're interested in the model of learning, you don't start from this production line mentality."
"These are, it's essentially about conformity."
And increasingly it's about that as you look at the growth  of standardized testing and standardized curricula.
And it's about standardization.
I believe we've got to go in the exact opposite direction.
That's what I mean about changing the paradigm.
"There was a great study done recently of divergent thinking, published a couple of years ago."
Divergent thinking isn't the same thing as creativity.
I define creativity as the process of having original ideas  that have value.
Divergent thinking isn't a synonym.
But it's an essential capacity for creativity.
"It's the ability to see lots of possible answers to a question,"
lots of possible ways of interpreting a question.
"To think, what Edward de Bono would probably call laterally."
"To think, not just in linear or convergent ways."
"To see multiple answers, not one."
"So, I mean, there are tests for this."
"I mean, one kind of cod example would be, people might be asked to say how many uses can you think of for a paper clip."
Those routine questions.
Most people might come with 10 or 15.
People who are good at this might come up with 200.
"And they do that by saying, well, could the paper clip be turned, and a foot tall, and be made out of foam rubber."
"You know, like, does it have to be a paper clip as we know it, Jim."
"Now, there are tests for this."
For the most part we have acting out kids altogether.
"But, he, academically he does very, very well when he wants to do it."
"I don't know, some days I can go into school, sit down, not say a word, do everything."
"And everyone will say, wish we could have Adam like this all day without his hat on, without him talking, doing all his work, asking for more work."
And other days it's like Adam comes in and starts goofing off.
So real high school turned out to be another missed opportunity.
He's a fragile guy right now.
"You know, I want him to be successful."
"But when you don't give a student what they need, the potential for really falling apart and giving up is so high that you really have to factor that in."
It's a possibility.
A year later the school has expelled Adam for poor behavior.
"Once again, adrift,"
Adam has held a variety of odd jobs.
And his mother fears he is back on drugs and alcohol.
"When I was a little kid I dreamed of going to college, going to school."
But I haven't finished high school so I can't go to college.
Now I have no high school diploma so I just work full time.
It's like what else do I have?
Nothing.
I see kids every single day that are like Adam.
And sometimes I can get to them.
And sometimes I can help them.
And sometimes they slip by.
But there's no reason that Adam needed to slip by.
We had Adam.
We had a hold on Adam.
"What Adam needed, the experts say, was the hardest thing to get, early recognition of his problems and a consistent plan for dealing with them."
In some states the size of prisons are predicted on the basis of third grade and fourth grade literacy rates.
"So it does portend an alienation from society, in a sense."
"And it's for those reasons, these downstream consequences of loss of self esteem, poor academic development, limited vocabulary and other cognitive developments, difficulties with social relations, difficulties getting and holding jobs, and getting in trouble with the law that we consider reading problems to not only to be an educational issue but a public health issue and a public health concern as well."
Now Adam's parents are left with what they had at the very beginning but only that they still have hope.
You change your dreams.
Is there indifference or is there passion?
Passion is the measure of a media business that has valued for the long term.
"You can get away with selling ads for a while for example to large numbers of casual people, but they pretty well will knew, passion is how you build a community, how something takes on a life of its own."
"And, what I saw at TED was not only what the 800 people there -- you know, really influential people!"
But they had a level of attention that was way off the charts.
"I mean, they were there for 4 days."
They were focused.
They were engaged.
They used words like  'this is the highlight of my year'.
"I mean, this was a media thing that just exhibited extraordinary passion."
"So, I thought"
TED is amazing.
"And I also thought, Wow, it's an incredibly potent media asset, if you like, in the making."
"There's something really, really amazing here."
"So, I started to dream about whether there might be some way I could play a bigger role."
"And you know, to cut a long and complicated and occasionally painful story short, 2001, a foundation that I had set up found itself as the proud owner of TED and I got to run it, and I was terrified."
"First of all, business I'd been building had been smacked hard by the dot-com bust."
I'd had to lay off a thousand people off the workforce.
I knew that it was time for me too to leave.
I felt like an abject failure.
"If I failed at TED as well, there would be nowhere to hide."
It also didn't help that I knew nothing about the conference business.
(Laughter)
"Or, that I had none of Richard Wurman -- who had been the sole owner --"
I had nothing of his huge stage presence.
"So, the goal number one was ""Don't screw it up."""
(Laughter)
"And, I worked really hard to figure out, what was it about TED so special?"
"""Don't touch that."
"Only tweaks."""
"Some of the early tweaks included professionalizing the logistics of TED, courtesy of these two amazing Canadian twins, the McCartney sisters, who put on events with attention to detail that I hadn't seen before."
"And then as far as the program was concerned, it was just continue this process, make it -- continue the process of broadening it out, you know, bring in more people, brought in more scientists, more out-of-the-box thinkers, more non-Americans, more women."
The system is off its rocker.
"To conclude, some food for thought."
"First, for the Zande, there's a no concept of absolute evil."
There's no abstract evil force or double.
There are only humans who do evil things.
Evil happens.
Rather than exists.
It happens in witchcraft carried out by neighbors and even family members.
"Neighbors aren't evil in and of themselves, usually your buddies."
"But once their witchcraft heats up, evil things can happen."
"Second, witchcraft is a total system."
"The belief in witchcraft not only explains why bad things happen, but it offers a possibility for families to fight for the health of their loved ones."
"Furthermore, because of their belief in witchcraft, the Zande do their best not to upset their neighbors and not to outdo their neighbors."
"And finally, people who believe in witchcraft are not like aliens from outer space."
"Their rational, intelligent people just like us who do their best and their particular cultural, social, historical, and environmental context to find meaning in their world."
Franz Boas has said that tradition late shackles upon all of us.
"People who grow up in Zande Land, such as these children, are as unaware of the shackles of their traditions as people growing up in the American Midwest."
"If everyone around us is wearing the same shackles, it's hard to see them."
"I think the world would be a safer, more livable place if we recognize the shackles that tradition has laid upon us, and that can lead us to believe that our worldview is the only bright one."
"For then, we'd be able to respect the validity and the beauty of other belief systems, including witchcraft."
Thank you very much.

Beth:
We're looking at a lovely little Friedrich in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin called Woman at a Window.
"Like so many of Friedrich's paintings, we see a single figure from behind."
Steven:
This is his wife and his studio in Dresden.
"We see her back, but we don't stay there."
"Instead, somehow we begin to imagine what she sees as she looks out this window."
Beth:
We imagine her life in what seems like a rather constricted environment and this really rather small view of the outside world.
"Stone standing over our hero, who's been drugged and bound and gagged."
[music]
And we have this fight.
[music]
"It's an incredibly violent fight, but made much more tense, because no one in the scene can speak, our hero has been gagged."
The rescuers mute and of course the captain dare not say anything cause he doesn't want to bring the attention of the crew to them.
At the same time we hear off screen that calypso song.
[music]
"Which adds more tension because it really illustrates the distance between what everyone else on the crew is experiencing, and the horrors that are going on in this cabin."
How unaware they are.
"And also gives this counter point, which makes what we see on the screen all the more horrible."
Compared to the happy song going on off-screen.
"Worse and wells would learn about this, would learn from this."
[music]
In touch of evil.
[music]
"And Quentin Tarantino, of course uses the same technique of sound counterpoint to violence quite a lot."
"This is one of the first times, it's not the first time that I've seen it in a Hollywood film in 1943."
[music]
"And it comes from this B film from Lewton and Robson made at RKO. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; This is secure. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; And of course, then, we come back to the voice over."
"And the odd thing is, Finn is supposed to be reassuring us that everything is fine."
"But if there's anybody who can't reassure us of anything, it would be Finn."
Especially when it's combined with this
"low key lighting in the bridge, and on the ship."
"And I dare you to call this a happy ending, in the end we come back to a place that's like the one where the film began."
"And it's important that when our hero goes and meets the new girl, who we don't see, we see only her shadow."
We feel the entire cycle beginning again this is our new Stone.
Because becoming a captain of ship losing yourself in work leads to this isolated madness in this world.
Now that is an overview how the film uses sound but the film also has these two set pieces.
Two moments that are there to push the audience to the edge of sanity by terrifying them.
And one set piece involves a hook and the other one involves a chain.
Now I recommend you go back and listen and think about how the chain sequence works.
But that's cheating.
And it hurts your throat.
"So there's things you can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me."
"If only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it."
"So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine."
"We've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music production machine, and it enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me."
And I'm going to show you what it can do.
"And before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice,"
I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice.
"This system has -- thank you, beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind."
"So once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple."
So the polyphony problem:
I've only got one voice.
How do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time.
The simplest way to do it is something like this.
(Beatboxing)
By dancing.
It's like this.
(Music)
Thanks.
(Applause)
So that's probably the easiest way.
"But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up."
"There's things like pitch-shifting, which are awesome, and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like."
"So I'm going to start another beat for you, like this."
(Beatboxing)
"There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can clap along if you want."
You don't have to.
It's fine.
Check it out.
I'm going to lay down a bass sound now.
(Music)
Find operation requires a little more work.
"So let's look at the Implementation, a demo of that one in operation first."
"So again we, we start out the same way but now the idea array entry really means that every one of these things is a little tree where the one node each everyone pointing to itself."
"It's the root of it's own tree so now if we have to put four and three in the same component, then all we do is we take the root, of the component containing the first item and make that a child of the root of the component, component containing the second item."
In this case we just make four as parent three.
So now three and eight.
"So again, we take the first item and make it a child of the root of the tree containing the second item."
"So now three, four, and eight are in the same component."
Six and five six goes below five.
"Nine and four, So now four is the root of the tree containing four is eight."
And the root of tree containing nine is nine.
And so we make nine a child of eight.
"Two and one, that's an easy one."
"Now if we get our, our eight and nine connected, we just checked that they have the same root and they both have the same root eight and so they're connected."
Five and four 4's root is eight.
5's root is five.
They're different.
They're not connected.
Five and zero.
Five goes to be a child of zero.
Seven and two seven goes to be a child of 2's root which is one.
Six and one.
"6's route is zero 1's its own route, so zero becomes a child of one."
Each one of these union operations just involves changing one entry in the array.
"And finally, seven and three."
"So seven's root is one, three's root is eight, one becomes a child of eight."
Okay and now we have one connected component with all the items together.
"Alright, so now let's look at the code for implementing Quick-union."
The constructor is the same as the other one.
We create the array and then set each element to be it's own root.
"Now we have a private method that implements this process of finding the root by chasing parent pointers until we get to the point where I is equal to ID of I, and if it's not equal, we just move I up one level in the tree, set I equals ID of I and return it."
"So starting at any node, you just follow ID equals ID of I until they're equal and then you're at a root and that's a private method that we can use to implement the find operation or the connected operation."
"No way."""
"So Les did a finer study, and he found out it came out about 9,000."
"Using different microsatellites gave the different results, but the mean of all these studies is about 5,000, which I personally don't believe."
"But then, I am a skeptic."
"But even if you toss a few numbers around, you're probably talking an effective population of about 20,000 animals."
Do you remember how many they killed off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?
"So what it tells us, actually, is that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small."
"In fact, of those 20,000, 8,000 were thought to be females."
"There's only 8,000 basking shark females in the world?"
I don't know.
I don't believe it.
The problem with this is they were constrained with samples.
They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail.
"So, where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis?"
"Well, one obvious source is dead sharks -- dead sharks, washed up."
"We might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year, if we're kind of lucky."
Another source would be fisheries' bycatch.
We were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets.
"That's banned now, and that'll be good news for the sharks."
"And some are caught in nets, in trawls."
"This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas -- illegally, because you're not allowed to do that under EU law -- and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak."
"They even put a recipe up on the wall, until they were told it was illegal."
They actually did get a fine for that.
"So if you look at all those studies I showed you, the total number of samples worldwide is 86, at present."
"So it's very important work, and they can ask some really good questions, and tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure, but they're constrained by lack of samples."
"When we were out tagging our sharks -- this is how we tagged them on the front of a RlB, get in there fast -- occasionally, the sharks do react."
"On one occasion, when we were up in Malin Head in Donegal, the shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail, more, I think, in startle to the fact that a boat came near it, rather than the tag going in."
And that was fine.
We got wet.
No problem.
"And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head, to the pier,"
I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat.
"The stars and the sun are fixed to the dome, and this dome rotates around."
The earth is at the center.
It's flat.
"It's got corners, according to the bible."
Hell is somewhere below the earth.
Day and night was created before the sun and the earth in Genesis 1:4-5.
"According to biblical scholars like Usher, the age of the universe is somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 years."
"Although, they're not quite sure which. and the universe was created by god from nothing, from the void."
"In acutality, in reality, the earth is a planet, one of many in the solar system."
"There is no firmament, no sphere out there."
The sun is the center of the solar system.
The sun is a star on the spiral arm of a typical galaxy with billions of stars.
"The Milky Way is a galaxy, one of billions in the universe."
The age of the universe is 13.
"75 billion years, and the universe was created by natural processes from a singularity, as far as we know."
"So, lots of wrong here."
Lots of screwed up cosmology.
"Aristophanes, back in 2000 BCE, measured the size of the earth."
"He knew is was a sphere, and he measured the angle of the axial tilt."
"So, that's pretty impressive."
"Galileo upset the incorrect church's view using observational astronomy in the 1600s, and pointed out the foolishness of the church's position."
The church was not too happy about people using telescopes because they thought they were going to look up the skirt of god or something.
"Poor Galileo spent most of the rest of his life under house arrest, after that little episode, under fear of being killed."
"There's a long list of astronomers and others who have expanded and refined our understanding of the universe, and they continue to do so today."
"So, meanwhile, the church and the bible has contributed nothing."
"Yet, they're happy to claim credit."
"They say god did it, or whatever, and there's this notion of the god of the gaps, where, if there's something that's not known, well, that's a good place to stick, that's a god-shaped hole to stick god in there, and that explains it."
"But, as we learn more, that gap gets smaller and smaller and smaller, and it's really just an argument from ignorance."
"For other physical sciences, let's talk about lightning, rainbows and materials."
"Okay, lightning."
The chrisitan view up until the 18th century was
lightning was the wrath of god.
"I'm going to print out each word that's in small_words applied to ""The quick brown fox."""
I'm just sort of eyeballing it.
"""The"" and ""fox"" are at most 3 letters, so I hope to see these 2 in the answer, but ""quick"" and ""brown"" are too big to make the final cut, and that's exactly what we got out."
Recall that our goal was to enumerate all the strings in a grammar.
That was our super slow approach to check and see if HTML or JavaScript was valid.
"Well, unsurprisingly, these generators are the trick we're going to use to enumerate a lot of strings in a concise manner."
"All right, let's go through the possible answers together."
We're definitely going to match 1368 because it's in the language of this regular expression.
It's 4 copies of 0-9 together.
"By default, the value of the token, that is, when it comes into us, it's just the string 1368."
"But we're going to convert it to an integer using this cast or conversion here, so at the end of the day, it's going to be 1368."
It's not going to be the string 1368 because we have this special conversion.
It's not going to be the string 1 because the maximal munch rule means that we're not going to match just one.
We match all 4 digits.
"Similarly, it's not going to be the integer 1 because we match 1368."
It's also not going to be the empty string.
"We definitely match 1368, and 1368 is a good number to match."
That's the approximate year when the Ming Dynasty started.
"They featured a strong central government in China, but perhaps they're best known because most of the Great Wall that we can see was either built or repaired during the Ming Dynasty."
This is my Great Wall sketch.
"You can tell it's the Great Wall because it's got a label that says ""Great Wall."""
"Cranial nerves IX and X, which are the Glossopharyngeal and Vagus nerves, mediate the sensory and motor functions of the palate, pharynx, and larynx."
Practitioner:
I'd like to take a look at the back of your throat.
Can you open your mouth?
[fades]
"To test these nerves, ask the patient to say,"
"""Aaaah,"" or yawn as you observe the soft palate and the uvula."
"The soft palate should rise promptly and symmetrically, and the uvula should remain midline."
"Next, test the gag reflex, one side at a time."
"Using a tongue blade, touch one side of the pharynx, then the other."
"You should see a prompt rise of the palate, and other signs of gagging."
"And when we solved this equation, we would know exactly where the two bodies would be at all times."
"As long as we know where the bodies were when they started out, using that force law and this equation of motion, we could tell you what r would be for all future times."
That's called deterministic.
That's classical mechanics.
"Well, we're not going to do it, but we could actually set up a differential equation and solve for what r(t) is using that force law."
We could do that.
"And if I did that and if I started out the electron and the nucleus at one angstrom from each other, like they are, roughly speaking, in an atom, what would happen is that that electron would plummet into the nucleus in 10^-10 seconds."
"If I solved these equations,"
I would find that r would be equal to zero and t equal to 10^-10 seconds.
We've got a problem here.
"The problem is that this classical physics,"
"Newton's second law and the force law, it is predicting that after 10^-10 seconds the electron and the nucleus are on top of each other, they've neutralized each other."
We no longer have an atom that has a diameter of 10^-10 meters.
That's contrary to our observations.
This is saying the atom collapses in 10^-10 seconds.
But what we see is that the atom seemingly lives forever.
"So we've got a big problem here, as they did in 1911, 1912."
And the problem is that this kind of classical way of thinking does not predict our observations.
"It does not predict the fact that the atom lives together, it lives forever."
It says the atom falls apart.
"So it could be that the Coulomb force law is wrong, or it could be that this equation of motion is incorrect."
And of course what's going to turn out is that this equation of motion does not work for electrons in atoms.
You cannot use classical mechanics to describe the electron within the atom.
"We need a new kind of mechanics, and that new kind of mechanics is going to be quantum mechanics."
That is where we will pick up on Monday.
Have a nice weekend.
"When I was growing up in Montana,"
I had two dreams.
"I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur."
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life.
I was very fortunate early in my career.
I was fortunate in finding things.
These kids are being medicated as routinely as we had our tonsils taken out.
"And on the same whimsical basis, and for the same reason - medical fashion."
Our children are living in the most intensely stimulating period in the history of the earth.
"They're being besieged with information, and force their attention from every platform, computers, from iPhones, from advertising holdings, from hundreds of television channels."
And we're penalizing them now for getting distracted.
"From what, boring stuff, at school for the most part."
"It seems to me it's not a coincidence, totally, that the instance of ADHD has risen in parallel with the growth of standardized testing."
"Now, these kids are being given Ritalin and Adderall, and all manner of things, often quite dangerous drugs, to get them focused and calm them down."
"But according to this,"
Attention Deficit Disorder increases as you travel east across the country.
People start losing interest in Oklahoma
[laughter].
They can hardly think straight in Arkansas
[laughter].
"And by the time they get to Washington, they have lost it completely."
"And there are separate reasons for that, I believe"
[laughter].
It's a fictitious epidemic.
"If you think of it, the arts, and I don't say this exclusively of the arts."
I think it's also true of science and of maths.
"But let me, I say about the arts particularly because they are the victims of this mentality currently, particularly."
The arts especially address the idea of aesthetic experience.
And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak.
When you are present in the current moment.
When you're resonating with the excitement of this thing that you're experiencing.
When you are fully alive.
And anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what's happening.
And a lot of these drugs are that.
We're getting our children through education by anesthetizing them.
And I think we should be doing the exact opposite.
"We shouldn't be putting them asleep, we should be waking them up to what they have inside of themselves."
"But the model we have is this, it's, I believe, we have a system of education that is modeled on the interests of industrialism, and in the image of it."
"In some sense, being aware of context -- that things look one way from one perspective, you look at it from another perspective, it can be a whole different thing."
"What ""certainty"" is, by definition, is something that is, that's SUPPOSED to make us feel very comfortable and satisfied and certain about life."
"But you've said ""certainty"" is ""counter learning."""
Yeah.
"All this search for ""certainty,"" is in some sense, again, like shooting ourselves in the foot."
I think the strategies that we've been taught about how to learn
lead to the overwhelming feeling of incompetence that so many people have.
To boredom and depression.
And in that people are searching and some of the things that they come up with as a way of explaining this I think get them into more trouble.
"The application of mindfulness extends, as you've made the point, you know, throughout life."
Let's start with children.
"You're saying that we have to start doing in our schools, we have to start teaching them to be active deciders, not passive deciders."
What's involved with that?
"Well, again, it goes back to this notion of certainty."
Most people are afraid of uncertainty.
And
I think what we have to do is learn how to exploit the power of uncertainty.
"Um, let me give you an example."
I don't know if this will be meaningful to you.
"But when I was in school, I was taught The Battle of Hastings was 1066."
"Now, that's all I know about The Battle of Hastings."
This doesn't seem to me a very important piece of information.
"You almost get the sense that people were saying, ""OK, we'd better get ready because The Battle of Hastings is about to begin."""
"Rather than realizing that somebody decided that we're going to call this ""The Battle of Hastings."""
It doesn't begin that way.
"When does a conflict become, you know, a skirmish;"
A skirmish become a conflict; a conflict become a war.
When do we want to call it a war?
"All of these labels that we have, all of our categories are given by people and it hides all the ambiguity.\"
Attentiveness:
"Most teachers, they are doing a good job, and you and you would (I would) probably concur if I was looking into their little window, into their classroom, if all the students had their hands on the desks, sitting in a straight line with rapt attention."
"Yet you said ""creative distraction"" can be helpful in the classroom."
"And we tagged them very simply, not very high-tech, with a big, long pole."
This is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end.
You go up in your boat and tag the shark.
And we were very effective.
We tagged 105 sharks last summer.
We got 50 in three days off Inishowen Peninsula.
Half the challenge to get access is to be in the right place at the right time.
"But it's a very simple, easy technique; I'll show you what it looks like."
We use a pole camera on the boat to actually film the shark.
"One, it's to try and work out the gender of the shark."
"We also deployed some satellite tags, so we did use high-tech stuff as well."
These are archival tags.
What they do is store the data.
A satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite.
"And sharks and fish are underwater most of the time, so this tag actually works out the locations of shark, depending on the timing and the setting of the sun, plus water temperature and depth."
And you have to kind of reconstruct the path.
"What happens is, you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period -- in this case, eight months -- and literally to the day, the tag popped off, drifted up, said hello to the satellite and sent, not all the data, but enough data for us to use."
This is the only way to really work out their behavior and movements when they're underwater.
And here's a couple of maps that we've done.
"In that one, you can see that we tagged both off Kerry."
"Basically, it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters."
"On Christmas, it was out on the shelf edge."
"Here's one we haven't ground-truthed yet with sea-surface temperature and water depth, but again, the second shark spent most of its time in and around the Irish Sea."
Colleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the Isle of Man to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.
Nine and a half thousand kilometers -- we never thought that happened.
Another colleague in the States tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.
His tags didn't really work.
"All he knows is where he tagged them, and where they popped off."
"His tags popped off in the Caribbean, and even in Brazil."
"We thought basking sharks were temperate animals and lived in our latitudes, but in actual fact, they're obviously crossing the equator as well."
"So very simple things like that, we're trying to learn about basking sharks."
One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is.
Q: what are the obligations of GAP up nowadays?
A:
"Gap is based on reach middle school and recently, we also open with universities."
"Our core is in Fortaleza, Sobrau, Joào Pessoa, and Moçorò."
"Gap exists to create a means by which the Church can exercise his vocation, exercising the gifts that we have received by the grace of God."
"Therefore, this passion allows us to to influence young people, which nowadays are continually bombarded by the sinful seductions of this modern era and help them maintain their fire for Christ."
This helps them a lot.
"So we're on the road with tent giving space to the work of Christ bearing witness of lives transformed, the recovery of those who have gone astray, and in rebellion to God."
Q: how long are you in business?
A:
By 12 years.
Q: how's the dialogue with the Church?
A: it is difficult.
We are sometimes hesitant.
"Unfortunately there are many churches where leaders are interested in other things, thus deluding their members ... so we are sometimes unsure in making the first step."
"Mostly when it comes to activities, sometimes distrust of us because sometimes it seems that we are depriving them of their members."
"There are pastors who admire what we do, and pray for us, but more often than not we are left alone."
"We have pastors that we depend on, obviously."
The Ministry is under the pastoral care of a church.
Q:
"In these 12 years, how many missionaries have maintained?"
"A: we have never supported anybody, only now we are sending the first missionary."
"But as far as preparation is concerned, we have prepared about 400 young people."
The fact is that our joy in Christ is giving the possibility to people to vote according to their vocation.
"This serves to keep people from what is ""Babel syndrome"", i.e. making a name and putting himself in competition with Christ."
"Then there are Christian missionaries movements at universities, ranging from Ministers that have been prepared by Gap."
This is something that makes us very thankful to God.
"Q: talking about you primarily, in these 12 years, you are devoted mainly to Gap?"
A:
"In these 12 years, many things are interlaced between my personal life and Gap."
"I have a doctorate in theology, and I am the Director of Gap, but"
I had to delay my studies due to commitments with Gap when we were at the beginning.
Susan Calvin develops the positronic brain.
She designs their three laws and their implementation.
She is very important.
She is also unattached to any mails.
"Interesting, she's a wise old woman, she's not in any way part of the Eden complex."
She's much more like the female god.
"At the end, in the evitable conflict, she confronts Steven Bierley in his office."
"And she acknowledges that the whole world wonders whether or not he, who seems to be keeping everything running so well, whether or not he is not himself a robot."
"I mean, how can you distinguish perfect robots from human beings?"
"Earlier in the novel, Susan Calvin had said the only difference between a robot and a human being is that robots are essentially decent."
"Well, Stephen Bierley doesn't answer her."
"He doesn't prove his humanity, and he doesn't prove his robot nature."
"He doesn't admit to anything he says in fact, which either a robot or a human would say, humans would not like to know that a mere man controlled everything."
"And humans would not like to know that a robot, a mere machine had taken over the government of the human population."
"And so it is better for human beings not to know whether I, Steven Barley, I am human or a robot."
We can't argue with that logic.
The last image of the story is a fireplace behind a quartz fire screen and we look in it and a flame goes out and a wisp of smoke rises.
When I first read that I thought well the whole book seemed to be working its way toward utopia.
But I know what it means for a flame to be extinguished.
"Hey when a flame goes out, you know, that's the end of insight."
That's the advent of darkness.
"This is, this is negative."
The robots have taken us over.
But it didn't fit with the rest of the book.
"Well if you read the book as a series of separate stories that just happened to be published together as an anthology, what difference does it make?"
So one of the stories doesn't actually fit thematically with the others.
"But if you read it as a composite novel, How do you make sense of that smoke?"
"So, one day I was speaking to a colleague of mine, a quite prominent our historian and as soon as she heard this she said that's the Merode Altarpiece."
The Merode alter piece?
The Merode Altarpiece is a key example of a medieval iconographic trick.
"When in the annunciation, when the archangel Gabriel announces to Mary that she will bear the child of God."
"The Devine Light goes across from Gabriel as God's messenger to Mary striking sometimes in some paintings into her head, sometimes into her womb."
We have to follow the European
laws in Europe.
We have to follow the Chinese laws.
"We decided in China we did not like the way in which their censorship was working, so we moved to the other China, which was"
Hong Kong.
So we'll see what happens.
So we make that decision on a per country basis.
My own view is that these changes are happening so quickly.
The societies are not really prepared for what's going to happen when everybody is online.
Everybody is posting information about what's going on around them.
"I also think that in general this is very good because it empowers citizens, and citizens are fundamentally good."
"Citizens fundamentally want to make their countries a better place, and so I would say that in a positive context."
But I think that countries are a classic example where the laws conflict.
There are obviously also corporations that have different models from us that we also compete with.
"I see there are some questions over there as well, don't forget them."
"Yes, sir? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KAVlTSKl:"
Kavitski from Online Magazine in Germany.
I have two questions.
"One that is a specific one, Google translate, is that something you write, you also doing in a phone call over the air?"
"And the second, more general question about Chrome OS which, in my opinion, is almost like the big Android, for example, very suitable for tablets, is that coming soon or can you give us a short update there? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"So, two separate questions that the live translate is the next logical succession to the demo that you saw and you could imagine eventually it might be possible."
"Right now, we can do it the way you saw it."
So we're pretty close.
And I think eventually it'll be possible to speak.
"Today, you can SMS somebody and without speaking the language and I think it's reasonable to expect that with some level of accuracy you'll be able to do it live over time."
"Again, as the technology gets better, and remember these algorithms are trained algorithms."
"As they get more data, they get better."
"So a classic example where the computer does something better because the humans help it and the humans do something better because the computer is there, they can actually communicate with each other."
"On the question about Chrome OS, Chrome OS has been announced."
Chrome OS is an operating system which is in early availability and it's targeted primarily at the Netbook space today.
"And of course, because it's free, it's open-source."
People will also use it for tablets.
"So, when you trade it in they actually instead of you getting money for that car, you owe more for the new car you are buying and if you keep doing that eventually you will be really, really upside down."
"So really, really watch that."
It is better if you do finance it to finance it for two years or three years because you are probably going to keep it and at the end of that two or three years it is probably going to be worth more than what you owe on it if you decide to trade it in.
"We pay cash, so, I don't know a lot about that."
"But also, if you do that at the end of those three years you are going to have your car paid off instead of never getting a car paid off."
Okay?
And I know when we were younger we couldn't do that.
We couldn't pay cash for a car.
We had to go in you know and finance a car.
"But, we never financed it for five or six years like they are allowing you to do now."
Let's go on and look at page 200.
I want to really call your attention to this because you are going to use this on a project that you are going to do at the end of the semester for me.
"But, if you look on page 200, Automobile Operation Costs."
"That is something you have to consider and along with the information they have there, I want you to understand gas costs."
It is the annual mileage divided by the miles per gallon times the average cost of gasoline.
"So, you have to take, this is how much I drive this car annually and then I divide it by how many miles per gallon it gets and then I take that and multiply it times the average gas rate for that year."
And then that will tell you about how much money you are spending for gas cost.
"The cost per mile, take that total cost and divide by the number of miles that you have driven the car that year."
Okay?
It talks about maintenance.
You have to take that into consideration when you are thinking about how much a car costs.
"And then the next thing that your book goes into talking about, Resolving Consumer Complaints."
And I want you to read this.
There is a lot of information in here.
So many people just
let people run all over them and you shouldn't do that.
You have rights as a consumer.
And this chapter talks about those rights all the way up to the point of finally just taking some legal action.
And I know we live in a society of everyone sues everyone.
You know when you spill a cup of coffee and you sue the people who give it to you as if you didn't know that the cup of coffee was going to be hot!
Well then there is a problem.
Now it is one thing if someone from that business spills the coffee on you.
And that separation is 0.088 millimeter.
"If we make the openings much narrower, indeed, the light intensities would be more uniform, each maximum would be approximately the same strength, but then very little light will go through."
And so it's a trade-off.
"And the moment you make these two openings, these two slots,"
"larger and larger, you will understand Friday why then the light intensities are not the same, why the light intensity is a maximum at the center and then falls off near the edge."
As you see.
"It's a maximum here, and then the light intensities become smaller."
"I've shown you now the interference pattern with sound and for red laser light, but imagine now that I did the same with white light."
"The situation would be very different, and maybe even disappointing for you."
Let this be the location on the screen.
"So we -- we have X here, and here X is 0."
"And I want to know where the maxima are in the red, well that's very easy, there will be a maximum here when this position is L times lambda divided by D."
This is when Nancy is 1.
And there will also be a maximum here when we have 2L times lambda divided by D.
"And of course there will be one on this side, same distance."
"And there will be one here, this is when N is 0."
N is 1.
N is 2.
The red light will have maxima.
How about the blue light?
"The blue light will have maxima here, where L lambda divided by D, but lambda is different,"
lambda for blue light is smaller.
"Substantially smaller than red light, so the maximum of the blue will fall here, the maximum of the blue will always fall at N equals 0 together with red, and then Nancy equals 2 the blue will fall here, so this is Nancy 2, Nancy 1, Nancy 0."
"And here Nancy 0, Nancy 1, Nancy 2."
And so the red and the blue and therefore all the other colors
live a life of their own.
They don't talk to each other.
They come in with their own separation in terms of angles and in terms of locations X. That's the reason why I chose one and only one frequency with the sound.
"Because if I had exposed you to many different frequencies, many different wavelengths, then the location of silence for one wavelength is not the location of silence for the other wavelength."
And so the experiment would not have worked.
"And that's why it worked so well with the laser, the red laser, which is practically one wavelength, and so the minima and the maxima are extremely well-defined."
"If we had done the experiment with white light, it wouldn't have been so impressive, and on the next slide I show you what you w- would have seen then."
We want to go find things in some data set.
And I'll remind you that we sort of a separated out two cases.
"We said if we had an ordered list, we could use binary search."
"And we said that was log rhythmic, took log n time where n is the size of the list."
"If it was an unordered list, we were basically stuck with linear search."
Got to walk through the whole list to see if the thing is there.
So that was of order in.
"And then one of the things that I suggested was that if we could figure out some way to order it, and in particular, if we could order it in n log n time, and we still haven't done that, but if we could do that, then we said the complexity changed a little bit."
But it changed in a way that I want to remind you.
"And the change was, that in this case, if I'm doing a single search, I've got a choice."
"I could still do the linear case, which is order n or I could say, look, take the list, let's sort it and then search it."
"But in that case, we said well to sort it was going to take n"
"log n time, assuming I can do that."
"Once I have it sorted I can search it in log n time, but that's still isn't as good as just doing n."
"And this led to this idea of amortization, which is I need to not only factor in the cost, but how am I going to use it?"
"And typically, I'm not going to just search once in a list, I'm going to search multiple times."
"So if I have to do k searches, then in the linear case, I got to do order n things k times."
It's order k n.
"Whereas in the ordered case, I need to get them sorted, which is still n log n, but then the search is only log n."
I need to do k of those.
And we suggested well this is better than that.
This is certainly better than that. m plus k all times log n is in general going to be much better than k times n.
"It depends on n and k but obviously as n gets big, that one is going to be better."
"And that's just a way of reminding you that we want to think carefully, but what are the things we're trying to measure when we talk about complexity here?"
It's both the size of the thing and how often are we going to use it?
"And there are some trade offs, but I still haven't said how"
"I'm going to get an n log n sorting algorithm, and that's what I want to do today."
One of the two things I want to do today.
"To set the stage for this, let's go back just for a second to binary search."
At the end of the lecture I said binary search was an example of a divide and conquer algorithm.
Sort of an Attila the Hun kind of approach to doing things if you like.
"So let me say -- boy, I could have made a really bad political joke there, which I will forego, right."
"And if you like big numbers and you like to calculate and look at flow models and compartment models and differential equations and stuff like that, biogeochemistry has a place for you."
"The contact here is with geology, physical chemistry and meteorology."
The connections are important.
They're not all well worked out.
"So there must be important connections between ecosystem ecology and community ecology, but they are still being explored, and this is not an area that's really mature yet."
"The part of ecology that analyses these processes really is the part that deals with the fate of the planetary environment, especially water and air, and that means it has important economic and political implications."
"So it's an area well worth worrying about and learning something about and remembering, because these are the processes that will affect the quality of human life on the planet, for forever basically."
"Okay, next time I'm going to discuss biodiversity, and about whether it matters or not, and about what extinctions mean."
Now we enter Part Two of the Crash Course.
"Here you'll see the very information that led me and my family to make profound changes in our lives - where we live, my line of work, even where we get our food."
"With the background you've received to this point, you are now positioned to understand how the Three ""E""s, the Economy, Energy and the Environment, intersect and seemingly converge on a very narrow window of the future, what I am calling ""The Twenty-Teens""."
It's the data in these next parts
leads me to conclude that the next twenty years are going to be completely unlike the last twenty years.
A small warning:
This material can be shocking.
"So we begin Part Two with ""Debt""."
(Laughter) (Applause)
"Young man, if you are trying to impress me, you are not."
It's not working.
"For him, that was the end of life."
We had to do a little work to get him back.
"To cut the story short, my son went on to graduate with honors from Waterloo, one of Canada's top universities."
(Applause)
"You need to have the bravado, to challenge the odds that life throws against you."
"OK, let's do a show of hands here."
How many of you use Facebook?
"Wow, I'm really in the wrong business."
(Laughter)
"Twitter, Google, I suppose everybody."
"How many of you know Aramex, Fadi Ghandour?"
"Well, if you look at the background of all these people, they are just ordinary people like you and me."
I hope Fadi Ghandour doesn't mind me calling him ordinary.
"And now, we've already written it as a fraction and if we want we can simplify this down."
"Both 8 and 10 share common factors, they are both divisible by 2."
So lets divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
"We are not changing the value of the fraction because we are dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same thing 8 divided by 2 is 4, 10 divided by 2 is 5 and we're done."
"0.8 is the same thing as 8 tenths, which is the same thing as 4 fifths."
"Welcome, hope you had a good summer."
"I just wanted to talk about the class since there's about a week or so left before it starts, believe it or not."
"I, I have put something on the set, on the web."
And it's a detailed syilabus for the class.
And I would encourage you to take the opportunity to read it.
It's a big document simply because I want to give you clear sense of what you're going to get into.
And you want to make a decision that this class is good for you or not.
And even though you have resisted I encourage you to read it.
It gives you a good sense.
"But what I'm going to do in the video is I though I would give you visual idea and talk to you about the class, and it reflects what's in the syilabus."
"But hopefully, easier to follow, and motivate you to go read the syilabus."
The first main thing I will talk about are the objectives of the class.
"And to me, the main objective, the first one, is to learn how to value assets."
Assets are what create value in the world.
"And if you know which is a better asset than the other in terms of creating value for the world, I think you're on board."
"You're going to make good decisions, and that's the second, if you may, practical."
"Purpose of this class, to understand value, to make good decisions."
"And if you can make good decisions, it kind of empowers you, to feel comfortable in a very uncertain world."
"You're not guaranteed to make great decisions, but you will probabilistically make better decisions and that's what you want."
I want you to understand your environment and what public policy's all about.
Why is that important?
"Because, as"
"I said, Finance's beauty is about valuing assets but making real life decisions and all of this happens within a context and in fact the context is an outcome of our actions."
"So if you understand the interaction between decisions and what's happening and public policy, it will help you."
Now will it be a perfect understanding?
No.
"But I guarantee you when you read the popular press, you'll be able to understand things a bit better."
"Ethnic media outlets, like Iwi radio stations."
There's 22 of those.
There's two Pacific radio stations.
"There's Māori Television now, which is having a major impact."
"Pay television, online news websites, and of course social networks,"
"like Facebook and Bebo, and a strange thing called Twitter."
Anyone in the room Twitter?
"Yeah, Twitter is now the way that most news is broken worldwide."
"The Chinese earthquake was first heard of via someone under a desk somewhere, as the building was crashing around them,"
"Twittering to their network, sort of like text messages sent out to a network."
"And it strikes me that these are things that the young people are into, and the research needs to include that."
"Now what about my friends in the news media, how have they contributed to the debate?"
"Well, very defensively."
"No primary research on the effects in New Zealand has been commissioned by the Media Freedom Committee, so far as I can see."
"They had Jim Tully do a fairly limited review, no more than a literature review, from what I could see."
"The limited examinations I've seen have really concentrated on trying to discredit overseas research used by the Ministry's consultants and researchers, a pretty big task, after what we saw today."
And the result's pretty pallid.
"Someone picked up the fact that, in a paper, a researcher had misspelled ""causal"" as ""casual"" and was hugely excited about that."
But frankly I don't see that it was a fatal blow to the credibility of the paper.
"The news media industry as a whole in this country does little, if any, primary research on anything."
They do...
"Individual media companies do a lot of commercial research on readership and sales and stuff, but you never get to see that."
"So I'm not aware that they do any research on media effects, and they're not interested."
It's too expensive.
"So if they want to challenge the Ministry's position, frankly, they need to spend some money and do some research."
"I have a little bit of a problem with researching this topic, though, because we have such a restrictive regime."
"How can we really tell what the effects are if there is no, in effect, news reporting of suicide, other than name and the fact that it was self-inflicted?"
"So I'm not quite sure how you're going to gauge that, Brian."
"I'm sure you'll explain, but it strikes me as a kind of Catch-22."
"There have been some other problems with the press, the news media's response."
"The Press Council said that something had to be done about this because of the increasing problem, especially for young people."
It's a false premise.
"And like Frank Borzage, Robsen and Lewten take this as an opportunity to embellish detail and atmosphere."
In the film.
"The film is a web of repeated and varied motifs, like knives."
"There are knives in the window in the very beginning of the film, and then Finn has a knife as our hero goes on board."
"There's a bayonet on the wall of Stone's office, and of course the film ends in a knife fight."
"Or there's the picture of Ellen on Stone's desk, which is put on top of a navigation map."
Which pretty much sums up Stones problem with his relationship.
"Or there's the way that the men have to be careful to coil the rope in just the right direction, which then echoes the way that"
Louie has to coil the chain the right way in the chain lock.
And the reason I picked this film is that sound is so important to its texture.
Just think about how many times hearing and sound are mentioned or made important to the plot.
The film begins with a blind beggar.
There's Finn who cannot speak but hears what other men can't hear.
Our hero's best friend is a radio man who puts on his headphones to block out the madness of the captain.
"When Bound talks to our hero, he says he better pull in his ears and not criticize the captain."
"The crew on the ship, does their job by using sound, not by necessarily speech."
"On the bridge, someone will ring a bell, and on the deck, that bell will be answered."
"Fog horns are, of course, important becasue they turn sound into space, they tell, they map space and dangers at sea"
Through sound.
"Billy Rad sings on the boat, to entertain the crew, but he's also expressing the real feelings of the crew."
"And since this is an inexpensive film, they can't afford to show sailors in front of actual sea."
"The most we get is a sailor in front of a the backdrop with the cloud painted on it, moving up and down a little bit."
"So, sound takes over."
The sound of the wind and the sound of the sea.
"And depending on where you are on ship, you're either the wind or the sea."
Or the sound of the engines of the boat.
And they become oppressive and meaningful across the film.
It's also an excellent film for illustrating how most Hollywood film makers use sound.
"Mixing ambient sounds and side effects, keeping dialogue on top, then bringing in an underscore orchestral music score to tell us the character's emotions even if the character isn't directly expressing them as emotions."
So I would like to take a look at.
"Bits of this film beginning at the opening scene, and think about how Robson and"
Lewton make sound important to their atmospheric horror.
A spring rose
You are the light of my soul
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Come back...
"Come back, oh crimson of my soul"
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Come back...
"Come back, oh crimson of my soul"
I'm very proud of you.
You did very well on the last exam.
Class average is a little bit above 70.
Congratulations.
There were 22 students who scored 100.
"Many of you are interested in where the dividing line is between C and D. If I take only the three exams into account, forget the quizzes, forget the homework, forget the motor, and you add up the three grades of your three exams, the dividing line between C and D will be somewhere in the region 135 to 138."
So you can use that for your calibration where you stand.
The controversy between Newton and Huygens about the nature of
light was settled in 1801 when Young demonstrated convincingly that light shows all the characteristic of waves.
"Now in the early twentieth century, the particle character of light surfaced again and this mysterious and very fascinating duality of being waves and particles at the same time is now beautifully merged in quantum mechanics."
But today I will focus on the wave character only.
"Very characteristic for waves are interference patterns which are produced by two sources, which simultaneously produce traveling waves at exactly the same frequency."
Let this be source number one and let this be source number two.
"And they each produce waves with the same frequency, therefore the same wavelength, and they go out let's say in all directions."
"They could be spherical, in the case of water surface, going out like rings."
And suppose you were here at position P in space at a distance R1 from source number one and at a distance R2 from source number two.
Then it is possible that at the point P the two waves that arrive are in phase with each other.
"That means the mountain from two arrives at the same time as a mountain from one, and the valley from two arrives at the same time as the valley from one."
So the mountains become higher and the valleys become lower.
We call that constructive interference.
"It is also possible that the waves as they arrive at point P are exactly 180 degrees out of phase, so that means that the mountain from two arrives at the same time as the valley from one."
"In which case they can kill each other, and that we call destructive interference."
In that one we would go and check to make sure that the M characters match if we have a hash match.
And then if it could be that with such at a low probability could be that there's a hash match but not a substring match.
Then we're just.
Move on.
And from a theoretical point of view there's some very extremely low possibility that one could be slow.
But lets look over at what the analysis says.
So the theory says that if you take a sufficiently large random prime say mn^ three So a long value maybe you can get that and remember n is huge.
"Then the probability of a false collision is about 1/n. so you know in a billion things you might get, you might get 1/n, you might get a false collision."
"So in practice we choose actually q just to be, there's no reason not to choose as"
"large as we possibly can, not related to m and n.m And then the probably collision is going to be about 1/q."
"So we're going to take it to be like the biggest law, and that means that probably collision is extremely small."
And then you can take your chances.
You can do a Monte Carlo version where you just say I got a match because I got a hash match.
And be confident in the laws of probability.
And not worry about the client getting the wrong answer.
"Or you can have the Las Vegas version where you go, go ahead and return the correct answer."
And.
"And be confident that your client's not gonna run into a slow case cuz the probability is so, so tiny, 1/q, that you don't have to worry about it."
That's the Rabin-Karp algorithm.
"Now, why look at this algorithm?"
It's linear time.
We have other algorithms that are linear time.
"One of the key reasons to, be interested in Rabin-Karp is that it's easy to extend it to more complicated situations."
"So, say you wanna look for one of, several different patterns."
"Well, you just compute the hatches for those patterns, and then look for any one them Use, a symbol table, to look for'em."
"So, that's a much more, general capability than, we can provide with the other methods."
It also can be extended to do 2-dimensional search and other things like that.
"For straight suffering search, it's gonna be a little slower because, there's, interloop it's kind of long, the arithmatic operation, are gonna be a"
"little slow, if you wanna do the Las Vegas version you have to back up the text and you have this, Monte Carlo Las, Las Vegas thing, and you should think about, writing code to extend it to look for any one of p possible patterns, thats, an interesting,"
Algorithmic puzzle as I mentioned is not so difficult to solve.
So here's our summary.
"We started with a brute force algorithm, and although typically you don't have this worst case thing."
You can't say it's a bad thing.
"Even if you don't agree with the 15M, if you put someone who has nothing to do with the 15M in front of 4 people and say ""you're going to laugh"", in the end you get caught up in it, emotionally, through humour."
I think that's really important.
There are a lot of people who I believe were hooked on the 15M because it's fun.
And it has been fun.
"I don't know if it still is for everyone, but for a lot of people it has been fun. and the use of false identities, which is another debate altogether, has also contributed to get certain absurd examples of behaviour out of the furrows."
People who pretend to be someone else and talk to other Twitter users who react in a really absurd way.
So absurd it's real.
And that serves to expose certain things.
Undoubtedly it's the most original political action there is.
But it's just the beginning.
I think it's always going to be that original from now on.
"The large protests are going to be like that via the networks, with sarcasm, with a sense of humour where the individual is above political affiliation."
I think all that can be used by completely opposing ideologies.
"And we're simply at the start of a new form of political participation, to achieve the most diverse goals."
"Not just with goals that, for example 73% of the population can empathise with, but anything that goes beyong political parties and NGOs, it can be organised through the net."
ST:
Let's wrap this up.
"Out of everything that's happened, what do you think has been the most important thing?"
JL:
I think there has been a change in the mentality of society.
Vital attitude.
A door to participation in politics of the future has opened.
A way of allowing people to participate publicly from here on in.
"Not just because of the protests and the assemblies, but because of what's happening on the internet."
I think it's become obvious that a lot of people organised spontaneously and very suddenly- I mean we're organised today for this and tomorrow I don't need to know you- can impose the political agenda of a country.
Almost nothing.
"And I think it's also going to serve as an experience of political maturity for a lot of people, this has been their first political experience."
"Young people, and not so young people who have had their first political experience, and are learning a lot about this world, regarding the media, politics, team work."
Good lessons and bad lessons.
And how this atmosphere of maturity is going to evolve is quite eye-catching.
"Because if there are people who think the 15M is naive, maybe their strength is non confrontation,"
Workers can't just negotiate for their rights.
Striking is the best way to get their rights.
And I'll repeat again: negotiators must be elected so they don't betray the interests of the workers.
"We are 45,000 workers in the Public Transport Authority."
We have an independent union.
The independent union called us to join a strike
"The union said that workers had the right to social justice, to a minimum wage and to a decent pension."
The union said we must strike for the sake of our kids.
It's the same thing all over the world and not just in Egypt or in England.
"Ordinary people shouldn't be working to feed the rich, they should be working to feed their own families."
The rich just sit around at home getting richer.
They control the government.
"The capitalists"" control of the government is what loses workers their rights."
That is why workers all over the world must win their rights.
"I'd like to ask colleagues in London, how long before you rise up?"
You need to get the young people organised.
The time for waiting has passed.
The workers of London need to strike and fight back for their rights.
"They need to fight for the rights of pensioners, who can't win their rights themselves anymore."
"So I'm asking the workers of London, and the workers of the world to be like Che Guevara, and like Lech Walesa in Poland, to be like the workers of Egypt who changed the course of history with the revolution of 25 January and who overthrew the tyrant."
You should overthrow your tyrants in London.
"In a factory or in a public institution if there are only 5 independent worker activists but they have the confidence of their colleagues, then they can lead 5,000 others."
Each one can move a thousand.
"So I say, anywhere there are five activists like this, they can get people to move by telling them ""these are your rights and you must take them"", by showing how the rich are robbing the poor how globalisation is controlling people, and how wealth is going to a small handful, while people are dying of hunger in places like Somalia."
"I urge workers in Britain to make a revolution, because Britain is a great country."
"We love Britain because there is freedom there, and we had no freedom in Egypt."
Despite this we still had a revolution and overthrew a million policemen.
So can't you overthrow however many policemen you have?
You are the poor and yet you're working to make the rich richer.
You are the heroes of Britain.
You're the new generation of heroes
I call on the workers of London to lead the workers of the world in a revolution to overthrow tyranny in every country and get the poor their rights.
"And to illustrate this,"
"I'd like to talk about  a project called ""Planet Hunters""."
"So Planet Hunters is a project that's been running for a few years now, and we thought we'd try  and discover planets around other stars."
This is the most exciting area of astronomy right now.
We thought there might be a few planets left over for our citizen scientists to catch.
"Now whenever you go hunting planets,  you can't see the planets directly."
What you have to do instead is look for  the indirect signs that they're there.
"And one of the most effective methods  is to look for what we call ""Transits""."
A planet transiting in front of its star will cause the start to dip in brightness  by much less than 1%.
"But if you can catch that dip, then you can infer that the planet is there."
"It's a rather simple case of Dark Matter, if you like."
You can infer that this planet is there from the data.
"And we have data from NASA's Kepler satellite, which is staring -- actually Kepler, I feel rather sorry for it, it's got the most boring job in the world, because it just stares at 150,000 stars, and every 29 minutes tells us what brightness they are."
"It can send that data down here, and we can look for these transits."
And sometimes these transits are really obvious.
( beeping )
"In fact, in this case, they're so obvious that you can hear them."
That modulation is the dip at the repeated transit of a planet orbiting its star in just a few days.
But sometimes the transits aren't so obvious.
"This is what it might just look like to be on a moon, orbiting a Neptune sized world, now know as Planet Hunters 1B."
This was a planet discovered by a group of citizen scientists using our project.
And Planet Hunters 1B is currently a unique world.
It's the only world that we know of  that has 4 suns in its sky.
"So this is a system with 2 pairs of stars, and a planet orbits one of those pairs."
It's a planet that simulations tell us shouldn't exist.
So we didn't even know to look for this and yet there it is.
And it's there because a group of volunteers saw something strange in the data and they didn't even tell us about it.
"They went out, they got more data from the professional NASA website."
"They did their own analysis, and they came to us when  they'd worked out what was going on."
"These were people who did not start off as scientists, who'd gone through the engine of motivation, being convinced that they could do something real by taking part in the main project and then collaborated together to make a truly gobsmacking discovery."
"And then we made the nice image, so that they could try and image  what that planet was like."
This is real citizen science.
This occurred there.
"Because it knows who I am, it knows what I care about and it knows roughly where I am."
"So this notion of autonomous search, the ability to tell me things that I didn't know but I probably am very interested in, is the next great stage in my view of search."
"And ultimately, we think we can understand things like what you really meant."
"So, for example, you ask the question, ""What's the weather like?"" That's the question."
"And what you're really asking is, ""Do I wear a raincoat?"" Right?"
"Or, ""Do I water the plants?"""
"We think we can make that bridge or get closer to it, to understand, ""What did you really mean?"
"What is the problem you're really trying to solve?"" We've also thought a lot about new areas in commerce, specialize searches of one kind and another."
We brought a company called ITA around travel.
"So we're very, very interested in making it possible to answer very deep questions using Computer Science about things that you care about."
"It's interesting that--that one in three queries from smartphones is now from about where I am, where my location is, something around me."
"So, we know that users are doing this and we know they're doing it a lot and it makes sense to them."
"So, the area of mobile--it's interesting that our most mobile search traffic grew 50% in the first half of 2010."
It's growing much quicker than everything else.
"So, not only is--do I believe my strategy is correct here, but also the data says that our users really, really like this."
"It's interesting that Android and I, of course, I hope everybody has their Android phones with them."
"Android is shipping about 200,000 activations per day now, and God knows what the growth rate is going to be."
It's so fast.
"What's interesting about Android, of course, is it's not just one partner."
"There are more than 60 devices and 21 OEM partners across 59 carriers in 49 countries, and that number is growing very, very quickly."
"And you can imagine those numbers will be much, much greater before Christmas because of all the new products that are coming out."
"Search traffic from the Android phones tripled in the first half of 2010, another example of all us taking on."
Another part of this is a browser strategy.
Everybody here knows what browsers are; the things that you use when you are using the Internet?
We have a browser which we like a lot called Chrome.
It's based on an underlying technology called
"WebKit, which is very much the fastest underlying browser technology."
It's used by many of the browsers now and that's part of why it's so quick.
"And in Chrome's case, it's getting--it's got a huge momentum; it now has more than 70 million users."
"It's--the latest release is four times faster, that are really four times faster than the release we did two years ago."
And deeper integration with the browser means that we can have more autonomous actions.
"But instead of setting a temporary ID to the element, to save time, I can just type $0 in the console."
This is a shortcut reference to whatever element is currently selected in this panel.
"It's just a regular reference, so if I'm using jQuery I can toss it into it's dollar method easily."
"Now over on the Network tab, I'd like to share a few things."
"In this waterfall chart, two lines are added."
"The blue one points out where the DOMContentLoaded event fires, which is basically ""document ready"" and the red is window's load event, which waits for all images and iframes to finish."
Now you probably have had to inspect the cookies that are associated with your page request before.
"The Headers tab has that info as one of the request headers, but you can now view the current cookies in table format."
"You also have the size of each cookie, which you want to keep as small as possible, as all the cookies are sent in the HTTP header with every request of the page."
"Now, I'd like to show you a few handy features when doing Javascript debugging."
I'm going to bring up a page with some basic script.
"So here, I can filter our results here using search or a category filter."
Easy enough.
This gallery.js contains most of the functionality.
Now I'd like to add some logging to see what's going on.
"In Chrome, I can edit the script on the fly inside the Ul."
This feature is unique to Chrome because of how the V8 Javascript engine executes your code.
I'm going to jump down to the showGallery function.
I can use cmd-G or ctrl-G to jump to a specific line number.
"Now I'd really like to dig into this JSON argument here, so I'm going to console log it out."
"Now when I filter, I get the object logged to the console, where I can poke around with it further."
You'll notice I'm also getting an exception thrown on the page.
Sometimes it's difficult to figure out where these errors are coming from.
"By clicking on this pause button, I can ask the dev tools to pause execution whenever an exception is encountered, effectively giving me a breakpoint at that position."
"I can now open up the console, again by hitting"
"Escape, and figure out what's going on."
Whoops!
Looks like that element doesn't exist yet.
I guess it's time to file a bug report.
"If you'd like to dive into the dev tools, I definitely recommend picking up a dev channel version of Chrome."
It updates weekly and gets new features in the dev tools very regularly.
Holding your baby is something that's very different for every individual you really need to hold them in a way that is most comfortable for you.
The price-- I get nervous when I'm running out of time.
So I'm going to do this in the next video.
See you soon.
"So in this problem, we're going to try to build up a given row of Pascal's triangle."
"So you could solve this problem recursively, and that's what I did my first time, but I feel that the iterative solution is a bit simpler and more intuitive to understand."
"This isn't always the case, but this is how I'm going to explain this problem."
"What we're going to do is, we're going to start with a list that's row 1, and then we're going to build the next list by adding the 2 numbers above it."
"More precisely, let's say we're doing the last row, and we have the previous row already made, we're going to start an invisible 0 here, and we're going to say, 1 is going to be the sum of the 0 number that I just made up and the 1 that's the first element of the previous row."
"We're going to update our pointers to move over by 1, and we get to the element 4 by adding 1 and 3."
I'm going to repeat this process all the way through.
6 is 3 + 3.
4 is 3 + 1.
1 is 1 and 0.
"So that's pretty easy to explain, and that's basically how you would do it if you were building it out by hand, but putting it in a code may be a little bit more complicated and have alluded you."
So let's see how it's done.
So if I initialize the first row in the triangle to 1.
"We don't have anything for a result yet, so that's an empty list."
"I'm then going to iterate through the process of building each row 1 at a time, n times."
That way we can get to the nth row.
We're going to append the row that we just discovered onto the result list.
The first time around it will just be the list of 1 because that's how the triangle starts.
"We're then going to find the next row, which I haven't defined yet, and then repeat this process appending the current row onto the result list."
"Once we're done, we're going to return the result."
"So this is a good outline of what we're doing, but we're missing the most important part, and that is the makenextrow."
So a row is going to start as an empty list.
"As I had the 2 pointers before, we're going to have the previous one and then we're going to have one that I'm going to call e."
"So as I said in the description, we're going to start out with 0."
"That way when we add 1, we get 1, which is the sides of the triangle."
We're going to calculate the new entry in the current row by adding e--that's our right pointer--with the previous one that we start at 0 so that we get 1.
"We're going to update the values in previous and then the next iteration, e will update to the next value in row."
This last line basically includes the 1 on the right-hand side.
"Once we return result, triangle can use makenextrow accordingly, and we're done."
"Whenever we're going to do an experiment with two sources which are in phase, at the same frequency, you can predict the directions of maxima and minima and you can even predict the separation, the linear separation, if you know how far away you are from these sources."
And the first demonstration that I'm going to do is with sound.
We have here two loudspeakers.
"And the distance between those two loudspeakers, we're going to do it with sound, D, is 1.5 meters."
That's a given.
And the frequency is 3000 hertz.
"The wavelength, therefore,"
"lambda, equals V divided by the frequency, the speed of sound is about 340 meters per second, divided by 3000, is about 0.113 meters."
So the wavelength is about 11.3 centimeters.
"I can now calculate everyone who is sitting here [fweet] right in the middle through this whole plane will have a maximum of sound, and then when we go away at angle theta, some will again have maxima, and we go further away theta, again maxima, and in between will be the minima."
And I'm going to calculate where they fall in the lecture hall.
The first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to give you N as in Nancy and calculate that angle theta of N and I will do it for the maxima.
"In other words, I'm going to use constructive interference and you see there, the sine of theta N is lambda divided by D. That's the equation I use."
When N is 0 the angle is 0.
That is 0 angle.
Everyone here will hear a maximum.
"When N is 1, and you may want to check that at home, I find an angle of 4.3 degrees, and when N is 2, the angle is about double that, is about 8.7 degrees, and when N is 3, it should be close to 13 degrees, 13.1."
"In case you take N is 10, so I skip a few, you get about 49 degrees."
This is where the maximum fall.
And so there's going to be a maximum here and then 4.3 degrees away is again a maximum.
But surely we would like to know how far you in the audience will have to move in order to go from a maximum to a minimum.
"And so the way you have to think of this is that if I make here a picture of the lecture hall, if here are these two sources, you are at a distance L away from here."
Some of you are 5 meters away.
Some are 10 meters away.
"Some are 15 meters away, all the way in the back of the audience."
And you want to know where you're going to hear the maxima.
"I call this X1,"
"I call this X2, and I call this X3, and this is 0."
So this is the meaning of theta 1.
"And this is the meaning of theta 3, and this angle here would be theta 2."
That's the meaning of these angles.
"And so I can calculate now how far you have to move depending upon what capital L is to hear, to go from one maximum in sound to another maximum."
"So, I'm really good at taking notes on this; I am terrible at editing."
And it just means if I really wanted to become good at actually...
"If I had to do final papers or let's say documents for my boss or something on this device, I would really have to practice using that before and after letter, ah, issue I was just talking about."
But it's really confusing if you're not used to it.
"Because sometimes you're before the letter, sometimes you're after, depending on the direction you've moved."
And I'm making a big deal of that because I don't want that to throw anyone or convince anyone not to do this.
"Ah, it's just something that if you practice with, it's fine."
"When I go to meetings, I just do a lot of writing."
And there's a thing in here where you can email the note to yourself.
"And you get all the text, errors included, and that works out great."
"There's actually, If I can input here, there's actually a very good article on macaccessibility.net and that's www.macaccessbility.net, under the tutorials section that describes the cursor and how the cursor in mac or ios differs from the cursor in Windows."
"Uh, it describes it really well."
"That's what I read when I started using the ios devices cuz it got, it got me confused too."
"I'm like 'Wait a minute,'"
"'I didn't want to delete that character, I wanted to delete the one to the left.'"
"Then I read that article and now I realize that the cursor is different between the two operating systems, and so it's ah..."
I still make mistakes myself.
It takes a bit of getting used to.
I have done editing on here.
"But yeah, it's, It's definitely different than Windows."
[new speaker]
"And it's actually kind of neat because it's much more precise, but if you're not used to it it can really throw you."
And I don't want to waste everyone's time.
"If I were home, I'd spend the next ten minutes making this pristine just for the challenge, but I'm not going to waste everybody's time and do that."
[Audience member]
Thank you.
"Um..There's a lot of different places throughout the iPhone that you can actually go into edit mode, you'd like to be able to go into edit mode, like in the search fields, and um, and ah, text messaging, and things like that."
"Does this keyboard, this edit mode, work in every single one of the iPhone apps?"
Or does it only work in the notes?
"Um, the keyboard will work in any of the edit fields."
That's the nice thing about all of the ios devices.
"If you have an edit field in texting, or whether it's in notes, or Navigon, or any field, or any application, this keyboard's going to work with it. cuz an edit box is an edit box. and if the developer has-- [sudden library announcement over PA system]"
So we will often reject a paper.
Right away.
And now let me just tell you the process that we go through at the American Journal of Epidemiology.
"At first, it's looked at by the editor-in-chief and then he assigns it to one of the other editors, who really makes the final decision and I happen to play that role, as a general epidemiology editor."
"There are other more specialized editors that work just in cancer, or just in cardiovascular disease or just in infectious diseases, but I tend to be more general."
And so.
"If the two of us think that the paper is not going to be of sufficient priority to be accepted, even if it's good science and well-reviewed, then as a favor to the authors, we won't delay a rejection of it."
"Another, beside novelty, another criterion we look at is interest to the readers of this particular journal."
"For example, sometimes we'll get a paper that really is not so much an epidemiological study, but a way to improve public health, and we will decide, you know, this is really."
"More suitable to a, to a public health journal then to the American Journal Of"
Epidemiology.
"We, also look for good writing, and this can be especially a be a problem, with a non-english speaking author."
"Usually when a paper comes from a foreign country, often the english is, really, bad and we know it's gonna need a lot of work, and we think it's a good study, we will often, send it back and say please have a, someone, a native english speaker go through this and edit it."
"And occasionally this comes, when a foreign, person who is, who's english who's, lang, need of languages not english."
It works in an American institution and submits a paper.
So you know usually that is not a problem.
But it can be.
Mm-hm.
Another Fact.
"Factors that you know, don't make the paper too long."
Don't put in too much excess material that's not needed.
And another important problem is what we call slicing the salami too thin.
"Yes, yeah that would be great for you to say a bit about it."
"You know, if you, [laugh], I have a study that involves both men and women and want to try to get two papers out of it say here's what that risk factor, here's the effect of this risk factor in men."
And then another paper here's the effect of this risk factor in women that is really frowned upon by journals.
And my own personal experience is that I was I had to deal with this as an author.
"A colleague and I, each wrote a paper about health effects of cigar smoking."
This was at Kaiser Permanente.
His was on cardiovascular disease.
Mine was on cancer.
"I submitted I, mine to the, Annals of Epidemiology and was accepted."
He submitted his to the New England Journal.
"So I, I was hoping you could comment on that."
[laugh].
"Well I. I, I don't think you'll necessarily dumb down the science."
"And, of course you do want precision and clarity."
"But, I think you should avoid jargon and things that are really hard to understand."
"George Comstock, who's no longer alive but he was used to be the Editor in Chief of the American Journal of Epidemiology, used to say that, papers should be understandable by someone with a good college education or someone who reads the Scientific American."
"It does not have to be full of jargon that's only understood by your, your peers and your particular specialty."
Yeah.
So I would.
You know we welcome things that are very readable and easy to read.
"I don't, I, I, I would not have that fear at all."
Yeah and.
"In terms of getting published when you get two papers in and say they were the same science and one was very jargony and you know, sounds sort of the way, scientists think they have to write and you have one that's clear, can you comment on your chances of publication."
"Well you know, if both of them get peer reviewed and, and very highly rated and they seem like, they seem important to the editors we might ask."
"You know, to please explain what you mean by this, word or by this sentence?"
"Yeah, yeah."
So it will take an extra step if it's really hard to understand and not clear to most readers.
"Yeah, yeah."
And what advice can you give specifically to first time authors?
"I imagine a lot of, the students in this course are, you know, early in their career."
"And haven't had a chance to get published yet or, or, in the process of submitting their first papers?"
"What bothers me most, is when I get a paper, you know, often be from a really good institution and the senior author at the end of the list is someone who's well known, but it's clear its been written by a student, [laugh], and, if it sounds like a thesis, it sounds like a Phd thesis, or masters thesis, Which, and it contains every conceivable strength of the study, every conceivable weakness, [laugh], so that, to prove, in writing the thesis they learned what they were supposed to learn in a school public."
Author in their graduate program.
"So, Right is if you were more established senior scientist who knows what other scientists understand."
"And, you don't have to explainuh, something to everything."
"I just happened to see a paper this morning in the latest journal of the American Journal of Epidemi-, the latest issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology that was going over the strength and limitations of there study."
"And, it was a study about mortality and, in whites and African Americans and related to a certain."
"Factor, and I was saying, one of the strength of our study is that we had a"
large African American.
Population as part of this study group.
"Well, that's sort of obvious or you wouldn't."
"Right, right, [laugh]."
It's a stupid world.
"Let's go back to the beginning, OK, to the very first browser and the very first server."
"Initially they were both on the same machine, but eventually they figured out how to put a wire between them, and that was a good thing, that's when it started to get interesting."
"Pretty quickly you get to the point where you've got so many browsers trying to attack one server that one server can't do it anymore, so we had to start thinking about how we're going to scale."
"Historically what we did was put a distributor in front of the servers, so each request that comes in can route either at random or round robin or least loaded, whatever policy you want."
The message goes somewhere else and that server deals with it.
Then you've got a database in the back that they can all share.
The database becomes a problem -- that becomes a bottleneck.
"Initially everybody was using some kind of relational database there, which I think was a really bad fit for this."
The relational database was developed at IBM back in the mainframe era to solve a completely different class of problems than we have here.
"But there were a lot of people who understood how they worked, and understanding how they work means you don't have to rethink anything, so great, we'll just take that and put it in."
And they didn't scale.
"So in the decades since then, we've done a lot of things — figuring out how to shard them and do other stuff -- and in doing that you break the relational model, so most of the goodness you got from that model you don't get any more."
"But at least you don't have to rethink anything, OK, so"
life continues.
"But at some point even that doesn't work, so you start looking for other options."
"People have come up with no SQL databases, which are wonderful."
I love these things.
There's
"Mongo, and Couch, and all the others."
They're great.
"People are kind of going back and changing the assumptions, and going what's really important here?"
The important thing often is scalability.
"You're going to trade off a lot of other things in order to get that, and we're getting it, so that's really good."
It turns out Yahoo!'s been doing this for a long time.
"We had a massive home grown no SQL database introduction here since 1996, so we've been doing this for a long time too."
It's wonderful stuff.
But now let's put Ajax on top of all of this.
This model was not designed for Ajax.
"This was something that we kind of figured out after the fact that we could do, and it's not optimal for us."
The biggest problem is: where does the server put its state?
"Because this model assumes that it's stateless, so that any request can go to any server."
"What it is it's sort of like charismatic power - being likable, having a charm factor, being respected highly, being looked up to for who you are, for you integrity, for the way you think, for the way you're cool and calm and rational, and you're cooperative and collaborative, and you just have these characters that people admire."
You're actually going to see this in some of your assignments.
Maybe you'll see it in groups you belong to.
You know people like this.
"Everybody follows them because they seem to know how to act, but also their ideas are pretty good, and they just set such a good example by the way they are."
"The third type of power, we tend to use it too much, it's called expert power."
"You know it's having the answers, having some knowledge, bringing knowledge in from our past."
We have the answers because we've done this before.
"You know, every group needs expert power."
"You need people who are veterans who have some experience, so they can bring it to the group as long as it's not overdone or telling the group what to do or the know-it-all."
You've got to be real careful about overusing expert power.
"Let the group sort of make its decisions, bringing ingredients in appropriately as an information giver, as we talked about that role, rather than trying to control outcomes by overusing expert power to sway a group toward something you think is best."
The fourth of these types of power is called reward power.
"Now, reward power is the ability to give people something, some kind of perks."
"Maybe, ""I'll bring refreshments next time, again."""
"And everybody says, ""Ah, I love that."""
Maybe you're a good cook; you can bake something.
"I was in a Bible study once, and it was a men's Bible study, a bunch of farmers six in the morning, and we all took turns."
It was such a cool thing.
There was a reward there though.
"It was almost like, you brought the cookies, you brought the baked goods, cinnamon rolls, and you made the coffee, and everybody took turns giving perks, and it was all sort of a cool thing."
"If you've every been in a group, maybe somebody in the group says,"
"""Alright if we succeed in this, I'll buy everybody dessert at Applebee's after the meeting if we can figure this out by nine o' clock."""
"So, if there is some reward power everybody is on task."
They want this to happen.
"And the next of these, the fifth type of power, is what we call coercive power, where we punish people."
"We don't like somebody's idea, so we try to embarrass them."
We try to criticize them; we try to shut them down.
We try to get them to be quiet.
And those are not good things.
"And this is where gate keeping comes in, so we don't allow people to misuse gate keeping to quiet down people while letting other people talk more."
And the last of these is persuasive power.
Sal thank you very much from the Khan Academy.
Sal:
Thank you.
Tom:
And you and I will get together later and see if we can improve my math skills.
Thank you.
This is a Web Archiving Service tutorial video that will show you how to conduct an XML metadata export.
There are two different options for exporting as an XML file.
The first method can provide you with the document of all of your files.
"To complete an export of this type, you will first go to the ""Project Admin"" page, which is found under the ""Administration"" tab."
"Here you find a link to the XML metadata export page, in the list of reports."
"Once you are on the XML Metadata Export page, you may choose whether you would like to export all of your files, or just your publicly available files."
"Click ""Create Report"" to export your data as an XML file."
The second option for exporting as an XML file allows you to create a limited list of files for export.
"To create an export of this type, you will first go to the ""Manage Sites"" page, which is found under the ""Sites"" tab."
"Once you are on the ""Manage Sites"" page, you can use the limits on the right side of the screen to narrow the results that are displayed."
"For example, you might choose to only display items that have been captured since a particular date."
"After creating a limited list, select the items that you are interested in exporting, and then scroll to the bottom of the page."
"Click on the link that says ""Get XML Metadata Export for selected."""
This link takes you to the same
"""XML Metadata Export"" page where you were able to choose whether you would like to include all of the items you selected, or just the publicly available ones."
"Again, click ""Create Report"" to export your data as an XML file."
"Choosing between these two XML Metadata options is dependent on whether you are interested in creating a brand-new list, or whether you are updating a previously created list."
The document created from the XML Metadata Export is a raw XML file.
You will need to convert the file to make it functional in your local system.
Feel free to use your local tools for this.
WAS provides a generic MarcEdit XSL stylesheet that can be installed to produce basic MARC records from the XML report.
You will still need to customize the XSL stylesheet to fit the needs of your institution.
"Further information can be found by clicking on the ""Help"" link and choosing ""XML Site Report."""
"This document provides a description of all of the fields in the XML report, as well as a link to the previously mentioned"
XSL crosswalk for MarcEdit.
This has been a Web Archiving Service video tutorial on how to conduct an XML metadata export.
"You could have this circle right over here, so you see clearly that two points are not enough"
You need three points.
"Three points lead to a triangle, which leads to a unique circle"
So that by itself is kind of cool
Now another question is if I have a circle
And if it circumscribed about an arbitrary triangle is the center of that circle necessarily the circumcenter?
So let's think about that a little bit because there are some non-intuitive cases here.
"So if I draw a circle right over here, its center is right over there, and if I draw an arbitrary triangle where all of the vertices of that triangle are on this circle, is this center necessarily the circumcenter of that triangle?"
So let me draw a crazy situation
Let me draw one where this thing is clearly outside of the triangle.
So we could have one that looks like this and clearly all three vertices sit on the circle.
"So you might first say, wait, there's no way this could be the circumcenter, it's not even inside the triangle."
"But remember, this point right here is equidistant to every point on the circle."
"I should say, every point on the circle is equidistant from this point."
They're all a radius away.
And all three points of this triangle are on the circle
So they are all exactly a radius away from this point right over here.
"So this distance is going to be a radius, this distance right over here is going to be a radius, and this distance right over here is going to be a radius"
"Now, this point is clearly equidistant from that point and that point."
We know that.
It's exactly R away from both of those vertices of the triangle
"So if it's equidistant, and we proved this in a previous video, if it's equidistant from both of those points, it must be on the perpendicular bisector of the segment that joins those two points"
So this must be on the perpendicular bisector.
"So that's perpendicular, and it bisects that segment right over there."
But we can make the same argument for this segment right over here. because this point is R from the center
"We're going to call it point 0, I'm tired of just calling it ""this point"" point O is equidistant from"
"Let me label these, so let's call this A, B, C."
So we already said point O is equidistant from
"C and B, so it must be on the perpendicular bisector of BC, and it's also equidistant from A and B"
It's R away from both because
A and B both sit on the circle they are both a radius away from the center
So it also must sit on the perpendicular bisector of A and B.
That's gonna be hot.
It's nice!
Very savoury but soft!
A little bit different from your normal grain.
"So, I hope you enjoyed your savoury oatmeal dinner, we're gonna have ours put in a plate and topped it off with the avocado and enjoy it here on the roof top in Kas."

In 2007 the crisis in the real-state market spread fast around the world
Millions of people lost their houses and their jobs ?
We are deep in shit and we all know it but we still trust that all is not going to fall apart
Is capitalism destroying itself and
I think that is all splosh
Capitalism
Karl Marx and the critique of Capitalism is undergoing a revival today
To bring Marx's Kapital to the stage is a crazy edeavour
The success of this play is very astonishing for me fully unexpected
The achivement of Capitalism is the limitless capacity or commodities
But how can Marx's criticism of capitalism can help us to gain a better understandig of this crisis?
The question from Marx is not aimed at more critique
From where does all the enthusiasm with everything that has to do with Karl Marx comes?
"In a lot of countries in the West, dealing with your waste, you're kind of separated from it, you put it in the bin and it magically disappears."
"Someone comes, it's all arranged for you."
You don't have to think about it.
"And here, you have to make an extra effort, because there really isn't a system, so you have to think about it."
You're confronted with it.
"So even though there's a really bad problem, there's a positive side, because you're forced to recognize the problem."
You're forced to have to deal with it.
"So looking at that side of it, it's really an opportunity for people to kind of confront their their consumption, their pollution."
"Bali has a problem about every year our coastal, when it's the season once a year, a lot of plastic garbage landed in Kuta coastal."
The government said this is because of the sea tides.
"It's not about the sea tides, from my opinion, it's about people still throw plastic garbage in the river or in the canals and they flow to the ocean, and the ocean will bring it back to the land."
"Waste management is a little bit the land of no one, no?"
"I mean it's a little bit, you can almost do whatever you want without really being caught. / But the garbage problem affects everybody, rich and poor, and if you can't deal with that basic problem- pollution from your waste- then how are you going to deal with these large, more complex problems, like deforestation, destruction of the coral reef, and climate change."
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
I want to reach the greatest mountain.
"Climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store... [instrumental and chorus]"
"[rhythmic dripping, haunting melody continues]"
And here we have the result of some simulations of the exploratory agent.
We see it's doing much better than the passive agent or than the Greedy agent.
So I'm graphing here; and we only had to go through 100 trials.
We didn't have to go through 500--so it's converging much faster.
And it's converging to much better results.
"So the policy loss and the dotted lines started off high; but after only 20 trials, it's come down to perfect."
"So it learned the exact, correct policy after 20 trials."
"The error in the utilities--so you can have the perfect policy, while not quite having the right utilities for each state-- and the errors in utility comes down, and that, too, comes down to a level that's lower than the previous agent's-- but still, not quite perfect."
"And we see here that it, in fact, learns the correct policy."
"Now that we have constructed Hilbert spaces and Orthonormal bases, we can see some of their distinguishing features."
"One of them is norm conservation, which is called Parseval's theorem, and is an extension of Pythagoras' famous Orthonormality theorem to infinite dimensions."
"Then, we will see the Orthogonal Projection Theorem."
This is a powerful method to take a vector from possibly an infinite dimensional space and project it onto a subspace.
"Once we have this, we will consider some examples of approximations and orthonormal bases."
Modules 3.3 Hilbert Space and Approximation.
The overview of this submodule is the following.
"First, we look at the norm conservation, in particular Parseval's formula."
"Then, we look at the approximation by the projection method, and finally we explore a few examples."
"Parseval's theorem: we know that if we have a basis for space, any vector x can be written as a linear combination, summed from 0 to K-1, αk, wk."
"For an orthonormal basis, there is this beautiful formula which says that the squared norm of x, ||x|| squared is equal to the sum of the coefficents of expansion squared, or Parseval's formula."
Let us verify Parseval's formula on a simple example.
"We have the canonical basis E, e0 on e1, and we can write x as α0, e0, α1, e1."
"Let us look at the new basis, the blue one, which is given by v0 and v1."
"V0 is equal to cosθ sineθ transpose, v1 is minus sinθ cosθ transpose."
"And x can of course also be written as a linear combination of v0 and v1, namely, β0, v0, plus β1, v1."
It's going to happen. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
What was that again? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
It's going to happen. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"Two last questions from me, and Vic did a great job on the panel on the mobile Internet a few moments ago."
Would you be willing to opine in your lifetime when mobile-related revenue search might surpass PC-based revenue?
Given that we now know where the future is going? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
It clearly will.
It's a question of the growth rate of data-capable mobile devices.
"The reason it clearly will is that the monetization of the ads should be higher, because they're even more targeted."
"So we have a lot of evidence, and Vic talks about this in his speeches, where when you have a powerful browser, whether it's the I-Phone, is a good example, the Blackberry now has one, obviously the Android phones, as they come out."
"People spend many, many more searches when they finally have a capable browser."
"And so one of the things, one of the questions is what's new in the technology sense, as opposed to the financial market sense, and the development of this new, open source browser that all these things are based on, really does create that first step of a whole new platform."
So how long does it take?
"The answer is, a few years."
But not a few decades. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"One last question from me, and then I'll turn it over to others."
You have been a great partner with your revenue-sharing agreements with thousands or millions of other players.
"You don't necessarily get the credit for it that, in my humble opinion, you should."
But you're offering those sorts of compelling deals to content providers.
You're offering an Android operating system to the mobile device market.
"And this goes back, it's the same question, slightly differently, do those offers become more compelling to standouts in the next six to 12 months than they have been in the past? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Do you mean people who have previously said no? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Yep.
Yep. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Well, I think one of the first principles of business is that they say no this year and maybe they'll say yes next year."
We're working really hard to create ecosystems that have enough differentiation and enough innovation that people want to play in them.
"And we're also trying to do business terms that are non-exclusive, so that everybody has access to it."
So there's certainly no prohibition from people doing it.
"In the Android case, it was discussed at the 3GSM conference that there are quite a few partners that have pre-announced their intent to offer Android-based devices of one kind--and some of these things look like phones but some of them are, in fact, not phones."
"And that obviously, then, creates the cycle for more applications."
And that'll bring more people to the party.
"I think people in the room here understand how platform businesses work, and it's fundamentally about momentum."
Let's see another example.
"Now, be careful here with this power of two."
We can not apply that to each of these two terms.
"What this means is (3y-5), (3y-5)."
"So again, we can FOlL."
"This is equal to the product of the first terms in the binomials, so 3y * 3y."
"And then, plus the product of the outer terms in the two binomials, so 3y * -five."
"And then plus the product of the inner terms in the two binomials, so -five * 3y."
"And then, plus the product of the last term in the two binomials, so -five * -five which is equal to 9y^2 - 15y - 15y + 25."
And combining the outer and inner terms gives us our answer of 9y^2 - 30y + 25.
"Now again, this is a common type of multiplication here where we're multiplying a binomial by itself."
And there's a special formula again in this type of case.
And the formula is that (A-B)^2 = A^2 - 2AB + B^2.
"That is the outer and inner terms are the same, so there'll be two of them."
"Which we just saw with A = 3y, and B = five."
"So, our answer here is A^2 or (3y)^2 - two * A * B, and then plus B^2, or 9y^2 - 30y + 25."
And this is how we multiply two binomials.
"Thank you, and we'll see you next time."
"Now we're going to succinctly talk about body fluid cleanup, from a potential bio-hazard."
"Now, when we do this, I'll tell you, one of the best things you can do actually, is have your scene set up first."
"I mean making sure you have extra pair of gloves already laid out, having your disposable wipes, having your premixed 1 to 10 household bleach solution,"
"One part bleach to ten parts water, which is suggested by the Centers for Disease Control for a disinfecting household solution, if you don't have a commercial virucidal, or another disinfecting solution."
"The goal here, now, is to obviously disinfect the surface, this could be applied to tools or other inanimate objects as well, but in this case it's a table top."
"Somebody had a bloody nose, a child or an adult, they bled on the table, and now we're coming in later to disinfect this."
"In the meantime, if you notice there's a blood-spill, and you can't disinfect right away, block off the area so that other people don't come in contact with it, and become infected as well, or at least exposed."
So first is to actually clean up as much of the gross contaminate as possible.
We're gonna do this by wiping the bulk of the contaminate off the table.
"If you can have someone assist you by bringing the bag in, we're going to dispose of the contaminate in a bio-haz bag, being careful not to cross-contaminate."
"Now, if we're working with a clean bottle, and we've just wiped up contaminate,"
I mean I can get this contamination on these gloves pretty easily.
"Let's remove the first contaminated gloves without snapping or popping the gloves, with a glove-on-glove, skin-on-skin, removal procedure."
"Now we're gonna be careful, and actually drop those into the bio-haz bag as well."
"But with attacking two chemicals, so, being a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, we can sometimes see benefit and therapeutic outcomes."
So you have to balance this spectrum.
"So, the first group we're going to talk about is the SNRls, which is the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors."
So this is a reuptake pump inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine.
"So we're not only going to prevent serotonin from being sucked back up by the brain, and not be able to be used, but we're going to increase norepinephrine in the same manner."
"The first SNRI is Venlafaxine, and this is"
Effexor and Effexor XR.
"This is dosed twice a day, anywhere from 75-300mg total."
Your mechanism of action is as a SNRl.
We have a couple different indications.
"How this drug needs to be managed is, we need to go slow in terms of initiation."
We need a slow titration because of the side effect profile.
"Again, this medication is a very effective medication to be used, but it needs to be titrated slowly, because there are a lot of side effects."
So it's very difficult to get patients on and off of this medication.
The nausea and diarrhea is very severe.
"This situation, you actually want to use the extended release preparation, because there are"
less side effects associated with the extended release.
"Similar side effects to the SSRls: headaches, sexual side effects, the increase in anxiety, and insomnia."
"We do see an increase in blood pressure, especially as we get to the higher doses of the medicine, and it's usually isolated systolic increase."
"So you have to use this with caution in certain patient populations, potentially."
"And again, use that long-acting formulation to avoid side effects."
"Interestingly enough, with this medication, you need to be at the higher end of the dosing spectrum to get that double-action effect."
"At the lower end, in initiation of the medication, up until about 150mg, you're really only getting action as an SSRl, so as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor."
You're not hitting both neurotransmitters until the higher level dosing.
"Again, I mentioned this medication needs to be titrated slowly: there's a significant withdrawal, again, with the medicine, so, like I said, it's very hard to get on and off of, but it's a very effective medication in treatment."
The next SNRI is one of our newest antidepressants:
"Duloxetine, or Cymbalta."
"Anywhere from 20-60mg a day, and, again, an SNRl."
The main difference with this is that patients get the dual action right away.
"Versus Venlafaxine, it took to get to the higher dosing spectrum."
This we get right away.
"Nausea, insomnia, and headache are the most reported side effects."
The other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral bleaching.
"It's a beautiful picture, right?"
All that white coral.
Except it's supposed to be brown.
"What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis, and they have these little algal cells that live inside them."
"And the algae give the corals sugar, and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection."
"But when it gets too hot, the algae can't make the sugar."
"The corals say, ""You cheated."
"You didn't pay your rent."""
"They kick them out, and then they die."
"Not all of them die; some of them survive, some more are surviving, but it's really bad news."
"To try and give you a sense of this, imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked."
"And you come home, and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves."
"And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,"
"""Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."""
"Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died."
"And then the really scary thing about all of this -- the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change -- is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum."
"But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks, the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts."
"And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this, is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?"
"I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it."
But what does that mean?
We really don't know.
So what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years?
"Well, there won't be any fish except for minnows, and the water will be pretty dirty, and all those kinds of things and full of mercury, etc., etc."
"And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge, and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global, coastal ocean."
"Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it, because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette."
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom; sometimes you don't.
That doesn't sell.
"The really scary things though are the physical, chemical, oceanographic things that are happening."
"As the surface of the ocean gets warmer, the water is lighter when it's warmer, it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over."
We say it becomes more strongly stratified.
"The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries, of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever, those slow down and those fisheries collapse."
And he said she was.

"With kids that age, I think it's more of an addiction, you know, they have to get that text, they have to be talking to somebody all the time."
"She believed me in so many things, and she did what I told her to do the whole time she was growing up, but this one thing we couldn't get her to quit."
"I told her, I said, ""You've got to stop this."
"You're going to have a wreck if you continue to do this."""
"But, her mentality was it wasn't gonna happen to her, because she looked me right in the eye and said, ""Dad, no I'm not."""
Cause that happens to other people.

Have you ever felt like you have walked into the middle of a movie?
What if this movie was the story of your life?
An experience that made you sick to your stomach.

"The best time to cry is at night when the lights are out and someone is being beaten up and screaming for help,"
"Hello, everyone."
"I'm Amanda D'Annucci and I'm going  to be talking to you about storytelling, conflict resolution,  psychology and neuroscience."
"Did you know that  by telling someone a story, instead of spewing out  a mouthful of data, that you can engage a much larger  portion of their brain?"
The art of storytelling has psychological  and neurological basis that scientifically explains the natural human predilection for narrative.
"A vast portion of a person's brain is activated during the listening to, and telling of a story"
"For instance, the amygdala hippocampus system, which is responsible  for preliminary encoding of episodic and autobiographic memories is engaged; the left perisylvian region where language is created is engaged; and also, it has been proven  that the same sections of the brain lights up when the storyteller or the respective listener interacts."
"Quite simply, narrative engages the entire human brain, the entire human experience."
"If a string of word can affect a person in such a profound way, how powerful can the art of story be?"
"Stories can heal, stories can teach, stories can inspire, stories can enlighten stories can resolve."
"For my master thesis here at Gallatin,"
I'm exploring the power of story and relation to conflict resolution  and peace making.
Story is an influential tool which  can mold the most obstinate of minds by means of appealing  to an individual's pathos.
"By using story as a communication tool, a pessimist understanding can be  made into a relatable situation."
There's an ample evidence of storytelling  in a multitude of cultures around mankind.
"The eyes, the jaw, the teeth: everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has."
We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution -- enormous polygonal count.
And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin in the computer.
But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.
"We went through this process, then, called retargeting."
This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.
"And here's the resulting data that comes from that, the model that comes from that."
Retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model.
"And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjamin was made from Brad, we could transpose the data of Brad at 44 onto Brad at 87."
"So now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s."
Next we had to go into the shooting process.
"So while all that's going on, we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world."
"And we shot our body actors, and we shot them wearing blue hoods."
So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.
"And the blue hoods helped us with two things: one, we could easily erase their heads; and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set."
But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.
And so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen.
"His job, then, was to become Benjamin."
And so we looped the scenes.
He watched again and again.
We encouraged him to improvise.
And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go.
We shot him with four HD cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast.
From there we went into a process called image analysis.
"And so here, you can see again, the chosen take."
"And you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87."
"And so, what's interesting about this is we used something called image analysis, which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face."
"And so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow."
"And the software would tell us that, well, in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here, and it concludes moving in frame 32."
And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from.
"And then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew -- that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in live action with our database of aged Benjamin, the FACS shapes that we had."
"On a frame-by-frame basis, we could actually reconstruct a 3D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad."
"Now when my mother died and I had grief, it wasn't a negative emotion."
"Out of my grief came hope and inspiration, determination and respect and all those things you talked about."
"And when a loved one dies and we have grief, I think, I put it to you that we have grief because we have a connection, it's the spirit connection within us - it's that God part in us that connects with the"
God part of that other person.
So therefore it's the passing of the spirit.
That when we have grief over death it's about the passing of that spirit which we accept.
"So I put it to you that grief is not a negative emotion but it's intrinsic in the emotion of love because out of love comes joy and peace and patience and kindness, gentleness, prayerfulness, goodness and understanding and self-control."
"Now, in close, if you made a comment I'd appreciate it."
"But I've noticed that you've mentioned John Howard, now I respect John Howard because firstly as a father, he's been a great father, I'm a father, and secondly he's been a magnificent"
"leader to this nation for a long period of time, so I think we should respect him for who he is."
Ajahn Brahm:
I agree with you with respect yes.
"Okay, it's a long question there and usually I try to repeat this for the tape but that was too long a question to repeat it for and wouldn't actually catch it but the first thing, I'm just going to do this in brief."
The main question was about - is grief intrinsic to love?
"And I certainly thought that way when I was very young, but I know that I never had grief when my father died but I loved him very dearly."
"I couldn't understand why that was, and only later on when I went to Buddhist countries and spent nine years in the north-east of Thailand which unlike"
"Sri Lanka had not been, I would say influenced by ""Western"" civilisation."
"The West had never got to Thailand, or rather they never had colonised it."
"And so it was, what I could actually possibly call a pure Buddhist culture there."
And in the nine years I was there I never saw grief.
"And this was living in a village very close to those people, we were part of the family, and many times I saw people die."
The funerals were held in our monastery.
I never saw tears.
It wasn't part of their repertoire.
That proved to me was that grief is not intrinsic in the human condition.
There was a culture which didn't have it.
And it wasn't just the funerals.
"You'd see them afterwards, the next day, weeks, months, they were part of your family, the extended family of a monastery embedded in a couple of villages in the north-east of"
Thailand.
"And those people loved each other, but there is a another type of love, which is a love which will let go.."
Which will let a person go into a death.
"So grief is, and we're not saying that grief is wrong or bad."
"Not just ""kind of"", it's actually joining our ancestor as its being created and extending that relationship by joining with another instance of parent."
So you can kind of think of going down the ancestor tree adding relationships as we go down.
"Again, I really can't encourage you enough to download this query and play with it yourself to fully understand what's going on."
Let's go ahead and run it.
It's going to be rather anticlimatic.
"When we run it we do discover that these five people are Mary's ancestors, and if you've drawn the little tree of the data you can verify that, that's the correct answer."
Let's play around a little bit.
Let me try a few other people's ancestors.
Let's try Frank.
We don't see Frank here because
"Frank actually happens to be a child of Mary's, so we should get even more ancestors when we run this one, especially"
"Mary should be included, and in fact, she is, there she is, and these are Frank's ancestors."
"Let's try George, I think"
George was somewhere in the middle of the tree there.
"Yes, George has three ancestors, and finally let's try Bob."
"Bob is at the root so we should get an empty result and we do, because again Bob has no ancestors in our database."
Now lets take a look at our second example.
"That was the one where we had a hierarchy of management chain in a company, and then we were interested in computing the total salary cost of a project, so I've set up our three tables."
"The first one is the Employee table, it just gives the IDs of the employees and the salary of each employee."
The second table is the Manager relationship.
"So, again, you might want to draw the little tree here although it's pretty simple this time."
"123 is at the root of our little management structure, as 234 as a subordinate."
"234 has two subordinates, 345 and 456 and 345 is another one."
So it's only a three level tree.
Of course if we knew it was only three levels we wouldn't need recursion at all.
But we're going to write a query that will work for arbitrary numbers of levels.
So that's our management structure.
"And finally, our third table, the Project table says that employee 123 is the manager of project X, so what we want to do is find the manager of project"
"Y in the hierarchy,and then take that manager's salary along with the salary's of all the manager's subordinates recursively down to the management structure, and of course that's everybody in in our little database."
"Again, I can't encourage you to download the script and run it for yourself."
So here's our query to find the total salary of project x and I'm actually going to give a couple of different ways of running this for you.
The way we've done it the first time is to effectively expand the management structure into a relation called superior.
And desire this public
"Notice may be given of their Resolution, so their Parents and Friends may have sufficient Time to be providing Homespun Cloaths for them."""
[laughter]
It was like: 'we are making a proclamation.
"Mom, send me some clothes.'"
[laughter]
That was like--okay.
[laughs]
But the feeling was there.
[laughs]
"And even better, they want their parents to provide homespun clothes,"
"""that none of them may be obliged to the hard Necessity of unfashionable Singularity, by wearing imported Cloth."""
Okay.
"'Mom, if you don't send me clothes,"
I'm going to have to wear imported clothes and I'm going to be really unpopular'-- so--[laughter] guilting the parents.
"Okay, but anyway that's--Yale students of the 1760s actually making acts of protest, organizing themselves into active protest."
"Now Yale isn't unique in this way, actually."
"Throughout the--this period, colonial colleges in a variety of different places were places that tended to brew sentiment-- political sentiment that was rebellious or outraged at some of the acts being imposed by the British government."
"Actually, Yale and Harvard and the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton, tended to be particularly well-known as sort of seedbeds of unrest-- particularly angry students who had strong political feelings, but there were other colleges as well where the students really were provoked to acts of protest in a variety of different ways."
"And I--this morning in researching for this lecture,"
I found a bunch of Princeton/College of New Jersey students who decided that no one in Princeton should be drinking tea.
So they went out into the town and just personally forced their way in to people's houses and when they found tea they burned it.
"That would be really popular--right?--and then one of them said something like, ""That was a real frolic."""
[laughter]
Okay.
[laughs]
The town must have been very pleased.
"I think in another college the commencement exercises, the speeches that the students gave at a commencement exercise, at a pretty early point actually, they debated, one for, one and against the possibility of independence."
I think that was in 1769.
You had students at one college who decided that would be what would be happening at their commencement ceremony is they would have that debate.
"It's a really early point and again, pretty radical."
"So we're kind of looking at a long-standing pattern of college students being bold and radical during times of political controversy and political unrest, and this is happening throughout the colonies in this period."
"That means the quantity of tickets available is going to be ten, the quantity of Tickets or pollution rights demanded is going to be 25, there is a serious shortage in the market and in an auction that shortage is going to be solved by an elevation of the rights."
If the price of one of these tickets goes to $150 then you can imagine that A. will only buy four rights.
Why?
"Because A would prefer to incurr the $100 cost of abating the first unit of pollution than to pay, to pay $150 for a right to pol-."
To pollute or to emit that unit of pollution.
"So, the price, the quantity demanded of tickets is going to go down."
"As, the price at the auction goes up."
"As in all markets, there is going to be an equilibrium price for, these pollution rights."
"In thi s market on my document camera, we have the supply of pollution rights."
This vertical
line here.
There are ten of them.
Got it indicated there.
This demand curve is actually drawn from the earlier table.
"That is, I just, if the price goes up, I just ask how many. tickets would firms a, b, c, d and e, buy, and this is actually how it turns out."
"That is, as the price of the ticket goes up, the number of tickets demanded, goes, goes down, goes down to zero at $5600."
"Well, the equilibrium price."
Is going to be the intersection price and supply demand intersect at 1500 dollars.
Now suppose that the government decides to auction off these rights and the equilibrium price is 1500 dollars as we've indicated from our graphical analysis and then we ask the issue how many. tickets or pollution rights with each of these firms obey.
While A would prefer to clean up the first unit of pollution at a cost of a $100 and had to go by a pollution right and would enable it to avoid clean up.
"It would prefer to but. clean up the second one and the third one and the fourth one, but it would prefer to buy a pollution right at 1500 than to incur $1600 in costs."
So A is going to buy one pollution right.
"B, on the other hand, would prefer to clean up these first two units, incur those costs as opposed to paying $1500 to avoid cleaning them up, so B Is going to want to buy, three pollution rights. c is going to want to buy none of, none of the pollution rights, and the reason is that it's cost of clean up is, is lower for each of these units, than the $1,500 ticket price, so c Is going to have zero tickets, quantity demanded."
"D, is going to want to buy two tickets."
Why?
"Because it is cheaper to buy a ticket for 1,500, than to incur a pollution cost, abatement cost of 1,800 or 2,200."
"So D is going to buy two rights, and E is going to buy four rights."
"The reason is, it will clean up the first unit at $1000 as opposed to paying $1500 to avoid cleaning it up."
"It is cheaper to buy the rights here, so we have a situation here in which A. Is when a by one right D three, C0, D2, and A4."
"Well, at the end those up one, three, four, six, ten."
Quantity demanded is equal to ten.
Now we know where the distribution is.
"We'll talk about one later on that is, does have weight gain."
"But Paroxetine, of the SSRls, is probably your highest risk adding maybe about five pounds, to ten pounds."
"Sertraline, or Zoloft, is used at a dose anywhere from 50-200mg."
"Again, various indications."
"Some of the unique aspects of this are it can be a little more activating; we have some actual slight dopamine activity, so that can give a little bit of activation."
Dopamine often functions very similarly to norepinephrine.
"It can be helpful in an actual atypical depression, which we're not really focusing on during this talk, but those patients, that subset, that sleep more and eat more."
"We do see quite a bit of diarrhea and sweating with this clinically, so you have to be careful with initiation too, with patients."
"And then, again, you have to taper this medication."
"Pretty much every antidepressant, except for Prozac or Fluoxetine, you have to taper."
"Fluoxetine, with that long half-life, tapers itself."
"Citalopram, or Celexa, is actually, when looking at the pictures, probably the clean SSRI that we think of."
All it really touches is Serotonin.
"There's a little, little bit of antihistamine activity, so sedation is about 50/50 with this drug."
So half the patients say if they take it in the morning they're tired in the afternoon.
"Half of them, it doesn't make any difference."
"If they're taking the medicine in the morning, and really tired in the afternoon, they can switch it, potentially, to bedtime to help with that."
There's really no drug interactions.
"There's an advantage in the elderly with this, because it's a very clean, useful drug."
It does have two sides to it: it's broken down.
And so it has an inactive side in terms of when the liver metabolizes it.
And that becomes important because it leads into the next drug we're going to talk about.
"So, we're going to kind of transition into Citalopram to Escitalopram."
"And you see, Citalopram on the top has R and S enantiomers."
"And the liver metabolizes this drug into two components: an ""R"" enantiomer - which basically, think about this, is the liver makes active and inactive drug."
And the active drug is something called Escitalopram or Lexapro.
And so these two are really what we often refer to as cousins.
They're very similar medications.
"So, when looking at Escitalopram versus Citalopram, again, you see a little bit different dosage with the Lexapro in that we can kind of get a little bit lower dosage because, you see, it's about 100 times more potent than Citalopram."
"Meaning that it's not necessarily more effective; it's just occupying all receptors with active drugs, versus some receptors with inactive drug."
Some of the studies suggest that 10mg of Lexapro is about equivalent to 20-40mg of Citalopram.
"This can be an insurance issue, though."
"It's an extraordinary journey, one that I will now symbolize by embarking upon a journey of my own... over to camera 2...Hi there, camera 2, it's me, John Green,"
let's start with that double cheeseburger.
"Oh, food photography, so this contains 490 calories."
"To get this cheeseburger, you have to feed, raise and slaughter cows then grind their meat, then freeze it and ship it to its destination."
You also have to grow some wheat and then process the living crap out of it until it's whiter than Queen Elisabeth I. Then you have to milk some cows and turn their milk into cheese.
"That's not even to mention the growing and pickling of cucumbers or the sweetening of tomatoes and the grinding of mustard seeds, etc."
How in the sweet name of everything holy have we ever come to live in a world where such a thing can even be created.
"And how is it possible that those 490 calories can be served to me for an amount of money that if I make the minimum wage here in the US, I can earn it in 11 minutes!"
"And most importantly, should I be delighted or alarmed to live in this strange world of relative abundance."
"Well, to answer that question, we are not going to be able to"
"look strictly at history, because there isn't a written record about a lot of these things."
"But thanks to archaeology and paleobiology, we can look deep into the past."
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.
"So 15,000 years ago, humans were foragers and hunters."
"Foraging meant gathering fruits, nuts, also wild grains and grasses."
"Hunting allowed for a more protein-rich diet, as long you could find something with meat to kill."
By far the best hunting gig in the prehistoric world incidentally was fishing.
"Which is one of the reasons why when you look at the history of people populating the planet, we tended to run for the shore and stay there."
"Marine life was A, abundant, and B, relatively unlikely to eat you."
"While we tend to think the lives of the foragers were nasty, brutish and short, fossil evidence suggests that they actually had it pretty god."
Their bones and teeth are healthier than those of agriculturalists.
And anthropologists who studied the remaining forager peoples have noted that they actually they spend a lot fewer hours working than the rest of us.
"And they spend more time on art, music and storytelling."
Also if you believe the classic of anthropology
"""Nisa"", they also have a lot more time for skoodilypooping."
What?
I call it skoodilypooping.
I am not going to apologize.
It's worth noting that the cultivation of crops seems to have risen independently over the course of millenia.
"And the number of places, from Africa, to China, to the Americas, using crops that naturally grew nearby."
"Rise in Southeast Asia, maize in Mexico, potatoes in the Andes, wheat in the fertile crescent, yams in West Africa."
People around the world began to abandon their foraging for agriculture.
"That's counter to justice,"
"I mean, that's counter to common sense!"
"Apparently Judge Deana McDonald isn't aware of the thing called the internet, where names like Will Frey and Austin Zehnder can be spread very very quickly."
"I would call the judge and defense attorneys behind these actions disgusting, but that wouldn't be an appropriate enough word."
So I'll use these words:
WlLL FREY AND AUSTlN ZEHNDER.
"Look, bottom line, in a world where half of rape victims don't say a word, we have a justice system that's encouraging girls to keep their mouth shut, at least one specific girl."
That's completely counter to what we need to have happen in this country.
"It's beyond offensive, it's freakin' wrong."
"So tell us what you think of Will Frey and Austin Zehnder,"

Tree rings are rich with history and can reveal the exact age and geographic origin of a tree trunk or a piece of wood.
"The scientific analysis of tree ring patterns is known as dendrochronology, and was used to learn more about the cabinet's wood."
Only certain types of wood can be analyzed with dendrochronology.
"In the case of the cabinet, the oak interior was most suitable."
"But the end grain of these oak panels, where the tree pattern is visible, was inaccessible."
"So to examine the hidden tree ring pattern of the interior, an innovative method of x-raying was devised."
"To begin, parts of the cabinet were carefully disassembled, transferred to the museum's x-ray laboratory and placed on a rotating table."
"For dendrochronology to be effective, the rings must be measured very accurately."
"Once the tree rings were perfectly aligned, the image was recorded on x-ray film."
"The tree rings were measured from this high resolution image and these results, along with many other samples, were analyzed by a dendrochronologist, who compared the tree ring measurements to weather patterns in different regions, going back in history."
"The dendrochronologist concluded that these oak panels came from a tree that grew in the region of Burgundy, in eastern France, and was cut down in 1574, six years before the cabinet was made."
Even the cabinet's smallest details had much to reveal about its origins.
"The middle drawer is lined with a silk and linen fabric, which is held in place by rose head tacks."
Scientific analysis could tell us whether these tacks are from the 16th century or are later reproductions.
"A loose, broken tack discovered inside the cabinet was prepared for analysis."
It was embedded in liquid resin that was hardened under blue light.
It was an extremely painful delivery for my wife.
The doctor rushed the whole process so he could go sailing.
"My daughter is 37 now; but wherever we go, she is always the last to leave the house."
"And whenever we go somewhere by car, she is always the last one to get out of the car."
I think she is still angry for having been rushed at birth.
In the Front Line
"For example, when my son was born I had to fight very hard to be there."
Somebody had decided that it would not good.
"And after he was born, I wasn't allowed to hold him in my arms, because I had walked in from the street."
Decisions like these.
That is bio-politics.
"What do those people think, who make such decisions?"
I remember a book: a thick book written by an American journalist.
"Its title was 'Eleni', which is about his ordeal trying to find out who signed his mother's execution order."
"She was shot to death in the Greek Civil War but before it happened, she had looked for someone to help his son escape the country."
And the whole book is about how he is trying to find out who signed his mother's execution order.
And he believes that he is going to kill the person.
"However, when he finds the old man the only thing he does is to spit him in his face and with that the story was over."
"Well, whoever signed the order to have Agi Gereb imprisoned, I would like to spit in their face."
I've never felt as outraged in my entire life as I felt when I heard this story.
There can't be any more unjust and cruel misunderstanding than this.
"It's as if Hungary had regressed to dark, medieval times."
"'Malleus maleficarum' was a book in the medieval ages, which was used in the systematic persecution of witches, by which they made a distinction between witches and non-witches."
It is the same dark force that was used by the Dominicans to persecute those whom they wished to accuse as witches.
"The harm that is done by obstetrics, by a doctor who works in a mechanical and dogmatic way, may go unnoticed for 20, 25 or 30 years after a person's birth."
"Since the harm done by obstetrics cannot be implied immediately, it is even harder to recognize than the situation was in Semmelweis' case."
So this is where those psychologists who know prenatal psychology should stand up and say:
"'Ok, perhaps both mother and child will live, but it is very likely that the child will need 20 years of psychotherapy 20 or 30 years from now, just because we are not listening to Leboyer or Agi Gereb.'"
"If there is any kind of tension around a child's birth, it is something that a whole generation will pay for within15-20 years."
"So the sooner there is some kind of solidarity and cooperation between obstetrician and midwives, the better it is."
"Michel Odent, who has visited me on a few occasions, and we have given several lectures together."
"He has stated several times, without any reservations, that everything he knows about births, as an obstetrician, he has learned from midwives."
Enhancing the size of the student body means we need more faculty to teach them.
"We hired five new faculty last year, eleven new faculty joined us this year, and we're out recruiting for even more faculty to join us next year."
These new faculty add to our expertise and they add an energy that's revitalizing the College of Business Administration.
We believe that we are shaping and molding the next set of ethical leaders for Nebraska and the world.
"As our enrollments increase, we are taking steps to keep all these new students highly engaged."
"For example, all freshmen now take a course that's designed to introduce them to the rigors of college work, introduce them to the various majors in business, to leadership, and to help connect them to fellow students so they have a sense of community here in the College of Business Administration."
Many people say we're a large college that feels small.
And I like that.
"Hi I'm Clark Cunningham, are you from Germany."
"I think it was a fantastic way for me personally, I'm from out of state so it's kind of hard for me to get to know people."
"It was a really great way for me to experience new cultures, get to meet people."
"We're all doing something that's new to us, we're all in this new environment and I thought it was fantastic."
The University of Nebraska is a city within a city.
Get to know as many people as you possibly can.
Speakers like alumnus Aaron Davis and Husker legend Dr. Tom Osborne speak to our freshman class.
They stress the importance of meeting new people and both are examples of the rich traditions of this university.
This fall we rolled out a new major in supply chain management.
We also revised our management major to include a new track in entrepreneurship.
"Finally, we started a new minor in business designed especially for non-business majors from all the other colleges around the campus."
And it's been very well received.
"This summer, I attended the CBA Nebraska at Oxford Program along with 71 students from the University of Nebraska."
"The program, held at one of the most prestigious schools in the world, is the largest study abroad program at the university and has flourished over the last 24 years."
"All these great things happening here in the College of Business Administration would not be possible without the support of you, our friends, our alums, and our business partners."
"In fact, we've just wrapped up our annual CBA partnership summit and advisory board meetings."
More than 170 individuals from all over the nation give of their time and talents serving on our 12 advisory boards.
We're fortunate to have such loyal volunteers who take an active interest in CBA.
"As you can see, it's a great time to be part of the College of Business Administration."
Thank you for your interest and support and I encourage you to continue to engage in our CBA community.
CBA's the place to be.
You'll be hearing more from me soon.

"When you quit smoking, it's like there's a good self on one side saying,"
Photoshop.
"So here at the capture sharpening stage you can often just stick with the defaults but if you do want a photo to look sharper here on your screen at this stage, here's how to work with the detail panel's sharpening controls."
The first thing you wanna do is set up your previews.
"You have your preview of your sharpening -a live preview, here at the top of the digital panel."
"And if you don't see it, you can click this black triangle to open the Preview area."
I can set this
Preview to any part of the photo by clicking on the target and then clicking on the area of the photo that I wanna see in this preview.
And I can even come in and Click and Drag to move that around.
"By default, this small preview is set to one-"
-to-one view.
And that's really important because you cannot accurately preview sharpening unless you're viewing the photo at one-to-one.
And that's also true in the other preview that you have which is out in the Image Window.
Your Image Window has to be set to one-to-one view as well in order for you to judge your sharpening here.
"So, I'm gonna go up to the Navigator panel and I'll click the One-to-One button there."
And then I'll use this small square in the Navigator panel to drag the image in the image window to the part of the photo that I wanna see as I'm sharpening.
"Now, let's talk about what sharpening does."
Sharpening looks for edges in a photo.
"The edges between dark and light tones, like this edge here at the corner of the building."
"And then when you sharpen, that adds light pixels on one side of the edge and dark pixels on the other, those are called Sharpening Halos."
These halos increased contrast at the edges and that creates the illusion of sharpness.
"To see that better, I'm gonna go over to the sharpening settings and I'm gonna drag the amount slider way over to the right."
"And, then I'm also going to zoom in, I normally wouldn't do this when I'm sharpening but I want you to see that along that edge, there are some white pixels and along the other side of the edge, some dark pixels."
And those are the halos I just mentioned that create the illusion of sharpness.
"This amount slider determines the strength of sharpening, how brighter, how dark the sharpening halos are."
"The next slider, the Radius slider determines the thickness or spread of the sharpening halos."
"How far out from an edge a sharpening effect extends so you can see that if I drag the Radius slider to the right keeping your eye on these halos, they're going to move out from that edge as I increase radius."
"And if I decrease radius, those halos go back in toward the edge."
"Now if the Radius slider is up too high, you're gonna see a kind of a ghostly glow on the edge of the building when I go back in to a one-to-one view."
I'm gonna do that now.
Coming up to the Navigator panel and clicking One-to-One.
So you can see I've still got that glow along the edge of the building and that means that my Radius slider is up too high.
"So, I'm gonna drag it down."

Research is an essential part of education.
Students are expected to cite articles from scholarly journals when they write research papers.
You probably use journal articles in your own work.
You've probably also encountered journal articles that you wanted to read but couldn't get access to.
Why is that?
"Well, let's take a look at how scholarly journals are published today."
Professor A does some research and writes an article about it for free.
He wants to publish it so he submits it to a journal in his field.
The journal likes his article so asks Professor B and C to peer review it.
"The professors read it, evaluate it and send it back for free."
"The journal sends Professor A the changes that need to be made, if any, and Professor A sends them the final version of his article at no cost to the journal."
The publisher then puts Professor A's article with a bunch of other articles and formats them all together and charges people for access.
How much does it cost to a campus library to buy a subscription to the journal?
It depends...
"If it is a journal of Econometrics, a year subscription costs as much as two thousand one hundred and fifty-five dollars if it is the journal of Geophysical Research, it costs five thousand seven hundred and sixty dollars. if it is the journal of Brain Research, it's twenty-one thousand seven hundred forty-four dollars. not all scholarly journals cost this much but when many of the key resources for students and faculty cost an arm and a leg, not even the best funded universities and libraries can afford them all."
So librarians buy what they can afford and students and the professors just have to hope they're not missing something important.
But it doesn't have to be this way
There is an alternative to the closed subscription-based scholarly publishing model:
Open Access
"Open Access is free, unrestricted online access to scholarly works."
"Open Access journals use advertising sponsorship, author fees and other sources of revenue to support the cost of publication, keeping the access free to the user."
Authors can choose to publish their articles in one over forty-two hundred peer-reviewed Open Access Journals or they can put a copy of work published elsewhere in an online repository.
Open Access lets anyone read the latest research.
"It helps scholars stay up-to-date on each other's work... it enables computers to sift text mining and mashups, which help uncover trends that no-one would have suspected it gives authors more visibility and impact... and makes scholar work a lot easier."
Open Access brings curious minds and the world's knowledge together.
Isn't that what academia is fundamentally about?
"Free, unrestricted, online access"
Open Access
"There, was another point that I wanted to make that now, Nih has a policy that if your paper is supported by them as part of a grant or contract The finished man even if the journal wants to charge money for downloading the paper, wha."
"After a year, NlH will put it on PubMed as a finished manuscript which may not have had the kind of copy editing that will finally."
Hm.
Appear in the journal.
But it'll at least be your final version of the manuscript.
"And so you'll be able to, to read papers that have been out for a year, even if, for no cost, even if the journal is the kind that wants to charge money for it."
"That is great, yeah."
"And if you could change one thing about the publication process, what would you change?"
"Well I had, when you asked me that question before, I got two things."
"First of all, I think there should be greater evaluation of negative findings, by both researchers and by The journals."
"You know a, you're gonn, when you do studies, you're gonna have this great idea that you think something is a cause or prevention of, of some disease."
And you're gonna do a study and it's not gonna pan out.
"That is the, that is the most common experience that we epidemiologists have."
"In fact and a graduate student here, who is doing a study of Metformin and in relation to risk of breast cancer because."
"It was some thought that this might be preventive, Agent for, you know for reducing the risk of certain kinds of breast cancer."
"And This is being done at, at Kaiser Permanete in our division of research."
"But It's looking like, and, and this is not final result."
But it's looking like that's probably not gonna turn up.
"What was hoped for or what was expected and naturally, the researcher is very disappointed in that, but you know, I say, you know, this is important to know too, that there's a negative finding."
So don't be Discouraged if you have a negative finding.
"It's important that, that get published and it's imp-, and, I wish journals would be more interested in, in publishing these, and, sometimes it, it, you know, a negative finding, if you want to get it out there, could be written in the form of a brief report which will take less journal space, it'll get higher priority so, I think that's, that is my main..."
Answer to your question.
"I, I also wish that there was greater ease in getting peer reviewers to review a paper."
Sometimes we have a list at the American Journal of Epidemiology and I sent a particular paper out to people who said this was their specialty or special interest and out of ten people who we sent it to only one agreed to review.
Oh wow.
"And we tried to get two and I was asked, you know, can you make a decision on just the one review because we can't just keep."
"Trying to get, with your."
"So, as, as a scientist and an author."
"Please accept the responsibility of being a reviewer, as well as a As an author, we've had some cases where."
"You know we've published papers by a certain author, and this author consistently refused to review papers."
And naturally they're not well regarded by the.
Mm.
"People get off of gluten and they say, you know, remarkably, I feel better."
There's nothing wrong with following a gluten-free diet if you don't have Celiac disease.
"If you suspect you have Celiac disease, it's a good idea to get tested and have a confirmation of your diagnosis."
Many people find that they lose weight when they go on a gluten-free diet.
"If you've been consuming hundreds of extra calories from breads and pastas and rices, it makes sense that when you cut those foods out of your diet, you're going to"
lose weight.
"If you're interested in learning more about Celiac disease, I recommend you check out some of these resources."
"The Gluten-fFree Diet book, by Shelley Case, is a great resource."
"Shelley is a Canadian dietitian, who, herself, has Celiac disease."
"A number of the different foundations, like the Celiac Sprue Association, and the"
"Celiac Disease Foundation, can also provide you with valuable information. ."

"&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On August 1, 2007, the eye 35 bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 45."
Newspaper articles followed asking questions why did the bridge collapse.
And the experts pointed to structural deficiencies such as corroded bearings or faulty-- fatigue cracks in the steel around the bridges joints.
"But for the victims and their families, the important question was not why did the bridge collapse, but why did the bridge collapsed at the exact moment when I was on it."
"Ann was on the bridge because she was on a cell phone with her friend, so she missed her exit."
Otherwise she wouldn't have been on the bridge when it collapsed.
"On the other hand, Jim was not on the bridge because he happened to meet a friend and stopped to chat, or he would have been on the bridge."
The questions the bridge victims asked are just like the questions of the Zande in the Central African Republic.
"Just the same questions when misfortune strikes them, they're not interested in why did the bridge collapse, but rather why did the bridge collapsed at the precise moment when I was on it."
But the Zande have a different kind of answer.
"It's not God, it's not karma, not coincidence, not God's will, but witchcraft."
The main point I was making today is that witchcraft gets a bad rap.
"It's seen as backwards, superstitious, barbaric, and pictures like this one, of a Zande witchcraft-- witch doctor, which I took, don't help."
But witchcraft among the Zande is not an irrational belief system from the heart of darkness.
"It does nothing more or nothing less than other belief systems do, including world religions."
"They all explain why things happen, especially bad things."
"They do so in a way that allows intervention, especially medical intervention, and it allows to blame someone else or something else for our misfortune."
I'll be making a plea today for cultural relativism.
"Deep down, one person's witchcraft is another person's Christianity."
"The Zande live where the three countries of South Sudan, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo meet."
"Ed Miliband, the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener."
Which he did -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.
"There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities,"
Leicestershire and Somerset.
"And in Stroud, the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan."
"And the head of the council said,"
"""If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time."""
"As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging."
"In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this."
And we see it all over the place as well now.
"But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now, but that things are already inevitably changing, and what we need to do is to work creatively with that, based on asking the right questions."
I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories.
Because I think stories are vital here.
"And actually the stories that we tell ourselves, we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here."
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
"Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company."
"And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden."
"Because the last time that was done, when Eleanor Roosevelt did it, it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States."
"So the question I'd like to leave you with, really, is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive, how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions, while also building resilience?"
"Personally, I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil."
"I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky."
"But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point."
"Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable."
"And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us, and that the Oil Age has done for us, we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient, more nourishing, and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled and more connected to each other."
Thank you very much.

Good afternoon.
"First of all, I'm not that great."
I'm just a chemist.
"I'm the person who knows about materials, but I don't know so much."
And I am pretty mediocre.
"For example, I don't do any sports, or I cannot dance,"
"Hence, these animals were in Central Italy before Roman times."
"However, agriculture also arrived to Italy way before Romans."
"In fact, the Neolithization of Italy occurred about 6000 years BC."
How to narrow down the arrival period of these cattle?
"Mitochondrial DNA, our time machine, helps also in this case."
"By reconstructing genealogies and knowing DNA mutation rate, it became possible to date the ancestors shared by modern Central Italian and South West Asian cattle."
These ancestors lived in South West Asia and a branch of their progeny moved to Tuscany.
"The molecular clock dated their arrival around 2,000 BC."
"So we have some evidence on a possible relationship with the Etruscans: geography, date, the sea route..."
"They arose in Central Italy in the first millennium BC, exactly in that area."
"Look, we found a real proof of this..."
"I'm kidding, no scientific journal would take it as an evidence, however we found an Etruscan fibula representing a Maremmana-like bull, a male one."
"You see female horns are lyre-shaped, while male ones are crescent-shaped."
The origin of Etruscan civilization is still debated.
"The Italian school supports the local origin of Etruscans even if a clear influence from Eastern culture is acknowledged, so that their period of highest development is referred to as the Oriental Period- but they think they're local."
European Experts are divided between local origin with Eastern influence and purely Eastern origin.
"Archaeologists have different opinions, as linguists do."
"We only understand a few words of their language, and we know the Etruscan alphabet."
"But no analogous to the Rosetta Stone, that could allow us to understand Egyptian hieroglyphic, was ever found."
"Interestingly, some Etruscan words seem to have more sense when interpreted according to the Semitic rather than Indo-European languages."
"Herodotus, in his ""Stories"" reports that Etruscans were Lydians, once settled on the coast of modern Turkey, that sailed to Tuscany and funded the Etruscan civilization."
Human genetics for a long time have produced inconclusive results.
Etruscan bones have been analysed.
The results indicate modern Tuscans as the closest population to Etruscans and Anatolians just a little further.
"Since Etruscans were critical in interpreting our results, we seek advice from re-known human geneticists."
And since we were no longer talking about
"Etruscan cattle, but people, we went to Cavalli Sforza and his colleagues."
Antonio Torroni at that time was working on human DNA from people
living in small villages of Etruscan heritage.
This because people in large cities are probably mixed and have excessively diluted
DNA signatures of ancient origin.
The end of the story is that we joined bovine and human evidence.
"So, let me encode an ordering by a labeling of the vertices with the numbers one through N."
This is just to encode the position of each vertex in this ordering.
So formally there's gonna be a function which takes vertices of G and maps things to integers between one and N. Each of the numbers one through N should be taken on by exactly one vertex.
Here N is the number of vertices of G. So that's just the way to encode an ordering and then here's really the important property that every directed edge of G goes forward in the ordering.
"That is, if UV is a directed edge of the directed graph G, then it should be that."
The F value of the tail is less than the F value of the head.
"That is, this directed edge has a higher F value as you, as you traverse it in the correct direction."
Let me give you an example just to make this more clear.
So suppose we have this very simple directed graph with four vertices.
"Let me show you two different, totally legitimate topological orderings of this graph."
"So the first thing you could do is you could label S1,"
"V2, W3 and T4."
This corresponds to mapping these four vertices.
"Another option would be to label them the same way except you can swap the labels of, V and W. So if you want you can label V three and W two."
So again what these labeling meant to encode is an ordering of the vertices.
"So the blue labeling you can think of as encoding the ordering in which we put S first, then V, then W and then T. Whereas the green"
"labeling can be thought of as the same ordering of the nodes, except with W coming before V. What's important is that the pattern of the edge is exactly the same in both cases, and in particular, all of the edges go forward in this ordering."
"So, in either case, we have S with edges from S to V and S to W. So that looks the same way pictorially."
Whichever order V and W are in.
"And then symmetrically, there are edges from V and W to T. So you'll notice that no matter which order we put V and W in, all four of these edges go forward in each of these orderings."
"Now, if you're trying to put."
"V before S, it wouldn't work because the edge from S to V would be going backward, if V preceded S. Similarly, if you put T anywhere other than the final position, you would not have a topological ordering."
"So in fact, these are the only two topological orderings of this directed graph."
I encourage you to convince yourself of that.
Now who cares about topological orderings?
"Well this is actually a, a very useful subroutine this has been, come up in all kinds of applications."
"Really whenever you want a sequence, a bunch of tasks, when there's precedents constraints amongst them."
By precedents constraints I mean one task has to finished before another.
"You can think, for example, about the courses in some kind of undergraduate major, like computer science major."
"Here the vertices are going to correspond to all of the courses and there's a directed edge from course A to course B, if course A's a prerequisite for course B, if you have to take it first."
"So then, of course, you'd"
like to know a sequence in which you can take these courses so that you always take a course after you've taken its prerequisites.
It's bringing it down into the soil.
It gets processed and de-nitrified and goes back up as
N_2.
There's some industrial fixation; the Bosch-Haber process is doing that.
"This runs off, gets into the ocean and fertilizes the ocean."
"If we look at the impact of nitrate and sulfate on human problems and on terrestrial ecosystems, one of the big ones is acid precipitation."
"So this stuff right here, all of human industry and cars and so forth, which in the United States has been concentrated in an area mostly roughly between Chicago and Pennsylvania, right here, this area, because of the-- remember our Hadley cells and the jet stream and the reason that the air is flowing from west to east across the continent-- all of that emission is getting picked up and it's getting dropped on lakes in Canada and the Northeastern United States."
"So in 1955 the pH in this region of the country, in freshwater bodies, had dropped to 4.6; that's starting to get pretty acid."
And by the way it was a much bigger problem for a lake that was sitting on granite than for a lake that was sitting on
limestone.
Why would it be more of a problem on granite than on
limestone?
Student:
Limestone's basic.
Prof:
Limestone's basic.
It's also a buffer.
So limestone will basically put a lot of carbonate into the water and buffer this.
"So this was a big problem, and in fact some lakes were"
losing all of their fish populations.
"However, there were improvements in air quality control around the country, and this has spread, but in many places it's also been ameliorated."
"I'd say it still remains a serious problem, and it's a situation that also causes international tensions, because basically Eastern Canada is getting hammered by"
"U.S. industrial and car emissions, because the flow of materials around the planet does not respect the arbitrary national boundaries that humans have created."
It's even worse in Europe.
"In Europe the industrial production of Germany, which creates a huge load of acid in the atmosphere, gets dumped on Scandinavia, which is old Scandinavian basalt shield; so they don't really have any"
limestone buffer up there in Scandinavia.
And that's one of the issues that gets talked a lot about in the European Union is how to equalize these kinds of costs.
"Because basically Canada is being treated as an externality by the United States, and Scandinavia is being treated as an externality by Germany."
So that sort of thing needs conflict resolution.
"Okay, water."
"The hydrological cycle is critical because you can't grow plants without water, and you can't grow humans without water either."
"And as the human population has gone up over five, and now through six billion, fresh water on the planet is becoming very, very scarce."
And we raise the a little more.
And so I will show you now s- some of the results for maxima.
So I only go now for constructive interference.
And I have done this for three different distances.
"Those of you who are 5 meters away from me, 10 meters away from me, and 15 meters away from me."
"And what you see on the left side is going to be X, that is the linear separation, and these, so these were in meters, forgive me but I will do these in centimeters."
"And this is X1, if you are 5 meters away from me, you will have -- I will put X1 a"
"little lower than I have it now, you will see shortly why I put it a little lower -- X1, this is about 38 centimeters."
So the linear separation from one to the next is 38 centimeters.
"And you're 10 meters away, it's double that, that's no surprise, 76 centimeters."
And if you're 15 meters away it is 113 centimeters.
"And then X2, which is the position where you have another maximum, would be at 76 centimeters and it would be at 152 centimeters, and it would be at 228 centimeters if you're 15 meters away from me."
"So the minima will fall almost exactly in between, and so the minima where, in an ideal case there is no sound at all, sound plus sound gives silence, think about it, sound plus sound will give silence, will be when you are roughly at 19 centimeters, half of this, this will be 38 centimeters."
"Half of this, and here will be something like 57 centimeters."
"And you can calculate what these values are, they are exactly in between."
"And so the conclusion is that if you're 5 meters away from me and you're near the center line, but you can also be a little bit in this direction, that the separation between bright sound,"
"loud sound, which is always at zero of course in the middle, to silence is 19 centimeters."
And then you move another 19 centimeters and then you hear loud sound.
"If you are however 10 meters away from me, just past the cameras, then you have to move 38 centimeters to go from loud sound to silence."
"And if you're all the way in the audience, in the back of the audience, it's more like 60 centimeters."
And this is what we're going to do now together.
I want you all to stand up and I'm going to make you listen to 3000 hertz.
And what I want you to do when
"I turn on the two loudspeakers, I want you to move your head very slowly and try to find locations where you hear silence."
"The position of silence is extremely well-defined, so don't go too fast, you miss it, also keep in mind that there are reflections of the sound from the walls, and from the blackboard, and so the pattern that I have calculated here is not perfect."
But you will see that there will be locations where sound plus sound will give you silence.
[tone]
[tone]
You are a couple of lousy scientists.
[tone]
You are a couple of lousy scientists.
"If the separation between a lot of sound and silence is 19 centimeters, that's about the separation of your ears, you dummies, so one ear could be at a maximum, the other ear could be at a minimum, so at least close one ear."
"I also forgot to mention that it's, I use photography stands that usually hold lights."
"They are about $15 bucks on Amazon.com, but you can go as simple as getting a bucket and putting a stick inside of it and put in cement, or sand, or something like that, get dowel rods."
"So, the camera itself,"
I use a Canon T4i [corrected from video]
"It's a great camera, high quality, that's the one I've been using probably for the past two months."
"I also before that had a lower expensive, the Canon I am using now is about $800."
"The next I had was a traditional video camera, consumer grade video camera."
"That ran about $400, and it was a Canon, I think it's the"
HF 200.
"If that's not it, I'll put it in the space below."
"I would also suggest that if you can't get those, get a cameral like the Kodak, I think it's called the 8zi, or the z8i, I think it is."
That camera has an external microphone jack.
You have to get a camera with an external microphone jack.
"If you don't, it's going to, it's going to sound like you are in a cave, so you get the crisp quality because this camera has a microphone jack, so if you need a low cost camera, it's the Kodak, again z8i, I believe it is, has an external microphone jack."
"Now, on the settings you may say, ""Well, ok, what about these things?"" You see I purposely am leaving this ugly stuff on the side here."
"Basically, when you go into you whatever video editing software you have, you just, that's it."
"You just crop out the sides, you put a white background, and voila, you have a perfectly professional infinite, white background, so thanks again everybody If you're not, if you didn't download my free e-book, go to the side, it's on How To"
"Create a Video That Persuades Customers To Take Action, to buy a product, click a button, whatever it might be, so go to the side, put in your information, and I will send you that e-book."
"Thanks for watching, browse around the site, and remember everyone can make! amazing videos."
Beginning to see
Stopping for a second
"What if it's true, as Kevin Phillips recently stated in an article in Harpers"", that ""Ever since the 1960s, Washington has gulled its citizens and creditors by debasing official statistics, the vital instruments with which the vigor and muscle of the American economy are measured?"""
"What if it turned out that our individual, corporate, and government decision-making was based on deeply misleading, if not provably false, data?"
"That's what we're going to take a look at here, by examining the ways that inflation and"
"Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, are measured."
"As you now know, inflation is a matter of active policy."
Too little and our current banking system risks failure.
"Too much and the majority of people noticeably lose their savings, which makes them politically restive."
"So keeping inflation at a ""goldilocks"" temperature"
- not too hot and not too cold - is the name of the game.
Inflation has two components.
The first is the simple pressure on prices due to too much money floating around.
You may recognize him.
"This is Brian May from the rock band Queen, who's actually a PhD astronomer, it should be said."
"And Brian, not right now, not in this image, but Brian is  an avid Galaxy Zoo classifier."
He inspired many other people to come to Galaxy Zoo and join in.
He inspired in particular this woman.
"This is Hanny van Arkel, who's a teacher in the Netherlands."
"As you can see, she's got a guitar that's just like Brian's."
"Anything that he did, she was going to do."
"And so she took up Galaxy Zoo too, and she became the first person in history to pay attention to this object."
And this illustrates the ability of humans to get distracted from what they are supposed to be doing.
What we wanted Hanny to do was classify the galaxy.
It's a Warped Spiral.
A rather beautiful one.
"But of course like you, she wanted to know what the blob underneath was and she called it a ""Voorwerp"", which I believe is Dutch for ""thingy"", a term which I'm proud to say we've worked into the scientific literature."
Because this object is literally one in a million.
We didn't know it was there.
"It's a gas cloud, a galaxy sized gas cloud, hanging in space, energized by a jet, driven by a black hole in that neighboring galaxy, which has recently shifted from being an active black hole to a quiet one."
"It's a process that we knew happened, but never before have we managed to catch a galaxy in the act, catch it in the act of this transformation."
"But because we had so many eyes and we could pay individual attention to each image, we were able to catch this and follow it up."
"We also discovered that, as astronomers, we're not the only people  struggling with this data flood, with having more information than we knew what to do with."
"This is a problem that confronts scientists in field, after field, after field."
"And so after the last few years, we've helped researchers not just look at galaxies, but provide the most accurate forecasts of whether solar flares are going to hit the Earth with a project called ""Solar Stormwatch""."
"We've transcribed more than a million log book pages from World War I Royal Navy logs to help climate scientists understand  the weather of the past, and thus predict the weather of the future."
"We have a side project, trying to find out whether wales have accents."
"And we're also helping cancer scientists in the UK do that pathology by classifying images, like the one on the screen."
Each of these projects makes use of the time and the pattern recognition abilities of hundreds of thousands of people.
It uses them collectively to accelerate science.
"We've collected all of these projects together in what we call the ""Zooniverse"", a platform for this kind of citizen science a place where people can sit in front of their web browsers and, within a few minutes, see something  that no one has ever seen before, and, more importantly, make an authentic contribution to science."
"This is science education, but it's also the cutting edge."
People actually get to help us.
Even that's not the exciting part.
"Magical things happen once you convince people that they too can take part in science, once you convince them that they have  the ability to contribute."
"Instead, she was sent to Harvard to work for Lieutenant"
"Commander Howard Aiken on the IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, the Mark 1."
"The first thing she did there was essentially take the machine apart and figure out how it worked, because there was no documentation on what you needed to know in order to program the thing, so she had to figure it out."
"She figured it out really well and then taught other people how to program the machine, and spent the duration generating numbers for solving hard problems, and ship design, and weapons design, all driven by the need to get the country quickly to the end of hostility so we could bring everybody home."
"When the war was finished she ended up going to a computer manufacturing company, one of the world's first computer manufacturing companies, to work on the UNlVAC."
She quickly figured out something that everybody else had missed.
"The thinking was, these machines were ridiculously expensive and human life is very cheap, so it shouldn't be at all difficult to find enough people to write the programs for these machines."
"She realized there were not enough people who are defective in the way that all of us are, that could make a business out of selling"
UNlVACs.
They just weren't going to be able to make enough software at the rate they were making software at that time.
"So she thought, we need to figure out a way to get smarter about developing software."
She wrote a program which she called A-0.
"Just as an indication of how far ahead she was as a programmer, she didn't called it A-1."
"OK, that's an important clue."
[laughter]
A-0 was the first compiler.
The reason we call compilers compilers is because of Grace; she did this first.
"What she did was she thought, subroutines are going to be the unit of code we use, so we need to figure out a way to make it easier to use subroutines."
"She put a big collection of subroutines onto a tape and gave each of the subroutines a number, similar to a library book call number."
"It looked a lot like the library call system; all the trig functions started with T, for example."
"Your program would be a list of subroutines, and A-0 would scan through that tape and compile a program based on all of those things, compiling in the same sense as compiling a bibliography, which is why we call it that."
"Ever wonder why we call a function, or call a subroutine?"
"Why is that called, because it's nothing like a phone call?"
"It came from this, the library metaphor, because she was an academic."
"She had two kinds of subroutines: open subroutines, which just get inserted into the program in place."
"Today we'd call that an include, or an inline."
"And she had closed subroutines, which today we call functions."
"There'll only be one occurrence of those, and some extra overhead in getting to it and back again."
"In modern terms, A-0 doesn't look much like a compiler."
It looks more like a linker.
"But this was the first, and everything else grew from that."
"When she finished A-0 she gave it to her team and they built A-1, and tested that, and learned more, and then built A-2."
"Because healthcare costs are rising extremely rapidly, the impact of including a much smaller healthcare weighting is a reduction in reported inflation."
"By simply reinstating the actual level of healthcare spending, our reported CPI would be several percent higher."
But the most outlandish adjustment of them all goes by the name
"""hedonics,"" the Greek root of which means ""for the pleasure of."""
"This adjustment is supposed to adjust for quality improvements, especially those that lead to greater enjoyment or utility of the product, but it has been badly overused."
Here's an example.
"Tim LaFleur is a commodity specialist for televisions at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, where the CPI is calculated."
I'm guessing he works in a place that looks like this.
"In 2004, he noted that a 27-inch television selling for $329.99 was selling for the same price as last year, but was now equipped with a better screen."
Hmm.
"After taking this subjective improvement into account, he adjusted the price of the TV downwards by $135, concluding that the screen improvement was the same as if the price of the TV had fallen by 29%."
"The price reflected in the CPI was not the actual retail store cost of $329.99, which is what it would cost you to buy, but $195."
Bingo!
"At the BLS,"
TVs now cost less and inflation is heading down.
"At the store, they're still selling for $329.99."
Hedonics are a one-way trip.
"If I get a new phone this year and it has some new buttons, the BLS will say the price has dropped."
"But if it only lasts eight months instead of 30 years, like my old phone, no adjustment will be made for that loss."
"In short, hedonics rests on the improbable assumption that new features are always beneficial and are synonymous with falling prices."
"Over the years, the BLS has expanded the use of hedonic adjustments and now applies these adjustments to everything from TVs, automobiles, washers, dryers, refrigerators, and even to college textbooks."
Hedonics are now used to adjust as much as 46% of the total CPl.
So what would happen if you were to strip out all the fuzzy statistical manipulations and calculate inflation like we used to do it?
"Luckily, John Williams of shadowstats.com has done exactly that, painstakingly following each statistical modification over time and reversing their effects."
"If inflation were calculated today, the exact same way it was in the early 1980""s,"
Mr. Williams finds that it would be running at closer to 13% than the currently reported 5%.
"This is a stunning 8% difference, which explains much that we see around us."
It explains why people have had to borrow more and have been able to save a lot less - because their real income was actually a lot lower than reported.
A higher rate of inflation is consistent with weak labor markets and growing levels of debt.
It fits the monetary growth data better.
So many things that were difficult to explain under a low-inflation reading suddenly make sense.
The social cost to this self-deception is enormous.
I think it would in fact be right to ask people within military or in government institutions for particular documents.
"I mean, I don't see any particular problem with that."
"In terms of knowing where things come from and how they're obtained, we're specialized in not knowing."
It's very difficult to deal with major state intelligence agencies.
"And over time, it is in fact, it would be impossible for us to keep secret information, over say the course of ten years, from the Chinese Public Security Bureau, the SVR in Russia, and from the National Security Agency."
It would just not be possible.
So we don't try to do that.
What we try to do is never collect information about sources in the first place.
"So, because we don't know who they are, we don't know how they get the material."
"And we don't ask them to go in and break in so in terms of US jurisprudence, there's not an issue for us."
"In terms of Swedish jurisprudence, that would also be the case because that has a higher standard."
David please.
"David Isaksson, editor at Global Reporting."
I guess there's some parallel between what you're doing to the reporting by Seymour Hersh in the 70s film from the Viet Nam War. actually on the My Lai Massacre.
"His reporting was not done in the field, he did interviews with people, I mean, the technology was different."
And you showed us the embedded reporter who was more concerned with taking a shower than what was actually the reality in the country.
"My question to you is do you see from your reporting and the effect it has had and how it's been so well spread that other media might reconsider how they report from war, that they will put more focus on investigative reporting and less on sending reporters out as embedded reporters?"
"Second question, the news you've spread all over the world and the media is picking up, do you see any increase in your income?"
You need income to continue with your investigative reporting?
Do people also take part in financing your work?
I'll answer the last question first because it's a very important one.
The funding for our organization has come from the people involved directly.
"Up until January this year, it came from me and others who are directly involved, totally committed into spending both their time and money."
"But as we grew, and as the demands grew, for example the bandwidth for the"
"Collateral Murder video was worth $600,000."
"Fortunately, we were able to gain subsidies for that from Google."
"But, it can be expensive to run such a large, such a popular operation."
But since January we have called upon the general public to assist us.
"And we have raised some million dollars, which is not a lot when considering the demands that we have, but it is completely independent."
"It is not from a foundation, it is from people like the people in this room, it is from moms and dads from all over the world."
And that is giving us an unparalleled degree of independence in what we can publish.
"We have tried to get foundation funding during that period, and in fact we were rated first out of 3,000 applications to the Knight Foundation, which hands out about a hundred and something million dollars per year in the United States."
"For example, the browser today is a nice event driven system which is good, but we've got this terrible problem that we call the cross site scripting problem — which is terribly named, because the name suggests that there's something wrong with cross site scripting, and there's not."
Cross site scripting is extremely desirable and valuable.
"It's how we do mashups, and mashups are good and we want to be doing more of that."
"The problem is that the browser's security model didn't anticipate that we were going to do that, and that's bad and needs to be corrected."
"If you look at what causes this problem, there are two basic causes."
It's pretty simple.
The first is the sharing of the global object.
"Any script that can get onto the page anyhow gets access to everything that that page knows, so they all get into everything."
"Now, we're improving that in ECMAScript 5."
ECMAScript 5 has a strict mode which will allow us to put third party code on a page and be confident that that third party code cannot do all the bad things that happen in cross site scripting attacks.
"That's a wonderful thing, so hooray for ECMAScript 5."
I just can't wait until Microsoft and all the other guys get it out so that we can get on with the future.
"The other problem, though, is inherent in HTML, and that's just that HTML is way too complicated, particularly in that it has nesting of multiple languages, including CSS and URLs and JavaScript, which can all be nested inside of each other, that all have different encoding patterns and different escapement patterns."
It's extremely difficult to do static analysis on a piece of code and determine if it's going to be safe in any context in which it might be put onto the page.
Both of these things need to be corrected in HTML; we cannot fix them on the ECMAScript side.
"Tragically, HTML5 ignores and worsens the XSS problem."
It does nothing to make it better and does a few things which will make it significantly worse.
"The editor of the HTML5 recommendation has written that ""HTML does not ever have a markup injection vulnerability."" That working group simply doesn't understand the problem that you guys are living with every day, so they're not at all motivated to try to correct it."
"I think that's intolerable, but that's the situation."
"What you have in the browser is a loaded gun pointed at your head, and this pulls the trigger."
"We tend to use page templating languages -- PHP, ASP, JSP -- which made a lot of sense in 1995 when Rasmus did PHP."
"That was a really good idea then, but it's not so good now."
Templates are way too rigid a framework for the kinds of really dynamic pages that we're trying to build.
"But worse than that: it's way too easy to insert text into a context that gets delivered as part of the HTML load which can be misinterpreted and executed, completing an XSS attack."
So could we do better if we had JavaScript on the server?
There are some obvious advantages.
One is that all of the expertise that you've gained in doing JavaScript can be applied immediately to the server.
That's got some huge benefits.
It turns out this is not a new idea.
The first server side JavaScript implementation was from Netscape in 1996.
Unfortunately they modelled it after PHP.
Syntactically it was a little different.
"We can suggest what you put--what you should do next, what you care about, all the things in front of you."
"Imagine the world's calendar knowing everything, all the events, and we know where you are, we know what things that you like and all of a sudden, we can suggest, ""Well, there's an amazing play over here or there's a great concert around the corner that you didn't know about it, that your friends care a lot about."
And what I'd like the most about this vision is it's a future for everyone.
It's not a future just for the elites.
"Historically, information services and information and power have been for the rich people, the knowledge workers and so forth."
"This is technology which is accessible to every single person on the planet, or at least all the people who can afford or are working very hard to get smartphones, too, which is today on the order of a billion people."
And in my view over the next five to ten years will approach three to four billion people with powerful networks that will back them up.
That is a humongous change.
It is a tremendous change in accessed information for people who have struggled to get through the day and worrying about all the things that we all care about.
"So for me, this is a future that is committed to doing good."
It's a future that we care a lot about at

"It's a future that's gives people time to do what they really care about, thought, ideas, intuitions, solutions and doing what they love, which I think is mostly about people and about society and about the fun that they all have."
It's interesting that this is a future that is a stuff with poetry.
"It's a quote that I like, ""Google is made of us, a sort of coral reef of human minds and their products,"" from William Gibson last week."
I tell you now that the future--this future that I've talked about that you've seen is really available to all of us right now.
I'm proud to be part of it and thank you so much for coming and participating in this talk.
Thank you so much.
"I think we have--okay, we have some time for some questions."
"If you will give us comments or questions, we have some hands up here."
I think we have some microphones.
Do you want to just sort of do them. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FABlEN:
Fabien from AndroidPlT. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Yes, how are you? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FABlEN:"
I was wondering when I saw your
"Google TV presentation as well as your presentation for the Android phones, if Google becomes a content provider more than like right now, someone where everything gets into Google and someone else can retrieve it, this is more because I think, from my perspective, and my perspective, TV is a very passive medium where I sit in front of it and then I get information, but I don't want to probably check information out."
"I just want to be passive, in my personal opinion."
Is Google becoming a content provider? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
We've decided to stay right on--there's a line that we've decided not to cross.
"So we want to work with content providers and get them onto this new platform, whether it be Google Television or YouTube or the web."
"We're very unlikely to go into the actual content production, at least in a significant way because we want the content providers to be able to make money."
"I will tell you, by the way, as a passive television viewer, once you have Google Television, you're not going to be passive."
"But you get so busy sometimes, I made this suggestion to have one of these answering machine services - you know like you get in these government - like press 1 for something."
Because it has happened that sometimes people sometimes their dog has died or someone says can you do some chanting for me over the phone.
"Can you do some Buddhist prayers, they ask for."
"I've done that sometimes, in the middle of the night, to the opposite side of the world - their dog is sick so I've done the chanting over the phone.. sometimes I'm too compassionate."
[laughter].
"But.. so I've decided actually to actually, uh, so if you want..we can record these chants and have them on the recorder so if you want a prayer you can just press number 1."
[laughter].
"Why not, that's very easy."
And then if you want to speak to
Ajahn Brahm you haven't got a prayer so press number 1 anyway.
So that way I get rid of everybody and have a nice easy time.
"But you have to deal with people, and that's only a joke."
"You have to deal with..it's much nicer to be accessible to people, even though you're tired, I'd rather be accessible then be sort-of somehow separated from the people who support you, and feed you, and clothe you, and look after you and your friends."
So even though it's a lot of work I enjoy doing it.
"But when you're dealing with people's emotions, sometimes you have to let people understand, number one, that those emotions are real, they have a place in life, but also where they come from."
"Because it's great when you have an emotion in your heart, to find out why is that there, where did it originate from."
"Because it's great when you track it back, you can see how emotions arise, how they build up."
"I don't know how many of you have been to movies, but you can actually see that the trick of the movie is to start with the music."
You know the different musics that get your emotions going and just how even the lighting starts to change.
"If you want to get people afraid, you turn the lights down.. and the music is very very soft.. apumbabambumbum bumbumbum.."
"And it gets people, because actually your heart beats."
When you get excited you heart beat goes at that level.
"And if the music or whatever else. the beat gets that, it actually encourages your heart beat to sort-of get very very very strong."
And you can even use your speech to say that..something..is..coming.....and make people afraaaaaid..
"But you can see how emotions can be generated, just in movies especially by the music by the way that speech is actually said, and also by the lighting."
"One of the first times when I saw this, how people can play your emotions is actually when we started our nun's monastery down in Gingegannup because that was before Sister"
"Vayama was here, and we were looking for a nice piece of land, we found this nice piece of land over in Reen Road but it was on auction."
"And so I went there for the auction, with"
- I don't know if he's here this evening - Eddy Fernando was our bidder.
"But when the auctioneer started the auction he was very calm, saying about this beautiful block of land, wonderful place for retreat, lovely forests and the river and then he started mentioning the figures.."
"And he said, I think this is worth so much, I think we should start for at least a million dollars."
"And straight away I thought, ""oh no""."
"It's gotten $2,000 more expensive off of $20,000, so it's gotten 10% more expensive."
"You, as the economist, what you would say is, as the way you've defined it, your consumer price index, and this is abbreviated with CPl, consumer price index, your consumer price index is up by 10%."
"Or another way, based on the way you measured it, and it changes from country to country, and even within countries, they change the way that they do these basket of goods, but by the way you've measured it, you would say that price inflation, or, you would say that the price inflation has been 10% between year 1 and year 5, or in general everything got 10% more expensive, or you would need 10% more money to have the same standard of living."
"In general, when people are just referring to inflation, so if you just see the word ""inflation"" being referred to, especially in modern times, they are referring to price inflation."
"This general increase in the price of goods and services, measured by some type of basket of goods."
"There is another type of inflation, and that is monetary inflation."
Monetary inflation; and they are related.
Monetary inflation is inflation due purely to an increase of the money supply.
This is increase in money supply.
"In general, if this increase in the money supply does outstrip the productive capacity of the country, it could very well lead to price inflation, but in general what people measure, when they talk about inflation, from one year to the next, they're talking about this basket of goods."
They're talking about price inflation.
"The other thing that you'll sometimes see, maybe in year 5, someone says,"
"""Hey; I could sell you this house,"" so this is in year 5,"
"""I could sell you a house,"
"""and this house in year 5 is $660,000."""
"Is $660,000."
"Someone might ask, what would be that price if we adjusted it for inflation in year 1 dollars?"
"What they're saying is, if you adjust for how much value your money has lost, because if things are getting more expensive, that means each dollar is being worth less."
You can buy less with each dollar.
"When people say, ""How much is that,"
"""adjusted for inflation in year 1 money?"" you're essentially saying,"
"""What amount of money would that house"
"""have had to cost in year 1,"
"""that when you adjust it for inflation,"
"""when you increase it by 10%,"" so that's the same thing; increasing by 10% is the same thing as multiplying by 110%, or multiplying by 1.1, so, ""what amount of money would that house"
"""had to have cost in year 1,"
"""that if I multiply it by 1.1,"
"""I get $660,000?"""
"We could do a little bit of quick math here, to figure that out."
"If we say, let's say that, I don't know,"
let's call it P.
P is the price of the house in year 1.
"G, depth-first search is going to be invoked exactly once from each of the vertices."
"Either U or V could be first, both are possible."
"So, first, let's assume that U is visited by DFS before V. So then what happens?"
"Well, remember what depth-first search does when you invoke it from a node, it's going to find everything findable from that node."
"So, if U is visited before V, that means V doesn't get explored so it's a candidate for being discovered."
"Moreover, there's an arc straight from U to V. So, certainly, DFS invoked at U is going to discover V."
"Furthermore, the recursive call corresponding to the node V, is going to finish, is going to get popped off the program stack before that of U. The easiest way to see this is just to think about the recursive structure of depth-first search."
"So when you call depth-first search from U, that recursive call, that's gonna make further recursive calls to all of the relevant neighbors including V and U's call is not gonna get popped off the stack until V's does beforehand, that's because of the last in first out nature of a stack or of a recursive algorithm."
"So because the current label starts at N, and it gets decremented each time a recursive call ends."
"And because, the assignment, the F value that we assign to a node is exactly the current label at the time that its recursive calls finishes."
"Because V finishes first, it will get, finishing time or an F value that's later."
"So, because V's recursive call finishes before that of U, that means it will be assigned a larger label than U. Remember, the labels keep decreasing as more and more recursive calls get popped off the stack."
So that's exactly what we wanted.
"Now, what's up in the second case, case two?"
So this is where V is visited before U. And here's where we use the fact that the graph has no cycles.
So there's a direct arc from U to V. That means there cannot be any directed path from V all the way back to U. That would create a directed cycle.
"Therefore, DFS, invoked from V, is not going to discover U. There's no directed path from V to U, again, if there was, there would be a directed cycle, so it doesn't find U at all."
"So the recursive call of V, again, is going to get popped before U's is even pushed onto the stack."
"So we're totally done with V before we even start to consider U. So therefore for the same reasons, since V's recursive call finishes first, its label is going to be larger, which is exactly what we wanted to prove."
So that concludes the first quite interesting application of depth-first search.
"In the next video we'll look at an even more interesting one, which computes the strongly connected components of a directed graph."
"This time we can't do it in one depth for search, we'll need two."
"I'm going to do a couple more moment and force problems, especially because I think I might have bungled the terminology in the previous video because I kept confusing clockwise with counterclockwise."
This time I'll try to be more consistent.
Let me draw my lever again.
My seesaw.
"So that's my seesaw, and that is my axis of rotation, or my fulcrum, or my pivot point, whatever you want to call it."
And let me throw a bunch of forces on there.
"So let's say that I have a 10-Newton force and it is at a distance of 10, so distance is equal to 10."
The moment arm distance is 10.
Let's say that I have a 50-Newton force and its moment arm distance is equal to 8.
She's often shown reading an open book which would be that of the Bible which already existed.
"In other words, the Light of Heaven comes down."
That's the annunciation the Spirit is entering into Mary.
That light crosses a candle.
And that candle is the one by which Mary is reading.
"In order for the medieval painters to show how bright is that divine light, the candle is shown with a wisp of smoke."
"Because, in comparison to that light, mere earthly light is as if it were darkness."
Isaac Asimov wrote Asimov's Guide to the
Bible.
"It's not unreasonable for him to understand perfectly well that, that image of the wisp of smoke at the end of the evitable conflict is not in fact the extinction of knowledge, it is in fact the advent of a new millennium brought to us by the perfect robots."
The conflict is now evitable.
We read that last story quite differently if we understand it as a composite novel.
"From the 1950s on, people began to be able to write novels rather than short stories."
"You see, something important had happened."
"Right after the Civil War, the American News Company bought warehouses near the railheads surrounding major cities."
"If someone printed a periodical in any city, they could sell their print run to the American news company, which would take it and sub divide it and send the different sections to their own warehouse, those around the country, where the subsection of periodical A will be joined with the subsection of periodical B and so on, and then, in that region of the"
"American News Company would deliver all of the periodicals that it had contracted to, to distribute."
"So the American News Company, in fact, became the de facto distributor for virtually every national magazine in the"
United States.
And it had no competition.
"After a while, American cities grew."
"And what had been cheap warehouse property near the railhead, often became very valuable property next to the downtown railroads, next to the downtown railway station."
"And in the 1950s, a Wall Street group realized that the value of the property that the American News Company owned was greater than the profitability of the"
American News Company.
"So they bought it, and over a period of a few years, they dismantled it, they sold it for it's property."
No other national distributor ever came to replace it.
"In fact, we only have real national distribution again for a few journals that can afford to send their material through satellites and beamed them down to printing presses around the country."
"As for example, some newspapers now do."
"Before The American News Company disappeared, there were 38 science fiction monthlies published in the United States."
"By the time The American News Company had been entirely obliterated, there were four."
"Obviously we can't support many, many writers writing short stories who are going to turn out fix ups."
"On the other hand, in the early 1950's Ian and Betty Ballantine suddenly realized that instead of having soft Bantam books be a later publication of hardbound books that had already come out, it would be possible to have softbound books as original publications, and starting in the early 1950's Ballentine Press began to have paperback originals."

Last year president Barrack Obama established April as national sexual assault awareness month this weekend the 139th airlift wing raises that awareness by hosting a 5k walk-run at Rosecrans over 150 members either walked or ran in support of the event
"Major Barb Denny leads the sexual assault prevention and response program at the 139th and says this is the first time they've held a 5k we wanted to do something different this year than we've done in the past and we thought this was a good way to get people together work on our fitness and just have a lot of fun sexual assault is actually a societal problem, it's one that we really need to raise awareness for so we can make sure victims understand they can come forward the event also took donations that will go to the YWCA in St. Joseph it's a non-profit group that has programs aimed at assisting individuals who have been victims in domestic violence"
Master Sgt. Jackie Moser works at the YWCA in her civilian job and says the program is for both women and men
The YWCA has always been a huge resource for her program because they have several different different programs that can assist women and men that have been sexually assaulted
This weekends event raised over 600 dollars that will go to the YWCA to support that program
For the 139th Airlift Wing
I'm Staff Sgt. Michael Crane
"Today, we're going to talk about some things that are ingredients in success of a team or a group."
"And in the stead of the roles on this particular lecture, we are going to look at some others things that are outside the person or at least are different processors that a person may bring or ingredients they bring into the group that has nothing to do with the actual functions of that person or what they actually do."
"There's sort of external variables that affect the group, but yet they're important."
"And so the three things we'll look at here that are these variables that have a lot to do with group success, or can detract from it, are what we are going to call norms, status, and power."
"And I think you can already figure out that norms can be a good thing or a bad thing, and same with status and power."
When power is used properly and ideally it's a good thing.
It is used properly for positive force in a group.
"Now, let's start with norms."
What I'd like to do is define these three terms and give examples of them and actually do a little more detailed analysis of how they affect a group.
"And these are things you're going to want to pay attention to when you're in a group: what the norms of that group are, is status affecting a group, and how is power influencing the people in that group - is it a positive force or not."
Let's start with norms.
"And after about one or two minutes she stopped moving her arms up and down, she stopped shouting, and at that point Ajahn Jagaro put down his spoon, put aside his bowl, and said ""what happened?"""
I thought it was a beautiful piece of psychological calming a person's emotions down.
"Because he was not responding with anxiety to her great distress, he was just calming her down just by his actions and by his softness, she too calmed down in the space of one or two minutes."
It was the most brilliant counselling
I'd seen for years.
He was giving her a sense of perspective about what had happened.
"So by having someone who was calm, was not being agitated, she could calm down too and see the bigger picture."
"Which is what happens sometimes, when we see this is my boyfriend that's left me, this is my child that's died, this is my job which someone else has taken, these are my shares which have just all disappeared, it's my team the Dockers have lost - I'm being fair because I've mentioned the Eagles first now I'm mentioning the Dockers."
Sometimes that we when lose perspective we can actually get emotionally distraught and that was a very beautiful way that he dealt with that by calming her down to see a bigger picture.
"Not negating her feelings but acknowledging them, but calming them down."
"Because you see just how these emotions can get built up, what actually builds them up and how they're created."
I just was at a funeral service this afternoon - and I enjoy taking funerals because at a funeral service you do have a group of people who are emotionally raw.
They've just
"lost a close member of their family or their friend and it's, I've seen many many times just how grief can be created or how that feeling of grief can be calmed down to get a different emotion coming up."
"I can actually see that I remember even when my own father died that obviously I knew my mother so well but when my father died she knew he was going to die, you know he came very close many times, when he actually did die she was at ease, at peace with it."
"It was only when a cousin came in to the house and opened up her arms to my mother and said, ""oh you poor thing"", and of course that meant the floodgates of my mother's tears started coming."
And I knew that if that cousin hadn't said that stupid thing my mother would be much more at peace with the death of her husband and my father.
"It was as if that there was a social trigger there, that you've lost your husband that you must cry, and that was pressed by this cousin when, before that happened she did not need to go on that path of grief."
And I've seen so often that our social conditioning creates these emotions.
And one of the things which I love doing if you're teaching at a funeral is to actually give people other triggers.
"Trigger not to actually generate these emotions in the same old ways, but look at them in a different way."
To give different triggers to different emotions.
"And let's look at another sort-of emotion, the emotion of anger."
Where does that anger come from?
"You know the old story, that someone calls you a pig, I don't know if anyone's called you a pig today, but now I'm going to call you a pig."
And what happens when somebody calls you a pig?
"You think - ""they have no right to call me a pig!"
Who does he think he is to call me a pig!?
I am not a pig!
"He shouldn't call me a pig."" And every time you remember that I've called you a pig, you allow me to call you a pig one more time."
Every time you remember that I'm calling you a pig again.
Why do we do such things?
I'll call it P1.
"That x 1.1 ... x 1.1 is going to be equal to $660,000, when you factor in the 10% inflation over these years."
This is simple algebra right here.
You can divide both sides by 1.1.
"Divide both sides by 1.1, and we get, these cancel out, you get the price of that house in year 1; $66 divided by 11 would be 6."
"You could work it out with a calculator, if you don't feel comfortable with what I'm about to do, but this would give you $600,000, if you work this math right out here, and you could figure out the decimals."
What we could do ...
I think you get the general idea here.
You can use your calculator.
"I did this one in my head, but the general idea is, a house in year 1 that is $600,000, $600,000, if you factor in the devaluing of the currency, or how much more expensive everything got, in year 5 would cost $660,000."
"You might hear someone say, when they're talking about inflation, or they're talking about price increases,"
"""This house in year 5 is $660,000,"
"""which is equal to $600,000 in year 1 money."""
"As an example of that, I live in a neighborhood where the houses have gotten all of a sudden, because I live in the heart of Silicon Valley, it's not a fancy neighborhood by any stretch of the imagination, but the houses now are quite expensive, and we have neighbors who moved in in the '50s, and they say, ""My God; I bought our house"
"""for $10,000, and now people"
"""are selling these houses for so much more."""
"The reality is, is that it is true; the house has appreciated, but $10,000 in 1950 was actually a lot, a lot, of money."
Doctors and engineers did not make that much more than that much per year.
I don't know the exact amount.
"The reality is that you actually have to adjust money for the year that you're talking about, and you have to adjust it for inflation."
"If you believe this 10% inflation number, hopefully people's incomes also increased by the same amount, so the same person with the same skills and the same job, who could afford the house for $600,000 in year 1 could now pay $660,000 for it, and it won't take an unusually large chunk of their expenditure."
It would take the same chunk that it did in year 1.
"Hopefully that clarifies things a little bit, and I'll, in the future, do more videos, going into the details of inflation."
Only rarely is there an opportunity to participate in a molecular happening.
"You are going to have that opportunity for this film attempts to portray symbolically, yet in a dynamic and joyful way, one of nature's fundamental processes- the linking together of amino acids to form a protein."
We know now that the three dimensional structure and the function of a protein is determined by the order of amino acids along the backbone of the molecule.
So protein synthesis involves programming and assembly and this film with people portraying molecules using the dance idiom tries to animate these two processes— the programming and assembly of a protein.
"Our genes carry the instructions for ordering the amino acids of each protein, those instructions are encoded in a messenger molecule and RNA depicted in this film as a long snaking chain."
Each of the message units is played by three adjacent people in the chain.
"Colored head balloons indicate the bases— green for guanine, blue for uracil, yellow for adenine."
"If there is a message, there must be a way to translate that message."
That's the job of the ribosome and of the transfer RNAs.
We don't think that there are people or objects that actually do that.
"If there were, not only would it look  like things were moving backward in time but everything we know about causality, cause and effect, the past versus the future, this would all get jumbled together in a way that doesn't really  make sense to us."
So we should be thankful that Einstein says there is a speed limit on the universe.
"And the last question is,  is there a timeless zone in the universe?"
This is an intriguing question  because it's not absolutely clear what it would mean to have a timeless zone in the universe.
"It makes you think about what is time, what is the definition,  and what would it mean to not have it?"
So the simplest way to think about time  is that it's a label.
It's a label on the different moments  in the history of the universe.
Our universe is like a film  with different frames in the film strip or a book with different pages.
"There's stuff in the universe,  scattered throughout space."
And that stuff scattered throughout space happens over and over again with everything slightly in a different position than it was just the time before.
"And the time is just a label, it's just like the page number in the book, or the frame number in the film."
So a timeless zone in the universe would be a place where there were no different moments.
Where the universe didn't happen over and over again.
There was just one configuration of stuff forever.
"But if you think about it,  what if you sort of visited that timeless zone in the universe?"
We have some intuitive  science-fictiony picture that everything would slow down  and then stop or something like that.
"But the truth is, you could never get there, to the timeless zone, because as you approached,  if you try to reach your hand in, your hand would stop moving."
That's what it would mean to be timeless.
You could never see the timeless zone  in the universe because no light could ever come from it  because it takes time for light to travel.
"So our best guess right now is no,  there are no timeless zones in the universe."
"But we keep an open mind, that's what makes theoretical physics and cosmology so much fun."
"Thanks for all your great questions, if you have any more questions for the next expert, please leave them in the comments below."
one boy and the other is so different again
I look forward to all boys with everyone I try something else and I learn also from all
"I think it's great that everyone is different, and of course there are some guys that I really like"
"I enjoy working with Jack, with Luke and Roger which is a group that I would like to work together all the time and I would still like to do a group"
"I would go for Jack, Luke and Roger."
With those three would be great and what about adam adam is great too! but I would go for Jack
"Jack is a little bigger than Adam, and that makes him still the winner size is important to you? yes size is certainly important but not necessarily just look at Todd, he is not so big, but we really click and there is romance"
"Jack just has a huge dick, and Luke is aggressive during sex, and he has a lot of energy they all have some"
"I have lots of friends in Bel Ami, that's for sure there are even people that I really see as family when I needed it, they really helped me always the feeling is mutual, we really support each other there are a lot of people that I can trust, just like in a real family"
"In appointing the prosecutors, Holder rebuffed calls from lawmakers to appoint an independent special counsel outside of his office's control."
"At a White House news conference on Friday, President Obama rejected suggestions the leaks may have come from his administration to bolster his re-election bid."
The notion that my White House would purposely release classified national security information is offensive.
It's wrong and people I think need to have a better sense of how I approach this office and of how the people around me approach this office.
"Wildfires are continuing to spread through parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming as high temperatures fan the flames."
"The High Park Fire in Colorado has already scorched more than 20,000 acres of land amid high winds and temperatures above 90 degrees."
"More than 1,800 people have been evacuated across the four states."
New figures meanwhile show 2012 continues to be the warmest year on record in the United States.
"According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this spring has been the warmest of all time and last month was the second-warmest May since record-keeping began more than a century ago."
The average temperature for the 48 states not including Alaska and Hawaii from March through May was more than five degrees higher than the 20th century average.
New figures show this year's military suicide rate is on pace to reach a record high.
"The Pentagon says there have been at least 154 suicides among active-duty troops through last Thursday, a rate of nearly one each day."
The figure marks an 18 percent increase over the same period a year ago.
More U.S. soldiers have died by taking their own lives than been killed on the battlefield.
Spain has agreed to accept a European Union bailout offer of up to $125 billion dollars for its debt-ridden banks.
The move makes Spain the fourth and largest European country to accept emergency international aid as part of the continent-wide sovereign debt crisis.
"Details on the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, with no mention of new austerity measures that have sparked an uproar across Europe."
"After the bailout was announced, demonstrators with Spain's Indignado movement gathered in Madrid to protest."
We are saying that this is a scam precisely because the aid should not be for the banks.
It should be for the citizens who are the most affected by this crisis.
Not the bankers.
I don't think they are doing as bad as the citizens.
"The crisis has its origin in the markets not in the citizens."""
"In Iraq, at least six people have been killed and 38 wounded in a bombing of a crowded square in Baghdad."
The attack targeted a gathering of Shi'ite Muslim pilgrims.
"Hundreds of a people rallied in the Chilean capital of Santiago on Sunday to protest the screening of a new film honoring the late military dictator, Augusto Pinochet."
"The premiere of the film, titled ""Pinochet"", drew a number of former ministers and army generals who served under his regime."
"Protesters came under assault from supporters of the film, who threw rocks, eggs and red paint at the large crowd."
"Lorena Pizarro, head of a group representing victims of the regime, denounced the attacks on protesters."
"They are violators of human rights and today this is the only response that they have: to suppress us, to be violent towards us, to mistreat us and abandon [their country]."
"They, those genociders are inside the [theater]."""
"Three people were killed in Auburn, Alabama on Sunday after an argument at an apartment complex turned violent."
It's true that we all can make person choices and back away.
"It's true that we might reinvent the net to be a very different type of technology that encourages concentration, it's true that our employers might say 'no don't stay connected all the time go away and think for awhile', but I think you're right."
That all the trends in society point to a continued devaluing of that whole way of thinking that doesn't fit in to our kind of utilitarian kind of problem solving mode.

"I would like the chance Mr. Norvig a little bit, as much as I admire and respect your research work, I think you made a methodological mistake in you poll because you missed a sort of large part of the population."
"I think a different results would come out of this poll if you ask the chairs of University computer science departments, let's say California State of Dominguez Hills or"
Florida Gulf Coast University or University of Idaho.
"Next maybe I think Google wouldn't hire my students if I told them to get their knowledge from Wikipedia, although it is a very good tool."
"And finally, I think that you have to take a look at Universities which offer degrees online, so there's many more examples, so I would say the question 'Is Google making us stupid?' is a valid question because there is a large segment of the population which is just not getting anything out of this."
And I have a question for Mr. Carr.
You mentioned at the beginning about the probably your very first computation on a machine know to humankind although you didn't call it that way which is the clock.
"Some of these great philosophers like Louis Mouthford or you know media, people like"
"Marshall Mcluhan recognized the changes which a clock makes, I mean enforced on us."
"And they say that we don't eat when we want to eat, but when there is a specific time we go to work at the same time, not because there's a need to work but because there is a time to go to work."
Do you see these tendencies with the internet because this is what they call a big megamachine right?
"And I know this, everybody does now."
PETER NORVlG:
Lets see if we can answer thes two question.
I'll go first.
I think you raise a good point that technology sort of accelerates differentials.
"And that leads now can do better and those who don't have the right education are farther behind, so there's a bigger gap."
I sampled one part of that gap and not the other and that is a very important question for society.
"I think, you know, one of the points over here was 'well people aren't reading books anymore' well that's somewhat true, but now completely."
"Harry Potter sold 4 million copies, the Twilight series, I hate to admit it, sold over 100 million copies"
"My generations equivalent to that, which has been selling for over 50 years would be the Narnia books, and that only sold 120 million copies so I feel so bad I got to go out and buy another whole set."
So in general there is a whole lot of reading going on.
Non-required book reading is going down slightly.
"Sixty-one percent of people said they read a book for pleasure in '92, whose down to 57 percent in 2004."
"Total sales of books are up certainly worldwide literacy is down by fifty percent since the seventies, so, but that's probably more to do with wealth than with literacy per say or the web."
"So, it's mixed; magazine readership is way up, newspapers is down, reading on the web is up."
It's a complicated picture and there's a lot going on.
I thing we do have to try and educated everyone and we have to be creative in the ways we do that.
So the garage stretches from x = zero to x =
"G, so in the garages coordinates, the garage itself where this is x and t."
The garage will be something like this.
And this will be the point x = g.
"And the garage is stationary so it just sits there, the interior is the garage."
I will pick the left end of the ladder to be x prime equals zero.
"And so, of course the"
"left, the ladder is moving to the right, so if I set things up right and I am going to try to do that is in the standard way that I like the world line at the left end of the garage which is also because it is x prime equals zero."
This is going to be my t prime access.
"This is, describes the motion, the straight world line, describes the motion of the left end of the ladder."
"And at some point, which I am going to call by convention, t equals zero and also t prime equal to zero."
"I will call that, pick as that event, event number one, or event number zero if you want."
The instant when the. left end of the ladder enters the garage.
"So at this point, the ladder is all the way to the left of the garage. what about the right end of the ladder?"
"Well, the right end of the ladder will be by con, by construction a distance I as seen in the primed coordinates to the right of the left end of the garage."
"So at coordinate x prime, of the right side of the garage is equal to I, and it too of course will be moving at speed v, at the same speed v. So its world line is going to be a parallel line here. this is the world line spiritually drawn, of the right end of the garage and as you've, as I've drawn it you can definitely see that at t equals zero, when the left end of the garage of the ladder enters the garage, the right end of the ladder has not yet exited the garage, and therefore at this point and in fact throughout the time that I am going to mark out here."
"The, this whole region is a region where the ladder is contained in the garage and then at this time, the right end emerges first and later the left end emerge s."
So the fact that I've drawn this to exist is the statement that while G is less than L G is bigger than the square root of one - v^2 / c^2 L. I have made the velocity high enough that the Lorentz Contracted Ladder does fit in the garage.
"Okay so this is event, the event that I'll call event number one and this here is event number two, event number two is the instant when the right end of the ladder is about emerge from the garage and that occurs of course at the position x^2 is equal to G as seen by the, by the garage frame and of course at that same, at that same instant, at that event, is the event where the world line of x prime equals L which is this blue line, the motion of the right side of the garage intersect x2 = g."
"So, that's event number two."
The intersection of this green line with that blue line and
I can compute it.
In a moment I will.
"And then, the question of whether the ladder is inside the garage at any point or not, is the question of which event came first."
"If event number one, the left end of the ladder coming into the garage precedes event number two, the right end of the ladder emerging from the garage, then the"
ladder's in the garage.
"And in this picture it clearly is as seen in the frame of the garage. but the question is if on the other hand event number two precedes event number one, that means the right end of the ladder protrudes from the garage before the left end was in."
The ladder was never in the garage.
So let's figure out the order of these two events and again we will use Lorentz Transformations.
So I've written out here the full set of Lorentz Transformations front and back forwards and backwards as you note they only differ by flipping the sign of'v'.
And then.
I am going to ask what is the time as seen by the garage frame at which this world line of the right side of the garage meets the world line of the right side of the
I mean the idea that a plastic bottle consumes a typical 600ml plastic bottle needs a quarter of it in oil to produce that bottle is just mind-boggling.
When you're looking at that plastic bottle you're not buying water; you're buying crude oil.
"And then, in Bali, people don't realize how many bottles there are."
"Just water bottles, there are over 3 million bottle a day, and that doesn't include all the other kinds of beverages, from your soda to your energy drinks and things like that."
"And even if you were able to recycle 90% of those, you would still have 300,000 of them being thrown in the environment every day."
It's not acceptable.
It's nonsense.
"In Bali we produce 20,000 cubic metres of waste everyday."
"And if we say that 15% of that is plastic, then that means we're producing 3,000 cubic metres of plastic waste everyday."
"I think that it's an incredibly valuable resource; it's mined, oil is drilled from the ground and it creates this product which is incredibly useful, so it should be rightly respected as a resource, and used and used and reused and reused again and again and again."
"Our argument as a campaign is not with plastic; it's about our consumption, and our habits around this disposable culture that we've created. / I mean people come to Bali and they've looked at the brochure; they've heard about it or read about it, and seen stuff, and they have this image of what Bali is, and there have been a few times where they've been quite shocked at what happens, what actually is the situation."
"There was a story, where I was asked to help with this hotel, they had had a problem with garbage that right in front of their hotel entrance, literally, there was a huge garbage dump, and it would burn almost every day, and the smoke would go right through the hotel's lobby, and through their restaurant and through to the beach, and it wasn't good for business, as you might suspect."
"So they had tried every, they had called every government office, I think even calling up to the Governor to help deal with this problem, and nothing every happened."
"And so out of desperation they asked for help, and"
"I went down there and did a quick little survey, you know, I was working for an NGO back then and they were willing to pay us to do it, and at the time we thought quite a bit."
If we knew how much money they were losing we would have asked for more.
"But we did a survey of what was going on and what we discovered was that most of the garbage burning in front of the hotel was their own, that they had created their own problem."
And why that happened was they were selling their garbage to the local trash guy and he was just taking what he wanted out of it and dumping everything in the traditional dump.
"In fact, the dump had been there before the hotel."
"So no one in the hotel had bothered to go across the street and look, and they would have seen their logo."
They would have seen it.
"And their reaction at first was, ""well, let's fire this guy and get rid of him,"" and I said, no, that's not going to work."
If you replace him it's going to be the same thing.
"The problem is not this guy dumping here, the problem is you're asking him to pay for this garbage."
"You should be paying him to take care of it properly, to dump it at the landfill; a novel idea!"
I mean they really were kind of accustomed to selling their garbage.
It's completely crazy!
"And they realized that they needed to change, and it was easy to make the decision, because they were losing tens of thousands of dollars a day."
"I mean, they were losing a lot of money."
So to switch over and pay a local guy a few hundred dollars a month to take care of it made a
"lot of sense. / So every year, Bali has I think it's 4 million domestic tourists and 3 million international tourists."
"Now on top of that, we have a population that's just about reached 4 million."
A couple of other little ones:
They're nice.
Nice people are sympathetic.
"There's an old Hollywood adage: if you want to show us in 30 seconds who the hero and villain are, have one person pet a puppy and the other person kick that puppy."
Students:
Awwwwwwwww
Brandon:
Ok?
"We laugh at it, it's very simple."
But if you're aware of these sorts of things you will see people doing essentially that ALL the time in films.
This is how we know they're a bad guy.
"In fact they go overboard, they get generic, they get bothersome."
"I'm so tired of the opening scene where the villain is doing something, he hires somebody to give him this item or he picks it up, and then he kills them."
"It's like ""OK, well, he's the bad guy."
"He just killed the person that did him this favor, we know he's the bad guy."""
"But the reason they're doing that is that it takes them about 30 seconds to tell you who the bad guy is, right?"
"So, show them being nice, or, you know, not."
And another one is: people like them.

"Gets captured affected by its gravity, loops around and comes back."
"Okay, now since he was going very fast I wanted this to be relativistic, he needs quite a bit of acceleration to flip the direction of that velocity, so he'll to get near the star or the star has to be very massive whichever way you wanna think about it."
"And this gives us another point of view on what is going on here and why it is that in an unambiguous way, not the usual time dilation that is symmetric between two, Two inertial frames but in an asymmetric way honestly physically the moving twins clock was running slower than the stationary twins clock and it somehow has to do with the acceleration and the idea is imagine braking up the trajectory in sort of three pieces."
Piece number one is the piece over here until he approaches the star.
"So, some at this point, we imagine we can ignore the gravity of the star and everything is inertial and indeed, The stationary twin thinks his brother's aging slower."
The moving twin thinks the stationary twin's aging slower.
And indeed the same thing obtains here.
And all the symmetric Lorentz invariant.
Lorentz transformation's back and forth describe what was going on here.
And then there's the region in between these two events where there's this high acceleration.
And now we have a sense of what is going on here.
We know that during this period the blue clock runs slower than the black clock.
"But from our point of view its somewhat clear, the black clock is very far away from the star, the blue clock is running very near to the star."
"The blue clock runs slow during this period because of a gravitational red shift, and how much gravitational red shift?"
"Well that depends how mass of the star in is, is and how close."
"And that is determined by how massive the star has to be and how close you have to get to it in order to deflect this velocity V change your velocity from plus V to minus V, zooming you back towards Earth."
So at
"least without a calculation, you can do a calculation, but it's some intuitive level that is clear that indeed The accelerating phase of this moving twins trajectory is the part the phase of the journey during which unambiguously the moving twin ages"
less than the stationary twin in a way in which they both agree that this is not a question of.
"Whose clock is measuring it, but he the literally he is edging slower this is because we can now see the asymmetry."
He is at the bottom of the gravitational level and his brother at the top.
"So, thinking about the gravitational time dilation is a very power tool and in particular, it gives us the way of reasoning our way through the twin paradox and understanding what there had been being going on."

Environmental changes are already affecting freshwater fishing on the Mekong
The study identifies the Ton Le Sap lake in Cambodia as an ecological hotspot
"Linked to the Mekong river, the lake is a very important wetland"
The Ton Le Sap lake is in Cambodia and is one of the very important ecosystems
It supports the livelihood of a large number of people who are dependent on for their livelihood through fish production
People here know how their lives and jobs are linked to the ebb and flow of natures cycles
Now these patterns are being disrupted by reduced rainfall and river flow
This is partly the result of dam building upstream
The Mekong countries have to carefully manage the upstream-downstream tensions
They also have to balance competing demands for water
"For example, from cities and villages"
"And among the different sectors such as farming, households, and industry"
Then there are other challenges 2 out of every 5 people in the basin don't have safe drinking water or proper toilets
They are just too poor to afford these basic amenities
"To improve their living standards, countries need to invest more in rural areas"
The study recommends Mekong river countries to improve how they manage their water and land
"This needs better policies, institutions, and systems"
Countries sharing the Mekong river or same rivers they have to act together and they have to develop the policies on how to conserve and how to conserve the Mekong river and also how to properly manage the Mekong river
The study found the Mekong river basin moderately vulnerable to environmental changes
There aren't any major water shortages in this river basin as yet
"For now, the Mekong is holding up, despite many pressures"
But all this can change if less water is flowing down the river and the demand for water keeps growing
"That's why the Mekong countries need to watch this river, their main lifeline"

ANNOUNCER:
"From our region to yours, this is..."
So we no longer have the bogey man issue of unspent recovery act dollars.
And that's why we can appropriate more for weatherization.
"That issue has been taken off the table, and I think the work that Arley and I have been doing to raise the profile of the program through briefings, through one-on-one meetings with members, and most importantly, by orchestrating the visits to the"
"Hill with vendors who can talk about the supply chain, the contribution of weatherization to the economy, and your own personal contacts with the members."
There is nothing that is more effective on
letters or appropriations requests than hearing from the weatherization directors and the people in the field and asking the members directly for support for weatherization.
"And at this point I am very pleased to welcome to the call the legislative director for Senator Jack Reed and a great champion for weatherization, Elyse Wasch."
Elyse has been with Senator Reed since he came into the Senate back in 1997.
He replaced Claiborne Pell.
"Senator Reed was instrumental, Elyse, I don't know if you were on the call earlier, but I mentioned the budget amendment which passed in March, and the great leadership of"
"Senator Reed on that and partnering with senator Susan Collins, and we appreciate everything the"
Senator has done.
"And you have stepped into the breach due to some staffing changes and devoted a great deal of your time at this crucial turning point on weatherization, and we appreciate that very, very much."
"I wondered if you could give us your take from an LD's perspective of many, many years on the"
"Hill, of where you see the 2014 request going."
I was talking about the regular order and how far you see that going this year with the committees.
What would be your forecast looking at the approps process right now?
Elyse:
"Sure, thanks, and I want to thank everyone."
I just want to start by thanking everyone.
"And Brad spoke openly about that role that all of you have played and continue to play in the weatherization program, and particularly the effort that we just had on our letter that we did to Secretary Chu and getting many signers."
"So that and we have a forthcoming letter that we're going to do on the FY ""14 appropriations."
"Your efforts to give first-hand, sort of, where you see things, your perspective, a bird's-eye-view on the program and how it works to help people in your states and localities is what really generates support up here on the Hill."
"So I do want to first thank you for all the work that you've been doing on the ground in that regard, and the work that you do every day on making our program as top-notch as possible."
"So the FY ""14 landscape, we are in a different scenario, we have a new chairman in the Senate,"
"Chairwoman Mikulski, for the Senate Appropriations Committee."
And she's at least starting out very much committed to regular order where we'll have each of the subcommittees holding hearings on the various programs and their jurisdictions and then trying to write bills and trying to take those through the regular order.
"Meaning that we would do, let's say, an Energy and Water Appropriations Bill and try to move that, not just the committee process which we've done in many years, but also take those bills to the floor."
"I like to be an optimist, but I'm ever fearful of all the forces that be about how far we can take these bills in terms of members who don't necessarily want to spend money on these programs, so is the budget and fiscal climate that we face right now."
"But we want to start this process, start it in the right way with the right tone, the right tenor about how we're going to go through it and see how far it goes."
I think that's where we want to be.
We want to have a regular order.
"A-2 was the first open source project, because A-2 was given to UNlVAC's customers."
"For the first time customers were given source code to an interesting project, and they modified it and made suggestions and gave them back, and that helped to significantly improve the next A-3 and going on."
So open source is almost as old as computing.
"It's not quite as old, because it turned out open source didn't work unless you had multiple people with the same machine, and up until this point all machines were one offs."
"You'd build it usually as a research experiment and you'd learn things doing that, so the next one you built was going to be very different."
UNlVAC was the first time that people could share software across machines.
"A-2 led to A-3, and then to AT-3, which eventually got renamed as MATH-MATlC."
MATH-MATlC is now beginning to look like a modern programming language.
"In fact, it looks quite a bit like"
"FORTRAN, which was developed at about the same time."
"It was a huge advance in software development, and like all huge advances it was rejected by some of the best programmers of the day, who contended that programming took too much creativity and dexterity, that you couldn't replace the human with a machine, it's just not right."
Waa.
It's not going to work.
"It turned out they were wrong, that they completely misunderstood what these series of tools were intended to do; not to replace them but to help them be more productive."
One of the features of MATH-MATlC and FORTRAN was READ and WRlTE.
One characteristic of both of those systems is that they would stop the program while the I/O was happening and then suspend the program until the I/O was finished and then they would resume.
The thinking was that there's no reason to do anything else because the program was useless until it got the data it needed anyway.
It was also modelled after the way people were thinking about hardware at the time — that you've got a black box and it's got an input and it's got an output and something that happens in the middle.
So there's this symmetry between input and output.
"Later we find that there's not a good reason to demand that symmetry, but at the time we had it."
It was extremely influential.
"When we moved into timesharing, we took the same languages with us."
"We also invented some new ones, so we got BASlC, which was sort of a beginner's version of FORTRAN, but had basically the same model."
"The problem with writing interactive programs in those sorts of languages is that the programs are highly modal, so the user can only type in what the program is expecting at any point, because each READ statement is going to be different in its expectations of every other READ statement, and the user doesn't get to choose which READ statement it's going to execute next."
"Now, it turned out this worked really well for timesharing because it depended on the blocking in order to allow it to have the appearance it could be serving multiple people simultaneously, because once one program was blocked, others could run, and it turned out most users spent most of their time looking at the print out trying to figure out what to do next."
Virtually all programming languages have blocking I/O. READ and WRlTE are in almost every programming
language.
There are a couple of exceptions.
"ALGOL didn't specify I/O, and C was the big exception; it had no I/O at all, which was great because it meant you could modify the environment that you were going to run C in to use any I/O model that you wanted."
"So it was going to be a great thing for doing experimentation — except that it came with standard I/O, and that's the one everybody used, so it might just as well have been built into the language."
"Everything blocks, which is a shame."
"Meanwhile, in some of our research laboratories in places like SRI and Xerox PARC, people were experimenting with other models for how to do interactivity in programs."
"That means talk about it in your video, show it visibly on screen, use annotations and even in the description text of the video, which actually shows up right alongside of the video, right on your channel page there."
Make sure that you're talking about the subscribing there as well because ultimately the goal of the trailer is to talk to non- subscribed viewers and get them to click that subscribe button and become a part of your community.
YouTube also says to entertain the viewer and don't just tell them what you do and what you're about but show them.
"Use b-roll, use clips from past episodes and videos, really show them what you're all about and what they can expect if they subscribe."
"Number 3, they say to indicate somehow what type of videos that you make and then also kind of hint at your posting schedule and when people can expect new content from your channel."
"Number 4, they say to keep in mind that most viewers will potentially have already seen one of your other videos and that's why they're coming to your channel and they kind of check out more about what you're about."
So keep that in mind as you craft your script and what you're going to say in that video.
"And number 5, they say that there's no perfect length, but to keep it short and I think we can all agree with that."
"I say probably about 30 seconds is sufficient, although the one in this trailer doesn't do that but that's because I made it long ago and I'm going to fix that later."
"The YouTube tip that I would add for this is when you're explaining about what you do, make sure you include why you do it because I have found that most people don't really care as much about the what as much as they care about the deeper meaning behind it, the why."
"And if you can identify and articulate that quickly, what that is, I find that that's usually more emotional, more engaging and even if people aren't really interested in what kind of content you're doing, if they're really on-board with why you're doing it sometimes they will subscribe to you also."
"We've already talked extensively about why it's important to answer that why question both for you and for your audience, so click it right there if you want to go watch it or also link to it in the description below if you're watching this on mobile or something."
So I hope that's helpful.
"I'd love to hear from you guys, as always, what tips and advice do you have for your channel trailers as you've been experimenting with these and making them and maybe even finding out what's working and what's not."
"I'd love to hear from you guys and leave your comments, even if it's not just for me but for all the other video creators who will watch this."
The rest of you guys go check out what other people are saying because they usually leave good stuff.
And if this is your first time here we'd love to have you subscribe.
Why?
Because I believe that all you guys have a message that is important that people need to hear and I want to do whatever I can to help you guys spread your message so that the who people need to hear it can hear it and thus be impacted and I really enjoy helping you guys do that.
"So to do that, we talked about YouTube tips and advice every Wednesday."
"Tomorrow on Thursday we'll do some Q and A, just answering some of your questions and on Tuesdays we take a look at online video news and talk about what it means for us who are video creators."
"So all that is coming up, subscribe and I will see you guys tomorrow for some Q and"

I think I did bring some new things to the department.
"I came in as a professor of early Christian studies, so I would teach courses on new testament and early Christian literature, but the kind of person I am, is I have a focus really on some of the gospels outside of the new testament."
"So, I came in with a good Greek background in ancient Greek and also with a background in Coptic language, and believe me, there was nobody here that did Coptic language."
"So I could read all of those texts and I was in the process, in fact, of publishing translations of the gospel of Thomas and the gospel of Mary that was made famous by Dan Brown in The DaVinci Code."
"I didn't know it yet, but I was soon to discover also that I would be involved with the gospel of Judas, so I brought that kind of interest and that interest really has grown over the years."
"But already, back in the 1980s, it was thought to be something special that I could bring."
"I'm doing a little something on Coptic, either first semester or second semester readings in Coptic literature because it's such a rich kind of language with so much literature that is available."
"There are so few people that teach Coptic or know Coptic; so it's one of the special things that Chapman really has, that we do Coptic here, not in a formal way with large classes, but in this kind of informal way."
Over the years there have been a good number of students that have had Coptic and now take Coptic with them.
"As the department has grown in size with more professors that have been involved, we naturally can have more courses."
"Beyond that, we not only have increased in size, but we have other kinds of sub-disciplines and interests that are represented."
"We do a lot more now in world religions than we did before, which I think is a very healthy kind of thing."
I think when I came it was more a matter of doing a lot of things in old testament and new testament.
"That is, Hebrew bible and early Christian literature."
Now I think we have a much more diverse kind of curriculum.
"In fact, we have just now made a dramatic kind of change in our curriculum."
There is a new curriculum coming out in the next catalog and it's going to show exactly how we have grown and still are growing in offering a wide diversity of classes in religious studies.
"I mean, if we're talking about global citizens, if we're talking about making our students more ethically aware, making our whole community more ethically aware, that's what we do in religious studies."
"We care about world religions, the diversity of manifestations of spirituality and the religions of the world and we carry very much about different kinds of ethical systems as well."
How can we learn to behave rightly in all of our professions but also in our daily lives.
What kind of ethical issues are to be faced and what are some of the possibilities for how we respond to though kind of issues.
"That's what we do in religious studies, so I think we are making a very large contribution, and hopefully we will continue to make that kind of contribution in the future."
"One of the ways that we also do that is through the Schweitzer, the Albert Schweitzer Institute that we have on campus."
"When I first came, I knew nothing about Albert Schweitzer to speak of,"
"I had read his Quest of the Historical Jesus, but then I got kind of caught up with"
"Kurt and Elyse Bergel, two great people who were the founders of the Schweitzer Institute."
"Eventually I became the Co-Director, and now I am the Director of that."
"And through the Schweitzer Institute also we are deeply committed to raising issues about how we behave as moral agents in society at large, and then suggesting possibilities for how we may address those kind of issues."
So those are the things that we really care about in religious studies and in the study of Schweitzer.
"The Albert Schweitzer Institute was set up probably 30 years ago or so, I don't have the precise date in mind, but it was set up quite awhile ago by Kurt and Elyse Bergel, two salt-of-the-Earth people wonderful professors here, they both have passed away."
Their contribution really was huge.
"They both ultimately came from Germany and then moved at the time of the Holocaust into Europe, elsewhere, and finally to the United States and became professors here at Chapman University and set up the Albert Schweitzer Institute"
This a live vaccine they spray on most of the meat your consuming.That your buying from the store.
"It gets even worse , the petroleum distillance or toxic waste that's left over from petroleum refineries that refine oil into gasoline they take these tens of millions of pounds of toxic waste that's left over, the Fluoride, the Mercury, the Lead and they dump it on crops as supposed fertilizer and what do crops"
like tomatoes and corn and potatoes do?
"They pull in all of those toxins out of the ground, in fact scientists for many years have used plants to actually detoxify areas that have been contaminated and those plants are pulling all of this up and you are eating it."
That's why the Washington Post reported in January of 2008 that a major study found that nearly a third of the 55 popular brand named food and beverage products where filled with Mercury.
"Despite the fact that the people of Europe for over 20 years have fought off all of the genetically modified wheat and corn and other crops being planted in there nation, now the"
E.U has buckled it is accepting it.
"The United States is literally a testing ground for all of this its just automatically approved and the people that work for these corporations there compartmentalized they don't know whats going on, the people that work at these stores they have no idea whats happening."
"This is affecting all of us, this is hurting everyone."
"Many different forms of cancer are growing by thousands of percentage points, diabetes all these different diseases and in major studies its all been linked to the toxic additives that are in our food and our water."
"And I haven't even had time to get into MSG,"
"I mean Ive interviewed brain surgeons, neurologists, scientists I mean it just devastates the brain."
Its an exitotoxin it destroys the liver and its in tens of thousands of products.
We can say No we can stand up.
"But if you've got a neighbor who's giving fluoride water to there baby please go over and warn them, if you've got a neighbor that's sitting there eating MSG filled chips one after the other."
Warn them.
You have got a responsibility.
If you know people that are feeding on processed foods filled with
GMO.
"And for Gods sake don't give it to your own children, if you wanna kill yourself that's your own business but don't hurt your children, don't do this ladies and gentleman."
"In closing I want to talk about some positive things, just 15 years ago or so you couldn't find organic food anywhere on store shelves and now about half of what you see is organic just a few years ago all the milk had the growth hormone in it."
Now its hard to find milk that has the growth hormone in it because the consumers have spoken and said no.
"A few years ago you couldn't find tooth paste that didn't have Sodium Fluoride in it, now tons of them made, there starting to take over the isle space and displace the other mainline toothpaste makers where it says on the back "" if you swallow this call poison control immediately "" even Colgate is putting out fluoride free toothpaste, people are demanding that they not be poisoned and there finding out about whats going on and so industry is starting to respond and at least give people who want a choice an option to not be forcibly medicated through the food and water."
You know cigarettes are bad for you but just 20 years ago the cigarette makers where getting up before congress and saying it was a conspiracy theory that it was killing people and later it came out in there internal documents they knew it was deadly.
"Ladies and gentlemen I have seen the studies, much of what there putting in our food and water is far worse than even cigarettes as bad as they are one of the biggest killers in the country."
"This is a covert soft kill operation, we will put a lot of links beneath this video so you can check out the facts for yourself and I'm just begging you to do your own research and find out that one of the most dangerous places in the world is your grocery store and the tap water in your house."
What people need to understand is the secrecy around UFOs and extraterrestial intelligence really has nothing to do with ETs.
It has to do with humans
And the power that is resting in large corporations and financial interests that do not want you to know the truth.
And here it is
The truth is that not only are we not alone but that for a hundred years the advanced sciences and technologies dating back to the time of Tesla
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"Well, first of all, since we know that the vast majority of people just look at the first three google results."
I am not even that sure that there's all that much exploration going on.
"I think people can look at their own experiences, their children, other people's experiences, or can look at general societal trends."
I don't think there is that
"- I totally agree with you - that, you know, we should define thinking as having two parts; the exploration part, where scanning, skimming and browsing and surfing can be very, very important."
Googling and everything else and then there is the time when you stop and you pay attention to what you found and go deep.
"And what I think what we are doing is redefining as a society intelligence as being all about access, all about finding, all about filtering, all about skimming, and acanning and we're losing sight of the fact that we also have to pull back from the technology, disconnect, and go deep."
"Obvious there are people who still do that, plenty of people, but I think more and more that is becoming a rare skill. and I think it's the nature of the net, the nature of this medium, that encourages us to be constant browsers of information but never to disconnect in a way that lets us go deep."
PETER NORVlG:
"I don't know, it seems to me if that's the case we are doing it wrong."
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"Oh, I agree! yeah but I'm more interested in what's really happening than how people, you know, I mean McDonalds has salads and fruit plates and people go in and buy Big Macs."
"I mean it's not just, it's not impossible but you have to look at how people actually use it."
PETER NORVlG:
I certainly agree with that there are temptations and there's great opportunities but there's also opportunities for squandering that and making choices that aren't wise.
But i guess you have to measure on the whole which way is it going and to me I see the benefits more than the negatives.
"So i look at the uh the people i work with, especially the younger employees and boy am I impressed that they are doing far beyond what I was able to do at their age because they can do so much more."
I look some of the homework assignments.
"My friend was telling me of the homework assignment his ten-year-old got which after the Haiti earthquake they were told okay, come up with a plan to spend one million dollars are gopto help in Haiti.and so these ten-year-old 5th graders I guess, his kid said I'm going to build schoools and so he researched how much it costs to build a school, how much desk costs, he sourced them out, found a place to buy desks on the web, found a shipping container company and figured out how many desks fit in the shipping container, got a quote from the shipping container company and figured out how many schools he could have by building this spread sheet and multiplying everything out and that just seemed like an excellent educational experience, one that you couldn't get from a book because no books had been written yet about the Haiti earthquake."
"So much was done that was facilitated by this online information and of course, sure,he needed help from his teachers and parents not to be going on Facebook and keeping on task, but those opportunuties are there that are far beyond what we could have done a generation ago."
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"I think that's right and I would be lying if I said I hadn't received huge benefits from the web and from the ability to do research much more quickly to solve problems much more quickly and there's no doubt, for those type of problem solving exercises, the web can a huge benefit and you can do things that were impossible before."
"And I think that's one of the reasons we use it so much, one of the reasons it's become so ingrained in our work lives which our often about solving problems, finding particular bits of information."
But that's not the only way to think and it's certainly not the only important way to think.
"There are also the more attentive, more contemplative ways of thinking that I think are also essential to not solving problems but expanding our mind, expanding our creativity expanding our perspective on life and it's those type of things that are being pushed aside by the web and its many benefits, so I don't disagree with you that there are was of being smart and being intelligent that are enhanced by the technology."
PETER NORVlG:
"So you mentioned McDonald's and some of the choices they make there and in the sixties President Johnson declared the war on hunger, and today, Michelle Obama has the war on obesity, so we've sort of solved one problem."
"But now it's not the problem of scarcity, it's the problem of abundance we're dealing with and the problem of bad choice."
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"And there's certainly, in our web habits, and there's certainly a quarrel there."
"I think, you know, there are very deep instincts we have to overvalue new information, particularly if it has some kind of social value."
I will declare war on you
Allah
"Celle Ve Ala, SWT declaring war on us inside each and every one of us there is that existence of that being that is worst then seytan that is worst then firavun that is worse than nemrut that one who is declaring war not only on the friends of Allah not only on the Prophets of Allah but they are declaring war on Allah that is called the ego that ego it's in you and me and that ego is never in a moment in gaflet station never in a moment is sleeping never in a moment to say let me just take a break that ego is always on the lookout day and night twenty four hours seven days a week three hundred sixty five days a year until we meet our judgment day until death until we reach to the grave he's never stopping and our Seyh is teaching us holy prophets they came to teach us from our Lord how to be careful out to be careful of this great enemy that we have inside of us inside, the enemy is not outside enemy from outside we can see and we can built so many walls we can built so many fortresses we can build so many barricades to try to stop of course it is for those walls those barricades our prayers they are they are our fasting they are our Zekat they are our Hacc they are all the actions that we are doing the principles of islam and the principles of the iman that we're doing to stop the enemies from outside to come to take the faith away but the enemy that is inside of us that ego that is worse than seytan worse than firavun and worse than nemrut that one you need a Prophet that one you need a Prophet to train you how to be aware first of that ego because billions of people they're not even aware that they have an ego they're not even aware that there is such a thing especially in the west they teach the ego to be something just something that exist something that is there something that is powerful something that is good ego, superego, this that, it, mit they're using so many words confusing all of that, they are taking from Islam anyway but they are taking from islam and they make another deviation for the task with a big uh... responsibility of taking control of our ego that is given to Prophets and those ones who are inheritors  of those Prophets those ones who are the friends of Allah those ones our Seyhs those ones who is going to make us to understand our ego make us to understand what is this creature that Allah SWT has created and has put inside of us that is always awake that is always on the lookout to trick us to bring us to the fire to trick us to bring us to become allies not with the friends of Allah but with the friends of seytan, with seytan"
This is a big job not too many are given this job not too many out of billions and billions and billions of human beings from the time of the Adem AS to the Holy Prophet SAV
"Only one hundred twenty four thousand Prophets and some of their selected inheritors and in this way in this Ahir of the Ahir Zaman in this second cahilliye in this nation of the Holy Prophet SAV for fourteen hundred years that specialty has given to the Naqshibendi Tariqat to the most distinguished order where, our Seyh is saying where the other Tariqats they finish we begin the end of their way is the beginning of our way finish, graduate from the other forty Tariqats when you're finished then you enter into the Naqshibendi Tariqat"
Naqshibendi Tariqat and these days
Naqshibendi Haqqani Osmanli Tariqat the straight way concentrating on the ego when the Seyh is concentrating on the teachings of the Prophet SAv  to say do not let my ego
"YaRabbi to trick me for a blink of an eye, this is the seriousness of it they are not given everywhere too"
Elhamdurillah we have receive that teaching from our Seyh because the training of the ego identifying that enemy that is inside of us and controlling that enemy that is inside of us is the most important thing is the most valuable thing that the human that the muslim that the mumin that the murid can have you can have all the prayers and all the readings at all the Zikir  and all the Tilavet of the Quran of all the fastings all the Zekats and the Hajj that you're making which in these days twenty first century muslims it's a big question mark all these obligations all these principles of islam they are not fulfilling properly you don't believe me sit down and think
Hacc has become a vacation
Umra has become vacation people sitting in five-star hotels sleeping all day shopping every kind of luxury then to come back and to say
I am transformed I've become holy
Zekat
"Hahh, Zekat first, we have to ask ourselves how is the system of Zekat"
How is the system of the economy how is the system of currency or financials off money in Islam is? for us to say that yes we give Zekat big question mark but one thing islam is forbidding us to have paper money gold and silver something valuable that you have in your hands to exchange
"Ahir Zaman, ahir of the Ahir Zaman no one is even questioning this a few who are they've deviated from that it's become a main thing so Zekat which Zekat how you're paying the Zekat ?"
"Who is the one who is responsible to receive and to give the zakat? big question mark there fasting where this month of Ramazan, alhamduilahirabbi alamin, Allah SWT, has given us this month may he gives us next year"
"Ramazan also it will live that long for him for Allah and his Prophet this month, month of Ramazan check yourself sit out and say did i just stay away from food and drink? did i just become hungry and thirsty? or did I really fast? fasting from my animal characteristics because eating and drinking and relations it is belongs to the animal characteristics did i really stay away from the animal characteristics or when the sun goes down did i jumped into the food"
like an animal and now these days that are coming the hajj
The Hajj's later.
"Bayram not uh... is coming, this eid al fitr is coming we're seeing millions millions of muslims getting very excited for that, good, we should, we should celebrate but the priority priority has to be doing it for Allah, how many their priority is for this month or these days, these holy days that alhamduilah, Sultan Awliyah declare yesterday to be laylatul qadr, and we do but it could be tonight too it could be tomorrow they could be any night like the turkish saying trade every night like it is laylatul qad, and treat every person as Hizir alayhi salam, that time you're not going to lose is the priority given to these holding nights? right now, are millions of muslims now priority is shop. spend money to get so wrapped up and to be so excited, about the Bayram. not for the sake of Allah and His Prophet,because if you do, you are going to first, your priority is these these holy nights that you are going to catch and you are going to worship and you're going to say maybe i'm not going to reach the next Ramazan but they're chasing after this dunya to spend a lot of money for the luxury for the enjoyment as if you're not going to reach the next Ramazan that is the attitude, prayers prayers that we are making we are making like these quickly praying and quickly leaving sit and think is that prayer a miraj that you have made because a prayer according to Holy Prophet SAV, for a believer, it is a miraj. did we just did miraj? did we just perform the mraj? all of that is to protect the shahadah for the sahadah and the prayer, the fasting, and the zakat and the hajj if it is not protected from the enemy that is inside you can be doing everything it's going to fall and we are going to fail who is the enemy inside? what is the enemy inside? our ego our number one enemy that is allies with shaytan that shaytan will not do anything, shaytan has not done anything, he has just whispered, he is making wes wes but it is our ego that takes that whispering that takes that counsel that takes that consultation and makes it into an action in the judgment day shaytan is going to say, as you know Ya Rabbi i did not pulled the trigger i did not perform that evil deed it is that one who did and i did not hold a gun to his head shaytan is not holding a gun to our head, to force us to commit the wrong thinks that we are doing he is not forcing us he is just suggesting is just making confusion we are following, so importance the importance the most important thing that jihad akbar that is not finishing that is not going to finish until we passed from this world that this world is not going to finish until"
"Sahibul Zaman calls the takbir and Isa AS descends from the paradise that is not going to and until the world ends that Jihad al Akbar still continues who is concentrating on this jihadu akbar we should watch we should see, we should try to understand we should answer that question this is the second jahiliyah worse than the first jahiliyah this is the ahir of ahir Zaman this is the time of jababirah this is the time of great confusion this is a time of complete darkness this is the time of Dajaliyat if we are jumping up and down with happiness if we are ssaying this world is a paradise if we are happy with the way that this world is we need to check out for you we need to be happy, definitely with what Allah SWT has given us but we are not happy with how this world this country, our community, ourselves how we are living in this favor that Allah has granted to us we should not be happy we should say astaghfirullah, Ya Rabbi you have granted us everything in this ahir zaman you've granted us that so many millions and billions of people maybe they are not given but we are not saying shukr and we're not carrying that amanat and we are not saying astaghfirullah that we have taking you for granted we are happy, shukr for what you have given us but we're not happy with our ego we're not happy with our progress we are not happy because we are opening doors to shaytan we're not happy because we pass this Ramazan, and we should have done more we should have done more zikr we should have done more reading of the Quran, we should have done more meditation, we should have done more sitting and thinking and understanding what our ego is and how to catch it we should have done more listening to the sohbet of our seyh we should have caught our ego more tightly and we didn't what are you going to lose if you think like this? nothing. you are going to gain what are you going to lose if you are saying, well another month pass just like any other months you going to lose if you are going to pass through this month and see that well i'm satisfied with myself you are going to lose you must never be satisfied in pleasing your Lord that time when you are we have to check our faith who is saying that our Lord is happy you think in this ahir zaman in this second jahilliyah in this time of Dajjal in this time where there is no khalifah when there's no shariat, tarikat, question mark. when there is no faith, when darkness is taken all over this world you think that in these times it gives us happiness, no, it doesn't. it's not. it should not."
"Astaghfirullah hil azim wa tu bu ilah. we are asking our Lord, for forgiveness we are saying shukr Ya Rabbi, for what you have given us this month of Ramazan that has come and past and our intention is to make if you give us the life to make next Ramazan to be more blessed and to be better for us to make us to reach to higher stations to become obedient servants to you not for anything else we're not looking for anything else Ya Rabb. we are not happy we are not happy because you are not happy we're not happy because we understand that you are not happy with the situation that is in this world we have no right to be happy"
"Prophet SAV is not happy. with the state of this ummah. uh...Awliya Allah, completely they are not. as a believer if we sit down we understand this it'll make us to understand what Allah wants from us. what our Prophet wants from us, and what our seyh wants from us. what is our job, what we have to do, check that enemy that is inside of you are you letting his leash are you letting his leash to be long are you taking his leash off we're putting the leash more tightly in the month of Ramazan"
"Shaytan is all chained. after this month pass watch, during this time watch because the shaytan may be chained but maybe he has trained our ego better than the way that he could have done his job and a believer must be sad that this month is passing the believer must be sad that this month thiis holy month, these holy nights they're gone from our lives again for one more year the sultan of the months have passed this month of mercy this month of forgiveness this month of Rahmat month of blessings has passed. the believe must be said and the believer what he is sad in that way he must try to remember this month more, outside of this month remembrance means you must try to do as much as he did during the Ramazan outside the"
"Ramazan definitely it is going to be a little bit difficult because this month comes with its own ease. he should not be so many muslims are so many saying Alhamduilah, Ramazan is finished taubah astaghfirullah now we can celebrate now we can eat and drink, isn't it? now we can buy new clothes now our lives can continue as normal now especially those secular minded ones, now we can go eat and drink in public, go to muslim restaurants and eat whenever that we want"
"Where is the faith? the faith is gone because together with the ego we are only remembering the dunya and we want the dunya we wanted the dunya to be under our feet but do we had that kind of attitude we're putting the dunya on top of our heads without putting faith,"
"Allah and His Prophet and our Seyh on top of our heads we're putting the dunya on top of our head, don't we are going to be crushed that time,"
"Put Allah and His Prophet as priority don't waste these last few nights go to sajdah and ask Allah for forgiveness advice to you and to me we don't give advice anyway suggestion we don't even give sohbet, our Seyh his Sohbet we talk we give suggestion to one another"
"Asking Allah, Ya Rabbi, this month that i passed, this month that i've passed i've made so many mistakes i did not treat this month as it should have been treated please forgive me for the sake of the holy ones that time inshaallah because you're stepping on your ego you, you not being arrogant and stubborn and"
"letting this month to pass empty the blessings will reach to us inshAllah ar-Rahman that is what we hoping for the great confusion is coming it is not with money is not with technology it is not with too much reading and writing and intelligence that is going to save you from the confusion that is going to come and it's already here it is a connection that you've built to your Lord, your Prophet through his friends through the awliyah Allah. what we're teaching is for us to be obedient servants for us to take control of our ego, for us to understand ourselves for us to understand our Lord."
"May Allah forgive me and bless all of you for the sake of our Seyh, for the sake of our grandseyh, for  the sake of the holy prophet"
Hanamachi
"A hanamachi (花街) is a Japanese word used to call a neighborhood where courtesans and geisha lived and worked. The word's literal meaning is ""flower town"". These neighborhoods used to have many ""okiya"" (""geisha houses"") and ""ochaya"" (""tea houses"", where geishas entertained guests). The term ""hanamachi"" is used in modern Japan to call the areas where modern-day geisha are still living and working. Today, ""hanamachi"" are rare outside of Kyoto."
Japanese traditional dance
"There are two types of Japanese traditional dance: ""Odori"", which was created in the Edo period; and ""Mai"", which was created in the western part of Japan. Odori came from ""Kabuki"" drama, where it is danced by men. Mai derives from ""Noh"" drama, also danced by men. Today it is usually danced by female dancers, and is mostly done in houses, instead of on stage."
"A type of the Mai style of Japanese dance is the ""Kyomai"" or Kyoto style dance. Kyomai was created in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period. Noh drama, music and dance was heavily influenced by the elegance of the manners of the Japanese Imperial Court. Kabuki drama, and hence Odori, was a more democratic form, but still (viewed with modern eyes) quite traditional."
Parkour
"Parkour is an activity in which the goal is to move from one place to another as quickly and efficiently as possible, using the abilities of the human body. Parkour helps to overcome barriers, and is practiced in rural and urban areas. Parkour practitioners are called ""traceurs"", or ""traceuses"" for females."
"Founded by David Belle in France, practitioners only use efficient movements to develop their bodies and minds, and to be able to overcome barriers in an emergency. It may also be a form of entertainment or a hobby."
"Acrobatics (such as flips and wall flips) are not part of parkour, because of inefficiency in a difficult situation (emergency). Freerunning is the branch of parkour, when such flips are used rather than efficient movement."
"In 1988, David Belle was 15 years old. His father Raymond Belle was a great fireman. David was influenced by his father. He left school at the age of 16 and his father helped him to make him stronger. David and his classmates began to create new actions to train themselves. They named it parkour."

Shirt
"A shirt is a kind of cloth which is made to cover the upper body. In North America, shirts can mean T-shirts, polo shirts, etc. In Britain, a shirt has a collar, sleeves with cuffs and split in half with buttons on one side. (North Americans would call this a ""dress shirt"", a specific type of ""collared shirt""). Some shirts have sleeves, that cover the arms. T-shirts are a type of shirt that has shorter sleeves. These sleeves cover the shoulders. Shirts that do not have sleeves are called ""sleeveless""."
T-shirt
"A T-shirt or tee shirt is a kind of shirt which has short sleeves. These sleeves cover the shoulders and the top of the arm, but they do not cover the elbow or the forearm. T-shirts are usually made from cotton fabric or fabric which contains a mix of cotton and polyester. T-shirts are usually considered a casual type of clothing. Both men and women wear T-shirts in Western countries, such as the United States, Canada, England, and France. In some countries, such as Muslim countries, women do not wear T-shirts outside of the home."
Sleeve
A sleeve is a piece of material which covers an arm. It is usually a part of a shirt or other garment.
Taxi
"A taxi (taxicab or cab in the United States) is a car, or other vehicle which is used for public transport. People use them to get to where they want to go. This means there are no stops in between where they get on and where they get off. Many big cities have taxis."
"In most other types of public transport, such as a bus, tram, or train, the rider does not get to choose the locations where they want to get picked up or dropped off. These vehicles often take certain roads or follow a very specific route. Because of this, they usually do not stop exactly where people want to go."
"Riding a taxi is a lot like having your own car, but you don't drive it. You only tell the taxi driver where you want to go and he or she will take you there. How much you pay for the ride, in most cases, depends on how far you are going from where you get on. It is common for the price for a taxi ride to be more expensive than other forms of transport."
History.
"The first taxi-type system started in Paris and London in the early 17th century. These were carts pulled by (carriages) and could be hired. The monarchies that ruled these cities controlled the rules. In the 19th century, Hansom cabs were mostly used because of their higher level of safety."
Taximeter.
Transport.
The main A38 road goes through Bromsgrove. The M5 motorway passes by the west side of the town. The M42 motorway starts at the north of the town.
"Bromsgrove train station is in the south of the town. The station is at the bottom of the ""Lickey Incline"". The Lickey Incline is the steepest hill for trains in Britain. An extra locomotive has to help push heavy freight trains up the hill. There are many passenger trains to Birmingham, Worcester and Hereford. There is a plan to build a new, better train station in Bromsgrove. The new station will cost about £10 million to £12 million."
There is also a bus station in the town centre. Buses travel from the bus station to many places in Worcestershire and the West Midlands.

Graham's number is a very big natural number that was defined by a man named Ronald Graham. Graham was solving a problem in an area of mathematics called Ramsey theory. He proved that the answer to his problem was smaller than Graham's number.
"Graham's number is one of the biggest numbers ever used in a mathematical proof. Even if every digit in Graham's number were written in the tiniest writing possible, it would still be too big to fit in the observable universe."
Context.
Ramsey theory is an area of mathematics that asks questions like the following:
"It turns out that for this simple problem, the answer is ""yes"" when we have 6 or more points, no matter how the lines are colored. But when we have 5 points or fewer, we can color the lines so that the answer is ""no""."
"By asking that the 4 points lie on a plane, we have made the problem much harder. We would like to know: for what values of ""n"" is the answer ""no"" (for some way of coloring the lines), and for what values of ""n"" is it ""yes"" (for all ways of coloring the lines)? But this problem has not been completely solved yet."
"In 1971, Ronald Graham and B. L. Rothschild found a partial answer to this problem. They showed that for ""n""=6, the answer is ""no"". But when ""n"" is very large, as large as Graham's number or larger, the answer is ""yes""."
"One of the reasons this partial answer is important is that it means that the answer is eventually ""yes"" for at least some large ""n"". Before 1971, we didn't know even that much."
"There is a much smaller limit for the same problem called N. It is equal to formula_1, where formula_2. This weaker upper bound for the problem, attributed to an unpublished work of Graham, was eventually published and named by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in November 1977."
Definition.
"Graham's number is not only too big to write down all of its digits, it is too big even to write in scientific notation. In order to be able to write it down, we have to use Knuth's up-arrow notation."
"We will write down a sequence of numbers that we will call g1, g2, g3, and so on. Each one will be used in an equation to find the next. g64 is Graham's number."
"First, here are some examples of up-arrows:"
"After that, g2 is equal to formula_18; the number of arrows in this number is g1."
"g3 is equal to formula_19, where the number of arrows is g2."
"We keep going in this way. We stop when we define g64 to be formula_19, where the number of arrows is g63."
This is Graham's number.
Laguna
"Laguna City is a little city of south of the Brazil, in Santa Catarina State. This city have more than 50000 people. It was the capital of the short-lived Juliana Republic in 1839. The city is known for having dolphins"
Some popular beaches of this city:

Agalychnis callidryas
"Agalychnis callidryas, known as the red-eyed treefrog is a species of tree frogs."
"Red-eyed tree frogs spend most of their time on large tropical leaves. They are not poisonous, and rely on camouflage to protect themselves. During the day, they stay still, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their bright feet under their stomachs, and shut their red eyes. So they look almost completely green, and are well hidden amongst the leaves. The large red eyes are a defensive adaptation called deimatic behaviour. When a red-eyed tree frog detects a predator, it abruptly opens its eyes and stares at the predator. The sudden appearance of the red eyes may startle the predator, giving the frog a chance to flee."
They are active at night. They like to eat small insects.
"During mating, the female carries the male on her back for several hours during the process. The female chooses a leaf above a pond or large puddle on which to lay her clutch of eggs. The male puts out his sperm onto the eggs as they are released."
Tree frogs lay jelly-like eggs. The mothers will stay near them and help them fight any hungry animals that want to eat them. They become a tadpole in one or two weeks. They drop from the leaf and into the lake which is below the leaf.
"If predators are close enough to produce vibration, the embryos sense this. After a few seconds, they vigorously hatch out into tadpoles and spread out to escape."
Common frog
"The Common frog (""Rana temporaria"") is a species of frog. They are also known as the European Common Frog or the European Common Brown Frog. They live in Europe, the Arctic Circle, Scandinavia, Urals, Iberia, Italy, Balkans and Ireland. They are an introduced species in most countries."

Jefferson salamander
"The Jefferson salamander (""Ambystoma jeffersonianum"") is a mole salamander. They live in northeastern United States, southern Ontario and southwestern Quebec. It was named after Jefferson College in Pennsylvania."
"It is usually dark gray, brown or black. Others can have silver or blue spots on their sides. These salamanders are very skinny with a wide nose and long toes. They can reach up to 11 to 18 cm."
"Like other mole salamanders, the Jefferson salamander burrows. They have lungs that helps them to dig. They are only active at night. They are only active in the day when its mating season. They will breed in early spring after snow has melted in their area."
California giant salamander
"The California giant salamander (""Dicamptodon ensatus"") is a species of salamanders. They are part of the family Dicamptodontidae. They live in California and western United States. They are related to the Idaho giant salamander, Pacific giant salamander and the Coastal giant salamander."
Tatsuya Fuji
", also known as Tatsuya Itou, is a Japanese actor."
Early life.
"He was born in Beijing, China and grew up in Yokohama, Kanagawa. When he was a student of Nihon University College of Art, he was spotted and recruited as a fresh actor by Nikkatsu."
Career.
"Fuji made his debut on films from Nikkatsu(Japanese film distributing agency) in 1962. His first movie is ""Bokyo-no-Umi"". He is the first actor who trains his body for acting in Japan. Early in his career, he was often assigned the role of a villain, but ever since then, he has acted various kind of role. In the Nagisa Oshima's film ""In the Realm of the Senses"", he acted in a passionate and violent love scene, and the movie caused a lot of fuss."
Bolitoglossa
Bolitoglossa is a genus of salamanders. They are also called tropical climbing salamanders and web-footed salamanders. They are part of the Plethodontidae family. They live in Central America and South America. They are terrestrial amphibians.
Species.
117 species are currently assigned to this genus.
Green toad
"Green toad (""Anaxyrus debilis"") is a species of toads. They live in southwestern United States in states like Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas and Texas. They can also be found in northern Mexico in states like Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosí, Durango and Zacatecas."
"Green toads are green or yellow with black spots. They are not a large toad. They grow up to 2 inches. They are only active at night. They will breed in spring, summer and autumn. Males will call a female to lay her eggs in his territory."
Smooth newt
"The Smooth Newt is a species of newts. They are also known as the Common Newt. It is the most common newt species of the ""Lissotriton"" genus of amphibians. They live in Europe, southern France and the Iberian peninsula."
Midwife toad
"The Midwife toad (""Alytes"") is a genus of frogs. They part of the Discoglossidae family. They live in most of Europe and northwestern Africa. They look like toads because of their hard skin. They get their name because they take care of their young on their backs. They help them from not being eaten from hungry animals. When they hatch the frog will go back to the water and allow them to swim away."
Van Dyke's salamander
"Van Dyke's salamander (""Plethodon vandykei"") is a species of salamanders. They are part of the family Plethodontidae. These salamanders have been used in research studies."
Energy for other kinds of welding.
"OFW uses a flame from burning fuel gas and oxygen to heat up the metal. This fuel gas is almost always acetylene. Acetylene is a flammable gas that burns very hot, hotter than any other gas. That is why it is used most of the time. Other gases like propane, natural gas, or other industrial gases can be used too."
"Some kinds of welding do not use heat to make the weld. These kinds of welding can get hot, but they do not make the metal melt. Forge welding is an example of this. Friction stir welding is a special kind of welding that does not use heat. It uses a very powerful motor and a special spinning bit to mix the metals together at the edge. This seems odd because metals are a solid. this is why it takes a lot of force to do and is very hard. The energy for this kind of welding is mechanical energy from the spinning bit."
Stalking
"Stalking means following something or somebody secretly. In the animal kingdom, Predators often hunt by stalking, or by combining stalking with ambushing."
Someone who likes to watch other people known as a voyeur. When this is continually done to a person it can have a bad effect.
Criminal stalking.
"Stalking in a way that makes someone feel unsafe is a crime in many countries. It is not just one event but an ongoing process that threatens or makes that person feel scared. Someone who does this is called a stalker. The stalker may do this because they want to be involved in that person's life, because they want to have power over that person's life, or for other sexual reasons. The stalker can make that person feel scared. They may feel they do not have the power to stop the stalker. Psychologists say stalking is a way of hurting someone's mind. Sometimes a stalker may go on to hurt that person's body by assaulting, raping or murdering that person."
Cyber-stalking.
Stalking can sometimes be done on the internet. This is called cyberstalking.

"Since 2016, Cosby has been legally blind, as a result of keratoconus."
Cosby and his wife have collected more than three hundred works of African-American art since 1967.
"In some countries, most notably where the weather is warm, there is a tradition to take a nap right after noon, or early in the afternoon. This tradition is called siesta, and is most common in Spain and Latin America. Some stores and services close while their owners and/or employees take their siesta."
Word.
"The word ""sleep"" comes from the old Old Germanic verbs for sleep. In Old and Middle High German, it was called ""SLAF"". The original meaning of the word was ""to slap"", which was related to the word for ""flabby"" (not hard or firm)."
"Many words related to ""sleep"" have very different meanings. For example, ""sleep"" may be used to mean death, so that ""putting an animal to sleep"" means to kill the animal without pain. ""Sleep with someone"" can also have a sexual meaning."
What sleep is for.
"Sleep helps the brain function. The details are not fully understood, but it is important to get enough sleep for the body and the brain to be healthy and to work properly. In general, animals (and people) sleep at periodic intervals, such as once a day. Certain animals send out signals to the others that they will soon go to sleep. Yawning is such a signal."
"Both humans and many animals sleep about once a day. Some animals, such as cats, sleep many times a day for short periods up to 15 hours a day (or even longer)."
"When people sleep, they often have dreams. Probably some animals do, too."
"Not only people sleep, but all mammals and birds, and most fish, reptiles and other animals also too."
Brief stages of sleep.
There are four stages during sleep:
"While humans sleep, REM and NREM are sleep patterns that help with long-term memory, remembering information, procedural memory, and creative thinking."
Different types of sleep.
REM sleep.
"In mammals and birds, sleep can be divided into two categories. In one of them, the eyes move rapidly. It is called REM-sleep (rapid eye movement). Most dreams take place in this phase. as the body becomes relaxed and the eyes move while sleeping. This phase helps prepare one for the next day. REM-sleep occurs normally at intervals throughout the night, and the periods of REM-sleep increase in length in the second half of the night. It is often encountered 90 minutes after falling asleep, and continues to occur every 90 minutes. REM-sleep was first discovered in 195253."
"REM sleep is found in mammals and songbirds, but is ""poorly established"" in reptiles and fish. According to a survey:"
NREM sleep.
"The other category, where this movement of the eyes does not happen, is called NREM-sleep (Non-REM sleep). In general, dreams do not occur during this time. There are three or four stages of NREM-sleep. Stage I is just barely sleeping, or dozing. Stage II is also light sleep. Normally, in adult humans, about half of the time spent asleep is spent in light sleep. Stages III and IV are called deep sleep. Deep sleep is necessary for growth and healing. It can be quite difficult to awaken someone who is in stage III or stage IV sleep. Sometimes, stages III and IV are combined and called stage III."
"Adult humans normally sleep in cycles of 90 to 110 minutes each. The night's sleep can be 4 or 5 of these cycles. Each cycle includes, in this order: stage I, stage II, stage III (IV), and REM."
Getting enough sleep.
"People who regularly get less than 8 hours of sleep a night tend to complain more and feel very fatigued throughout the day. Getting the appropriate amount of sleep is extremely important, as it could affect one’s body and increase the chances of serious health problems. For each age group, there are different amounts of sleep that are recommended:"
- Toddlers (4 to 12 months): 12 to 16 hours (w/ naps)
- Toddlers (1–2 years): 11 to 14 hours (w/ naps)
- Preschoolers (3–5 years): 10 to 13 hours (w/ naps)
- Grade Schoolers (6 to 12 years): 9 to 12 hours
- Teenagers(13–18 years): 8 to 10 hours
- Adults (including old age): 7 to 9 hours
The timing of sleep and the amount of it are both important. Both are different for different people. Some adults sleep best from 22:00 to 05:00 or 06:00 or 07:00. Some sleep best from midnight to seven or eight. These variations are normal.
"How much sleep is enough also depends on age. Children need more sleep than adults. Newborn babies sleep about 18 hours per day. Small babies sleep many times a day; human babies do not develop circadian rhythms before they are 3 – 4 months old. At the age of 1 year, they sleep for about 14 hours."
"A nine-year-old should sleep about 9–10 hours per day and teenagers, too, also need that much sleep. Adults who sleep less than about 8 hours a day perform worse than those who sleep that long."
Bad habits.
Poor habits could affect one’s sleep schedule in many ways without taking notice. A few habits that are very common and ruin sleep are:
Air raid on Bari
"The air raid on Bari was an air attack by German bombers on Allied forces and shipping in Bari, Italy."
"It occurred on 2 December 1943 during World War II. In the attack, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers of ""Luftflotte"" 2 bombed ships from the Allied Italian campaign. They sunk 27 cargo and transport ships and a schooner in Bari harbour."
"The attack, which lasted one hour, destroyed the port. Not It was not fixed until February 1944. The attack was called the ""Little Pearl Harbor""."
The release of mustard gas from one of the cargo ships added to the deaths. The British and American governments hid the news about mustard gas and its effects on victims.
Background.
"In 1943, during the Italian campaign, the port of Bari in southern Italy was important for Allied forces. Ammunition, supplies, and provisions were unloaded from ships at the port, then moved to Allied forces."
Bari did not have good air defences. No RAF fighters were based there. There was not good anti-aircraft defences.
"The Allies did not think the Germans could bomb Bari. They thought that the ""Luftwaffe"" in Italy could not do a major attack."
German air raids by KG 54 had bombed the Naples port area four times in the previous month.
"Thirty ships of American, British, Polish, Norwegian and Dutch registry were in Bari Harbour on 2 December. The port was lit on the night of the raid to help the unloading of supplies."
Raid.
"On the afternoon of 2 December, a ""Luftwaffe"" pilot flew over Bari. His report made Albert Kesselring order the raid."
The Germans thought that destroying the port might slow the advance of the British Eighth Army. Only 105 Ju 88 bombers were available.
"The attack started at 19:25, when two or three German aircraft circled the harbour at . They dropped ""Düppel"" (foil strips) to confuse Allied radar."
The German bomber force surprised the Allies. They bombed the harbour and its ships and many of the bombs hit targets. Two ammunition ships were bombed. A petrol pipeline was cut and the fuel caught fire. The fire spread to many of the ships.
Twenty-eight merchant ships with more than of cargo were sunk or destroyed. Twelve more ships were damaged. The port was closed for three weeks. It was reopened in February 1944.
"""John Harvey""."
"One of the destroyed vessels—the U.S. Liberty ship ""John Harvey""—had been carrying a secret cargo of 2000 M47A1 mustard gas bombs. Each held of the chemical. According to Royal Navy historian Stephen Roskill, the Mustard Gas had been sent to Europe to use if Germany used chemical warfare in Italy."
"The destruction of ""John Harvey"" caused liquid sulfur mustard from the bombs to spill into waters. The many sailors who had jumped into the water became covered with the chemical."
"Within a day, symptoms of mustard poisoning had appeared in 628 patients and medical staff. Symptoms included blindness and chemical burns."
"Hundreds of Italian civilians also seeking treatment, who had been poisoned by sulfur mustard gas. By the end of the month, 83 of the 628 hospitalized military victims had died."
Cover-up.
The Allies tried to hide the disaster.
"There were too many witnesses to keep the secret. In February 1944, the U.S. admitted to the accident. They said they did not plan to use chemical weapons unless Germany used them first."
Renée Asherson
"Dorothy Renée Ascherson (19 May 1915 – 30 October 2014), known professionally as Renée Asherson, was an English actress. Much of her theatrical career was spent in Shakespearean plays, appearing at such venues as the Old Vic, the Liverpool Playhouse, and the Westminster Theatre. Her first stage appearance was on 17 October 1935, aged 20, and her first major film appearance was in ""The Way Ahead"" (1944). Her last film appearance was in ""The Others"" (2001)."
"Her first stage appearance was in 1935. Her first feature movie was the 1944 movie ""The Way Ahead"". Her most recent motion picture was in 2001's ""The Others""."
"Asherson was married to fellow actor Robert Donat from 1953 until his death in 1958. His severe asthma led to their separation, although a reconciliation had seemed possible just before the end of his life. Although Donat had three children from his previous marriage, they had no children together."
"She never remarried. She died on 30 October 2014, aged 99. Among her surviving relatives is her nephew, the journalist Neal Ascherson."

Frogs as pets
"Frogs have become a popular exotic pet. They can be kept in basic conditions, compared to reptiles. They are not expensive and their food is easily purchased. Common pet frogs includes ranids, hylids, bufonids, leptodactylids, and dendrobatids."
"Pet frogs can be fed a lot of different live foods. These include crickets, rodents and fish. Small pet frogs will only eat crickets, fruit flies, springtails and other small arthropods. Medium-sized pet frogs can be fed larger crickets, mealworms, butterworms, silkworms, grasshoppers and small fish. Large pet frogs like ""Ceratophrys"" can be fed small fish, other frogs, reptiles, and small mammals such as mice or rats."
"Amphibians of all sizes would need different terrariums. Tree frogs like to climb and can escape if a pet owner does not add a top cover for their tanks. Semi-aquatic amphibians need both land and water divided in the tank. Tropical frogs would need mist and high humidity in their terrariums. All water for amphibians must be dechlorinated. The chlorine can kill amphibians, and may be in tap water. Many amphibians are popular exotic pets and are found in some pet stores."
Bombinatoridae
"Bombinatoridae or fire-bellied toads is a family of toads. It includes two genus ""Barbourula"" and ""Bombina"". They have bright colors which means that they are toxic."

Chamber
Chamber can mean several things:
Nonverbal learning disorder
"A nonverbal learning disorder (or nonverbal learning disability), or NVLD, is a neurological problem. People with the disorder have good verbal skills, but they have problems with motor skills, social skills and other areas. A person with NVLD also has problems in non-verbal problem solving, understanding humor and rote learning (remembering something by repeating it)."
"NVLD is linked with autism spectrum disorders, mostly autism or Asperger's. Most people with either high-functioning autism or Asperger fit this actual type. This condition, though, is also tied to depression and anxiety."
Nonverbal learning disabilities affect one in ten learning disabled children.
Red snapper
"Red snapper (""Lutjanus campechanus"") is a fish from the western Atlantic Ocean. They are game fish. They live in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of the Southeastern United States. They live as far north as Massachusetts and Rhode Island, though this is far less common."
Some species sold as red snapper may be other fish in the family. The red snapper can be served in various ways for food.

"He was born in Norfolk, Virginia. He hosted at many local stations in Fargo, North Dakota and its nearby areas."
"In the 2016 presidential election, Schultz endorsed U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States."
"Schultz died on July 5, 2018 in Washington, D.C., aged 64."
Corkscrew
A corkscrew is a tool which is used to open wine bottles. It is inserted into the cork and used to pull the cork out of the wine bottle. Corkscrews are needed because the cork cannot be gripped otherwise.
Basic wine tool.
In 1732 an anonymous poem shows just how far a man was willing to go to open a bottle of wine:
"With the popularity of wine today, a corkscrew is a common item in kitchens, pubs (bars) and restaurants. It takes between 50 and 100 pounds of force to remove a cork from a wine bottle."
History.
"The basic design of a corkscrew is been based on a tool called a gun worm. This was used by a to remove an unfired bullet from a musket's barrel. In the 1800s, many manufacturers that made gun worms also made corkscrews. The first patented corkscrew in England was by Samuel Henshall in 1795. In 1883 a flat, lever-style corkscrew called the waiter's friend was invented in Germany by Karl Wienke. It is commonly used in restaurants today."
Ronan Farrow
"Ronan Farrow (born Satchel Ronan O'Sullivan Farrow; December 19, 1987) is an American activist. He is the son of actress Mia Farrow. It is not known who his father is - it may be filmmaker Woody Allen or singer Frank Sinatra. He was born in New York City. He has written for ""The Guardian"", ""The Wall Street Journal"", and other newspapers."
People v. Jackson
"People v. Jackson was a 2005 trial against singer Michael Jackson. A 13-year-old boy called Gavin Arvizo accused him of sexual abuse in 2003. Jackson was charged with fourteen offences. These were four counts of molesting a child, four counts of getting a child drunk so that he could molest him, one count of trying to molest a child, and one count of secretly planning (conspiring) to hold the boy and his family captive at his Neverland Ranch. He called the charges “a big lie”. He was found not guilty of all charges. If Jackson was found guilty of all charges he could have been put in prison for 20 years."

"The original building of the mosque was a small mosque besides a cemetery at 7 Seymore Street. In 1978, the mosque was relocated to a new place at Oi Kwan Road because the land was needed by the government to construct Aberdeen tunnel. The new mosque building was reopened on September 1981."
Architecture.
"The mosque was designed by architect Ramju Sadick. The mosque has eight floors which consists of prayer hall, Chinese restaurant, bakery, clinic, classrooms, library and seminar room."
Activities.
The mosque is the headquarter place for Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong (the main Islamic organization in Hong Kong) and the Hong Kong Islamic Youth Association.
Atoms for Peace (band)
"Atoms for Peace is a band from California. They started in 2009. They did not have a name until February 2010. The members are Thom Yorke, Flea, Nigel Godrich, Joey Waronker, and Mauro Refosco. In February 2013, they released their first album, ""Amok"" on XL Recordings. The album charted at number 1 in nine countries. ""Pitchfork"" scored it 6.9/10."
Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of getting coal out of the ground. It is part of the mining industry. Coal is used as a resource for making electricity.
Extraction.
Surface mining is done when the coal is near the surface. Coal miners remove the soil above the coal. The coal can then be removed without the coal miners having to go deep underground..
"Underground mining is when the coal is farther underground, making it too expensive to remove soil. In this process, coal miners and all of the coal mining equipment are brought deep underground and coal is carried up out of the ground. This is especially dangerous because of fires, explosions, and poison gas in coal mines."
Processing.
"Before coal can be used, it must be processed in a coal processing plant. It is made smaller using a sizer and crusher. Parts that might be harmful to any equipment which will use the coal later on, such as the screening for metallic parts inside the mined coal."

The Sims 4
"The Sims 4 is a life simulation video game developed by Maxis and The Sims Studio and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released on September 2, 2014 and is the sequel of The Sims 3. The game is available on Microsoft Windows and OS X."
It was revealed during Gamescon via gameplay demo and release trailer.
"The game does not require an internet connection to play, but it will need an Origin account and internet access during the initial installation process."
Gameplay.
"The Sims 4 is made from the same idea of the other games in the series. The player controls their Sims' everyday lives. The game is open-ended and has barely any limits. The lots are connected with a large map. Sims can go to lots close to where they are by walking there, but can use their cell phones to go anywhere."
Create-A-Sim.
"Create-A-Sim is needed to create Sims characters. With no Sims, you can't play the game. Sims 4's Create-A-Sim is easier to use than it is in other Sims games. The Sim's body type can be changed by clicking and dragging parts of the Sim's body. There is a slider to change how muscular the Sim is and another slider to change how fat the Sim is."
"A Sim's clothing can be customized by the player. Mods can change this, but mods can also damage the game. Sims have several outfits. Each outfit is made in Create-A-Sim. They wear different outfits in different situations: an everyday outfit, a formal outfit, an athletic outfit, a sleep outfit, a party outfit, and swimwear. The player can change the Sims' outfits at any time in Live Mode."
Traits.
"Traits are what give Sims their personalities. Every trait you give a Sim will add something to their personality. For example, giving a Sim the cheerful trait will make them happy more often. When you are first creating your Sim you can give them three traits, and when you choose their aspiration you get one more. After that you can give them more traits by completing aspirations. There is no limit to the number of traits a Sim can have. The aspirations are:"
"• Active, which makes the Sim more likely to exercise (the Lazy trait cannot be used with this)"
"• Creative, the Sim is more likely to read books, paint, etc. This can link well with most traits."
"• Genius, the Sim is very intelligent. They will become upset if they have not read in a while, and can link well with the Creative trait."
"• Happy, the Sim is cheerful and optimistic. They will become tense around people with the 'Sad' trait."
"• Sad, the Sim is the opposite of the Happy trait, which means a Sim can't have both traits."
"• Playful - The Sim is more likely to have the Playful moodlet, and is the opposite of the Snob trait. It links well with the Immature trait."
Aspirations
"A Sim's aspiration is their biggest goal. You can change your Sim's aspiration whenever you want. The first aspiration you choose when you are creating your Sim will give you a special trait, but changing your Sim's aspiration after that won't change your Sim's traits. Each aspiration gives your Sims a set of tasks to complete. When you complete all these tasks you will get a second special trait. The trait you get will be different for each aspiration. These can be completed if wanted using cheat codes in the game."
Child and Toddler Sims have their own group of aspirations to complete. These aspirations cannot be given to adult and teen Sims.
Live Mode.
"Sims can only move and be controlled while the player is playing in Live Mode. In Live Mode, 1 second of real time=1 minute in in-game time. In Live Mode, the player can control one Sim in the selected household."
Relationships.
"Sims can form relationships by talking to other Sims. The way your Sims treat who they're talking to will affect their relationships. If they are nice to a sim they will have a friendly relationship, but if they are mean they will have a bad relationship. Your Sims can also have romantic relationships with other Sims."
Needs.
"The 6 needs in the game are Fun, Energy, Hunger, Bladder, Social and Hygiene.This can change with the Vampire game pack, as the needs are Vampire Energy, Thirst, Hygiene, Social and Fun."
"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer is a German wine-growing-region in the valleys of the rivers Moselle, Saar and Ruwer near Koblenz and Trier, Rhineland-Palatinate. It is famous for its wines of Riesling, Elbling and Müller-Thurgau grapes."
There are the following six sub-regions with 19 large vineyards:
Snail
A snail is a common name for a kind of mollusc. The term is used for a gastropod with a coiled shell. Their fossil records extends back into the Carboniferous period.
"Land snails and slugs breathe with a kind of lung. They used to be put together in a group, the Pulmonata. This was a well-known order in traditional taxonomy. However, the Pulmonata is polyphyletic. This means the same life-style evolved in a number of different lines. This is called convergent evolution. Therefore, the Pulmonata is no longer an official term in biological classification."
"The term ""snail"" is also sometimes used for aquatic snail-like gastropods, which usually have gills. Actually, most snail species are marine snails. There are more species of them, and they are far greater in numbers. Many kinds of snails can also be found in fresh water habitats."
Most land snails and slugs are herbivorous. Aquatic snails and slugs are usually omnivores or predatory carnivores.
"In many countries around the world, people eat snails as a delicacy. In France, snails are called ""escargots"", which is also the name of the dish. In French cuisine, the snails are cooked in salt water and then served with a garlic sauce."
The biggest snail is the giant African snail. Their foot is up to 35 cm long.
"The fastest snail is the ""Helix aspersa"". It can reach speeds up to 0.047 kmh."
There are known more than 43000 species of snails all over the world.
Body parts.
Shell.
"Snails are invertebrates, which are animals with no backbones. The shell on the snail helps protect it, and also reduces the loss of water by evaporation. Shells have many different shapes, sizes, and colors. Snails do not breathe through their mouths, instead they have a breathing hole under their shells."
Foot.
"A snails ""foot"" is a muscle which allows it to move slowly across the ground. The foot puts out ('exudes') slime, which eases the snail's movement, leaving a trail. Snails can absorb mineral nutrients through their foot by simply sitting on a rock."
Head.
The head is attached to the foot. On the head there are 15 mm stalks. At the end of the stalks are snail’s eyes.
Habitat.
"Snails are found all over the world. Generally speaking, land snails live in damp habitats. They live in caves and dark places. Snails can be found in dark places such as in a garden under plant's foliage leaves. Some species live in cold places like the Arctic and a few are found in warm places like beaches and deserts."
Food.
"Land snails eat vegetables and fruits, such as lettuce, carrots, cucumber and apples. Aquatic snails are often carnivorous. Snails use their radula to cut food. The radula is a hard, rough plate in the mouth. Radula teeth are like little pieces of sandpaper. They are good for cutting up plants and if the snail eats meat they are good for tearing the meat apart."
"Many animals eat snails. Fireflies, snakes, beetles, fish, insects, turtles and people eat snails too. To defend themselves, snails pull back into their shells."
Ruwer River
"The Ruwer is a river in Germany with a length of , a tributary of the Mosel River. The valley of the Ruwer is a part of the wine-growing region Mosel-Saar-Ruwer near Trier in Rhineland-Palatinate. It is famous for its Riesling wines."
"At the lower Ruwer valley are the villages Waldrach, Kasel, Mertesdorf, Eitelsbach and Ruwer."
Tributaries.
"Tributaries are Alkenbach, Altbach, Altweiherbach, Apfelbach, Avelbach, Bausbach, Benninger Bach, Bingelbach, Burg Heider Bach, Burkelsbach, Eitelsbach, Enterbach, Eschbach, Eselsbach, Flonterbach, Gimpelbach, Gondersbach, Grindelbach, Großbach, Hinzerter Bach, Kittelbach, Klinkbach, Kreidbach, Kundelbach, Labach, Lehbach, Misselbach, Moertschelbach, Mühlscheider Bach, Pehlbach, Rauruwer, Rimperterbach, Riveris, Rothbach, Siebenbornbach, Thielenbach, Waldbach, Waschbach, Weiherbach, Wenigbach, Wenzelbach and Weschbach."

Phase-shift keying
"Phase shift keying is a way of transmitting information. This is done by modulating the phase of a carrier wave. In such a system, the amplitude of the wave does not carry any information; all information is present in the phase of the signal. In many cases, this allows to better use the bandwidth available."
"If we think of a wave as a wiggly line, (like a sine wave), wiggling a specific number of times a second, and we can change at which part of the wiggle it is in. Say if it is at the top of its wiggle, and we immediately change it to the bottom of its wiggle, this is called a phase shift. We can use that change to carry information."
"By either changing or not changing the wave every time it gets to the top of its wiggle, we can send either ones or zeros. This is called Binary Phase Shift Keying. If we change the phase of the wave as it reaches the top, we can have this represent a 1. If we don't change it at the top, we can have this represent a 0. We can use a computer and a radio to turn text into a wave like this and then send it. A radio and a computer listening to this wave changing or not changing can figure out the original message being sent and turn it back into text."
"Binary Phase Shift Keying can be used to send computer data across radio waves quite efficiently. Certain Wireless LAN standards use Phase-shift keying, which they sometimes couple with Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, to get higher data rates."
Pritzker Architecture Prize
"The Pritzker Architecture Prize is given each year by the Hyatt Foundation. It is for talented and significant architect who has created great projects throughout his or her life. Jay A. Pritzker and his wife Cindy began the award in 1979. The Pritzker family pays for the prize. It is the top prize in architecture, and it is often called the Nobel Prize of architecture. The country, race, religion or political ideas of the architect are not important. Winners get US$100,000 and a certificate. Winners receive a medal. The back of the medal has these words in Latin—""firmitas, utilitas, venustas"" (English: ""durability, utility, and beauty""). The idea comes from the Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture came with the prize money."
Selection.
"Martha Thorne has been the Executive Director since 2009. The director asks many people, including past winners, academics, critics and others involved in architecture to suggest possible winners. Any licensed architect can also apply for the prize before 1 November every year. In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft applied for the award himself and eventually won it. Five to nine jury members meet early the next year before announcing the winner in spring."
Winners.
"The first winner was Philip Johnson. The award was ""for 50 years of imagination and vitality"" shown by the many ""museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures"". The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner. Ryūe Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44. The most recent winner, in 2019, is Arata Isozaki."

"Arthashastra is an ancient book of India. Kautilya (also known as Chanakya) wrote this book. Kautilya was a minister of Chandragupta Maurya (321 BC – 297 BC), an emperor of Ancient India. After many revisions and additions, the book took its present form about 1800 years before, in the 2nd century."
"The book is divided into fifteen sections. It tells about politics and administration. Different sections of the book talk about many subjects, such as: war and politics ""rule with a harsh hand"""
Hanuman
"Hanuman is one of the most popular gods of Hindus. He is also known by other names like Hanumat. His mother’s name was Anjana. Based on her mother’s name, Hanuman is sometimes called ""Anjaneya"", that is, one born of Anjana. His father’s name was Kesari."
"He is blessed by Vayu as the god of winds. Hanuman’s image shows him as a strong man with the face of a monkey. He also has a tail it represents the morality, higher pride of being self."
Hanuman was awarded boon of Immortality by Mother Sita ( Wife of Lord rama) and is still alive
"Hanuman is a very powerful and strong god. He finds an important place in the Ramayana. He was a devotee of Rama, a form (avatar) of Lord Vishnu, a god of Hindus. Hanuman is a figure of strength, perseverance and devotion. When he was young he thought the sun a mango. One of his most famous stories was when he helped Rama rescue Sita from Ravana which is the famous story of Diwali."
Indra
"(Devanagari: इन्द्र) or is the most important among the Indo-Aryan gods. He is the God of war, the god of thunderstorms. In the Vedas, many verses (hymns) are there in his praise. The Rigveda praises him as a very strong God. Many Hindu scriptures tell about Indra, his character and his deeds."
"Indra resides in a mythical city located above in the sky. The city’s name is Amravati. He lives there with his wife named Indrani, and several other smaller gods. There are many apsaras in amravati."
"Indra was a very important God during the Vedic period. Later his importance became less. Gods like Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva became more important in Hinduism."
"Indra in current form of mythology is similar to that of Zeus in Greek mythology. Though his importance has come down, he is still considered to be king of Gods. His status is below that of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. Thus, he is considered to be king of lesser Gods."
"Again, his weapon is Vajra which is represented by Thunderbolt! His means, at times, treacherous and he is shown as, at times, jealous and vengeful. Further, he is made to suffer his own bad deeds."
Badrinath
"Badrinath is an important pilgrimage place for the Hindus. The place is in Uttarakhand state of India, and is located at a high altitude in the Himalayas. The Hindu scriptures say that the place is sacred to Vishnu, one of the gods of Hindus."
"Badrinath gets its name from a tree's name. The name of that tree is ""badri-tree"" or Indian Jujube tree. The botanical name of a badri-tree is ""Zizyphus jujba Lam""."
The modern Badrinath temple was established by Adi Shankaracharya in the ninth century after the old temple fell to ruin. The Badrinath area is referred to as Badarikaashram (बदरिकाश्रम) in Hindu scriptures.
"The temple was renovated many times because of age or damage by avalanche. In the 17th century, the temple was renovated by the kings of Garhwal. After the great 1803 Himalayan earthquake, it was rebuilt by the King of Jaipur."

ICS Bégué
ICS Bégué is a French private business school in Paris. It was created in 1957 and is part of IONIS Education Group.
It is recognized by the French State.
Enol
An enol is an alkene that has an OH group attached to one end of the double bond. It is called an enolate if the proton on the oxygen atom is taken away.
"Enols are tautomers of ketones or aldehydes. Tautomers are molecules which are different only in the position of an hydrogen atom. Enols can be made very easily from ketones or aldehydes using a base. They are quite unstable, because the C=O bond is stronger than the C=C bond. However, they can do many interesting reactions. The best example is the aldol reaction."
"Enols of ketones can be made on two different sides. It is important to be able to choose which side to react. The side with less substituents is the easiest one to react: it can be made at low temperature with a bulky base. This is called the kinetic enolate. The other side, with more substituents, is more difficult to react. Higher temperatures are needed. This is called the thermodynamic enolate."
Steric effects
"Steric effects are the effects seen in molecules that come from the fact that atoms occupy space. When atoms are put close to each other, this costs energy. The electrons near the atoms want to stay away from each other. This can change the way molecules want to react. It can also change the shape (or conformation) of the molecule. The amount of space that a group of atoms takes is called the ""steric bulk""."
"An example of steric effects is steric hindrance. This is when a large group in a molecule makes reactions not work. For example, an SN2 reaction does not happen on carbon atoms that have three substituents. Steric hindrance however can also be a positive thing. Sometimes, chemists would like a reaction to happen in one place rather than another one. A bulky group can block a position. It can also change the shape such that only one diastereomer from a reaction is made."
"Steric effects are usually smaller than electronic effects. These affect the molecule's shape and reactivity as well, but they come from the way electrons are placed in bonds."
Motherland Party (Azerbaijan)
"The Motherland Party () is a nationalist and conservative political party in Azerbaijan. It was founded in 1990. Its members are mainly Azerbaijanis who come from Armenia. The party's leader Fazail Agamali is a former deputy minister for social protection. The party's aim is to create a ""free, powerful, democratic and entire Azerbaijan""."
"At the 2010 parliamentary elections, it won 2 out of 125 seats."
"The corresponding month in the Babylonian calendar is ""Tišritum"", made for Shamash (the Sun)."
Symbol.
"Libra's symbol, like the scales, is the only symbol in the zodiac that is not represented by an animal or person."
Mythology.
"In mythology a Libra is related to the Greek Goddess of Justice, Themis, the Greek mythology version of Atalanta (meaning balanced), and Astraea (daughter of Themis), who went up to heaven and became the constellation of Virgo, and carried the scales of justice, which is the constellation Libra.Ω"
"Libra is also related to the Greco-Roman goddess Aphrodite/Venus and sometimes also the goddesses Eris/Discordia &amp; Harmonia/Concordia,Dike, Themis, Hera/Juno, Ishtar, Freyja, Persephone, Frigg and Forsetti the god Xolotl."
Matsya
"Hindus believe that the Matsya was the first important avatar of Vishnu. As the Matsya avatar, Vishnu took the form of a big fish. Sometimes, it is said that he took the form of a half-man and half-fish. There is a story about this in Hindu scriptures. The story tells about a demon (an asura). That asura was very wicked. He snatched the Vedas, the holy books of the Hindus, and went deep inside the sea. At this point, Vishnu changed his form. He became a ""matsya"", that is, a fish. He entered the sea and brought back the Vedas. He gave the Vedas to Manu. The Hindu scriptures say that Manu was the first man in the world. He may be compared with Noah or Adam."
Kurma
"Kurma is an avatar in the Hindu religion. Hindus believe that Vishnu, an important god of Hinduism, had several forms, or avatars, and the second important avatar is called the Kurma avatar. In this avatar, Vishnu took the form of a kurma to help the devtas and asuras to churn the Kshira Sagara, to gain amrita. This avatar took the Mount Mandaar on his back and helped the mount to churn the ocean. Kurma is a Sanskrit language word that means a tortoise. As a kurma, Vishnu is the symbol of strength and stability."
Varaha
"Hindus believe that Vishnu had many important Avatars, and the Varaha avatar was the third avatar of Vishnu. In this avatar, Vishnu took the form of a black varaha. Varaha is a Sanskrit language word that means a boar. The Hindu scriptures tell a story about this avatar. There was a daitya (a demon) named Hiranyaksha. He threw the Earth (called Prithivi by the Hindus) into the waters of the ocean. The earth was about to sink in the ocean. At this point, Vishnu took the form of a black boar. He entered the water and carried the earth on its body and brought the earth safely to where it should be. Thus, Vishnu as a varaha saved the earth from being destroyed."
Prithvi
Prithvi is the name for the goddess of the Earth in Hinduism.
"The goddess prithvi is also called Devi basundhara, mata dharitri and bhoomidevi."
Daitya
"A Daitya, according to Hinduism, is a type of giant that fought against the gods."
Manu (Hinduism)
Manu is a term found in Hinduism.
"It has various meanings in different mythologies. In early texts, it refers to the archetypal man, or to the first man on Earth."
Wild boar
"The wild boar (""Sus scrofa"") belongs to the family of the real pig (Suidae) from the order of artiodactyls. They live today in almost every part of the world, even many countries that are not their natural habitats."
"The wild boar is native to Eurasia and North Africa. Wild boars are omnivorous and easily adapt to changes. They were hunted in Europe from long ago for many of their body parts, and were shown in the mythology of many ancient civilizations. Greek, Phoenician, and Persian mythology showed them as fierce, sometimes evil, while others showed them as brave, powerful animals. Again, others saw them as parasitic. Even today many people see wild boars very differently."
"The hair of the boar was often used when making the toothbrush until the 1930s. The hair for the bristles usually came from the neck area of the boar. The brushes were popular because the bristles were soft. However, this was not the best material for oral hygiene because the hairs dried slowly and usually held bacteria."
Appearance.
The name 'Dodo'.
"The history of the word 'Dodo' is not clear. Dutch admiral Wybrand van Warwijck discovered the island and the bird in 1598 during an expedition to Indonesia. He called the bird 'walgvogel', meaning ""disgusting bird"" because he disliked the taste of the meat. Four years later, the Dutch captain, Willem van Westsanen, used the word 'Dodo' for the first time."
"The ""Encarta Dictionary"" and the ""Chambers Dictionary of Etymology"" say ""dodo"" is a Portuguese word, coming from ""doido"". It means ""fool"" or ""crazy"". Another idea is that 'dodo' was a copy of the bird's own call, a two-note pigeon like sound, ""doo-doo""."
"In 1606 Cornelis de Jonge wrote a description of the Dodo, and of other animal and plants on the island ."
Description.
"The dodo was a large bird and weighed about . They had grey feathers and yellow feet. Their big hooked bill was a green/yellow color. It had short wings that were only stubs. They ate fruit, seeds and nuts. Portuguese sailors said that they saw the Dodos eating fish. They also ate rocks and stones which might have helped them digest food. They are eaten by humans who come in the search of treasure or spouting."
Extinction.
"The dodo was not scared of people which made it easy to hunt and kill. Dogs, cats, rats and pigs were left on the island and also killed the dodos. Because dodos built their nests on the ground, the new animals ate their eggs. The forests were chopped down and the dodo lost its habitat. Within 80 years, the dodo was extinct."
"The last known stuffed bird was at Oxford University and was thrown out as rubbish. Only a foot and a head are left. The American Museum of Natural History in New York has a skeleton showing. It was put together out of bones from several different Dodos. The Natural History Museum of Mauritius has the only complete skeleton of a dodo, found in a swamp."
Tolkāppiyam
Tolkaapiyam (தொல்காப்பியம்) is a book on grammar of the Tamil language.
Tol (தொல்) means Old and Kappiyam (காப்பியம்) means a literary work.
"The name of the author could not be identified (usually referred as ""Tholkappiyar"") and the work apparently relates to Grammar in Tamil."
"It is learnt that the author was one of the 12 disciples of Sage Agastya the Father of Tamil Grammar. This sage was living in the south near Madurai, during the visit of Lord Ram to the south in search of his wife, abducted by the Lankan King Ravan."
The age of Lord Ram precedes that of Lord Krishna and hence the work can safely be said to precede 3000 BC (the ideal period of Mahabharat Yudh).
"Lord Shiva and his Son Murugan is said to have laid the first tenets for the Tamil Language, probably long long time before sage Agastya could compile the same."
Great auk
"The great auk was a large bird, that could not fly. People hunted it for meat and feathers. It grew rare, because it was too easy to kill, and the ones left could not breed fast enough to make up for the lost ones. The last known great auks (there were two auks) were killed on June 3, 1844 in Iceland. It lived mostly in the water, like a duck."
"Penguins got their name from the great auk. The word ""penguin"" was the Celtic word for ""great auk"". When sailors saw penguins for the first time, they thought they looked like great auks."
"The great auk was covered in black feathers, but had white feathers on its chest and abdomen. It had very short wings, like stubs, which meant it could not fly. On land it stood upright and was about 75 cm tall. They spent most of their time at sea, coming to shore in the summer to breed. They lived in large breeding colonies on low rocky islands in the north Atlantic Ocean from Canada to Norway. Females laid one egg on bare rock. In winter they went as far south as Florida and southern Spain."
Abbey Road Studios
"Abbey Road Studios, usually called just ""Abbey Road"", are the recording studios in EMI's headquarters in St. John's Wood, London, England."
"Abbey Road had three different studios for most of its history. Other space was turned into a fourth studio later. Studio One is large, and used to be a ballroom. Symphony orchestras and very large bands and groups are recorded there. Studio Two is smaller, and works best for small combos or groups of musicians. Studio Three is much smaller, and is meant for soloists and duos. Studio Four is mostly for post-production, where changes are made to earlier recordings."
Ujamaa
"Ujamaa, meaning 'familyhood' is the group of ideas of Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. They are based on the traditional African society."
Prisoner
"A prisoner is a person who is forced to stay in a prison against their will. People who are suspected of a crime, for example, a murder, may be arrested and held in jail so they won't escape before their trial. After conviction a prisoner may be punished. For example, they may be imprisoned for a fixed number of years, or receive a life sentence meaning they stay in jail until they die."
Linga
"A linga or a lingam is a very complex Phallus symbol of Hinduism. It is associated with Shiva, supreme god in main gods of the Hindus. The Hindu scriptures say that a linga represents energy and strength. In almost all the temples of Shiva, Shiva is shown in the form of a Circumcised linga."
"The Hindu scriptures also say that Shiva took twelve forms as Jyotirlinga, that is, ""a linga of light"". In India, there are twelve places where this form of Shiva is worshiped. The Hindu scriptures also tell about five more forms of lingas. These form of lingas represent the earth, the water, the fire, the air and the sky (or ether). There are five different places in India where Hindus worship these forms of Shiva. These places are located at the following locations:"
"Beside above places, in almost all the towns and villages of India, Shiva’s temples are found. In all such temples, lingas are worshipped."
"Also in other places in the World of Ancient history, Shiva Limgam was worshipped."
United States National Guard
"The United States National Guard is an organization of the United States Army and the United States Air Force. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force are both branches of the United States military. The National Guard is a militia (an emergency army) for the United States. Each U.S. State has its own National Guard, usually under the control of that state's government. When needed, they are mobilized under control of the United States."
"There are two parts of the United States National Guard, administered by the National Guard Bureau of the United States Department of Defense. The Air National Guard is part of the United States Air Force; the Army National Guard is part of the United States Army. The two National Guard groups are identified by the kinds of jobs they do. The Air National Guard does mainly air defense jobs, while the Army National Guard does the jobs on the ground."
Bishop's Stortford
"Bishop's Stortford is a town in Hertfordshire in south-east England, with about 35,000 people living there."
History.
People have lived in the area for hundreds of thousands of years but it became a permanent town by the time of the Saxons.
The Domesday Book says there were 120 people living there in the 1100s. The Normans built a small castle there but it was unused and broken by the time of the Tudors.
"The town grew as an important centre for transport. After 1769, ships were able to use the river. It was a stagecoach stop for travel on the road between London and Cambridge. In 1842 the town got a railway station."
"In 1901 there were 7,000 people living there, and by 1951 it was 13,000."
The town is popular for travellers to London because of the M11 motorway (an important road) and good train services to London. Stansted Airport has also caused development.
Raven
"A raven is a big black bird, (""Corvus corax""). It may be called the common raven or the northern raven. It is similar to a crow but bigger. It and the thick-billed raven are the two largest birds in the crow family, and perhaps the heaviest perching birds. The raven's feathers are all black, but a crow has feathers that are white at the bottom. This cannot be seen from a distance."
"The most famous raven is in the Edgar Allan Poe story called ""The Raven""."
"The common raven can be tamed. Some think it is mischievous and sly, and it has been regarded as a bird of evil and mysterious character."
Malnutrition
Malnutrition is eating a diet which does not supply enough nutrients. There are two broad cateogries of malnutrition:
"Sometimes, people need to lose weight, and eat according to a special diet. This is usually not called malnutrition."
"Malnutrition is considered a more scientific and official term than starvation which has negative associations. Malnutrition is not, however, simply a matter of eating too little. Someone can be malnourished if they eat an unhealthy diet. This can be cured by eating a proper balanced diet."
"Children whose daily diet contains less carbohydrate and protein do not grow well. They do not gain weight. Their hands and legs appear as skin and bones. They cry all the time with hunger. They are not active and have sunken eyes. Such children often fall sick. Lack of a particular vitamin is another kind of malnutrition which can cause a particular deficiency disease, such as beriberi and rickets."
"Malnutrition becomes a bigger problem during famine because most of the people do not get enough food, hence increasing the death rate."
USA.
"A 2005 patient study found an average emergency room wait time from 2 hours in Iowa to more than 5 hours in Arizona. The Midwest had the highest number of emergency room visits (460 per 1,000 people). The West had the lowest number."
Gynecology
"Gynecology (also spelled gynaecology) is the part of medicine that deals with the female reproductive system (vagina, uterus, ovaries) and breasts. Outside medicine, it means ""the science of women."""
Women have started to outnumber men in the study and practice of gynecology.
Transantarctic Mountains
The Transantarctic Mountains are a mountain range in the continent of Antarctica. It divides the continent into eastern and western region. It extends for over 3200 km.
The Antarctic Peninsula to the west is not part of this range.
"Life in the interior of the Transantarctic Range is limited to bacteria, lichens, algae and fungi."
"The name ""Transantarctic Mountains"" was first used in 1960, in a paper by geologist Warren Hamilton."
John Singer Sargent
"John Singer Sargent (January 12, 1856 – April 14, 1925) was an American artist. He was the leading portrait painter of his day."
"During his career, he created about 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as many sketches and charcoal drawings. He travelled worldwide. His parents were American, but he was trained in Paris, and then moved to London."
"His ""Portrait of Madame X"" resulted in scandal, though today it is hard to see why. She was thought to be somewhat loose sexually. In the original portrait as exhibited, one strap of her gown had fallen down her right shoulder. This suggested to some the possibility of further revelation; ""One more struggle"", wrote a critic in ""Le Figaro"", ""and the lady will be free""."
"Sargent visited Spain, studied Velázquez, and was entranced with Spanish music and dance. He understood what the Impressionists were doing, and adopted their habit of painting ""en plein-air"". He was a big fan of Monet, and bought four of his works. His portrait of Monet shows he understood what was going on in French art at the time."
"Sergent kept his American citizenship, and went back there four times. However, he remained living in London to the end of his life."
École nationale de la météorologie
"École nationale de la météorologie (ENM, French Meteorology University) is a graduate engineering school in France. It has its own campus and also operates on the French Civil Aviation University campus for aviation activities."
It awards the following French &amp; European degrees :
Classes are mainly in French language. The school has 350 students from a dozen countries. Most of the graduate engineer students live in dedicated housing buildings.
Research labs.
Research at the school relate to the following topics:
Two-body problem
"The two-body problem is a problem from classical mechanics: there are two bodies which influence each other. Very often they attract or repel each other. In many cases they rotate. The problem uses bodies which are circles, or spheres. Solving the problem is possible for many situations, but it usually involves higher level mathematics."
Simplification: One body has a mass that is much smaller.
"When one of the two bodies has a mass that is much smaller, the influence of this smaller body on the larger one is very small, and can be disregarded. In such a case, the problem can be reformulated as a one-centre problem, where there is a stationary big body in the centre, and a small body orbiting around the big one. This setting is very comon. Johannes Kepler was the first person to formulate and solve it. For this reason, it is also known as Kepler problem."
General solution for the two-body problem.
Azemiopinae
"Azemiopinae, commonly known as the ""Fea's vipers"", is a monotypic subfamily made for a monotypic genus, ""Azemiops"", which contains the venomous viper, Azemiops Feae. It is found on the mountains of Southeast Asia."
Description.
"The Feas's vipers can grow up to the length of 77 cm. They are blueish-gray or black in color with orange crossbands, the head is orange while the chin and throat is yellow, it also has yellow eyes."
Where they live.
"The Fea's viper is found in northern Vietnam, southern China, south-east Myanmar, and south-east Tibet. In China the Fea's viper is found in Fujien, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Kweichow, Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang."
Habitat.
The Fea's viper is found on mountains which have an altitude of 1000 meters. It prefers to live in cool climates which have an average temperature of 18-25 °C. In Vietnam it is found in bamboo forests.
Behavior.
"The Fea's viper is said to be nocturnal, but some people say that it crepuscular, and it hibernates in the winter. When disturbed, the Fea's viper flattens its body to make it look wider, and opens its mouth widely to show its fangs, giving its head a triangular shape. It sometimes also vibrates it tail. Fea's vipers are said to eat small mammals."
Parable of the Prodigal Son
"The Parable of the Prodigal Son is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found only in the Gospel of Luke at 15:11-32. The parable is about a son who wastes his share of his father's estate. He loses all his money and gets work feeding pigs—one of the lowest jobs a person can do according to the Jewish religion. He repents and returns to his father's house. He is welcomed and a feast is held. His older, dutiful brother who has worked without reward for his father resents the fuss made over the prodigal son. His father reminds him that all he has is his. He says they should still celebrate the return of the younger boy because he has come back to them. In the Western Catholic church, this parable is usually read on the third Sunday of Lent. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is read on the ""Sunday of the Prodigal Son"". The parable is the subject of much art, music, literature, and stage works."
"This is the last of three parables about loss and redemption. It follows the Parable of the Lost Sheep and the Parable of the Lost Coin. Jesus tells this parable after the Pharisees and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with ""sinners."" The father's joy described in the parable reflects divine love, the ""boundless mercy of God,"" and ""God's refusal to limit the measure of his grace."""
Parable of the Mustard Seed
"The Parable of the Mustard Seed is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in three of the Gospels of the New Testament: Gospel of Matthew (13:31–32), Gospel of Mark (4:30–32), and Gospel of Luke (13:18–19). The differences among the three tellings are minor."
"In Matthew and Luke, this parable is followed by the Parable of the Leaven. The Parable of the Leaven also has a theme about the Kingdom of Heaven growing from small beginnings. A version of the parable also occurs in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas 20."
"The parable from Matthew reads: ""The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field; which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."" The parables from Mark and Luke are similar."
Parable of the Lost Sheep
"The Parable of the Lost Sheep is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in the Gospel of Matthew at 18:12–14 and the Gospel of Luke at 15:3–7. It also appears in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas. The parable is one of three that tell of loss and redemption. The others are The Lost Coin and The Prodigal Son. The Lost Sheep tells of a shepherd who leaves his 99 sheep to search for one sheep that is lost. Joel B. Green writes that ""these parables are ... about God, ... their aim is to lay bare the nature of the divine response to the recovery of the lost."" The parable has been depicted often in art."
Brandenburg Gate (Potsdam)
"The Brandenburg Gate () on the ""Luisenplatz"" in Potsdam, should not be confused with the gate of the same name on Berlin's ""Pariser Platz"", it was built in 1770/71 by Carl von Gontard and Georg Christian Unger by order of Frederick II of Prussia. It stands at the western end of ""Brandenburger Straße"", which runs in a straight line up to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul."
"Previously, from 1733, there was another, simpler gate on the same spot, which resembled a castle gateway. Together with the city wall, a form of toll barrier, and the other gates it was intended to prevent desertion and smuggling."
"Towards the end of the Seven Years' War, Frederick the Great had the old gate demolished and built, in its stead, this new Brandenburg Gate, as a symbol of his victory."
Since the city wall was demolished around 1900 the Brandenburg Gate has been a free-standing structure.
List of amphibians
This is a list of amphibians by family
Class Amphibia.
Swift
The swift is a bird in the family Apodidae. It is in the order Apodiformes with treeswifts and hummingbirds. The swift is very good at flying. It spends all of its time in the air.
"The scientific name for the swift (""apus"") comes from the Ancient Greek word απους, ""apous"" which means ""without feet"". This is because swifts have very small, weak feet. Swifts use their feet to hold on to vertical places (for example, the wall of a house, or a cliff). Swifts do not want to land on the ground. It is often thought that if they land on ground, they cannot fly up again, but that is not true. They can take off but with difficulty."
Description.
"Swifts are small birds. They can fly very well and very fast. Some swifts can fly at 514m per second. If a swift needs to fly very fast, it can fly at 60m per second for a short amount of time. When catching insects, they fly in a series of swoops, changing direction rapidly as they pursue the prey."
"Swifts have long, curved wings. The wings are in the shape of a sickle or boomerang. They have a forked tail. This means it looks like a V shape."
"Swifts can be seen all over the world. They like to live in warmer places and they migrate every year. For example, Swifts fly to Europe in the spring and summer. When it gets cold at the start of autumn, the Swifts fly to Africa where it is warmer."
Nests.
"Swifts make their nests in a corner between two walls. For example, near the roof of a house, or in an area between rocks in a cave. They use mud and saliva (spit) to make a cup-shaped nest."
"There are some swifts which only use saliva to make their nests. These swifts are in the genus ""Aerodramus"". In Asia, people take the nests and use them to make bird's nest soup. This soup is very popular in China."
"Wangaratta, Victoria"
"Wangaratta is a city in the northeast of Victoria, Australia. About 19,000 people live there. It is about from Melbourne along the Hume Highway. The city of Benalla is to the south west, and Albury and Wodonga to the north east. The Ovens and King Rivers which flow from the Victorian Alps meet at Wangaratta. It is in the local government area of the Rural City of Wangaratta."
History.
"Gold was found in the area during the 1850s. A Post Office opened on 1 February 1843, as Ovens, and moved to the town and was renamed Wangaratta in 1854. The Ovens office, and the Kilmore office which opened the same day, were the fifth and sixth to open in the Port Phillip District (Victoria). They were also the first two inland offices."
"The small town of Glenrowan about 10 km away is known as the site of the final shootout that led to the capture of Australia's most famous bushranger, Ned Kelly."
"Chiltern, Victoria"
"Chiltern is a town in the north east of Victoria, Australia. It is between Wangaratta and Wodonga, in the Shire of Indigo. In 2006 there were 1063 people living in Chiltern. The town is close to the Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park. Chiltern was once on the main road between Melbourne and Sydney but is now by-passed by the Hume Freeway a few kilometres to the east."
History.
"The area of Chiltern was on the Wahgunyah cattle run and was called Black Dog Creek. The township was named after the Chiltern Hills in England. It was surveyed in 1853 but not started until gold was found in 1858—59 during the great Victorian Gold Rush period. The Post Office opened on September 1, 1859."
"Many of Chiltern's old buildings are protected by the National Trust. In 1859, many shop-keepers and miners from around Beechworth and the Ovens Valley followed the gold rush and moved into Chiltern."
"The Grape Vine Hotel, on the corners of Main St and Conness St, has the largest grapevine in Australia, planted in 1867."
News release
"A press release, news release, media release, or press statement is a written or recorded communication for news reporters. Its purpose is to let them know about something that is news. These are mailed, faxed, or e-mailed to editors at newspapers, magazines, radio stations, television stations, and television networks. There are companies whose job is to send out this information."
"The use of a press release is common in public relations. People use this to get the media to take notice of them, or get publicity for a product, or event that they might be holding. A press release gives reporters the basic information they need to write a news story. Press releases can announce a range of news items such as: events, promotions, awards, new products and services, sales and other financial data, accomplishments, etc."
"A ""press statement"" is information given to reporters. This is an official statement or account of a news story that is specially written for newspapers and other news media for them to make known to the public."
Alice (song)
"""Alice"" is an alternative rock song written and performed by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne for the soundtrack to the 2010 movie ""Alice in Wonderland"", entitled ""Almost Alice"". The song is a mid-tempo ballad sung from the perspective of the film's lead character, Alice. According to Lavigne, she wrote the song after asking Disney executives and director Tim Burton for a role on the soundtrack. The song was produced by Butch Walker and mixed by Lavigne's former husband Deryck Whibley."

Freezing rain
"Freezing rain is rain that freezes when it hits the ground. It happens when the air is above freezing, but the ground is below freezing. It makes things slippery, and can cause problems."
Operation (mathematics)
"In mathematics, an operation is a function which takes one or more inputs (called operands) and produces an output. Some of the most common operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, all of which take two inputs and produce an output. These are called binary operations, and are often used when solving math problems. Other types of operations are called unary operations, which take only one input and produce an output."
"There are more operations than these, including raising numbers to exponents, taking the root and applying the logarithm."
Below is a list of the most used operations.
List of mathematical operations.
Addition.
"Addition is the first arithmetic operation and hyperoperation. It is the inverse operation of subtraction. The terms in an addition are called ""addends"", and the result of an addition is called a ""sum""."
The symbol for addition is +
Examples of additions:
formula_1
formula_2
formula_3
formula_4
formula_5
"Any number plus zero is the same number (formula_6). This is called the ""additive identity""."
For example: formula_7
"Changing the order of the addends in an addition does not change its sum. This is called the ""commutative property of addition""."
For example: formula_8

Irtysh River
"The Irtysh River (; ; / ; , ""Twirl""; ) is a river in Siberia and Kazakhstan. It is the main tributary of the Ob River. The main tributary of the Irtysh is the Tobol River. The Ob-Irtysh forms a major drainage basin in Asia, and covers most of Western Siberia and the Altay Mountains."
"From its origins as the ""Kara-Irtysh"" (Vast Irtysh, kara means Vast in Turkic languages but also black. But in the context and geographic terms usually refers vast) in the Mongolian Altay mountains in Xinjiang, China, the Irtysh flows northwest through Lake Zaysan in Kazakhstan, meeting the Ishim and Tobol rivers before merging with the Ob near Khanty-Mansiysk in western Siberia, Russia after 4,248 kilometres (2,640 mi)."
"The name Black Irtysh (""Kara-Irtysh"" in Kazakh, or ""Cherny Irtysh"" in Russian) is applied by some authors, especially in Russia and Kazakhstan, to the upper course of the river, from its source entering Lake Zaysan. The term White Irtysh, in opposition to the Black Irtysh, was occasionally used in the past to refer to the Irtysh below lake Zaysan; now this usage is largely obsolete."
Main tributaries.
"The largest tributaries of the Irtysh are, from source to mouth:"
Interpretations of quantum mechanics
"In quantum mechanics, the mathematical formalism is very difficult to interpret physically. However, there are many ideas about the interpretations and meanings of quantum mechanics. There are no facts to prove any interpretation over the others, but there are some that are more accepted than others."
Background material.
"""Main article: Quantum mechanics"""
The main ideas of quantum mechanics are the postulates of Schrödinger and Heisenberg. The Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation that describes the wavefunction of an object. The equation can be given by
formula_1
"The basic meaning of this equation is that a particle, such as an electron, is not ""just"" a point-like particle, but also a type of wave. The philosophical implications will be explored shortly. Another fundamental of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This bizarre theory is the idea that the position and the momentum of an object cannot both be known. The greater the certainty of the ""position"" of an object, the less the certainty of the ""momentum"" of the object. The mathematical formulation of this is given by"
formula_2
This can further be generalized by stating that
Determiners.
"Determiners are words placed in front of a noun to make it clear what the noun refers to. The difference is each noun can only have one determiner and the determiner always comes before all the other parts of the noun phrase. The most common determiners in English are ""the"" and ""a/an""."
Adverbs.
"Adverbs are words that tell you about words that are not nouns. An adverb can describe a verb, like the word ""quickly"" in the sentence ""He ran quickly."" They can also describe an adjective. The adverb ""very"" describes the adjective ""sick"" in the sentence ""The boy is very sick."" Adverbs can even describe other adverbs, as in the sentence ""He ran very quickly."""
Prepositions.
"A preposition is a word that describes how one noun (or pronoun) relates to another in the sentence as a whole. The preposition usually comes before the noun that it adds to the sentence, which is called the object of the preposition. An example is the word ""over"" in the sentence ""he walked over the bridge."""
Conjunctions.
"A conjunction is a word that connects other parts of a sentence. It can connect two words that both do the same thing in a sentence. ""And"" in the sentence ""the boy and the girl run"" connects the boy to the girl because they both run. Conjunctions can even connect two clauses that would normally be different sentences together. The word ""but"" in the sentence ""I like cats, but he likes dogs"" is a conjunction doing this."
Interjections.
"Interjections are words that do not fit normal grammar rules. Interjections can and often do take the place of an entire sentence, as they can give they meaning of a whole sentence in a single word. These can be used to show emotions, such as the word ""Hooray,"" which means that the speaker is happy or likes something. They are also used to shorten common phrases that would otherwise need a full sentence to talk about. For example, saying the word ""yes"" is much simpler than saying ""what you say is true,"" so it is usually used instead. Interjections like these can be helpful for saving time and making complex sentences very simple. Often, though, interjections may have no meaning at all, such as the word ""um."""
Syntax.
"Grammar also studies how the parts of language work together. This is called ""syntax."" Some common ways in which the words fit together are sentences, phrases, clauses, and paragraphs."

"Edward is an English male given name. It is an old name, dating from before the Norman conquest of England in 1066. It means ""wealthy"" (rich) and ""guard"". ""Ted"", ""Teddy"", and ""Ned"" are often used as nicknames for people called Edward, such as Ted Kennedy, or Ned Kelly. There have been many kings of England called Edward, such as Edward the Confessor, and Edward VIII."
Holiday Inn
Holiday Inn is a brand of hotels. Holiday Inn is one of the world's most recognized hotel brands. It is part of the InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG).
"Kemmons Wilson had the idea for the business after a family road trip to Washington, D.C.. During the trip, he was disappointed by the quality of roadside motels at that time. Mr. Wilson partnered with Wallace E. Johnson to build the first four motels on roads entering Memphis, Tennessee. Eddie Bluestein was the architect who designed these first hotels."
Walter Kogler
"Walter Kogler (born 12 December 1967 in Wolfsberg, Carinthia) is a retired Austrian football defender and coach. At the moment he is coach of FC Wacker Innsbruck, which is playing in the Austrian Bundesliga."
Career.
"In his youth years he played for FC St. Michael and Wolfsberger AC. He start as professional player with SK Sturm Graz. His next club was Austria Wien, where he started also his team career. After one year in France with AS Cannes he came back to Austria, where he played for LASK Linz, Austria Salzburg and FC Kärnten."
After his professional career he became football coach starting in the football academy of FC Kärnten. His first team was SK St. Andrä in the Regionalliga (3rd level). After one year with DSV Leoben he went to FC Wacker Innsbruck. With this team he reached in 2010 the championship and was promoted to the Bundesliga.
"Walter Kogler played 28 matches for the Austrian team and scored one goal. He was member of the Austrian team for the FIFA World Cup 1998. As player he was 5 times Austrian Champion (with Austria Wien, Austria Salzburg and Wacker Innsbruck). In 17 years as professional he played 495 matches in the Austrian Bundesliga."

She competed on the third season of NXT but finished fourth overall. Even though she did not win NXT she was still given a contract with the WWE and debuted in her first match for the SmackDown brand on May 27, 2011 edition where she teamed with Kaitlyn in a losing effort against Alicia Fox and Tamina."
Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close (movie)
"Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close is an American drama movie released at Christmas 2011. It is based on the novel of the same name. It stars Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Viola Davis, John Goodman, Jeffrey Wright and Max von Sydow with Zoe Caldwell. It is an autistic child whose father is killed in the September 11 attacks. The movie's reviews were negative. It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for von Sydow."
Eye colour
"Eye color is a visible character caused by two factors: the pigmentation of the eye's iris, and way light is scattered as it hits the top layer of the iris."
"The human eye is different from its nearest relative, the chimpanzee eye. The eyes of chimps and also gorillas are entirely brown. Humans have the white to their eyes. This difference is thought to be significant. In the apes, individuals do not usually look directly at other members of the family, but all the same they keep a close watch on what is going on with the family group. They tend to look out of the corners of their eyes, as if to keep the glance secret. Perhaps to them a direct look is aggressive. Jane Goodall used to be careful and avoid looking directly at the gorilla families in the bush. She would sit at a distance, appearing to nibble at grass and leaves, while making occasional glances at the gorilla family."
Physical cause.
"In humans, the pigment of the iris varies from light brown to black. This depends on the amount of melanin in the iris. The appearance of blue, green and hazel eyes result from the Rayleigh scattering of light in the iris. A similar process accounts for the blueness of the sky. Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or fluid. Eye colour is an example of structural colour which varies according to the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-coloured eyes."
"The brightly coloured eyes of many birds, reptiles and insects is caused by other pigments, such as pteridines, purines, and carotenoids."
Genetics.
"The view that blue eye colour is a simple recessive trait is incorrect. Two main gene loci code for the eye pigment: ""OCA2"" and ""HERC2"". They sit next to each other on chromosome 15. Mutations (SNPs) to these genes account for much of the variation seen in eye colour. ""OCA2"" mutations close to the 5′ regulatory region explain most human eye-color variation. An intron in ""HERC2"" contains the promoter region for ""OCA2"", affecting its expression."
"There are about 15 other genes which have some effect on eye colour inheritance. This is an effect called epistasis, and is not unusual."
Iris (eye)
"The iris (plural: irides or irises) is a thin, circular structure in the eye. It controls the diameter and size of the pupils."
"Eye colour is the colour of the iris. In humans, the iris may look green, blue, brown, hazel (a combination of light brown, green and gold), grey, violet, or even pink. In response to the amount of light exiting the eye, muscles attached to the iris expand or contract the pupil. The larger the pupil, the more light can enter the eye and reach the retina."

Fleet Street
"Fleet Street is a road in central London. It used to be where newspapers were made, before they moved east to Wapping."
The street existed in the 14th century. It connected the City of London to Westminster. It takes its name from the River Fleet.
Lisa Blount
"Lisa Blount (July 1, 1957 - October 27, 2010) was an American television series and movie actress and producer who was in notable movies. She starred ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" (1982) and in the 2005 movie ""Chrystal"". Blount was born in Fayetteville, Arkansas. She died in Little Rock, Arkansas."
Aérospatiale SA-330 Puma
"The Aérospatiale SA-330 Puma is a transport helicopter designed and built in France. The design was first built by Sud Aviation, and later by Aérospatiale. It was also built by Westland Helicopter in the United Kingdom after an agreement between the two countries It first flew in April 1965. It is mainly used by Armée de l'Air, Royal Air Force, and some other air forces. It is also used by civilians."
SA-330 specifications.
"The Aérospatiale SA-330 Puma is 59.6½ feet (18.15 meters) long, 49.2½ feet (15.00 meters) diameter, and 16.10½ feet (5.14 meters) tall. A minimum mass that weighs 7,795 pounds (3,536 kg) and at the maximum mass that weighs 15,532 pounds (7,000 kg). It is powered by two Turbomeca Turmo engines driving a helicopter rotor with four blades."
This frog moves around at night but it does sometimes move during the day. It can climb trees but it spends most of its time on the ground.
The female frog lays 5 to 60 eggs at a time in bodies of water at least 4 inches deep. The eggs sometimes stick to twigs or other things underwater. The tadpoles are about 45 mm long. They are black or yellow-brown in color with a white or near-white belly.
Edible frog
"The edible frog (""Pelophylax"" kl. ""esculentus"") is a species of frogs. It lives in Europe. It is also known as water frog or green frog. However, green frog is usually given to the North American frog ""Lithobates clamitans"". The Edible frog is used as a food source to people in France."
Texas toad
"The Texas toad (""Bufo speciosus"") is a species of toads. They are very small only reaching three inches. They live in the United States in the state of Texas. But they are also found in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Mexico."
"French Cathedral, Berlin"
"(German for: French Cathedral) is the colloquial naming for the ""French Church of Friedrichstadt"" (, ) in Berlin on the Gendarmenmarkt across from the Deutscher Dom (""German Cathedral""), formerly a church of German-speaking congregants."
"The first parts of the actual ""French Church"" were built from 1701 to 1705 for the Huguenot (Calvinist) community. At that time, Huguenots made up about 25% of Berlin's population. The ""French Church"" was modelled after the destroyed Huguenot temple in Charenton-Saint-Maurice, France."
"In 1785 Carl von Gontard modified the church and built - wall to wall next to it - the domed tower, which - together with the French-speaking congregants - earned the church its naming. The domed tower is technically no part of the church, there is no access between church and tower, because both buildings have different owners. The tower, similar to that of Deutscher Dom, was simply built to give the Gendarmenmarkt a symmetric design."
The church is not a cathedral in the strict sense of the word because it has never been the seat of a bishop.
"The domed tower, which is a viewing platform open to visitors, provides a panoramic view of Berlin. A restaurant is located in the basement underneath the prayer hall. The tower also contains the Huguenot museum of Berlin."
Cane toad
"The cane toad (""Bufo marinus"") is a species of toad. They are also known as the giant neotropical toad and the marine toad."
"Cane toads are terrestrial amphibians. This means that they only go back to the water to lay their eggs. They live in Central America and South America. However, they have been introduced to Oceania and the Caribbean."
In Australia.
"Nearly 80 years ago, a group of 102 cane toads were sent to Queensland to catch sugar beetles."
"Cane-growers were concerned about the damage insect larvae were doing to crops. The insects were native to Australia, but bad for the valuable cane crops."
"The first cane toads were brought into Queensland by Reginald Mungomery, an entomologist. Before 1935, Australia had no toads. The entire continent, full of various frog species, had no toads. Tough and always moving into new areas, the cane toads started reproducing and expanding outwards every wet season. This ""invasion front"" moved around 10 km a year until the 1960s, when it began speeding up significantly."
"Cane toads are rapidly adapting to dry climates, a huge change from their origins in the South American rainforest. They have poison gland in their skin."
Their predators.
"In their native habitat, a number of fish and reptiles prey on the tadpoles and the adult toad."
"These include the broad-snouted caiman (""Caiman latirostris""), the banded cat-eyed snake (""Leptodeira annulata""), eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, the black rat (""Rattus rattus"") and the Asian water monitor (""Varanus salvator"")."
"They have far fewer predators in Australia but, as time passes, some of the local animals will adapt their behaviour. Already some Australian crows have learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their back. Opossums of the ""Didelphis"" genus likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, and therefore are able to kill them. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let its toxin kill the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad."
In popular culture.
"A cane toad is one of the non-human characters in Dave Barry's 1999 novel ""Big Trouble"" and in the 2002 movie based on the novel."
Parotoid gland
"The first pharaoh was Narmer, though he did not use the term. The Egyptians believed their pharaoh was the god Horus. Pharaohs had several wives but only one wife was queen."
Gilligan's Island
"Gilligan's Island is a 1964 American television series. The series is about seven people (two crew members and five tourists) who take a 3-hour sightseeing tour from a marina in Hawaii. This occurs on the boat, S.S. ""Minnow"". An unexpected storm sends the boat to an uncharted island. Now, the passengers of the boat have to live on the island and try to find a way home. Most of the episodes involved the characters trying to survive a problem or trying to contact help."
Diaper
A diaper (or nappy) is a piece of clothing. It is worn by those who cannot control their urine or feces.
Diapers can be made of cloth (usually cotton) that can be washed and used again. They can also be disposable (put in the garbage after they are used up). Disposable diapers are usually made of plastic or man-made (artificial) fibers and contain chemicals that are very absorbent.
Diapers that can be washed must be folded in intricate ways (like origami) before being put on. With the disposable you must constantly buy new ones.
"Viewed as unpleasant by some, diapers are mostly used by children from birth until the child has learned to use a toilet. They are also used by older people. There are adult diapers for people with medical problems."
"In the United Kingdom, Australia and several other countries, a diaper is called a nappy."
"Sometimes adults who do not have medical problems also wear diapers. This can be for different reasons. Sometimes it is because they have a profession where they cannot always get to a bathroom, like astronauts. Some adults wear diapers for fun. This is usually a form of sexual pleasure, or for emotional reasons. These people are often called ""diaper-lovers"" or ""adult-babies."" The scientific term for liking to wear diapers is ""Diaper Fetishists."""
Mork &amp; Mindy
"Mork and Mindy is an American television sitcom which ran from 1978 to 1982. It stars Robin Williams and Pam Dawber as the title characters. The series was made by Garry Marshall. Comedian Jonathan Winters has a recurring role in the series. ""Mork and Mindy"" is a spin-off from Marshall's other popular TV series, ""Happy Days"". The plot of the series is that alien named Mork from a planet called Ork who travels to Earth and becomes friends with a woman named Mindy in Boulder, Colorado."

American Samoa
"American Samoa (; , ; also ' or ') is a territory of the United States. It is part of the Samoan Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean."
"In 1899, Germany and the U.S. divided the Samoan group of islands. The U.S. got the smaller group of islands on the east side. These islands had a good harbor near the capital city, Pago Pago. The western islands were run by Germany and then by New Zealand and are now the independent country Samoa."
"Officially, American Samoa is an ""unorganized"" territory. This means that the U.S. Congress has not passed an Organic Act. But the people who live in American Samoa rule themselves. Their constitution became effective on July 1, 1967."
"The capital of American Samoa is Pago Pago, but the seat of government is Fagatogo."
Citizenship.
"People who are born in American Samoa are called U.S. nationals, not U.S. citizens. This means they have some of the same rights as citizens but not all of them. Unlike people who are not Americans at all, American Samoans can go to any other part of the United States they want and live there for as long as they want. But they are not allowed to vote, to be on juries in court, to run for office, or to hold any job that the employee has to be a citizen to hold. For contrast, someone born in Puerto Rico or Guam is a citizen, so if they move to a state, they are allowed to vote in that state and in all federal elections."
"Some American Samoans like that they are not American citizens and others do not. Some American Samoans say that being nationals and not citizens makes it easier for them to keep the fa'a Samoa, the Samoan way of life. In 2019, three American Samoans living in Utah sued the U.S. government to say they are citizens. The judge agreed with them. The judge said that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that anyone born in any part of the United States is a citizen, and that should mean American Samoans too. But the next day, he said they should not register to vote until after an appeal judge has seen the case."
"In 2016, the United States Supreme Court decided they did not want to look at a case about whether American Samoans are citizens."

Delft
"Delft is a city in the province South Holland in the Netherlands. It is about halfway between Rotterdam and The Hague. It is famous for its Delft Blue pottery and the Delft University of Technology. It is the place where the royal family, the kings and queens, are buried. It has about 94,000 inhabitants."
Things to see.
"Delft is a city with typical Dutch canals, churches and large canal houses. The largest church in Delft is the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church)."
Deventer
"Deventer is a municipality and city in the province of Overijssel, the Netherlands. About 101,000 people were living there in 2021. It lies both in Salland and IJsselvallei regions, alongside the eastern bank of the IJssel river."
Deventer was founded by Lebuinus around 768. He built a wooden church there.
"A Catholic community called the Brethren of the Common Life was founded by priest Geert Groote in this city late 14th century. This community was connected with a Catholic reform movement called the Devotio Moderna, which was largely based on Groote and founded the same time."

Freud Museum
"The Freud Museum was the home of Sigmund Freud and his family after they escaped the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938. It is at 20 Maresfield Gardens in Hampstead, London."
"After the death of Anna Freud, the youngest daughter, in 1982, the home became a museum. The centrepiece of the museum is Freud's study, preserved just as it was during his lifetime."
"There are two other Freud Museums, one in Vienna, and another in Příbor, the Czech Republic, in the house where Freud was born."
The study.
"The study and library were preserved by Anna Freud after her father's death. The bookshelf behind Freud's desk contains some of his favourite authors: not only Goethe and Shakespeare but also Heine, Multatuli and Anatole France. Freud acknowledged that poets and philosophers had gained insights into the unconscious which psychoanalysis sought to explain systematically."
"The room contains the original analytic couch brought from Berggasse 19. On this patients would recline comfortably while Freud, out of sight in the green tub chair, listened to their 'free association'. They were asked to say everything that came to mind without consciously sifting or selecting information. This method became a foundation upon which psychoanalysis was built."
Antiquities.
"The study is filled with antiquities from ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt and the Orient. There are some fine masks and carving from Africa. Freud visited many archaeological sites (though not Egypt). Most of the collection was got from dealers in Vienna."
"He confessed that his passion for collecting was second only to his addiction to cigars. The importance of the collection can be seen in Freud's use of archaeology as a metaphor for psychoanalysis. One example of this is Freud's explanation to a patient that conscious material 'wears away' while what is unconscious is relatively unchanging: ""I illustrated my remarks by pointing to the antique objects about my room. They were, in fact, I said, only objects found in a tomb, and their burial had been their preservation""."
The collection includes a portrait of Freud by Salvador Dalí.
Emu
"The emu (""Dromaius novaehollandiae"") is a large flightless bird. It is native to Australia. The emu is the tallest bird from Australia. It is also the second tallest bird in the world, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. The emu is also related to the cassowary which is slightly smaller but heavier. It should also be noted, as an odd fact, that the Emus won a war against Australia."
Other emus.
There were four separate groups of emus in 1788 when the European settlers arrived. The emus on the mainland of Australia and those on the island of Tasmania may have been different species.
"There were also two species of dwarf emu, ""Dromaius minor"", one living on King Island in Tasmania and the other on Kangaroo Island. They are examples of island dwarfism. The group on King Island became extinct in 1805, that on Kangaroo Island in 1827, and that in Tasmania in 1865."

Hematopoiesis
"Hematopoiesis (or haematopoiesis; sometimes also haemopoiesis) is the formation of blood cells. In a healthy adult person, about 1011–1012 new blood cells are produced daily to keep steady state levels in the blood circulation."
"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or hemocytoblasts are the stem cells that give rise to all the other blood cells. The process is called hematopoiesis.&lt;ref name=""Birbrair n/a–n/a""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are in the core (bone marrow) of most bones."
As a stem cell matures it undergoes changes in gene expression which limit the cell types it can become. It moves closer to a specific cell type (cellular differentiation). These changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of proteins on the surface of the cell. Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and limits its potential to become a different cell type.
HSC studies through much of the past half century have led to a much deeper understanding. More recent advances have resulted in the use of HSC transplants in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders.
Risks.
"Bulimia nervosa can cause many health problems. Because vomit has lots of acid in it, purging frequently can burn the person's mouth, throat, or teeth. One can lose nutrients or fluids in their body. Glands in one's throat and face may get larger and hurt. The immune system is weakened, as well as the possibility of muscle or heart problems."
Sometimes bulimia can cause difficulty breathing. This is because the acids that are in your mouth go to your lungs and damage the bronchioles. There is also feedback to the ego and a social stigma that may cause further psychological impact.
Statistics.
Most people who have bulimia are between the ages of 10 to 25. It is more common in females than it is in males. People who have had past trauma are more likely to be bulimic. People with obsessive compulsive disorder or perfectionism are also likely to have bulimia.
Turks and Caicos Islands
"The Turks and Caicos Islands are two groups of islands in the Caribbean Sea, near the Bahamas. The islands lie southeast of Mayaguana in the Bahamas island chain and north of the island of Hispaniola. Cockburn Town, the capital since 1766, is in the Grand Turk Island about east-southeast of Miami, United States."
The islands have a total land area of . and they are on a tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

"The government of Great Britain is also the ruler of the Turks and Caicos, but that ruler always acts through a governor. There are local elections for premier (similar to a president). Government offices are in the Grand Turk Island."
Geography.
"The two island groups are in the North Atlantic Ocean, southeast of the Bahamas, north of Hispaniola, at . The Caicos Islands are separated by the Caicos Passage from the closest Bahamian islands, Mayaguana and Great Inagua."
"The eight main islands and more than 299 smaller islands have a total land area of , consisting primarily of low, flat limestone with extensive marshes and mangrove swamps and of beach front. The weather is usually sunny and relatively dry, but hurricanes are frequent during summer. The islands have limited natural fresh water resources; private cisterns collect rainwater for drinking. The primary natural resources are spiny lobster, conch and other shellfish."

Total population by island 2001-2012
Language.
"The official language of the islands is English and the population also speaks Turks and Caicos Islands Creole which is similar to Bahamian Creole. Due to its close proximity to Cuba and Hispaniola, large Haitian Creole and Spanish-speaking communities have developed in the territory due to immigration from Creole-speaking Haiti and from Spanish-speaking Cuba and Dominican Republic."
Religion.

Sorption
"When two chemical substances come in contact with each other, through what is called a phase, they will interact with each other in that phase. They may also have an interface. If a substance accumulates within a phase this is called absorption, if the same process happens on the interface, it is called adsorption. In the year 1909, James William McBain introduced the word Sorption to describe such a process, in the case where it is not easy or meaningful to make a difference between absorption and adsorption."
"Examples of where the concept of sorption is important are measuring the pollution of the environment; using sorption it is possible to bind pollutants to small particles in the air (called aerosols), or in the soil (where they bind to colloids). Sorption makes these bindings possible. In much the same way, polluants can be transported over long distances."
Machines and processes that use sorption include the absorption refrigerator and solar air conditioning.

Materials science
Materials science studies the properties of matter to solve science and engineering problems. It uses applied physics and chemistry. Supersmall nanotechnology has got attention in recent years. There are many inventions of new material. Work on why structures fail or break down is very important to engineering.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Nintoku.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun"") at Sakai. Nintoku is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Irukandji jellyfish
"The Irukandji Jellyfish, ""Carukia barnesi"", is a species of jellyfish. It lives in the waters of northern Australia. It is a very deadly jellyfish. The Irukandji is only 2.5 centimeters (with bell and tentacles) in diameter. This makes it hard to find. The Irukandji is believed to be the most poisonous creature in the world. Some people are not sure if that is true."
"The Irukandjis' name comes from an Australian Aboriginal tribe. The tribe lived in the Palm Cove region of North Queensland. When the Irukandji people were stung by the Irukandji, there are many symptoms. This includes:"
"Sometimes, people may also get fluid on their lungs (pulmonary oedema), hypertension, and heart failure."
"The Irukandji has killed at least two swimmers in Australia. In 2002, Richard Jordon came to Australia as a tourist. He was a 58 year old British man. He was stung while swimming off Hamilton Island. Jordon died a few days later. There may have been more deaths which doctors did not know were caused by the jellyfish."
"The Irukandji is related to another jellyfish. This is the box jellyfish, ""Chironex Fleckeri"". Irukandji was identified in 1964 by a Cairns doctor, Jack Barnes. Because of this, its scientific name is named after him. When people were getting hurt in the sea, Barnes was sure it was because of a jellyfish. He put on diving equipment and lay on the sea floor for six days until he discovered it. When Barnes discovered the Irukandji jellyfish, he tested its sting on himself, his son, and a lifeguard. They all had to be taken to the hospital."
"Irukandji has stingers – not only on its tentacles, but also on its bell. It is very small and weak. Because of this, sudden force may kill it. So, it cannot be kept in a normal aquarium. The first Irukandji jellyfish in captivity was born in Townsville, Queensland."
Emperor Yūryaku
"was the 21st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Yūryaku to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Yūryaku""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
"According to the ""Kojiki"" and ""Nihonshoki"", Yūryaku was the fifth and youngest son of Emperor Ingyō."
He was the brother of Emperor Ankō.
"Yūryaku was followed on the throne by his son, who would come to be known as Emperor Seinei."
Events of Yūryaku's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Yūryaku's life and rule. Only limited facts can be studied before the rule of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"After Ankō's death, Yūryaku overcame others in the struggle for power. He became the new emperor."
Yūryaku is known as a patron of silk. It is said that he encouraged growing mulberry bushes for silkworms to eat.
"Poems that are said to be Yūryaku's are included in the ""Manyōshū"". A number of his verses are kept in the ""Kojiki"" and the ""Nihonshoki."""
He is credited with bringing many artisans from Korea to Japan.

"The radio, book, TV and movie versions differ from each other. The same basic plot is used but they sometimes contradict each other. This is due to Adams rewriting the story for each new medium."
"In all versions, the story follows the adventures of Arthur Dent. He is an Englishman. His house is being bulldozed to make way for a bypass. At the same time the Earth is being demolished by the Vogons to make way for an intergalactic bypass. The vogons are a race of unpleasant and bureaucratic aliens."
"Dent's friend, Ford Prefect, is an alien. He is a researcher for the eponymous guidebook. He rescues Dent from Earth's destruction."
"Zaphod Beeblebrox is Ford's eccentric semi-cousin. Beeblebrox is the Galactic President. He has stolen the ""Heart of Gold"", a spacecraft equipped with the Infinite Improbability Drive. The depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android and Trillian are crew members."
"Trillian was known as Tricia McMillan, a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington. Beeblebrox saved her from Earth's destruction. She is the only other human survivor."
"Arthur learns that the Earth was actually a giant supercomputer. It was created by another supercomputer, Deep Thought. Deep Thought had been built to give the answer to the ""Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"". It gave the answer as ""42"". The creators of Deep Thought were disappointed and Deep Thought was then instructed to design the Earth supercomputer to determine what the question actually is."
"The Earth was destroyed by the Vogons just before its calculations were due to complete. Arthur becomes the target of the descendants of the Deep Thought creators, believing his mind must hold the Question. With his friends' help, Arthur escapes and they decide to have lunch at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. They have more adventures."
Cookbook
"A cookbook, or cookery book, is kind of book that tells people how to prepare food for eating using specific instructions called a recipe. Most cookbooks also have tips on how to eat and present the food as well. They usually list the ingredients needed, time needed to cook, and the instructions. They may give other tips too."
Somalia
"Somalia (; ), officially called the Federal Republic of Somalia (; ), is a country located on the Horn of Africa. It used to be known as the Somali Republic."
"It is bordered by Djibouti to the northwest, Kenya with Yemen to the north, the Guardafui Channel and Somali Sea to the east, and Ethiopia to the west. A person from Somalia is called a ""Somali""."
Government.
Somalia is a republic governed by a federal administration with various regional administrations governing on a micro level.
"Somalia is an independent country. Since the Somali Civil War in the 1980s, there has been no working government that covers all of Somalia; instead, different pirates have been destabilizing the region to the southwest, the Gulf of Aden. Somalia is now trying to gain control of their people and get back up on its feet with very little resources."
Clan wars.
"There are four big tribes in Somalia, the Hawiye, the Dirweyn, the Koofur Orsi inhabitants and the Darood. Somalis are a nation of related families, which are called clans. Groups of clans sometimes band together based on a common ancestor or other blood relationship. Sometimes these family relationships date back hundreds or even thousands of years in the past."
"Somalis are mostly camel or goat herders, and depend on their livestock to live. In Somalia there are limited sources of drinking water and grazing land, and disputes over grazing rights, water rights, or land in general can lead to fighting between families. Because of the clan system, the families involved will call on their clan for help, leading to a clan war."
Tsukemono
"Tsukemono is a traditional Japanese food made by pickling vegetables in salt or brine for a few days to several decades. Tsukemono resembles western Pickled cucumbers, but are usually eaten with rice."
Oyaki
"Oyaki (おやき) is a Japanese dumpling made from fermented buckwheat dough wrapped around a stuffing of Japanese vegetables, fruit, or anko bean paste and then roasted on an iron pan. Oyaki are popular and widely available in Nagano Prefecture which is famous for the dish."
Goheimochi
"Goheimochi is a local cuisine made in the mountains in the Chūbu region of Japan. It started in the Edo period, when rice was very valuable. Pounded rice is wrapped around a thin wooden stick, then grilled with miso, sugar, and mirin. Soy sauce, sesame, and walnuts can also be used. It is particularly famous in Nagano Prefecture where it is shaped like dango or traditional Japanese straw sandals called ""waraji""."
Sekihan
"Sekihan () means “red rice”, and is a traditional Japanese food usually eaten on important days. It was originally brought from China during the Jōmon period and used red rice. In modern times, it is made by steaming sticky rice and red beans. It is typically served in a bowl or in bento. Local specialty ingredients are often added to make it sweeter, such as peanuts in Chiba Prefecture, nattō in Yamanashi Prefecture and Hiroshima Prefecture, and sweet beans in Nagano Prefecture."
"In 2012, an organization was founded to promote ""sekihan"" in Japan. It has declared November 23rd each year as ""Sekihan"" Day."
Punch (drink)
"Punch refers to many drinks made from fruit or fruit juice and sometimes alcohol. The drink was started in India, then was brought to the United Kingdom in the early 1600s. The drink spread to other countries. Punch is usually served at parties in large bowls known as ""punch bowls""."
Chirashizushi
"Chirashizushi (ちらし寿司, ""scattered sushi"", also referred to as ""barazushi"") is a traditional Japanese food made with rice mixed with vinegar. It has several ingredients on top, such as egg, bamboo shoots, seafood, and nori."
Gokabo
"Gokabo () is a Japanese sweet produced and sold in Saitama, especially Kumagaya city. It is one of the top three sweets in Saitama, along with Soka rice cake (""Senbei"") of Soka city and potato sweets (""Imogashi"") of Kawagoe city."
"They are manufactured by hand. A starch-like core is placed in a pan and wrapped with starch syrup. Then, soybean powder (""Kinako"") is placed on the surface. They can be made in different colors by using different-colored soybeans, such as blue soybeans. It was introduced 140 years ago and was sold at Tadenji Temple in Fudogaoka. It was sold under the name of ""5 rice bar"" during the Edo period. It is occasionally served in school meals for public elementary and junior high schools in modern times. It costs about 400 yen for twelve pieces."
Pitsunda
"Pitsunda or Bichvinta is a town in the ""Gagra district"" of the disputed territory of Abkhazia."
Narazuke
"Narazuke (ならづけ、奈良漬) is a type of traditional pickle that began in Nara Prefecture, Japan."
"It is a pickle made from fresh fruit or vegetables that are soaked in salt and sake-no-kasu. Sake-no-kasu is a kind of waste from making sake, so that sake itself is not used. Making good quality narazuke takes a very long time. Some certain expert say it take at least 3 to 4 years."
Sannzoku-yaki
"Sannzoku-yaki is a dish made of chicken, especially chicken thighs, from Nagano Prefecture, Japan. It is fried or baked, and served with cabbage."
"Something untrue is false. A half truth is something true mixed with something false, or something partly true with key information omitted."
"If the things one says are true, then they are speaking the truth, or speaking truly. Saying something that is untrue can be called a lie, if the person who is saying it knows it is untrue. A person who says something untrue is often called a ""liar""."
True and false in logic and philosophy.
"""True"" is also one of the two basic values of logic. The other such value is usually called ""false"". In symbols, ""true"" is written as, T or 1."
Aristotle was the first to put logic into a formal framework. His version is called propositional logic (see also syllogism and deductive reasoning). Other forms of logic use types of mathematics (mathematical logic) or symbols. Boolean algebra is about things being true and false.
The relationship between verbal claims and external reality is handled by epistemology and the philosophy of science.
Philosophers argue over what makes up truth and how to define and identify truth.
Zimbabwe
The Republic of Zimbabwe is a country in the southern part of the continent of Africa. Its capital city is Harare.
Geography.
"Zimbabwe is surrounded by other countries, and so it has no coast on the sea. This type of country is called ""landlocked"". The countries that surround Zimbabwe are Zambia, Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique."
"Zimbabwe is home to the famous waterfall, Victoria Falls, which are a feature of the river Zambezi and also the Great Zimbabwe, the ancient architectural monument from which the country was named after."
Vegetation (Fauna and Flora).
"The country is mostly savanna. In the east it is moist and mountainous with tropical evergreen and hardwood forests. Trees include teak and mahogany, knobthorn, msasa and baobab. Among the many flowers and shrubs are hibiscus, spider lily, leonotus, cassia, tree wisteria and dombeya."
"There are around 350 species of mammals in Zimbabwe. There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species."
History.
"The area that is now Zimbabwe was added to the British Empire around 1890. Zimbabwe is also known by its old name of Rhodesia. In 1965, it became an independent country when Prime Minister Ian Smith announced the Unilateral Declaration of Independence(U.D.I). The government was mostly controlled by the white population, similar to South Africa at the time. African citizens were given full equality in 1980, and the country's name was officially changed to Zimbabwe. Robert Mugabe led the country as the Prime Minister and President for 37 years. Though Mugabe was elected fairly at first, he became a dictator, and had put in place a number of cruel and disastrous laws. On November 21, 2017, Mugabe resigned as President of Zimbabwe."
Language.
"The country Zimbabwe has a mixture of languages; Shona, Ndebele, Venda, Manyika, Nyanja, Chagani, and a unique-unified Zimbabwean English."
Economy.
"Zimbabwe uses the currencies of several other countries. The government uses the United States dollar. The economy is currently in a bad situation. Foreign currency reserves are at very low levels, and the Zimbabwean Dollar has become very devalued. Just recently, three zeroes were taken off the Zimbabwean dollar (for example, $1,000,000 (one million dollars) would become $1000 (one thousand dollars)). Many observers link this to Mugabe's controversial Land Reform programme."
2017 coup d'état.
"On November 15, 2017, President Robert Mugabe was placed under house arrest as Zimbabwe's military took control in a coup. On November 21, 2017, Mugabe resigned the Presidency."
Provinces.
Zimbabwe is divided into 8 provinces and 2 cities that are the same as a province.
Cities.
The largest cities are:
Sports.
Football is the most popular sport in Zimbabwe. Rugby union and cricket are also popular. Zimbabwe has won eight Olympic medals.
Zimbabwe has also done well in the Commonwealth Games and All-Africa Games. Kirsty Coventry won 11 gold medals in swimming.
"Zimbabwe has also been at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis. Zimbabwe has also done well in golf. Other sports played in Zimbabwe are basketball, volleyball, netball, and water polo, as well as squash, motorsport, martial arts, chess, cycling, polocrosse, kayaking and horse racing. Most of these sports don't have international representatives but instead stay at a junior or national level."
"After ""Excitable Boy"" Warren Zevon published ""Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School"" in 1980. This album had the only other song recorded by Zevon that reached the Billboard Top 100: ""A Certain Girl."" ""A Certain Girl"" is a rhythm and blues song written by Allen Toussaint."
"This album was dedicated to Ken Millar, who calls himself ""Ross Macdonald."" Millar is a writer who writes mystery novels, and Zevon really liked Millar's stories. He met Millar in an intervention put together by the journalist Paul Nelson. For awhile this intervention helped Zevon not drink too much alcohol."
"Cancer, death and ""The Wind""."
"Warren Zevon did not like to go to the doctor, and never went to one when he was an adult. Before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and started to have a chronic cough. When Zevon told his dentist his problems, his dentist recommended seeing a doctor. When he finally visited one, the doctor diagnosed him with mesothelmia."
"Warren Zevon did not want to get treated for his cancer if it might keep him from making music. So instead he started to make his final album, titled ""The Wind"". He had a lot of friends who helped him make the album. These friends included Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Jackson Browne, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Dwight Yoakam, and others."
Papa John's Pizza
"Papa John's is the third largest pizza company based in the United States. Its headquarters are in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. It was founded by John Schnatter in 1984."
Shrew opossum
"The order Paucituberculata contains the six surviving species of shrew opossum. ""Caenolestes"" is the main genus, and the group as a whole may be called 'caenolestids'."
"They are small, shrew-like marsupials of the Andes mountains of South America."
"20 million years ago, there were at least seven genera in South America. Today, just three genera remain. They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the high Andes."
"Insectivores were absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago, and are present now only in the northwestern part of the continent. Shrew opossums have lost ground to the these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches. Nevertheless, the ranges of shrew opossums and insectivores overlap broadly."
"Shrew opossums are about the size of a small rat (9–14 cm long), with thin limbs, a long, pointed snout and a slender, hairy tail. They are largely carnivorous, being active hunters of insects, earthworms and small vertebrates. They have small eyes and poor sight, and hunt in the early evening and at night, using their hearing and long, sensitive whiskers to locate prey. They seem to spend much of their lives in underground burrows and on surface runways."
"Largely because of their rugged, inaccessible habitat, they are very poorly known. Recent studies suggest that they may be more common than had been thought."
Australidelphia
The Australidelphia is a superorder of Australasian marsupial mammals.
"It consists in five extant (living) orders, which contain most of the world's marsupials."
ÖFB Ladies Cup
"The ÖFB Ladies Cup is the Cup competition in Austrian women soccer. It was first played in the 1972/73 season under the guidance of the Vienna Football association as Ladies Cup. Since the 1992/93 season the Ladies cup is under the guidance of the ÖFB (Austrian Football Association) and is called ÖFB-Ladies-Cup. From 2004 till 2009 the competition was called ÖFB-Stiegl-Ladies-Cup, after the main sponsor of the cup, a brewery from Salzburg."
The Cup is played with 32 teams in five rounds. The ten members of the ÖFB-Frauenliga and 22 teams from the nine federal states take part. In the first round the teams were drawn after local aspects.
Lepidodendron
"Lepidodendron is an extinct genus of primitive (tree-like) plant. They were the first large land plants, and a major part of the coal forest tropical flora."
"They were huge, over , and the trunks were often over in diameter."
"Sometimes called 'giant club mosses', they are actually closer to the quillworts ""Isoetes"" than to clubmosses."
Ecology.
They thrived during the Pennsylvanian sub-period of the Carboniferous 315–300 million years years ago.
The conditions were tropical swamps and rain forests of a huge river system much larger that the Amazon basin.
"Joe Hart (May 8, 1944 – September 11, 2022) was an American Republican politician. He was the 11th State Mine Inspector of Arizona from 2007 to 2021. He also was a member of the Arizona House of Representatives representing Arizona's 2nd Legislative District from 1992 to 2001. Hart was born in Kingman, Arizona."
"Hart died on September 11, 2022 at the age of 78."
Discourses on Livy
"The Discourses on Livy, also Discourses or Discorsi, was written around 1517 and published in 1531 by Niccolò Machiavelli."
It is a discussion about the history of early Ancient Rome. Although it strays very far from this and also uses modern political examples to illustrate points. Machiavelli presents it as a series of lessons on how a republic should be started and structured.
"While it more openly explains the advantages of republics, it also has many similar themes from his other works. For example, Machiavelli said that to save a republic from corruption, it is needed to return it to a ""kingly state"" using violent means. He excuses Romulus for killing his brother Remus and co-ruler Titus Tatius to gain absolute power for himself in that he made a ""civil way of life"". Commentators disagree about how much the two works agree with each other, as Machiavelli often refers to leaders of republics as ""princes"". Machiavelli even sometimes acts as an advisor to tyrants. Other scholars have pointed out the power-hungry and imperialistic features of Machiavelli's republic. Nevertheless, it became one of the central texts of modern republicanism."
Product rule
"In differential calculus, the product rule is a rule that helps calculate derivates that have multiplication."
formula_1
formula_2.
Steps.
Say we have the function formula_3.
The two functions being multiplied are formula_4 and formula_5.
We can set
formula_6 and
formula_7.
The rule needs us to find the derivative of both formula_8 and formula_9.
"We can find formula_10 by first using the sum rule to split formula_8 into formula_12 and formula_13. After using the power rule, we have formula_14."
"To find formula_15, we need to find the derivative of formula_5, which is formula_17, meaning formula_18."
"Now we can substitute the values into the equation,"
formula_19.
Proof.
One definition of a derivative is
"formula_20, and we're trying to find the derivative of formula_21, so we can first set formula_22 to formula_21."
formula_24
We can't really do much with this so we need to manipulate the equation.
formula_25
"The formula_26 part is equal to formula_27, meaning it didn't change the value of the equation. Now we can factor,"
"formula_28, and because formula_29 approaches formula_27, formula_31 is equal to formula_32."
"formula_33, and formula_34 and formula_35 are just equal to formula_15and formula_37."
"Experts say ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" was an example of the way Copland changed the kind of music he wrote during the 1940s. He began writing music that was more easily understood and more popular. Copland wrote about this in 1941 in his book, ""Our New Music""."
He wrote that the radio and record player was helping people who had never listened to music before to enjoy music. He said that there was no reason to continue writing music as if these things had not been invented. So he decided to write music in a simpler way.
His interest and activities beyond music.
"Copland spread his ideas about music in other ways. He taught at the New School for Social Research in New York City and at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. One of the many awards he received was the Pulitzer Prize. He won it in 1945 for his famous music for a ballet called ""Appalachian Spring."" It is one of his most popular works. The last part of the ballet is based on a traditional song, ""A Gift to be Simple""."
"Copland also wrote music for several major movies. He won an Academy Award in 1950 for composing the music for the movie ""The Heiress"". Then he began experimenting with what is called the twelve-tone system. His music was no longer as easy to understand, nor as popular."
"Copland stopped composing at the end of the 1960s. Yet he continued to be active as a conductor and speaker. In 1982, Queens College of the City University of New York established the Aaron Copland School of Music."
"Copland was a strong supporter of liberal ideas. In the early 1950s, he and other famous writers, actors and intellectuals were accused of supporting communism. Public opinion changed, though. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is America's highest award to civilians. Aaron Copland died in 1990 at the age of 90. But his music lives on."

464 BC
464 BC is a year in the pre-Julian Roman calendar. It was at the time known as year 290.
Diphthong
"A diphthong (pronounced ""DIF-thong"" or ""DIP-thong"") is a vowel where the speaker has to move their mouth into two different positions to make. It is a vowel where two different vowel qualities can be heard. Examples are:"
"waist, die, noise, road, house, fierce, bear, sure. Each of these is a different vowel sound."
"A monophthong is a simple vowel sound that a person does not have to move his or her mouth to make, like the ""oo"" sound in ""book."" In a diphthong, the person combines two different monophthongs, as with the ""oi"" sound in the word ""oil"". The speaker starts with the mouth in the position to make an ""o"" sound, then quickly moves the mouth to make a hard ""e"" sound. Another example is the ""ou"" sound in the word ""house"". The mouth starts out making a sound like the soft ""a"" sound in ""flat"", then moves to make the a hard ""oo"" sound like the one in ""caboose""."
"Just like with every other part of language, the exact way to pronounce a diphthong is a little different for different accents."
"The word diphthong is derived from the old Greek language. Here, ""di"" means ""two"" or ""double"", while the part ""-phthong"" means ""sound"" or ""tone"", from the basic word ""phthalein"", which means ""speak"", ""creating sound by the voice""."
"A diphthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it may be one syllable, but rarely."
The Price is Right
"The Price is Right is a USA game show on CBS. The current version started in 1972, and was hosted by Bob Barker for a long time. However, in 2006, Bob Barker announced that he would leave the show. His last episode aired in June 2007. Comedian Drew Carey is now the host; his first episode aired in October 2007."
"In this game, a person uses his shopping skills to correctly guess the price of different products, like in a market. Some products are simple household items, like toothpaste and vitamins. Other items are more expensive products, like furniture and cars. After the third and sixth games, the ""Showcase Showdown"" is played. The three players who got on stage in both halves of the show spin a wheel. They get two spins of the wheel. They have to be closest to $1.00 without going over. The person with the highest total moves on to the Showcase at the end of the show. If a player gets $1.00, they win $1,000 and get another spin. If they hit the $1.00 space on that spin, they win another $25,000. If they hit the 5¢ or 15¢ space, they win another $10,000. In the Showcase, the winners of the two Showcase Showdown games are shown prize packages. They make a bid on them, and whoever comes closest to the price of their showcase without going over wins it. If they are $250 or less from the price of their showcase, they win both showcases. If someone's bid was higher than the price of the real price, that person went over, and was disqualified from winning in that round."
"From 1956 - 1963, the show aired on NBC and was hosted by Bill Cullen. From 1963 - 1965, the show aired on ABC and was also hosted by Bill Cullen."
"Three nighttime syndicated versions of the show aired. The first one aired from 1972 to 1980. Until 1977, it was hosted by Dennis James. For the rest of its run, it was hosted by Bob Barker. From 1985 - 1986, another nighttime version of the show, named ""The Nighttime Price Is Right"", was made and was hosted by Tom Kennedy. A third nighttime version, ""The New Price Is Right"", was made from 1994 - 1995 and was hosted by Doug Davidson. Also special million dollar prime-time episodes where people could play different versions of games for $1,000,000 were made due to CBS shows being canceled."
Monophthong
"A monophthong (pronounced ""Mono-F-thong"") is simply a vowel. The word monophthong comes from the old Greek language. ""Mono"" means ""one"" or ""single"", and the ""-phthong"" means ""sound"" or ""tone"", from the basic word ""phthalein"", which means ""to speak"", ""create sound with the voice"". The word monophthong shows that a vowel is spoken with exactly one tone and one mouth position. For example, when you say ""teeth"", then while you are creating the sound of the ""ee"", nothing changes for that sound."
A monophthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it can as well be a syllable. There is no shorter syllable than a single monophthong.
Kalua
"Kalua is a Hawaiian cooking method. The word ""kalua"" means ""to cook in an underground oven"" in Hawaiian. The oven is a hole in the ground called an imu. Kalua is most often used to cook pig. Kalua pig is a popular food at luaus."
"One important change in the Victorian era was the making of the sewage system in London. In 1829 photography was invented. Gas lighting was important too. Streetlights became common first, followed by lights in public buildings and home. In the 1880s people began making power stations and distribution systems to feed the new electric lightbulbs."
Economic changes.
"Britain began ruling its trading colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The British Empire now extended all over the world. It used new technologies like the railways and electric telegraph to communicate across these regions. Many British citizens moved to the colonies to make their fortune."
"Industrialisation brought with it a rapidly growing middle class. They were not aristocrats and landowners, but on the other hand they were not unskilled workers. They were the people who created, managed and ran the new industrial factories."
Social changes.
"In the Victorian era, the middle class people owned their own houses. The family home often included three generations. The concept of ""privacy"" became a mark of the middle class life. What went on in those homes was the themes of many mid-century novelists."
"The printing press became faster in the nineteenth century and paper was cheaper too. The ""taxes on knowledge"" on newspapers and printed advertisements were lifted. This made magazines and newspapers cheaper. The government tried to improve literacy rates by starting schools for the poor. More books were written for, and read by, the newly educated middle classes."
Entertainment.
"More theatres opened in London. Orchestras and symphonies played, and operas were widely attended. Gambling at cards and new casinos became popular during the period. In the middle of the 19th century saw The Great Exhibition of 1851, the first World's Fair, and showed the greatest creations of the century."
De-Stalinization
De-Stalinization is the way that the Soviet Union tried to undo Joseph Stalin's politics and the heroic image he created of himself using propaganda.
"After Stalin died, a group led the Soviet Union for a while. Georgi Malenkov was the Premier of the Soviet Union; Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Ministry of the Interior; and Nikita Khrushchev was First Secretary of the Central Committee."
"Because Stalin had so prominent a control over the Soviet Union, he was placed on a pedestal both at home and among communists abroad. In the years 1953–1955, a period of ""silent de-Stalinization"" took place, as the revision of Stalin's policies was done in secret, and often with no explanation."
Revisionism.
"In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev became the leader of the Soviet Union. He attempted to reform the Soviet government and change how socialism in the country should be ran. In order to do this, he had to change the way the public thought of Stalin, this is called revisionism. He removed Stalin's corpse out of the mausoleum in Red Square and he changed the name of Stalingrad (which was named after Stalin) to Volgograd. Some people disliked Khrushchev’s reform and those who oppose revisionism are called anti-revisionist."
Pomelo
"The Pomelo (""Citrus maxima"" or ""Citrus grandis""), is a citrus fruit from South East Asia. It is pale green or yellow when ripe. Its flesh is sweet and white. The rind is very thick and spongy. It is the largest citrus fruit, usually in diameter. It weighs ."
Other names for the pomelo are pummelo and pommelo.

The Tsar's Bride
"The Tsar's Bride (""Tsarskaya nevesta"" in Russian) is an opera by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. It was the tenth opera the composer wrote. The words (libretto) were written by Il’ya Tyumenev who based the story on a book called “The Tsar’s Bride"" by Lev Mei. The opera was composed in 1898. The first performance took place in 1899 at the Moscow theater of the Private Opera of S.I. Mamontov."
The story of the opera.
"The story is supposed to take place in the autumn of 1572 in Moscow. At this time Russia was ruled by a very cruel tsar called Ivan the Terrible. Tsar Ivan had a group of people who guarded him. They were called oprichniki. The oprichniki were like bodyguards, but they were told to kill anybody who was not loyal to the tsar, so they behaved like terrorists, killing, raping and stealing wherever they went. In the opera there are also “Boyars”. A Boyar was a nobleman."
Act 1: The Feast.
"Griaznoy is an oprichnik. Although he already has a lover, Lubasha, he now decides he loves Marfa, the daughter of the merchant Sobakin. Marfa is already engaged to be married to Lykov, a boyar. There is much merrymaking and singing at a feast. Then Griaznoy asks to be left alone with Bomelius, the tsar’s doctor. He asks him to get him a love potion. Lubasha, who is hiding, hears what he says and realizes that he does not love her any more. When the doctor goes, Griaznoy is horrible to Lubasha and tells her to go. She now wants to talk to Bomelius."
Act 2: The Love Potion.
"A lot of people are coming out of church. They talk about the autumn weather, but when the oprichniki appear they are very frightened and start talking about whom the tsar is going to choose for his bride . Marfa talks to her friend Duniasha about how she has loved Lykov ever since they were children. Tsar Ivan passes by. She does not recognize him, but she is very frightened at the way the Tsar is staring at her. Sobakin comes in with Lykov and the four of them sing about looking forward to the wedding."
Lyubasha now goes to Bomelius and asks for another magic potion which she wants to give to Griaznoi to stop him loving Marfa. Bomelius says he will give her the potion if she will make love to him. Lyubasha agrees and goes inside with him.
Act 3: At the wedding.
At the wedding celebrations Sobakin tells Lykov that he will have to wait before his marriage to Marfa can be confirmed. The Tsar himself is looking for a girl to marry and has asked to see Sobakin’s daughters. Griaznoy realizes he needs to use the love potion quickly so he asks to be invited to the wedding. At the celebration he puts the potion in Marfa’s drink. A messenger comes with the news that the Tsar has chosen Marfa to be his wife. Everyone is horrified and Sobakin collapses.
Act 4: The Bride.
"Sobakin is at the Tsar's palace. He is proud because his daughter is now the Tsarevna (the Tsar’s wife) and he himself has been made a Boyar. But he is also worried because Marfa has become very ill. Griaznoy comes in and greets Sobakin (who are now both boyars). He says that the person who poisoned Marfa has confessed. Marfa rushes in and tells Griaznoi to speak. He says that Lykov was tortured and then confessed to having poisoned Marfa. Lykov was then executed by Griaznoi himself. Marfa goes mad when she hears this. In her madness she thinks Griaznoy is Lykov. This eventually makes Griaznoy confess that he himself at put the potion into her drink. He did not realize it was poisonous. Lyubasha then confesses that she had put her potion in the place of Griaznoi’s potion. She blames Griaznoy and invites him to kill her. He kills her, then he is taken to prison to be executed. As he is taken away, Marfa, in her madness, once again mistakes Griaznoy for Lykov. She invites him to return the next day to visit her. Then she dies."
Bubble sort
"Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It is simple to understand, so it is usually taught to new students. It is not as efficient as some other sorting algorithms."
"Bubble sort's name comes from the fact that each item in the list “bubbles” up to where it should go, like bubbles in water."
Algorithm.
"The algorithm compares pairs of elements in a list. The elements the make up the pairs are next to each other. Starting at one end of the list, the two elements in each pair are compared to each other in order. That means for example, the first and second element are compared, then the second and third element, and then the third and fourth, and so on. If the elements in the current pair are out of order, then the two elements switch places. This process – of comparing two elements – is done over and over again, until the whole list is sorted. The list is sorted, when there are no more pairs that have to be swapped."
"In the best case scenario, where the list was already sorted before running the algorithm, the algorithm's complexity is O(n) (Big O notation). In the worst case, where the list starts off as being sorted in reverse, O(n²)."
Implementation.
"In an imperative programming language, bubble sort can be implemented by using a flag variable and looping through the array's elements:"
"Alternatively, since the greatest value ascends to the highest index within the first iteration and then has reached its final ""right"" position, two for-loops nested into one another sort the vector, too:"
for top ≔ high(vector)−1 downto low(vector) do
for current ≔ low(vector) to top do
if vector[current] &gt; vector[current+1] then
"exchange(vector, current, current+1)"
Maundy Thursday
"Maundy Thursday, also known as Holy Thursday, Covenant Thursday, Great &amp; Holy Thursday, and Thursday of Mysteries, is the Christian feast or holy day falling on the Thursday before Easter that commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with the Twelve Apostles as described in the Canonical gospels. It is the fifth day of Holy Week, and is preceded by Holy Wednesday and followed by Good Friday."
Brazing
Brazing is a metal-joining process. Two or more metal items are joined together by melting and flowing a filler metal into the joint. The filler metal has a lower melting point than the adjoining metal.
Brazing differs from welding because it does not melt the work pieces. Brazing differs from soldering because it uses a higher temperature and more closely fitted parts than soldering.
"During the brazing process, the filler metal flows into the gap between close-fitting parts by capillary action."
"The filler metal is brought slightly above its melting temperature. while protected by a suitable atmosphere, usually a flux. It then flows over the base metal and joins the work pieces together. A big advantage of brazing is it can join the same or different metals with considerable strength."
Sequoia
Sequoia or Sequoyah may refer to:
Balsamic vinegar
"Balsamic vinegar is made from grapes. The name is derived from a Hebrew word meaning ""spicy."" The condiment is very strong, so it is applied to food usually in a small amount. It can be used to dress fresh fruit, salads, and meat dishes."
Norm Ferguson (animator)
"William Norman Ferguson (September 2, 1902 - November 4, 1957) is an American animator for Walt Disney Studios."
Failed state
"A failed state is a political body, usually a state, that can no longer work as it should. There are different definitions, but in general at least one of the following is true:"
"In such a state, there often is widespread corruption and there may be civil war (where different factions fight for control)."
"Examples of failed states are Yemen,or Somalia."
Brenda Chapman

Personal life.
Chapman was married to director Kevin Lima and had a daughter Emma Rose Lima.
Palace Maffezzoli (Milan)
"The The Palace Maffezzoli or Palazzo Maffezzoli is a palace in Via Anelli 15, Milano, Italy, designed by Guido Maffezzoli"
"adjacent to and in support of an existing masterpiece Palazzo Galmanini Portaluppi of 1953, and Palace Tre Torri of 1957, in the historic center of Milan inside the luxurious Quadronno District, which collects the open-air masterpieces of numerous archistars of the fifties."
Description.
"The building, belonging to the rationalist movement, is linked to the idea of ​​a forest in the city connected to the Vertical Forest of Via Crivelli, with a Canadian ivy that completely covers it."
Carolina parakeet
The Carolina parakeet is an extinct species of parrot.
"It was the last parrot type to have lived before the European conquest in the eastern United States. It was found from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf of Mexico, and lived in old woods along rivers."
"The last wild Carolina parakeet was killed in Okeechobee County in Florida in 1904, and the last bird kept by people died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918. This was the male bird called ""Incas"", who died within a year of his mate ""Lady Jane"". It was not until 1939, however, that it was agreed that all the Carolina parakeets had died."
"At some date between 1937 and 1955, three parakeets looking like this sort of bird were seen and recorded on videotape in the Okefenokee Swamp of Georgia. However, the American Ornithologists Union thought that they had probably recorded escaped pets. Additional sightings were recorded in Okeechobee County in Florida until the end of the 1920s."
Reasons for extinction.
"The Carolina parakeet died out for a number of reasons. To make space for more farms, large areas of forest were cut down, taking away its living space. The colorful feathers (green body, yellow head, and red around the bill) were in demand as decorations in ladies' hats, and the birds were kept as pets. Even though the birds were bred easily in captivity, little was done to make sure enough birds were bred to avoid their dying out. Finally, they were killed in large numbers because farmers thought they were pests."
"Another reason that led to their extinction was that, unfortunately, they liked to return in large flocks to places where some of them had just been killed. This led to even more being shot by hunters as they gathered about the wounded and dead members of the flock."
Match Game
"Match Game was a game show that ran from 1962 to 1999. Hosted Premierie on 1973 Present CBS GSN &amp; More Premierie June 26 2016 on ABC During $100,000 Pyramid Match Game The Hollywood Squares (1983) Like The Price is Right in Wheel of Fortune October 31 1983 on 1962-2016 Present Finale Until of 1979 in 1980-1982 in 1990 Theme in 1960s-2010s Like Pyramid"
Contestant Competition.
"First the challenging contestant would pick a question, A or B. Host Gene Rayburn would read it to the contestant. Then the contestant and the six celebrities would write their answer to the question on a piece of paper. Then after the contestant and the celebrities got done with their answer, Gene would ask for the contestant's answer. They would tell it to him. Then he would ask the celebrities for their answers. If the contestant's and a celebrity's answer are the same the contestant would get a point, and a green triangle would light up."
"Then the defending contestant would take the remaining question. Then the process was the same as above, except red circles lit up."
Whoever had the most points at after two rounds of the above procedures would win $100 and go on to the Big Money Super Match.
Big Money Super Match.
Audience Match.
"Before the game show, the audience would be surveyed. Their top 3 answers to the question (e.g. Road ___) would be worth (3rd most popular) $100, (2nd most popular) $250, and (most popular) $500. The contestant would pick 3 celebrities to give them answers they thought would be under the $500 slot. Then the contestant would choose one of those answers or make up their own. The answers were revealed one at a time."
Head-to-Head Match.
"If the contestant won the Audience Match, they would get a chance to win 10 times that money. They had to match a celebrity's answer exactly to questions like ____ Bee. At first, the contestant chose the celebrity they wanted to play with. In 1978, the Star Wheel was introduced. The contestant spun a wheel to determine which celebrity they would be playing with. If the wheel stopped on a gold star section, the money the contestant would be playing for was doubled."
Other versions.
"The first ""Match Game"" had different rules from this one and was shown on the NBC network starting in 1962 and ending in 1969. Then, this ""Match Game"" was introduced on the CBS network in 1973. That version ended in 1979. In 1975, a syndicated version titled ""Match Game PM"" started. It had three rounds of gameplay, and two Audience Matches in the Big Money Super Match. It ended in 1981. A second syndicated version with the same gameplay as ""Match Game PM"" started in 1979, and ended in 1982. In 1983, it was combined with another game show, ""Hollywood Squares"", to form the ""Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour"", which was on television for one year. Six years later, in 1990, it was brought back for the ABC network with a new host, Ross Shafer. In this version, contestants played for cash. It also featured a new round called the ""Match Up"" round. It was played at the end of both rounds. To start, a contestant chose one of the celebrities. The contestant had 30 seconds (45 in the second round) to match the celebrity in Super Match-style questions. Each question had two choices. Matches were worth $50 in the first round and $100 in the second. This version ended in 1991, but in 1998 it returned with Michael Burger as host. It featured five celebrities instead of six. This version was not very famous, however, and ended in 1999."
Melanesia
Melanesia is a region of islands in Oceania.
"It stretches from the western side of the Eastern Pacific Ocean, to the Arafura Sea, northeast of Australia. Its name was invented in 1832 and means ""black islands""."
The following islands and groups of islands since the 19th century have been considered part of Melanesia:
Islands whose long-established inhabitants are of mixed ancestry and do not necessarily self-identify as Melanesian:
"Some of the islands to the west of New Guinea such as Halmahera, Alor, and Pantar can also be considered part of Melanesia, although people in this area do not make use of the term."
Diaphragm
The diaphragm is a muscle that is at the bottom of the ribcage of mammals.
"The first period of Japan's history is its prehistory, before the written history of Japan. Archeologists have found pottery from that time. Japan’s Paleolithic era covers a period from around 100,000 BC to around 12,000 BC. Archeologists have found some polished tools made of stones. Some of them are kept in Tokyo National Museum. These tools are more than 32,000 years old."
Jomon Period.
"The Jomon period lasted for about 10,000 years, from 10,000 BC to around 300 BC. This was the Mesolithic era for Japan. Some scholars say that during this period, Neolithic culture also developed in Japan."
Archeologists have found several pieces of pottery of that time. Some are clay figures and some are vessels and potteries of different shapes.
Yayoi Period.
"The Yayoi period covered about 550 years, from around 300 BC till around 250. The period's name came from a location in Tokyo."
"By that time, Japanese people had learnt the cultivation of rice, and agriculture became the main part of the Japanese society. Because of this, differences in social status started to occur."
"Different clans controlled different areas and they also fought among themselves. Some Chinese texts tell about this time. These texts describe Japan as Wa. Later, the Yamatai came into being when about 30 smaller parts of Japan of that time united under a queen named Himiko."
Ancient and Classical Japan.
"The Ancient and Classical period covers about 900 years, beginning from the mid-3rd century till the end of the 12th century. Japanese history during this period may further be divided into several smaller periods. These are described below."
Kofun period.
"In the history of Japan, the period from the mid-3rd century until the mid-6th century is known as the Kofun period."
"Kofun is a large tomb made at this era, and people who had social power were buried. Buddhism had not reached Japan by this time. Many kofuns were made in many places. This fact lets us to know that many social groups all around the country made up an authority, and this leads to the Yamato dynasty."
"The Yamato dynasty started to have take more action against Korea and China. In the 4th century, they started to advance to Korea to get iron. By this, cultures and technologies of Korea and China started to be introduced to Japan. They also fought with Goguryeo and Silla, which are countries in Korea. In the 5th century, the five kings of Wa made effort to have relationship with China."
Asuka period.
The second period is called the Asuka period (mid-6th century till around 710). Asuka is the place where the base of Yamato dynasty took place. By this time Buddhism had reached Japan.
"From the end of the 6th century to the early 7th century, Empress Suiko and her nephew Prince Shotoku innovated the political system so that the emperor gets power. They also sent missions to the Sui dynasty."
"The trend of centralization still continues. In 645, the Taika Reforms takes place, and the political system changes a lot."
"In 663, the nation fights with the Tang dynasty and Silla (Battle of Baekgang), but loses."
"In 672, the Jinshin war occurs and Prince Ōama becomes the emperor (Emperor:Tenno天皇). In his era, Japan starts to make a Chinese style law system (Ritsuryo). Also, the word , which means ""Japan"" in Japanese, was started to be used in the era of Tenmu."
Nara Period.
"During this period, from the year 707, steps were taken to shift the capital to Heijō-kyō, a place near present-day Nara. This was completed in 710. A new city was built. The city was built to look like the Chinese capital city of that time. At that time, the Tang Dynasty was ruling China, and the capital was at Chang'an (now Xi'an)."
"During the Nara period, development was slow. The Emperor’s family members were always fighting for power with the Buddhists and other groups. At that time, Japan had friendly relations with Korea and China’s Tang Dynasty. The capital was shifted twice. In 784, the capital was moved to Nagaoka and in 794 to Kyoto."
Heian Period.
"The years from 794 to 1185 are known as the . This grouping of years is named after city of Heian-kyō, which is the early name of present-day Kyoto. The Heian period produced many cultural achievements, such as the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu."
"The power of the Japanese imperial court (that is, the Emperor, his ministers and other important persons) rose. This period is also famous for its art, poetry and literature. Japanese culture also became Japanese way.The language used in this period was called Late Old Japanese. The writing systems known as Kana emerged at this time. By the end of this period (that is, by the end of the 12th century), a number of groups came into being. These groups were highly armed and they fought among themselves. The situation was like a civil war, that is, war among different sections of society. Finally, groups of people called Samurai led society under the political rule of a Shogun. The Heian Period ended due to the Genpei War."
Feudal Japan.
"The period from around the 12th century through the 19th century is called feudal period in the history of Japan. The Japanese Emperor was the head of the government, but he had no real power. Many powerful families (called daimyo and military groups called shogun) ruled Japan during this period. The feudal period of Japan is generally sub-divided into different periods named after the shogunate which ruled during that period."
Kamakura Period.
"The years 1185 to 1333 are known as the . This grouping of years is named after city of Kamakura which was the center of power of the Kamakura shogunate. Minamoto no Yoritomo was the founder and first shogun of the Kamakura shogunate. The period is named after the government of Kamakura Shogunate. In this period, Mongols tried to invade Japan between the years 1272 and 1281. Japanese were successful at driving away the Mongols. But, this badly affected Japan. Shogunate also became weak and its rule ended in 1333. For a short time, Go Daigo became the emperor of Japan."
Muromachi Period.
The Muromachi Period began in 1336 and ended in 1573. Emperor Go-Daigo lost his throne. The government of the Ashikaga shogunate took control of most parts of Japan. This period ended in 1573. In that year the 15th and the last shogun named Ashikaga Yoshiaki was forced to leave the capital Kyōto.
"Linacre College is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. It was founded in 1962, and was the third graduate-only college at the University. It was the first graduate college founded at Oxford to admit both male and female students."
Botanical name
"A botanical name is a formal scientific name which follows the ""International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants"" (ICN). If it concerns a plant cultigen, the additional cultivar term must follow the ""International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants""."
"The code of nomenclature covers ""all organisms traditionally treated as plants, whether fossil or non-fossil, e.g. blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria); fungi, including chytrids, oomycetes, and slime moulds; photosynthetic protists and taxonomically related non-photosynthetic groups""."
"The purpose of a formal name is to have a single name which is accepted and used worldwide for a particular plant or plant group. For example, the botanical name ""Bellis perennis"" was given to a plant species which is native to most of the countries of Europe and the Middle East, where it has various names in many languages. Later it has been introduced worldwide, bringing it into contact with more languages."
"Some English names for this plant species are: daisy, English daisy, lawndaisy. In other languages, some examples are: , , , ."
"The cultivar ""Bellis perennis"" 'Aucubifolia' is a golden-variegated horticultural selection of this species."
Parts in a name.
"Depending on rank, botanical names may be in one part (genus and above), two parts (species and above, but below the rank of genus) or three parts (below the rank of species):"
"A name in three parts, i.e., an infraspecific name (a name for a taxon below the rank of species), needs a ""connecting term"" to indicate rank. In the ""Calystegia"" example above, this is ""subsp."" (for subspecies). In botany there are many ranks below that of species (in zoology there is only one such rank, subspecies, so that this ""connecting term"" is unnecessary there). A name of a ""subdivision of a genus"" also needs a connecting term (in the ""Acacia"" example above, this is ""subg."", subgenus). The connecting term is not part of the name itself."
Binary name.
"For botanical nomenclature, the ""ICBN"" prescribes a two-part name or binary name for any taxon below the rank of genus down to, and including the rank of species. Taxa below the rank of species get a three part name."
A binary name consists of the name of a genus and an epithet.
Jean Kent
"Jean Kent (Joan Mildred Summerfield; 29 June 1921 – 30 November 2013) was a British movie and television actress. She was also known as Jean Carr. She was born in Brixton, London. Kent was known for her role as Mille Harris in ""The Browning Version""."

The Five Satins
Demonic is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Testament. It was released in 1997. The lyrics deal with occult themes more like their 1980s efforts instead of the political topics covered on more recent releases.
"Musically, Testament takes a slower, almost death metal oriented approach with grinding guitar riffs and Chuck Billy's vocal work consisting primarily of death growls."
"This album also marked the first time, as Testament, that the band used the old Legacy pentagram graphic."

It was originally established with former Elf members, though over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. In addition to lead singers Ronnie James Dio, Graham Bonnet, Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White, the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neo-classical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group."
"Rainbow was ranked #90 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock""."

"Joseph J. Romm (born June 27, 1960) is an American physicist, writer and environmentalist. He has an interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. He is also interested in energy security through energy efficiency and green energy technologies."
"Romm's 2006 book was """"."
"In December 2008, Romm was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In March 2009, ""Rolling Stone"" magazine named Romm as one of ""100 People Who Are Changing America"". In September 2009, ""Time"" magazine named him one of its ""Heroes of the Environment""."
A Child of Our Time
A Child of Our Time is an oratorio by Michael Tippett. It was composed between 1939 and 1941.
Why Tippett wrote this oratorio.
"Tippett composed this oratorio at the beginning of World War II. He had already lived through World War I and he was very upset about all the evil in this world. He wanted to write a musical work about it. He did it by taking the story of the beginning of World War II as a basis of the oratorio, but he also made the work speak in general about the evil of this world."
"In 1938 a 17 year old Jewish boy Hershel Grynspan, who lived in Paris, desperately wanted to attack the Nazis because of the cruel way his parents in Germany had been treated. He therefore murdered a Nazi diplomat in France. The Nazi’s in Germany were so furious that they attacked and murdered lots of Jews in Germany. This terrible attack became known as the ""Kristallnacht"". This series of events can be found in the words of Tippett’s oratorio. Tippett wrote the words himself."
"The title comes from Ödön von Horváth’s novel, ""Ein Kind unserer Zeit"" (A Child of Our Time), written in 1938 and published in English in 1939. Tippett began composing it on 5 September 1939, two days after Britain declared war against Germany."
"In 1958 Tippett arranged the five negro spirituals so that they could be sung by unaccompanied chorus. They are often performed like that, separately from the oratorio."
"Tippett uses a similar structure to the Passions of Bach. This meant that he used a narrator (like the evangelist in Bach’s Passions) who tells the story. Instead of Bach’s Lutheran chorales he adds five negro spirituals which add an emotional comment to the events. The music of these spirituals blend very cleverly into the style of Tippett’s music. The whole oratorio, which lasts a little over one hour, has three parts. This idea is based on the three parts of Handel's ""Messiah"". Tippett calls the three parts: 1) Prophecy; 2) Narrative; 3) Meditation."
The story in the oratorio.
Part One.
"Part one opens with a picture of the world in darkness. The alto solo shows what the person’s soul is feeling. The bass (narrator) tells of the purges in Russia, the lynching in the USA, the terrible poverty in Britain. The chorus tell of their despair."

Pokémon Black and White
"Pokémon Black Version and White Version are two role-playing games (RPGs) in the ""Pokémon"" series made by Game Freak for the Nintendo DS. The games were released in Japan on September 18, 2010, in Europe on March 4, 2011, in North America on March 6, 2011, and in Australia on March 10, 2011. The games have 156 new Pokémon, which brings the total to 649. These games introduce the largest amount of Pokémon in any generation."
Gameplay.
"""Pokémon Black"" and ""White"" are role-playing games where the player captures creatures called Pokémon. They can use them to battle against other Pokémon. One of the new features in the games are triple battles, which allows players to battle three Pokémon against three Pokémon. Alongside triple battles are Rotation Battles. Players still send out three Pokémon, but only one can battle at a time. The player can switch the position of their Pokémon during their turn. Also new is that the seasons change, and areas in the game have falling leaves in the fall, and snow in the winter."
Plot.
"""Pokémon Black"" and ""White"" take place in the Unova region, which is based on New York City and its surrounding area, unlike past games being based on regions of Japan. The plot of the game follows a new Pokémon trainer who is on a journey to become a Pokémon master. They do this by battling other trainers such as Gym Leaders, and finally the Elite Four. During this journey, the player meets an evil team known as Team Plasma, who look like knights. Team Plasma wants to make a new world where Pokémon are away from humans. After taking them down, the player must track down the first members, the Seven Sages, and battle them."
Adolf Anderssen
"Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (Breslau, 6 July 1818 – Breslau, 13 March 1879) was a German chess master, and a teacher of mathematics. He was recognised as the best player in the world for much of the time between 1851 and 1870."
"Anderssen won three great international tournaments: the first in London 1851, then London 1862 and Baden-Baden 1870. Anderssen lost matches in 1858 to Paul Morphy and, narrowly, to Steinitz in 1866. He was also a chess problem composer.p16"
"Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered—including the Baden-Baden 1870 tournament, which is comparable to modern strong GM tournaments. His last success was at Leipzig in 1877 where he came second equal with Zukertort, behind Paulsen. He was then nearly 60."
"He is still famous for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the 'Immortal Game' (1851) and the 'Evergreen Game' (1852). He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration."
His status.
"Anderssen was never world champion because ""there was as yet no concept of a formal championship, or of the means by which one might be awarded... The world championship proper was the creation of Wilhelm Steinitz (18361900)... The first match for the world championship was in 1886""... Also: ""Wilhelm Steinitz... was the first person to use the title of Champion of the world...""."
Mathematician.
"Anderssen was a teacher of mathematics in Breslau (now Wroclaw). He became a professor in about 1862, and in January 1865 was awarded honorary degrees of PhD and MA. These honours were not for chess, but not much is known about the teaching part of his career."
Bayesian network
"A Bayesian network is a kind of graph which is used to model events that cannot be observed. This can then be used for inference. The graph that is used is directed, and does not contain any cycles. The nodes of the graph represent random variables. If two nodes are connected by an edge, it has an associated probability that it will transmit from one node to the other."
"Bayesian networks are mainly used in the field of (unassisted) machine learning. They have been used where information needs to be classified. Examples are image, document, or speech recognition, and information retrieval."
It is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes' discovery in the 1740s called Bayes' theorem.
History.
"The term ""Bayesian networks"" was made by Judea Pearl in 1985 to emphasize three aspects:"
"In the late 1980s, the seminal texts ""Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems"" and ""Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems"" summarized the properties of Bayesian networks and helped to establish Bayesian networks as a field of study."
"Informal variants of such networks were first used by legal scholar John Henry Wigmore, in the form of Wigmore charts, to analyse trial evidence in 1913. Another variant, called path diagrams, was developed by the geneticist Sewall Wright and used in social and behavioral sciences (mostly with linear parametric models)."

Bride kidnapping
"Bride kidnapping is when a man abducts the woman he wants to marry. The practice is also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by capture,"
"Bride kidnapping (which is often shortened to bridenapping) has been practiced around the world, throughout history. Peoples as diverse as the Hmong in Southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, and the Romani in Europe have done it."
Bride kidnapping still occurs in different parts of the world. It is most common in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
"Most countries see bride kidnapping as a sex crime, and not as a valid form of marriage. In some cases, it is seen somewhere beteen a forced marriage and an arranged one."
"In many cases, the woman will cooperate with the kidnapper, to save her face, or to save the honour of her family or her parents."
"Many countries also have laws that say that this is not a crime, if the woman later marries the man. Very often, there are also customs, which see bride kidnapping as some form of tradition."
"In most nations, bride kidnapping is considered a sex crime because of the implied element of rape, rather than a valid form of marriage. Some types of it may also be seen as falling along the continuum between forced marriage and arranged marriage. The term is sometimes confused with elopements, in which a couple runs away together and seeks the consent of their parents later. In some cases, the woman cooperates with or accedes to the kidnapping, typically in an effort to save face for herself or her parents. In many jurisdictions, this used to be encouraged by so-called marry-your-rapist laws. Even in countries where the practice is against the law, if judicial enforcement is weak, customary law (""traditional practices"") may prevail."
"Bride kidnapping is often (but not always) a form of child marriage. It may be connected to the practice of bride price, wealth paid by the groom and his family to the bride's parents, and the inability or unwillingness to pay it."
"Bride kidnapping is when one man (or a man and his friends) abduct one woman. When this is done on a larger scale (a large group of men abducting many women), this is known as raptio, and different from bride kidnapping. In the 21st century, there have been more cases of war rape, which may have elements of bride kidnapping. Women and girls abducted by groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda and ISIS in the Middle East have been taken as wives by their abductors."
"In some countries, there are still rituals, which involve a symbolic bride kidnapping as part of a wedding. Some say that the honeymoon is a relic of such a practice: the husband going into hiding with his wife to avoid reprisals from her relatives, with the intention that the woman would be pregnant by the end of the month."

Super Mario 128
"Super Mario 128 refers to a series of development projects that were originally to be used only to create a sequel to ""Super Mario 64"". As debuted at Nintendo's Space World trade show in 2000, the demonstrated graphics and physics concepts were gradually incorporated into various games across many years. This includes the rapid object generation in ""Pikmin"", the ""sphere walking"" technology used in """" and ""Super Mario Galaxy"", and the physics of ""Metroid Prime""."
History.
"""Super Mario 64"" sequel."
"The name ""Super Mario 128"" was first used as early as January 1997 by Shigeru Miyamoto, as a possible name for a ""Super Mario 64"" sequel. This rumored expansion and sequel to ""Super Mario 64"" called ""Super Mario 64-2"" was said to be developed for the 64DD, but ended up being cancelled due to the 64DD's commercial failure. Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at E3's 1997 convention that he was ""just getting started"" on the project."
"In November 1999, Shigeru Miyamoto said, ""Well, for over a year now at my desk, a prototype program of Mario and Luigi has been running on my monitor. We've been thinking about the game, and it may be something that could work on a completely new game system."" The game had only a demo of one level made for it. Miyamoto claimed that multiplayer functionality was the first aspect of the game that he wanted to include."
Autonomic dysreflexia
"Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), also called autonomic hyperreflexia, is a medical emergency."
Who Gets Autonomic Dysreflexia?
"AD usually happens in people with spinal cord injuries that have caused damage above the sixth thoracic vertebra (T6, which is about at the same level of the armpits). However, AD sometimes happens in people with spinal damage as low as their tenth thoracic vertebra (T10, which is about a few inches above the level of the belly button)."
AD can also happen in people with diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS).
Symptoms.
Acute AD causes many symptoms. Some are very dangerous. These symptoms include:
What Causes Autonomic Dysreflexia?
Acute AD happens when the involuntary nervous system gets overexcited. The body's fight or flight response kicks in very strongly.
"Scientists think this happens because of afferent nerves. Afferent nerves are supposed to sense things (like touch) and send messages back to the brain and spinal cord so the brain can decide how to react. Scientists think that afferent nerves below the spinal cord injury cause blood pressure to get and stay high, by causing the blood vessels to get smaller. This is part of the fight or flight response."

Gameplay.
"The game is actually an open world, you can navigate by walking, driving a car, or taking a bus. Though much of the game consists of exploring and solving puzzles. During combat, if the players loses, they don't die, but rather end up infected, they have to rush to the hospital in order to cure their infection."
"The game has an unsettling mix of science-fiction, body-horror and surrealism, possibly taking influences from the films of ""David Cronenberg"", ""David Lynch"" and ""Shin'ya Tsukamoto"" as well as some of the 1950's and 1960's American science-fiction flicks for the setting and the story."

Icosane
"Icosane, also commonly spelled eicosane, is an alkane or a hydrocarbon with the chemical formula H20C42. It has 366,319 structural isomers. Its high flash point makes it a hard to light fuel, so it is not much use in the petrochemical industry. However, an isomer of icosane, ""n""-Icosane (the straight-chain structural isomer of icosane) is the shortest compound found in paraffin waxes (CnH2n+2, where formula_1) used to form candles. Icosane's phase transition at a moderate temperature makes it a candidate for PCM, which is used to store thermal energy and control temperature."
Icosane is a non-polar molecule: quite unreactive except when it burns (see the NFPA Diamond in the infobox). It is also way less dense than insoluble in water. This also means it shares properties with its smaller alkaline counterparts.
Icosane can also be detected in the body odor of people diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.
"The compound is found in the highest concentrations in plants such as Mexican ageratum, licorice, and the Bayrum tree."

Winter larder.
"On the Moroccan island of Mogador, falcons seem to imprison small birds by trapping them in crevasses, presumably saving them to eat later."
"Mogador has the ruins of a fortress, a mosque and a prison. Today the island is a nature reserve, where Eleonora’s falcons nest among the ruins. They hunt migrating warblers, hoopoes and other birds."
"Researchers came across small birds trapped in deep cavities, their flight and tail feathers removed. The birds were unable to move their wings or use their dangling legs. Eleonora’s falcons have been seen building up larders of up to 20 dead birds during migration season, when prey is plentiful. But ""storing snacks that are still alive could be a unique behaviour"" said an expert."

Ainu people
"The Ainu people are the native population of northern Japan and the eastern part of Russia, mostly in the Amur river region, Sakhalin, the Kuril islands and on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The term is also used for their culture and language in the Ezo region (Hokkaido)."
History.
"The majority of their ancestors, the Jōmon people, arrived in Japan about 30,000 – 15,000 years ago from Central Asia and southern Siberia. They were largely replaced by the proto-Japanese which arrived from southeastern China about 2,000 years ago. The Ainu have strong similarities with Palaeolithic Europeans and people of the Middle East as well as with Native American groups of the northwestern coastal culture area in North America. Some scholars think they were related to the Emishi of northern Honshu."
"During and after the Yayoi period they were attacked by the early Japanese people. The Ainu and relative tribes lost most of their land in Honshū, many were killed or ensalved by the Yayoi-Japanese. After the rise of the Yamato, few Ainu were left in Honshu. After the Meiji restoration in the late 1800s, the Japanese began to colonize Hokkaido, sending their own people to live there. They forced the Ainu to leave the warm coast of Hokkaido and try to live in the mountains in the middle of the island. The Ainu were not allowed to fish for salmon or hunt deer. The Ainu were required to speak Japanese and use Japanese names. Japanese scientists and treasure hunters would dig up Ainu graves and steal the bodies and artifacts."
"The Ainu in Russia had more luck and lived their traditional life until the Second World War, when they were forced to act like other Russians."
"In April 2019, the Ainu became recognized as native population of northern Japan, and the rest of Japan has started to think of their culture as good and valuable. However, the Ainu still face discrimination in Japan. Most Japanese outside of Hokkaido mistake the Ainu for foreigners or tourists."
Culture.
"Their culture is based on the ancient Jomon culture of northern Japan and eastern Russia. Their native folk religion has some similarities to early Shinto. Their gods are named ""kamuy"", similar to the Japanese ""Kami"". They practiced agriculture but were also hunter gatherers. The Ainu are famous for their wood work and art."
"The Ainu lived in villages called ""kotan"" and were often built along rivers or lakes. Every villages consisted of at least four to seven families, sometimes more than ten. The traditional house was called ""cise"" or ""cisey""."
"You is a second-person English pronoun. The word can be singular or plural. It is what a person says when he or she is addressing another person in second person. Sometimes, just using the English letter ""u"" is acceptable, and ""ur"" for the words ""you're"" and ""your"". This is very informal, and is mostly used in texting."

Chinese language
The Chinese language is the group of languages used by Chinese people in China and elsewhere. It forms part of a language family called the Sino-Tibetan family of languages.
"Chinese includes many regional language varieties, the main ones being Mandarin, Wu, Yue and Min. These are not mutually intelligible and many of the regional varieties are themselves a number of non-mutually-intelligible subvarieties. As a result, many linguists refer to these varieties as separate languages."
"'Chinese' can refer to the written or the spoken languages. Although there are many spoken Chinese languages, they use the same writing system. Differences in speaking are reflected in differences in writing. Official China adopts a similar policy to the one in the Soviet Union, using one official language so people can understand each other. The Standard Chinese language is referred to as Mandarin in English, ""Pǔtōnghuà"" or ""common to everybody speech"" in mainland China and ""Guóyǔ"" or ""language of the whole country"" in Taiwan. All official documents in Pinyin are written in Mandarin and Mandarin is taught all over China. It is also a standard for language teaching in some other countries."
"Chinese is used by the Han people in China and other ethnic groups in China who are declared Chinese by the Chinese government. Many people in autonomous regions of China speak other languages. Chinese is almost always written in Chinese characters. They are symbols that have meaning, called logograms. They also give ""some"" indication of pronunciation, but the same character can get very different pronunciations among the different kinds of Chinese. Since Chinese characters have been around for at least 3500 years, people in places far from each other say them differently, just as ""1, 2, 3"" can be read differently in different languages."
"Chinese people needed to write down pronunciations in dictionaries. Chinese does not have an alphabet, so how to write down sounds was a big problem in the beginning. Nowadays the Mandarin language uses Hanyu Pinyin to represent the sounds in Roman letters."
All the Chinese languages (or dialects) use tones. This means that they use high and low pitches to help make differences in meaning clear.
Different languages or dialects of Chinese.
"The Chinese language is like a big tree. The base of the tree started thousands of years ago. It now has several main limbs. Some people call ""just a branch"" what other people call a main limb, so you can say there are six or seven main limbs. Each of these main limbs splits off into branches about the way there are branches of English spoken in Great Britain, the United States, Australia, India, and so forth. Just as the Romance languages all come from the area around Rome and are based on Latin, the Chinese languages all have some common source, so they keep many common things among them."
Here are the main seven main groups of languages/dialects of Chinese by size:
Traditional and simplified characters.
"In 1956, the government of the People's Republic of China made public a set of simplified Chinese characters to make learning, reading and writing the Chinese language easier. In Mainland China and Singapore, people use these simpler characters. In Hong Kong, Taiwan and other places where they speak Chinese, people still use the more traditional characters. The Korean language also uses Chinese characters to represent certain words. The Japanese language uses them even more often. These characters are known in Korean as Hanja and in Japanese as Kanji."
"A Chinese person with a good education today knows 6,000-7,000 characters. About 3,000 Chinese characters are needed to read a Mainland newspaper. However, people who have learned only the 400 most frequently used characters can read a newspaper—but they will have to guess some less-used words."
Examples.
"Here are some samples of some words and sentences in Mandarin Chinese. Simplified Characters are on the left, and Traditional characters are on the right. The pronunciation is given in the pinyin system, which may not always be as simple as it looks for those who have not studied it."
"The Traditional Characters are now used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chinese from Mainland China uses the Simplified Characters, but may recognize Traditional Characters."
"Before 1956, Chinese was written using only Traditional Characters. At that time most Chinese people could not read or write at all. The government of the People's Republic of China thought that the Traditional characters were very hard to understand. They also thought that if they made the characters simpler more people could learn how to read and write. Today, many people in China can read and write with the new Simplified Characters."
Zero
"Zero (0) is a special number. If there are zero things, then there is nothing at all. For example, if a person has zero hats, that means they do not have any hats."
Symbol.
"The symbol for the number zero is ""0"". It is the additive identity of common numbers. This means that if a number is added to 0, then that number would remain unchanged."
Math with zero.

"That was the Ford Mustang in 2015 but in 2016, Shelby decided to boost the 6th generation Mustang by creating the all new Shelby GT350R which had a 5.2 litre V8 with 526hp at 7500RPM. This was a great increase in performance since the 2015 Mustang. It also included many carbon fibre pieces that were put into the car to reduce its weight. The stock rims in fact were the first ever carbon fibre rims created by NASA, a space station in the USA. The GT350R also had a mounted carbon fibre spoiler and quad exhaust pipes. The same Mustang will be sold in America until 2018, where Ford is rumoured to give us a brand new facelifted Mustang..."
"Beginning with the 2021 model year, Ford also uses the Mustang name on a new, large electric crossover model called the Mach-E."
"The 2021 Mustang Mach-E is Ford's first all-electric crossover, and it was designed and named after the company's iconic pony car. The Mach-E also pays homage to the ""Mach 1"" moniker that has been used on high-performance Mustangs of old. Ford said it went with the name because it needed the electrified crossover to be as desirable as a Tesla to usher in its new era of electric vehicles. It's expected to provide 300 miles of driving range when paired with the extended-range battery and rear-wheel drive."
Red Hat Linux
"Red Hat Linux is a discontinued Linux operating system, replaced by RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)."
"Red Hat made it public in the past and it was used by many Linux users. The last publicly released version was Red Hat Linux 9 in April, 2003. Red Hat then decided to discontinue a future release of Red Hat Linux and started the paid ""Red Hat Enterprise Linux"" instead. There are some redistributions of RHEL, though such as CentOS which are free and come without Red Hat's branding, logos etc. due to trademark restrictions."
Red Hat Linux 7.3 version is still widely used around the world for servers and workstations.
"Around 2005, The Red Hat company released their system as Fedora Core, intended to be a test platform for new technologies. It is now called just 'Fedora' and its present release acts as a base for the next release of RHEL."

"Sacavém is a city in Portugal, near the capital Lisbon. There is about eighteen hundred people living there. Sacavém is on the border of the River Tagus. It confines with the parishes of ""Bobadela"", ""Camarate"", ""Moscavide"", ""Portela"", ""Prior Velho"" and ""Unhos""."
Sacavém is very well known for its ceramics.
Shooter
A shooter is a kind of video game. The aim of the game is to beat enemies by shooting (or otherwise killing) them. The enemies shoot back.
"Many of the oldest computer games were shooters; the first video game ever made was a shooter called ""Computer Space"". And one of the first games that many people played was a shooter called ""Space Invaders""."
"There are lots of different kinds of shooter. Now many people like first-person shooters. But there are other kinds too. In Japan many people play shooters where the enemies fire lots of bullets. The bullets make beautiful patterns on the screen. This kind of shooter is called a ""barrage shooter, bullet hell game"" or a ""curtain fire shooter"". It is also called by the Japanese name, ""danmaku"". One of these games is Touhou. Another that combines bullet hell elements with an RPG is Undertale."
Sushi
is a traditional food that is from Japan.
"The word ""Sushi"" comes from the Japanese word meaning vinegar, and "", meaning rice."
"Sushi is made with specially prepared rice, called . The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables. Some sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called ."
"Sushi is traditionally eaten by hand, but it is not wrong to eat it using chopsticks. Gari (Japanese pickled ginger slices) must be eaten with chopsticks."
"There are many different kinds of sushi. The most common sushi in Japan is : fish meat that is placed on top of a small portion of ""sumeshi"". Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of the ""sumeshi"", such as roe (fish eggs), and sea urchin meat, instead of fish. Another type of sushi, , consists of ""sumeshi"" rolled around fish and/or vegetables. In the US, ""makizushi"" is more popular than ""nigirizushi"". Another type is known as or a hand roll. This kind of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created by the ""nori"" wrapped around the ingredients inside. They are usually filled with a mixture of ""sumeshi"", fish, and vegetables."
"Sushi is eaten with your bare hands or chopsticks. Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly eaten with sushi. ""Gari"" (sweet, pickled ginger) can often be found alongside a plate of sushi and also a little bit of wasabi, used as a palate cleanser."
"In Japan, sushi is sometimes sold in ""conveyor-belt shops"" called ""kaiten zushi"" (回転寿司), where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers. People freely take the sushi they want as it passes. The color of the plate shows the price of the sushi. This way of serving sushi is becoming more popular in other countries as well."
History.
"Sushi began when rice farming came to Japan over 2,000 years ago. The original type of sushi was developed in the Nara Prefecture as a way of preserving fish in fermented rice. During the Muromachi period, people would eat the rice ""and"" the fish. During the Edo period, vinegar, not fermented rice, was used. In more recent times, it has become a fast food associated with Japanese culture."
"The origin of sushi goes back to Southeast Asia around the 4th century B.C.. At that time, it was called ""narezushi"". The fish was originally eaten alone, without rice. Later on, a style of namaranarezushi reached Japan. Namaranerezushi combined the fish with rice."
What is called sushi in modern times was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the End of the Edo period. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented. It was prepared quickly. It could be eaten with one's hands. This fish was originally known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in Edo-Bay or Tokyo Bay. The fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay.
"By the early 1900s, sushi was being served in the United States, after many Japanese people had immigrated there. The first United States sushi shop opened up in 1906 in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles."

Abdominal compartment syndrome
"Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the abdominal cavity (compartment) within the body becomes subject to increased pressure from within. This may be caused by internal bleeding, a blockage or fluid build-up in the intestines, or 'ascites' which is when fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity - the space between the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) and the abdominal organs (the stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder)."
"This increased pressure causes the abdomen to distend or expand, stretching the skin and placing pressure on the abdominal organs, which can constrict the blood vessels which supply them. When the pressure reaches a level above that of the blood supply to the tissues and organs of the abdomen, ischemia will happen leading to organ dysfunction and eventually failure."
"An operation called a decompressive laparotomy may need to be performed, where an incision is made to open the abdominal cavity. The incision is typically left open for a period of time to reduce the pressure in the abdomen."
Abdominal compartment syndrome can be divided into three categories:

Bogotá bag
"A Bogotá bag is a sterile plastic bag used to temporarily close incisions in the abdomen. It is generally a sterilized, 3 liter urological irrigation fluid bag, that is sewn to the skin or fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. It is called a 'Bogotá bag' because it was first used by Oswaldo Borraez, a doctor in Bogotá, Colombia."
Similar movies.
"""The Magnificent Seven"" was an American movie Western with a similar story. This is called a remake."
"The movie was also adapted into an Japanese anime series in 2004 by GONZO, entitled Samurai 7. The anime series takes a more futuristic and fantasy take at the original story, replacing robots for thieves and bestowing superhuman abilities to the 7 samurais."
Vacuum tube
"A vacuum tube, also called a valve in British English, is an electronic device used in many older model radios, television sets, and amplifiers to control electric current flow. The cathode is heated, as in a light bulb, so it will emit electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The anode is the part that accepts the emitted electrons. The device may have other parts. Vacuum tubes must be hot to work. Most are made of glass, thus are fragile and can break. Vacuum tubes were used in the first computers like the ENIAC, which were large and need much work to continue operating."
History.
"Although the vacuum tube was invented by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904, it was Thomas Edison who discovered the ""Edison effect"" in 1883 which states that electricity does not necessarily need a solid material to move through; it can move through gas or vacuums as well."
"John Ambrose Fleming invented the first vacuum tube, the diode, in 1904. Lee De Forest invented the ""audion"" in 1906 (which was improved by others as the triode in 1908) and used in the first telephone amplifiers. Many other kinds were invented for various purposes."
"The transistor became cheaper in the 1960s and was much smaller, worked on lower voltages, and used less power. In addition, unlike vacuum tubes, they were much less likely to be damaged by being dropped and had extremely long life. Eventually, they were also much cheaper than glass vacuum tubes. At this time, most radios, television sets, and amplifiers began using transistors instead. High powered electronics such as broadcasting transmitters were transistorized more slowly. Television receivers continued using the cathode ray tube until the mid-2000s."
Current uses.
"In the 21st century, vacuum tubes are rarely used in common electronic equipment. Many devices today rely on the transistor over the vacuum tube. Some devices that still use the vacuum tube, however, include:"

Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on January 23, 1933, the Twentieth Amendment (Amendment XX) to the United States Constitution moved the beginning and ending of the terms of the president and vice president from March 4 to January 20. It moved the start and end dates for members of Congress from March 1 to January 21. In both cases the start and end time is at noon. It also gives the procedure to follow if for some reason there is no president-elect."
Background.
"In the later part of the eighteenth century, when the Constitution was written, travel and communications were both very slow by modern standards. To cross the Atlantic Ocean could take several weeks. Traveling by horseback or by carriage on crude roads in the US could take even longer. Communications were mainly by letter or messenger. For these reasons the framers of the Constitution allowed for the longer periods of time it took to send and receive messages. Four months, the time from the election in November to the swearing-in in March, was necessary at the time."
"By the 1930s, a railroad passenger could cross the country in 3 days. The Post Office had been using airmail since 1918. But vastly improved travel times and communications were not the only reasons behind the Twentieth Amendment. The joint resolution calling for the amendment was sponsored by Republican Senator George William Norris of Nebraska. Called the ""Lame Duck"" Amendment, it acquired this name because Norris wanted to eliminate the lame-duck sessions of Congress where outgoing members still held office and voted on bills for several months before the new members could be sworn in. The bill he wrote applied to both houses of Congress, the offices of President and Vice-President."
Another area the amendment addressed was with the succession of the president if the president-elect died before taking office. It provides for the vice-president elect to become the president-elect and take office on January 20. The amendment also give Congress the power to legislate on other issues dealing with the succession of the president.
Effects of the Twentieth Amendment.
"The sessions of Congress between the election and the beginning of a new term are called ""lame duck"" sessions because members of Congress who were voted out of office still attend and can still vote. Originally the term ""lame duck"" was a financial term meaning those who could not repay a loan. As used in politics, a representative who lost an election was no longer accountable to the voters. As the framers of the Twentieth Amendment saw it, lame duck representatives should not be able to vote since voters had already rejected their views. The Twentieth Amendment only shortened the lame duck period by six weeks. Between 1933 and 2012, 18 lame-duck sessions of Congress have passed laws."

"Controversy about injected hCG for weight loss started marketing campaign for injections of ""homeopathic hCG"" for weight control. The ingredients in these products if prepared from true hCG via homeopathic dilution, will contain either no hCG at all or only small amount of it."
We can measure hCG level with Blood or urine tests. These can be done by pregnancy tests.
"Below is a list of hCG levels during pregnancy. (""LMP"" is the last menstrual period dated from the first day of your last period.) The level of hCG grows over the time during pregnancy."
Giovanni Bellini
"Giovanni Bellini (; c. 1430 – 26 November 1516) was an Italian Renaissance painter based in Venice. His father Jacopo and his brother Gentile were also painters, as was his brother-in-law Mantegna."
"Bellini used a coloristic style exemplified by his use of clear oil paints, deep colors, and detailed shadings. His atmospheric landscapes influenced Venetian painting, particularly the work done by his pupils, Giorgione and Titian."
International marketing
International marketing (IM) or global marketing is a marketing done on international level. The International Marketing is based on strategy created in home country of company and distributed to its other offices/affiliations. In most cases it is international company level (company have offices in different countries) market identification and targeting. International Marketing is very similar to Global marketing.
The main difference will be the fact that Global Marketing is focusing on intercontinental point of view.
The example of International Marketing would be where an English company would like to enter Chinese market. It will be done by either developing marketing strategy in their home country that will be then introduced in new market or they will hire a company to create such a plan.
Differences between marketing and international marketing.
International marketing is developed by many multinational companies on a global level. It is then send to local markets which make changes for their country and starts following new strategy. Such a way of creating marketing strategies ensures that the global brand will be following same strategy and targeting same buyers group.

"The name comes from the Scottish Gaelic, Beinn Nibheis, which may mean poisonous or terrible."
The Summit.
The summit of Ben Nevis is a large stony plateau of about . The highest point is marked with a large stone mound which sits an Ordnance Survey trig point.
"The ruined walls of an observatory are also on the summit. An emergency shelter has been built on top of the observatory tower for people caught out by bad weather. The roof of the shelter is higher than the trig point by several feet, making it the highest man-made structure in the UK. A war memorial to the dead of World War II is next to the observatory."
"On 17 May 2006, a piano that had been buried under one of the cairns on the peak was uncovered by the John Muir Trust, which owns much of the mountain. The piano is believed to have been carried up for charity by removal men from Dundee over 20 years earlier."
"The view from the UK's highest point can reach to over , and mountains such as the Torridon Hills, Morven in Caithness, Lochnagar, Ben Lomond, Barra Head and Knocklayd in County Antrim, Northern Ireland can be seen."
Snowdon
"Snowdon is the highest mountain in Wales. Its top is known as ""Yr Wyddfa"" (Old Welsh meaning ""the grave""). The English name Snowdon comes from Saxon ""Snow Dun"", meaning ""snow hill""."

Manaus
"Manaus is the principal city of the North Region of Brazil. It is the capital of Amazonas. Manaus had a great age when latex was discovered in the Amazon region. Manaus developed economically and culturally. After that great age, latex started to be produced in other countries, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where due the similar climate the plants start to grow even faster than in Brasil."
"Manaus is considerated as the entrance door to the biggest ecological reservation in the planet: The Amazon rainforest. Its name come from a tribe called Manaós that lived in this area and means ""Mother of God"". The colonization started on 1669, with a small fort, and around it grew a settlement. In 1833 it became a village, with the name of Manaus. On October 24th of 1848 it receive the name of city and became the Capital of the state."
"Manaus is the site of the ""encontro of the waters"" where two big rivers Rio Negro (black river) and Solimoes River come together and for more than 10 km ""walk together but not mixed"" because of their differing density, and then become the Amazon."
"The American Charles Goodyear, inventor of vulcanization, developed a procedure to process the juice of the rubber tree into rubber. The city became rich, and India rubber barons paid for a big biggest luxury from Europe, a copy the Grand Paris Opéra - the TEATRO AMAZONAS. Other monuments from this time include the MERCADO MUNICIPAL, a copy of the famous market halls Les Halles in Paris, the arts centre RIO PALACIO NEGRO between fascinating Portuguese facades."
"Today Manaus is a foreign trade zone. Foreign enterprises pay here no import duties what guarantees a certain income for the city and the region. Electronics, wood industry and oil refineries have settled in the outskirts in industrial areas. The harbour is the most important trading centre for the care of the city with regional, national and international products."
About 1.5 million people live in Manaus.
It was nominated as one of the places for the Soccer World Cup 2014. the city is growing rapidly and start to prepare for the event that will bring a lot of people.
Manaus in Facebook
"The Opera house is the major cultural heritage of the Amazonas. It was inaugurated in 1896 during the rubber boom. In spite of the predominance of neoclassic elements, other styles were used, so the architecture is eclectic, with materials brought from Europe as well as artists like Domenico de Angelis, Giovanni Capranesi and Crispim do Amaral. Preserved as a national heritage since 1965, today, with more than 100 years, it has room for 681 people including balconies and three floors of boxes. After the restauration made by the state government in 1990, the theater rescued its splendor, with performances of famous operas, national and international musicians."

Twyla Tharp (born July 1 1941) is an American dancer and choreographer. She lives and works in New York City.
"Her work often uses classical music, jazz, and contemporary pop music. In 1973, Tharp choreographed the ballet ""Deuce Coupe"" to the music of The Beach Boys. It is considered to be the first crossover ballet. Later she choreographed ""Push Comes to Shove"". That ballet featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of the crossover ballet."
"Tharp has choreographed dances for many important ballet companies around the world. She also has had success on Broadway. In 1985, her staging of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" played at the Gershwin for 367 performances. Her dance musical ""Movin' Out"" ran for 1,331 performances on Broadway. The musical is set to the music and lyrics of Billy Joel. It received 10 Tony Award nominations and Tharp was named Best Choreographer."
Honors and awards.
"Twyla Tharp received two Emmy Awards, 19 honorary doctorates, the Vietnam Veterans of America President’s Award, the 2004 National Medal of the Arts."
Tharp was inducted into the Academy of Achievement in 1993.
She was named a Kennedy Center Honoree for 2008.
Chytridiomycosis
"Chytridiomycosis is a disease that can kill amphibians, for example frogs. A fungus causes it. THe chytrid fungus ""Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis"" causes the disease. The animals can catch it from each other. Chytridiomycosis one reason why there are fewer amphibians on Earth than there were. The fungus has decreased the amphibian population by 30% worldwide. Many spcies are now extict because they died of chitridiomycosis. In some species, only a few animals die, but in other species, they all die. This is called 100% mortality. There is no cure."
Temnospondyl
Temnospondyls are an order of small to giant batrachomorph tetrapods. They lived worldwide from the Carboniferous to the Triassic. A few species continued into the Lower Cretaceous.
"The Temnospondyls are similar or identical to the Labyrinthodonts minus the Lepospondyls. It is probably an evolutionary grade, not monophyletic. It is convenient to use, because all these early amphibia were so different from present-day amphibia.p169 Many in the early Permian looked more like reptiles because they were adapted to life in a drier climate. Nevertheless, they were amphibians, and many larval stages have been found."
"They are a large group of some 40 families and 160 genera.p322 Fossils have been found on every continent. Their evolutionary history spans 210 million years. During this time, they adapted to a wide range of habitats including fresh water, terrestrial, and even coastal marine environments."
"Fossils are known from the larval stage, metamorphosis, and maturity.p184 Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic, although some were almost fully terrestrial, returning to the water only to breed. These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land. Although temnospondyls are considered amphibians, many had characteristics such as scales, claws, and armour-like bony plates which modern amphibians do not have."
The youngest known temnospondyl is the Australian Koolasuchus that lived about 120 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous.
Lepospondyl
The Lepospondyli are a large group of batrachomorph tetrapods from the Palaeozoic era. They are sometimes included in the Labyrinthodonts.
"They lived during the Carboniferous to the early Permian. There are six different groups. The Acherontiscidae, Adelospondyli, Aïstopoda, Lysorophia, Microsauria and Nectridea. The included species which looked somewhat like newts, eels, snakes and lizards. Some of them were aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial animals. None of them were big animals."
Peltobatrachus
"Peltobatrachus (from Greek pelte, meaning shield and batrakhos, meaning frog) is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibians from the late Permian period of Tanzania. They were large and slow-moving animals. They reached 70 centimeters (2.3 ft) in length. They were terrestrial amphibians. They only went back to the water to lay their eggs. They eat insects, worms and snails."
Terrestrial animal
"A terrestrial animal is an animal that lives on land such as dog, cat, an ant or an emu. It can also be used for some species of amphibians that only go back to the water to lay their eggs. It is usually a term to describe the difference between animals that live in water, (such as lobsters and fish), from animals that live on land."
Sister group
A sister group or sister taxon is a term used to describe the closest relatives of an organism (or other taxon) in a phylogenetic tree. It is a term in cladistics.
"The sister group of organism A is B. The sister group of the clade B+A, is C."
"In a July 2007 indictment, federal prosecutors said that Wells had been involved in the planning of the botched bank robbery. Two of his alleged co-conspirators, Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes, were indicted. In 2008, U.S. District Judge Sean J. McLaughlin sentenced Barnes to 45 years in federal prison. Two years later, Diehl-Armstrong was also found guilty and, in 2011, was sentenced to life in prison, where she died from cancer in 2017."

Death of Gloria Ramirez
"Gloria Ramirez (January 11, 1963 – February 19, 1994) was an American woman dubbed ""the Toxic Lady"" by the media when several hospital workers became ill after exposure to her body and blood. She was from Riverside, California."
"Ramirez had been admitted to the ER while suffering from late-stage cervical cancer. While treating Ramirez, several hospital workers fainted and others experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath and muscle spasms."
"Five workers required hospitalization, one of whom remained in intensive care unit for two weeks."
"Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Ramirez died from complications related to cancer. This incident was initially thought to be a case of mass hysteria."
"The medical staff injected her with diazepam, midazolam, and lorazepam to sedate her. When it became clear that Ramirez was responding poorly to treatment, the staff tried to defibrillate her heart. Many people saw an oily substance covering Ramirez's body. Others noted a fruity, garlic-like odor that they thought was coming from her mouth."
"An investigation by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said that Ramirez had been self-injecting dimethyl sulfoxide as a treatment for pain, which converted into dimethyl sulfate, an extremely poisonous agent via a series of chemical reactions in the emergency department. Although the medical sector of Riverside supports this claim, scientists still believe it is not the case."
"Two months after Ramirez died, her badly decomposed body was released for an independent autopsy and burial. On April 20, 1994—ten weeks after her death—Ramirez was buried at Olivewood Memorial Park in Riverside."

Sulfur cycle
"The sulfur cycle is the way sulfur moves between rocks, waterways and living systems."
"Sulfur (S) is an element important to ecosystems and the climate. The majority of sulfur is stored underground, for example under the ocean or in rocks. It also occurs naturally in places like swamps (where organisms have decomposed) and volcanoes. Humans add excess sulfur into this cycle, usually through atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion."
Steps of the sulfur cycle.
Sulfur can also be naturally released when volcanoes explode. The hydrological cycle plays a critical role in moving sulfur around.
Human Impact on the sulfur cycle.
"Humans are responsible for 1/3 of the sulfur in the atmosphere. Sulfur is released by the combustion of fossil fuels, as mentioned above, and is most prevalent as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur is one of the root causes of acid rain along with nitrogen and carbon which negatively affects the environment. Acid rain is created when the H2O falls and combines with the Sulfur trioxide to create Sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is also used in most fertilizers and so can be introduced into the water cycle from runoff off of nearby farms into rivers and lakes. This causes eutrophication and algal blooms, and so reduced the Dissolved oxygen and biodiversity in that water system. Sulfur in the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide also absorbs radiation, however which keeps the earth's surface cooler and combats some of the effects of global warming."
Flag of Azad Kashmir
"The State flag of Azad Jammu and Kashmir traditionally displays the Pakistani national colours, white and dark Green, with a Crescent and star to represent the Muslim-majority all of which shows its Islamic heritage and strong ties with the Federation of Pakistan. It also has a saffron square to represent the Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh and other minorities of the disputed region, the colours are clearly influenced by the Mughal Empire. The four white stripes symbolizes the main rivers of the Kashmir region; Indus (National River of Pakistan), Jhelum, Chenab and Ravi. It also represents the five geographic divisions of the Disputed territory, namely, Baltistan, Gilgit, Jammu, the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh."
Deaths in December 2015
"The following is a list of notable deaths in December 2015. For notable deaths before the current month, please see ""Previous months""."
Oʻtkir Sultonov
"Oʻtkir Toʻxtamurodovich Sultonov (Russian: Уткир Тухтамурадович Султанов, ""Utkir Tukhtamuradovich Sultanov"") (14 July 1939 – 29 November 2015) was an Uzbek politician. He was the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan from 21 December 1995 until 12 December 2003."
"Sultonov died in Tashkent, Uzbekistan at the age of 76."
Claire Aho
"Claire Anita Aho (2 November 1925 – 29 November 2015) was a pioneering Finnish-born Swedish photographer. She started her career in the 1940s at the Aho &amp; Soldan company. Aho moved to Sweden in 1974 where she worked as an photographer for several newspapers including ""Hufvudstadsbladet"" and with Nordic Museum."
"Casineria was a tetrapod which lived 340 million years ago (mya) in the Mississippian. It was a small animal, length about 15 centimeters."
It lived in what was then a fairly dry environment in what is now Scotland. It had a mosaic of 'basal' (= primitive) amphibian and 'derived' (= advanced) amniote characters.
"""Casineria"" was at or very near the origin of the amniotes. It may have been one of the very first true amniotes. The only fossil lacks key elements: most of the skull and the whole lower body is missing. This makes exact analysis difficult."
"""Casineria"" was an insectivore. This earliest amniote had five fingers with claws on each hand, and marks the earliest known clawed foot."
"Its name, ""Casineria"", is a latin version of ""Cheese Bay"", the site near Edinburgh, where it was found."
Discovery.
"In 1992, an amateur fossil collector spotted the remains of this four-legged creature on the shore of Cheese Bay, Scotland. For the next five years, the fossil waited at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh while researchers focused on other projects. In 1997, work began to expose the remainder of the fossil from the surrounding matrix of stone."
The work revealed that the animal probably lived in an environment much drier than previously understood. The findings were first reported in 1999.
Phylogenetic relationship.
"""Casineria"" shows features that ties it in with early tetrapods, notably a generally gracile (slim) build with light leg-bones, unfused ankles and toes ending in claws. This would enable the animal to use their feet actively in traction, rather than as holdfasts. This indicates a mainly terrestrial lifestyle. These traits shows it was closely related to amniotes."
"With its advanced features, ""Casineria"" may have been one of the very first true amniotes, that is, egg-layers before the split between Synapsids and Sauropsids. ""Casineria"" pushes back the origin of amniote lineages much further than was previously realized."
"""Casineria"" and its relatives were perhaps the first vertebrates to live and reproduce on land."
Protoclepsydrops
"Protoclepsydrops was an early amniote from about 314 million years ago. Its remains were found at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs World Heritage Site. The dating of this site has been debated, with dates from 320 million years ago (mya) to 305 mya being suggested.p39 It is now settled as 314.5–313.4 mya +/- 1.1 million years.p40"
"The skeletal remains of ""Protoclepsydrops"" suggest it may have been a synapsid. If so, it is the oldest synapsid known, though its status is unconfirmed because its remains were fragmentary. ""Protoclepsydrops"" lived slightly earlier than ""Archaeothyris"", which was definitely a synapsid. Like ""Archaeothyris"", ""Protoclepsydrops"" had a body shape which resembled modern lizards."
Paleothyris
"Paleothyris was a small, agile, anapsid reptile which lived in the Pennsylvanian epoch in Nova Scotia (about 312 to 304 million years ago)."
"""Paleothyris"" had sharp teeth and large eyes: it was a nocturnal hunter. It was about a foot long. It probably fed on insects and other smaller animals found on the floor of its forest home."
"""Paleothyris"" was an early sauropsid, yet it still had some features that were more labyrinthodont-like than reptile-like. Its skull lacked fenestrae, holes found in the skulls of most reptiles and mammals."
Amy Brenneman
"Amy Frederica Brenneman (born June 22, 1964) is an American producer and actor. She is best known for starring in ""NYPD Blue"" and ""Judging Amy"". She has also starred in many movies. She was born in Connecticut."
Westlothiana
"Westlothiana lizziae is an early tetrapod. It is a transitional fossil, with a mixture of amphibian and early amniote characters.282 Its body shape had a superficial resemblance to modern-day lizards. It lived during the Carboniferous period, about 350 million years ago."
"The type specimen was discovered in East Kirkton Quarry, Bathgate, Scotland, in 1984. It was named after the County of West Lothian where it was found."
"""Westlothiania"" in life."
"This species probably lived near a freshwater lake, probably hunting for other small creatures that lived in the same habitat. It was a slender animal, with rather small legs and a long tail."
"Together with ""Casineria"", another transitional fossil found in Scotland, it is one of the smallest terapods known, being a mere 20 cm in adult length."
"The small size has made it a key fossil in the search for the earliest amniote, as amniote eggs are thought to have evolved in very small animals. There are derived (advanced) features which tie it in with the amniotes rather than amphibians. These are: unfused ankle bones, lack of labyrinthodont infolding of the dentine in teeth, a lack of an otic notch and a generally small skull."
"The island of Sardinia has an area of and, after Sicily, is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is long from North to South, and wide from West to East. It lies between 38° 51' and 41° 15' latitude north and 8° 8' and 9° 50' longitude east."
"The island is on the western Mediterranean Sea, between the island of Corsica to the north and Tunisia to the south. The Tyrrhenian Sea part of the Mediterranean is directly east of Sardinia, between the Sardinian east coast and the west coast of the Italian mainland peninsula."
"The Strait of Bonifacio (, , Gallurese: ""Bocchi di Bunifaciu"", ) is the strait between Corsica and Sardinia, named after the Corsican town Bonifacio. It is wide and divides the Tyrrhenian Sea from the western Mediterranean Sea."
Rivers.
"Sardinia has few major rivers, the largest being the Tirso, long, which flows into the western Mediterranean Sea, the Coghinas () and the Flumendosa ()."
Mountains and valleys.
"The highest peak is Punta La Marmora (), part of the Gennargentu group of mountains in the centre of the island. Other mountain chains are Monte Limbara () in the northeast, the Chain of Marghine and Goceano () running crosswise for towards the north, the Monte Albo (), the Sette Fratelli massif in the southeast, and the Sulcis Mountains and the Monte Linas ()."
"The mountain chains of the island are separated by wide valleys; the main ones are Campidano in the southwest between Oristano and Cagliari, and the Nurra in the northwest."
Islands.
There are many small islands around the main island of Sardinia. Some of them are:
Administrative divisions.
Sardinia is divided in eight provinces:
Nuclear reactor
"A nuclear reactor is a machine that uses fission to generate heat. There are different designs which use different fuels. Most often, uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are the main components of these fuels."
"Most nuclear reactors are used to make electricity. In nuclear power plants heat from the fission reactions in the reactor changes water into steam. The steam is then used to power electric turbines which make electricity. As with other steam engines, the turbines take energy from the movement of the steam."
Some reactors are used for other purposes. Some reactors make neutrons for science research and others make radioactive isotopes. Some universities have small nuclear reactors to teach students how reactors work.
The first nuclear reactor was built in 1942 by a team of scientists led by Enrico Fermi. This was a part of the Manhattan Project which needed the fuel from the reactor to make the atomic bomb. The first nuclear reactor to make electricity was a small experimental reactor built in Idaho in 1951. It made just enough electricity for four light globes.
"Nuclear reactors are expensive to build because of the many safety features they need to have. There is also a problem with the huge amount of radioactive waste from the reactors. However they produce electricity cheaply, and do not pollute the air. There have been serious accidents at several nuclear reactors: Windscale (UK) 1957, Mayak (USSR) 1957, Three Mile Island (USA) 1979, Chernobyl (USSR) 1986 and Fukushima (Japan) 2011. Concerns about safety have limited the growth of nuclear power. There are about 437 reactors around the world which provide about 5% of the world's electricity."
Samobor
"Samobor is a city in Zagreb County, Croatia, population 36,206 It is west of Zagreb, between the eastern slopes of Samoborsko gorje (Samobor hills, the eastern part of the Žumberak Mountains), in the Sava river valley. It is part of the Zagreb metropolitan area."
"Samobor has been there since 1242, according to a document of endowment by King Bela IV. It is one of the earliest tourist resorts in the region, with the first tourist facilities dating back to 1810, oriented towards anglers, hunters and hikers."
Frankfurt (Oder)
"Frankfurt (Oder) or Frankfurt an der Oder (; abbreviated """", , Low Sorbian: ""Frankobrod nad Odru"", , Upper Sorbian: ""Frankobrod nad Wódru"", lit. 'Frankfurt at the Oder') is a town in Germany. It lies on the Oder river, which marks the current border between Germany and Poland (The so-called Oder-Neisse line). It's in the east of the state of Brandenburg."
"In January 1999, the town added a prefix ""Kleiststadt"" to refer to Heinrich von Kleist, who was born there in 1777. Today, about 65,000 people are living in Frankfurt an der Oder."
Cook Islands
"The Cook Islands are a group of islands in the southern Pacific. They form an independent state, but have strong ties with New Zealand. The 15 small islands have a total land surface of 240 square kilometers. About 18.000 people live on the islands, most of them from tourism. The largest island, Rarotonga, also holds the territory's capital, Avarua."
"The nation also has a distinctive Polynesian language known as Cook Island Maori, which is closely related to the Maori language of New Zealand and to the Tahitian language."
"In South Indian cuisine, especially Tamil cuisine, citron is widely used in pickles and preserves. In Tamil, the unripe fruit is referred to as 'narthangai', which is usually salted and dried to make a preserve. The tender leaves of the plant are often used in conjunction with chili powder and other spices to make a powder, called 'narthellai podi', literally translating to 'powder of citron leaves'. Both narthangai and narthellai podi are usually consumed with 'thayir sadam' (Curd Rice - Yogurt Rice)."
"In Korea, it is used to create a syrupy tea (called Yuja cha) where the slices of whole fruit are eaten with the sweet tea. The fruit is thinly sliced (peel, pith and pulp) and soaked or cooked in honey or sugar to create a chunky syrup. This syrupy candied fruit is mixed with hot water as a fragrant tea, where the fruit at the bottom of the cup is eaten as well. Often perserved in the syrup for the cold months, Yuja tea served as a source of fruit in winter. It is also popular in Taiwan, where it is known as 柚子茶 (Youzi cha)."
[Note: The Korean Yuja is the same as the Japanese Yuzu 柚子 and must be different from the citron being described in this article. The Japanese Yuzu = Citrus junos.]
Citric acid
"Citric acid is a weak organic acid. It can be found in citrus fruits ( like oranges). It is used by organisms for Krebs cycle. It acts like a preservative when added to food. It is also used to add a sour (acidic) taste to foods and soft drinks. In the European Union it is known as E 330, as a food additive."
"Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first who could extract citric acid from lemons, in 1782. The substance was probably known to alchemists, perhaps with a different name. The Arabian alchemist Geber is said to have discovered citric acid in the 9th century. Citric Acid contains 6 Carbon atoms, 8 Hydrogen atoms and 7 Oxygen atoms. Its chemical formula is C6H8O7."
Geber
"Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (; ; died between 806 and 816), is the name for the writer of a great number of writings in Arabic. The writings together have the name Jabirian corpus. The most important subjects of these writings are: alchemy, cosmology, numerology, astrology, medicine, magic, mysticism, and philosophy."
"Jabir's writings have in them the oldest known list of chemical substances. For the first time, the writings gave an explanation of how to produce an inorganic substance (ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair)."
"Modern scholars doubt the historical existence of Jabir. It is probable that one person did not write all of the writings in the Jabirian corpus. Instead, scholars see Jabir ibn Hayyan as a pseudonym that a group of writers used."
"Translations into Latin of some of Jabir's Arabic writings (like the ""Book of Mercy"", and the ""Book of Seventy"") came into existence in the Middle Ages. In Latin, Jabir had the name ""Geber"", a transliteration of ""Jabir""."
"In 13th-century Europe an anonymous writer, called pseudo-Geber, started to produce new writings about alchemy under the name Geber. People still read the in the 17th century. The """" was one of the writings that pseudo-Geber produced in the 13th century. It was an influence on early modern chemists like Robert Boyle (1627–1691)."
Carl Wilhelm Scheele
"Carl Wilhelm Scheele (December 9, 1742 - May 21, 1786) a German-Swedish pharmaceutical chemist, born in Stralsund, Western Pomerania, Germany (at the time under Swedish rule), was the discoverer of many chemical substances, most notably discovering oxygen before Joseph Priestley and chlorine before Humphry Davy."
Micheline Calmy-Rey
Micheline Calmy-Rey (born 8 July 1945) is a Swiss politician. She was Switzerland's foreign minister as head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. She was also a member of the Swiss Federal Council from 2003. She was President of the Confederation in 2007 and again in 2011. She resigned her office as member of the Federal Council on 31 December 2011.
Criss Angel Mindfreak
"Criss Angel Mindfreak is an American television program. The program is hosted by illusionist Criss Angel. Angel performs many different types of stunts and illusions on the program such as street magic, levitation, and setting himself on fire. The program was first shown on July 20, 2005. It is shown and distributed by the A&amp;E network."
Piano trio
"A piano trio is a group of three instruments including a piano. Usually it is a piano, a violin and a cello. This combination of instruments has been a very popular form of chamber music from the Classical music period onwards. A piano trio can also mean a piece of music written for a piano trio to play."
"Other combinations of piano with two instruments are often called by the featuring wind instrument. For example: Mozart wrote a trio for piano, clarinet and viola which is usually called a “clarinet trio”. Brahms wrote a trio for piano, violin and French horn which is usually called a “horn trio”."
Music for three people to play at one piano is called music for piano six hands.
Famous music for piano trio.
"Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote several piano trios for the traditional combination of piano, violin and cello. Beethoven’s last piano trio has the nickname ""Archduke"" because it was written for the Archduke Rudolph. Franz Schubert wrote two beautiful piano trios."
"In the Romantic period some of the best piano trios were written by Felix Mendelssohn, Antonín Dvořák, César Franck and Pyotr Tchaikovsky."
In the 20th century Maurice Ravel and Dmitri Shostakovich each wrote a famous piano trio.
"The body of the wild boar, when seen from the side, often looks very big. This impression is partly because, compared to the large body mass, the legs of the wild boar are short and do not look very strong. The wild boar's head is very large. Its eyes are high up on the head, while the ears are small with bristles around it. Its tail can move very quickly, and the wild boar often uses it to show when his mood. If seen from the front, the body looks quite narrow. The wild boar has 44 teeth in its jaw, which helps its strong bite. The male and the female wild boars' snout shapes are different."
Piglets.
A wild boar usually gives birth to about 4 – 6 piglets at a time. Piglets weigh from about 750 – 1000g when they are first born. They are fully weaned after 3 – 4 months. They begin eating solid foods such as worms and grubs after about 2 weeks.
In culture.
"Wild boar appears in European culture as symbol of warrior virtues. It also appears in Greek, Norse mythologies, vaishnavism, hinduism."
Narasimha
"Narasimha, according to Hinduism, was the fourth avatar of Vishnu. In this form, Vishnu had the body of a man, but he had a head of a lion. This avatar of Vishnu is also a symbol of great strength."
"The Hindu scriptures tell this story about Narashimha. There was a demon (a ""daitya"") named Hiranyakashipu. He was against all gods. But, his son named Prahlad used to worship the gods, especially Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu was not happy at his son and wanted to burn him to death. Hiranyakashipu also wanted to kill everyone who worshipped the gods and make everyone worship him instead. Vishnu became Narasimha, and protected Prahlad and other people who worshipped the gods by stopping Hiranyakashipu. Brahma had granted Hiranyakashipu a boon that kept him safe so that he could not be killed by a human, animal or deva. He also could not be killed in the day or night, or inside or outside of his palace. This made Hiranyakashipu believe that no one could kill him. When he wanted to kill his son for worshiping Vishnu, Vishnu came to earth incarnated as a half-man, half-lion creature (neither man nor human). This way Vishnu killed Hiranyakashipu in the twilight (neither day, nor night) and on the porch of the palace (neither inside, nor outside), without disrupting the boon given to him by Brahma. Now, Narasimha Jayanti is celebrated across the world."
Prahlada
"Hindus believe that Prahlada was a good person. He was the son of Hiranyakashipu, his evil father, and he worshipped Vishnu. Narasimha protected him from Hiranyakashipu."
Yuga
"Hindus believe that there are periods of time called yugas (""ages"" or ""eras""): Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. When Kali Yuga ends, a new Satya Yuga begins."
Vamana
"Hindus believe that Vishnu has many important avatars. The Vamana avatar was the fifth avatar. In this avatar, Vishnu was in the form of a human.Vamana avatar is basically in the form of a bramhin(a caste in hinduism which is responsible for ancient spiritual, cultural, educational activitiesand the highest in the Varnas) was taken for a demon king 'Bali'. Lord Vishnu in this avatar asked Bali to offer him 'three feet land' as a form of offering a king offered to a brahmin as a goodwill during ancient times in hindu culture. The story goes when king Bali captured the Adobe of hindu demigods and caused them a fierce battle. 'Aditi' - the mother figure of demigods in hinduism prayed to Lord Vishnu and pleased by her prayers, Lord Vishnu appeared and assured her a boon. In a thought of revenge , she wished that may Bali loose his whole wealth and power."""
"Lord Vamana (lord Vishnu) when asked Bali for three feet land then Bali laughed and said ""Brahamandeva (O Brahmin) you might have asked many luxurious things from me as dakshina but you asked such a menial thing of land of a three feet quantity?"" After which Lord Vamana grew so large in size as his one feet could cover whole Earth and other whole heaven! That means, whole land property of Bali was under control of lord Vamana. As per Bali's oath, there was no more land to donate and one feet of lord was remaining. Bali asked lord about who is greater, the thing or who gives the thing? Lord answer was the donar or giver of the thing is greater than the thing. Then king Bali asked the Lord to keep his third feet on his (Bali) head!

Parashurama
"Hindus believe that Vishnu has many important avatars. The Parashurama also known as parshurama avatar was the sixth important avatar. In this avatar, Vishnu was in the form of a human. He came to Earth to stop bad people. He was the son of sage Jamdagni, a sage who was known for his temper. It is believed that parashurma was cheiranjiv it means that he was immortal. He was the great devotee of Lord Shiva. Parshurama's mother Renuka Devi was daughter of kshatriya after receiving Parashurma from Lord Shiva as a boon it was impossible to defeat parashurma in Earth. He was the first brahmakshatriya (both brahmin and kshatriya warrior)"
It is said that he was born before the Lord Rama and still he is alive.In Mahabharata he tought
Dronacharya Bhishma and karna.It is believed that he will teach war skills to the tenth avatar of Vishnu (kalki) once he cutt of the right tusk of Lord Ganesha.
Because Ganesha was not letting him in to meet Lord Shiva when Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva grew up with anger after hearing this but after they forgive parashurma.
Balarama
"Hindus believe that Balram was the older brother of Krishna. Some Hindus believe that he is an avatar of Vishnu’s shesh naag. In this avatar, Shesh naag was in the form of a human."
Ba Ðình Square
"Ba Đình Square (Vietnamese: Quảng Trường Ba Đình) is a place in the Vietnamese capital, Hà Nội. It is where Vietnamese President Hồ Chí Minh declared the independence of the Democratic Republic of Việt Nam from French imperialist rule on 2 September 1945, the same day that World War II ended. This is now where his mausoleum is."
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
"The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is an international treaty signed in 2001. The treaty became effective in May 2004. Its aim is to limit the use and production of Persistent Organic Pollutants. Examples of substances affected by the treaty are Polychlorinated biphenyl and Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. An extension to the treaty in 2009 added other substances, like Lindane. Critics have said that the treaty limits the effectiveness of the fight against diseases such as malaria. This is not the case, as the use of certain substances for vector control is permitted; this includes the use against mosquitoes."

Dark Circle
"Dark Circle is a documentary movie about anti-nuclear protest activity. The protest is mainly focused on Diablo Canyon (Nuclear) Power Plant in California. The point of view is clearly in favor of the protesters. They believe that the protests delayed government licensing of the Diablo Canyon (Nuclear) Power Plant. They believe that as a result of this delay,construction errors were made public before the plant started operating."
"The director is Judy Irving. The movie is a 1982 release. It is said to be ""still powerful"" long after its initial release."
Protest leader Raye Fleming takes central role. She leaflets power plant workers going to work and later leads protesters. Two thousand people were arrested at the demonstrations. This established a record for anti-nuclear civil disobedience in the US.

Acute radiation syndrome
"Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) also known as radiation poisoning, radiation sickness or radiation toxicity, is a syndrome or group of health effects which occur within months of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation. The term generally refers to acute (serious, rapid onset) problems rather than ones that develop after a prolonged period. It is mainly damage to the blood, digestive system, and nervous system."

"Castorocauda was a genus of small, semi-aquatic proto-mammals which lived in the Jurassic period, about 154 million years ago."
"Its fossil was found in lakebed sediments of the Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia. ""Castorocauda"" was highly specialized, with adaptations like those of modern semi-aquatic mammals such as beavers, otters, and the platypus (convergent evolution). It is the earliest animal found with fur."
"""Castorocauda"" is one of the near-mammals in a group called the Docodonta."
"Although ""Castorocauda"" was not a crown group mammal, it is important in the study of how mammals evolved. It was the first find with an almost complete skeleton. Also it is not a ""small nocturnal insectivore""."

Gustave Doré
"Paul Gustave Doré (; January 6, 1832 – January 23, 1883) was a French artist, engraver, illustrator and sculptor. Most of Doré's work was wood engraving and steel engraving."
Biography.
"Doré was born in Strasbourg. His first illustrated story was published at the age of fifteen. As a young man, he began work as a literary illustrator in Paris. He was hired to illustrate scenes from books by Rabelais, Balzac, Milton and Dante."
"In 1853, Doré was asked to illustrate the works of Lord Byron. British publishers asked him to do more work, including a new illustrated English Bible. Ten years later, he illustrated a French edition of Cervantes's ""Don Quixote"". His images of the knight and Sancho Panza have influenced later readers, artists, and stage and film directors' ideas of how the two characters looked. Doré also illustrated an edition of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Raven"" with larger than usual pages. He was paid 30,000 francs by the publisher Harper &amp; Brothers in 1883."
"Doré's English Bible (1866) was a great success, and in 1867 Doré had a major exhibition of his work in London. The Doré Gallery in Covelant Bond Street opened after the show. In 1869, Blanchard Jerrold suggested that they work together to make a complete portrait of London. Jerrold got the idea from ""The Microcosm of London"" produced by Rudolph Ackermann, William Pyne, and Thomas Rowlandson in 1808. Doré signed a five-year contract with the publishers Grant &amp; Co. He had to stay in London for three months each year. He was paid £10,000 a year for the project."
"The completed book, ""London: A Pilgrimage,"" was published in 1872. It had 180 engravings. The book was successful financially and influenced many people. However, many critics at the time disliked it. Some of these critics wrote that Doré paid too much attention to the poverty in parts of London."
"The republic territory is in the semi-desert zone which prominent feature is the completeness of a vegetative cover shown in a combination of steppe and deserted plots, and is most forestless region of the Russian Federation."
Sochi
"Sochi (Russuan:Со́чи) is a city in Russia on the Black Sea coast. It is in the Russian federal subject of Krasnodar Krai. The 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics were played there. The Sochi Olympic Stadium will also be used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches. Sochi is also a popular health resort. It is one of very few places in Russia with a humid subtropical climate (""Cfa"" in the Köppen climate classification)."
Catherine II of Russia
"Catherine II of Russia (also titled Catherine the Great or Yekaterina Aleksei'evna) (April 21, 1729, Stettin, Germany – November 17, 1796 Tsarskoye Selo, Russia) was Empress of Russia. She came to power by a coup d'état that deposed her husband, who was killed."
"Catherine greatly increased the power of the crown. In wars against the Ottoman Empire and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth she conquered much land in the west and south. During Catherine's rule, Russia became a strong power in Europe."
Early life.
"Catherine was born in Stettin, which was a part of the Kingdom of Prussia at the time. She was the daughter of Prince Christian August of Anhalt-Zerbst and Princess Johanna Elizabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. She had five brothers and sisters. She married her cousin Peter III (who, like Catherine, was German) at age fifteen, and became empress of Russia at age 32. She was educated in three languages (Russian, German and French). She grew up as a Lutheran (Protestant). When she married Peter, she changed to the Russian Orthodox church."
Marriage.
"Catherine's marriage was said to be unfaithful and distraught. Peter and Catherine were each said to have several lovers. After they had been married nine years, Catherine bore a son, Paul. Paul was born on . Both parents accepted him as legitimate, even though there had been rumors about Catherine having been unfaithful. Catherine also had a daughter Anna, born in 1757. Anna died in 1759. Catherine and Peter had a very difficult relationship. When Peter died, Catherine was left to rule Russia on her own. Catherine had many lovers, probably because of the difficult marriage; over twenty lovers are known. A few of these seem to be more important:"
Reign.
"Six months after Peter took the throne, Catherine led a palace coup to overthrow him. The question of who killed him and why is still much discussed. Catherine was greatly admired by the public. She was much involved in foreign affairs, including successful Russo-Turkish Wars which conquered new territories for Russia."
Death.
"Catherine suffered a stroke on 1. Due to the stroke, she lost consciousness. She died in her bed at 9:20 the following evening, while she was still unconscious. Catherine was buried at the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg."
Hiccups
"A hiccup (also spelled hiccough) is sudden tightening of the diaphragm, which is a muscle inside the chest and below the lungs that causes air to be pulled in. A short time after diaphragm contracts, the throat suddenly closes. This closing stops the air from flowing in, and results in the ""hic"" sound that gives ""hiccups"" its name. A hiccup is a reflex, a kind of action happens in the body without trying. Hiccups often repeat several times per minute, and end on their own after a few minutes."
"Sometimes a single hiccup happens, or they may happen over and over, a few times each minute, in a series called a ""bout"" of hiccups. Hiccups are rhythmic: the time between one hiccup and the next usually doesn't change much. A bout of hiccups generally ends by itself, without having to doing anything to end it on purpose. Many home remedies (cures) are often tried to attempt to shorten how long the hiccups last, because hiccups can be uncomfortable and make it hard to pay attention to other things. It is rare that medical help is necessary because it is rare that they last long enough to cause any harm."
"Hiccups may be triggered (started) by several common human conditions such as swallowing air, eating very quickly, and laughing for a long time. They can also be caused by some drugs and by some diseases."
The reason that people hiccup is not known for sure. A leading theory (idea) is that hiccups evolved to help human babies and other young mammals obtain milk more easily during breast feeding. This is related to the pattern that hiccups often happen when a bubble of air forms below the diaphragm and takes up space in the belly.
Napoleonic era
"The Napoléonic era was a time in the history of France and Europe. This era existed during the fourth and final stage of the French Revolution. It is the time when Napoleon ruled France. The Napoleonic era begins when Napoléon Bonaparte began to rule by overthrowing the government of France which was then called the Directory, creating the French Consulate. The era ends with Hundred Days and his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (November 9, 1799 - June 28, 1815). Afterwards, the Congress of Vienna tried to bring Europe back to pre-French Revolution days."
It was a time of many wars in Europe.
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
"The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was the Yugoslav state that existed from the second half of World War II (1943) until it was formally dissolved in 1992 (""de facto"" dissolved in 1991 with no leaders representing it) amid the Yugoslav wars. It was a socialist state and a federation made up of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia."
"Josip Broz Tito ruled Yugoslavia until 1980 when he died. In June 1991 Slovenia and Croatia declared independence. By 1992, only two states still wanted a union, Serbia and Montenegro. They formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was not recognized as the successor of the SFRY by international leaders."

Amazon River
"The Amazon River (also called ""Rio Amazonas"" in Portuguese and Spanish) is the largest river in the world by the amount or volume of water it carries. It flows through the tropical forests of South America, mainly in Brazil. Its headwaters are in the Andes Mountains in Peru, on the western edge of South America and flows eastward into the Atlantic Ocean near the equator."
"The Amazon River moves more water than the next eight largest rivers of the world combined and has the largest drainage basin in the world. It accounts for about one fifth of the world's total river flow. During the wet season, parts of the Amazon exceed in width. Because of its size, it is sometimes called ""The Sea"", but it is not the world's ""longest"" river system. The world's longest river is the Nile River, with the Amazon being second-longest."
Overview.
"All the main tributaries to the Amazon River have their own names. They start in the mountains (Andes) as clear water with high oxygen content, and connect with the other rivers as they all flow towards the mouth of the Amazon."
"The water of the Amazon ends up full of mud. This is especially true of its Rio Negro tributary). In the nutritious mud live a huge number of insects, small crustacea, parasites. On these small fry live predators, birds, fish and life generally. The mud is what causes this huge array of life. The mud has nutrients, and on this the flies and fish all the other animals depend."
Size and path.
"It is one of the longest rivers in the world. There have been different studies that have tried to measure its exact length. As the studies have come up with different numbers, it is therefore difficult to give an exact number. The length also changes in the rainy season. Several studies from Brazil, Spain and Chile say it is the longest river in the world, longer than the Nile. The Nile has a length of . The Amazon may have a length of . The Spanish daily newspaper El País gives its length at . In 2007, scientists from Peru and Brazil calculated a length of ."
"A study done in 1969 says that the Amazon has a length of . This was measured from a part of the River Apurimac. Until the 1970s, it was thought that the Marañón River was the source of the Amazon. In 2001, an expedition found that Nevado Mismi was in fact the source of the Amazon. Another document of the Geographic society of Lima gives the length of the Amazon at over ."
"The source of the Amazon is in the Andes Mountains of western South America. It flows east from there to the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the huge river and its many tributaries are in the country of Brazil. There are many places on the Amazon where a person on one side of the river cannot see the other side. The Brazilians call the Amazon the ""River Sea."" The Amazon is navigable from the ocean to Peru. Ocean ships can travel on the Amazon all the way across Brazil, and most of South America, to the city of Iquitos in Peru."
"One characteristic of the Amazon river is the ""Brazo Casiquiare"", a water connection to the Orinoco river into Venezuela, that connects the two basins."
Estuary.
"The estuary of the Amazon is about wide. The width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo do Norte to Punto Patijoca. Generally, the outlet of the Para River is included. It is wide, and forms the estuary of the Tocantins. The estuary also includes the island of Marajó, which lies in the mouth of the Amazon. This means that the Amazon is wider at its mouth than the entire length of the Thames river in England."
"Along the coastline, near Cabo do Norte, there are many islands partially covered with water. There are also sandbanks. The tides of the Atlantic generate a wave that reaches into the Amazon river. This wave goes along the coast for about . The phenomenon of this wave generated by the tides is called a tidal bore. Locally it is known as ""pororoca"". The pororoca occurs where the water is less than deep. It starts with a loud noise, and advances at a speed of . The bore is the reason the Amazon does not have a delta. The ocean rapidly carries away the large amount of silt brought by the Amazon. This makes it impossible for a delta to grow past the shoreline. It also has a very large tide, that can reach . The place has become popular for river surfing."
Uses.
The Amazon River has many uses:
"""Uses"" suggests that the wonders of the Earth are there for our taking. They are not. It is up to us what we do, and the Amazon has already been greatly damaged by greed and corruption. Logging its trees and changing the ecosystem to farmland is already far advanced."
Bridges.
"There are no bridges across the entire width of the river. This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry, so there is no need to build a bridge. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro (a tributary of the Amazon)."
"The river is the main route of traffic in the region. Most cities are on the banks of the river. The biggest city on the river is Manaus, which is also the capital of the Brazilian State of Amazonas. Many native people live in the Amazon, such as the Urarina who live in Peru."
Trade route.
"Big ocean boats can get up the river until Manaus, which is almost 1500 kilometers (900 miles) from its mouth. Smaller ocean ships of 3,000 tons and 7.9 m (26 ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos in Peru, 3,700 km (2,300 miles) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km (486 mi) higher as far as Actual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently go up to the Pogo Ode Escherichia's, just above Actual Point."
Pyramid
"A pyramid is a structure, usually made of stone, built in the shape of a pyramid. From ancient to modern times people in many different parts of the world have built such structures."
"The word ""pyramid"" comes from the Greek word ""pyramis"" which meant ""wheat cake."" The ancient Egyptian word for them was something like ""Mer"". The Great Pyramid of Giza was one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world."
The first pyramids were built in 2630 B.C. The oldest known pyramid was made for king Djoser of the third Dynasty.
Egyptian pyramids.
"In Egypt, kings and queens, called Pharaohs, were buried in the tombs of huge square-bottomed pyramids built of stone. They were usually built to be used as tombs for Pharaohs. The ancient Egyptian pyramids are very well built. Some of the pyramids still stand today."
"The oldest man-made pyramid found is called the Step pyramid. It is in the Giza Necropolis in Saqqara, near Cairo, Egypt. It was built for King Djoser thousands of years ago. Later pyramids were built much larger. The largest one was the Great Pyramid of Giza. It is near Cairo. It was the tallest building in the world until the Eiffel Tower was built in Paris, in 1889. The Great Pyramid was built by the pharaoh Khufu (= Cheops) from the Ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom. Herodotus was told by his Egyptian guides that it took twenty years for a force of 100,000 slaves to build the pyramid (with another ten years to build a stone causeway that connected to a temple in the valley below)."
"People once thought pyramids were built by slaves. More recent evidence suggests that the workers who built the pyramids were paid and well-cared for. They were loyal to the Pharaoh. Inside the Great Pyramid, famous man-made objects have been found from ancient times. Many valuable items were buried with the dead Pharaohs, in the hope that they would take them to the afterlife. Pyramids usually had traps to stop thieves from escaping easily. Tomb thieves were punished by death if they were caught. However, by 1000 BC, many of the pyramids had been robbed of their precious treasures."
A large statue of a Sphinx stands near the pyramids at Giza. It has the body of a Lion and the head of a Pharaoh.
"He was also honored with the Award of the Yugoslavian Radio-Television (Ohrid, 1972), awards of the City of Belgrade for the best concert in the previous concert season (1976, 1981, 1986), as well as with 7th July Award (1962), the state’s highest award for the arts."
State awards.
"In 2007, upon recommendation of the Expert Committee of the Ministry of Culture, he was awarded Special Acknowledgement for the Highest Contribution to the National Culture of the Republic of Serbia. In 2010 the Association of Musical Artists of Serbia awarded him with The Lifetime Achievement Award."

Flash memory
"Flash memory is a memory storage device for computers and electronics. It is most often used in devices like digital cameras, USB flash drives, and video games. It was developed in the 1980s from the earlier and similar EEPROM."
"Flash memory is different from RAM because RAM is volatile (not permanent). When power is turned off, RAM loses all its data. Flash can keep its data intact with no power at all. A hard drive is also permanent (non-volatile) storage, but it is bulky and fragile. Flash memory is one kind of Non-volatile random-access memory. It is slower than RAM but faster than hard drives. It is often used in small electronics because of its small size and lack of moving parts."
"The main weakness of flash memory is that it is more expensive than hard drives for the same amount of storage. Another weakness is the number of times that data can be written to it. Data can be read from flash as many times as desired, but after a certain number of ""write"" operations, ""write cycles"", it will stop working. Most flash devices are designed for about 100,000 - 1,000,000 write cycles."
"EEPROM has the same limitation that flash does: ones made in the 20th century could only survive about 100,000 write cycles, later increased to about a million. It is more expensive than flash, so it is rarely used for storage greater than 128kB. The main difference between EEPROM and flash memory is that most EEPROM devices can erase any byte of memory at any time. Flash memory can only erase an entire chunk, or ""sector"", of memory at a time. Both EEPROM and flash are subject to the limitation that only bytes in an 'erased' state can be written, which means that if the user wants to change only one byte of flash, the entire sector must be erased and re-written. This means that flash memory can wear out faster than EEPROM. Some flash memory can store hundreds of gigabytes, or even terabytes. Many are in the form of a pen drive."
"Flash memory is used in USB Drives, solid-state drives, computer RAM (occasionally), hybrid drives (small SSD + hard drive), graphics cards, and memory cards."
Bottrop
"Bottrop is a city in west central Germany, on the Rhine-Herne Canal, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Nordrhein-Westfalen). Bottrop is in the Ruhr industrial area, It is next to Essen, Oberhausen, Gladbeck and Dorsten. The city had been a coal-mining and rail center. There are factories producing coal-tar derivatives, chemicals, textiles, and machinery. The population is currently 119,655. Bottrop grew as a mining center beginning in the 1860s and was chartered as a city in 1921. In 1975 it was put together with the unification with the neighbor communities of Gladbeck and Kirchhellen, but Gladbeck left in 1976."
History.
"The place is first heard of in 1150, as ""Borthorpe"". This name means ""village on the hillside"". In the year 1423, Bottrop is awarded the status of a market town. In 1786 the first cotton mill opens. Coal mining starts in 1856. The city gets town privileges in 1919. In 1953, the population passed 100.000 people for the first time."
Katsuyama Castle Museum
"Katsuyama Castle Museum (勝山城博物館, ""Katsuyama-jō Hakubutsukan"") is a museum that is in the city of Katsuyama in Fukui Prefecture in Japan. The museum was finished on July 19, 1992. It is considered to be the tallest castle in Japan, at 57.8 meters, but it is not a castle because it does not have a ""tenshu"" or ""tenshukaku""–a “keep tower” (tower to defend from enemies). It was built to look like the Himeji castle. The museum also stands out because it has dragons cut into its foundation stone, which is unusual for a Japanese castle."
History behind the construction.
"During the Edo period in Japan, the territory of modern Katsuyama City belonged to the Echizen-Katsuyama Domain (region). During that time, the city was planning to build a ""tenshu"". However, for different reasons, such as the laws that were in place at that time, the city was never able to finish it. Kiyoshi Tada, who was born in Katsuyama and who was the founder of Sōgōtakushi, a taxi company that is nowadays divided into many different taxi companies, decided to build a castle, and put into life the long wish of people for a ""tenshu"". Instead of a usual castle he built a museum that looks like a castle, where different items from his own collection are displayed nowadays, including various samurai armor, swords, and traditional folding screens. The museum was built close to another gift to Katsuyama from Kiyoshi Tada--""Echizen Daibutsu"", a complex of buildings built in a traditional Japanese style with a huge Buddha statue in it. The cost of construction was 10 billion yen."
Modern times.
"Since the opening, the museum has been managed by the Tada Kiyoshi Cultural Educational Commemoration Foundation (""多田清文化教育記念財団"", ""Tada Kiyoshi Bunka Kyōiku Kinen Zaidan""). In 2014, the Katsuyama Castle Museum started working together with the Katsuyama City government."
"In addition to Kiyoshi Tada’s own collection, the museum also displays a collection of more than 800 articles of embroidery of the Qing dynasty in China. There is also a collection of works by famous calligrapher Goseki Nishiwaki shown in the museum."
"Many events are held on the museum territory throughout the year, including tea ceremonies, haiku competitions, various concerts, and collaborations with the government and other museums. (Please check the information before visiting there as the event may be canceled or changed due to the influence of the coronavirus."
"In 2019 alone 12,5000 people visited either the museum and/or the ""Echizen Daibutsu""."
You can overlook the city of Katsuyama from the observation room on the top floor.

Lyft started in the summer of 2012.
Ucanha
"Ucanha is a place in northern Yucatán, Mexico, where scientists dig up Mayan ruins. It used to be a town where Mayans lived. People lived in Ucanha during the Late Preclassic period (ca. 300 B.C. — ca. A.D. 250). It was about 2.2 square kilometers in size. There were about 400 households. It was connected to a larger town, Uci, by a wide stone causeway. Uci is 13 km to the west of Ucanha."
"A large brightly colored stucco mask was discovered in Ucanha in 2017. It is about two meters tall and was found in a building near the center of Ucanha. Although masks like this one have been found in other Maya sites, this is the only one known for this part of Mexico."
The mask has been repaired so it looks the way it did when it was new. The archaeologists buried the mask again to preserve it and because the site is not legally protected.
Insemination
"For organisms that reproduce sexually, insemination is the transfer of male gametes (usually sperm) into the female reproductive tract, for the purpose of generating offspring. In mammals, this is the uterus, in birds, this is the oviduct. Insemination happens naturally during sexual intercourse, or copulation. It can also be done artificially, in which case it is called artificial insemination."
Pavel Eljanov
Pavel Eljanov (born 1983) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster.
"Eljanov's most notable tournament result to date was winning Corus B tournament 2007 in Wijk aan Zee, Holland with a score of 9/13. This result enabled him to qualify for the category 20 tournament Corus A 2008."
"On the September 2010 FIDE rating list, Eljanov had a rating of 2761, making him number 1 in Ukraine and number 6 in the world. His results in the Russian premier league had been exceptional. Since then he has slipped to #21."
Lactase
"Lactase is an enzyme which acts on lactose, breaking it down so it can be digested."
"Mammals in their infancy usually make lactase: they need it for digesting the lactose found in their mother's milk. Mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase. Thus, if you give milk to an adult cat it causes discomfort and diarrhea."
Lactase evolution in humans.
"Humans are somewhat different. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of polymorphism."
The ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the development of animal husbandry. This created a system providing a consistent supply of milk.
Hunter-gatherer populations before the Neolithic revolution were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant. So are modern hunter-gatherers.
Genetics.
"A mutation on chromosome #2 stops the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives."
"This appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy consumption. It has occurred independently in both northern Europe and East Africa in populations with a pastoral lifestyle. Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait."
"Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years. Therefore, lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution. As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene–culture coevolution."
Tanduay
"Tanduay Rhum is an alcoholic drink from the Philippines. It is produced by Tanduay Distillers Inc., and with origins dating from 1854."
Asia Brewery
"Asia Brewery is a brewery founded in 1982 in Makati City, the Philippines. It is one of only two breweries in the Philippines, and is the smaller of the two, with only 10% market share. It is owned by Lucio Tan, listed by Forbes Magazine as the second richest Filipino in the Philippines, with assets worth $1.5 billion."
Products.
"It produces malt beverages like beer, shandy, iced tea, bottled water and carbonated soft drinks. Its sister company Tanduay Distillers, Inc. produces hard liquor. It somewhat mimics the structure of its bigger rival San Miguel Corporation, except that ABI has no food and agribusiness divisions."
"It offers eight beers in the Philippines with its flagship brand Beer na Beer launched in 1988 as Beer Pale Pilsen. It changed its name to Beer na Beer after lawsuits by other breweries using the term pale pilsen. In 2001, Beer na Beer was reformulated and now has 6.0% alcohol volume."
"ABI's seven other beers are sold on a somewhat limited scale, but its Colt 45 brand, launched in 1995, is the biggest among them. This malt liquor's biggest competitor is Red Horse Extra Strong from San Miguel. ABI's other licensed brands are Carlsberg (the brewery's first beer in 1987), Lone Star (launched in 2000), Lone Star Light (2002), Colt Ice (2003), Lone Star ULTRA (the country's first low-carb beer, launched in 2004, Stag (either cancelled or it's just hard to find in the country), and Coors (2008)."
"The company also offers Absolute distilled drinking water, the second biggest-selling bottled water brand in the market behind SMC's Wilkins, and Summit mineral water. They are both launched in 1992."
"In 1995, Q Shandy was launched to compete with SMC's Cali. In 1999, Pacific Sun iced tea was launched. In 2009, Asia Brewery introduced Feelgood, the first juice drink in the Philippines to contain prebiotics."
"Asia Brewery entered the low-priced carbonated soft drinks market by acquiring a license to produce Virgin Cola from Virgin Drinks. They are responsible in distributing products such as Summit Vitaminwater, ZeroCal and 100Plus."
"In 2008, Asia Brewery partnered with Cobra International Beverage Holdings, Inc. introduced the Philippine version of Cobra Energy Drink, is the ready-to-drink energy drink now in the Philippine market."

Oiran
"were courtesans in Japan. Oiran were part of Japanese society during the Edo Period, (1600–1868). Prostitution was legal then, but only in special neighborhoods that were closed to outsiders. There were different kinds of oiran, depending on their beauty, skills in art, education, and more. High-ranking oiran were called . Only nobles could be with one. Tayū had many servants, and when they went outside, their servants carried them and followed them, making a procession. They wore very expensive clothes and jewelry. Any man who wished to be with an oiran had to follow difficult rituals and etiquette."
Geisha replaced oiran. Geisha practiced common types of entertainment enjoyed by the people of that time. They became more popular than oiran. The last known oiran was in 1761. A few women still practice the arts of the oiran today (without sex) to continue the cultural heritage.
Ryōtei
"A is a type of very expensive and elegant Japanese restaurant. Traditionally they only accept new customers who are recommended by known and trusted clients. They usually include entertainment by geisha, but not always in modern times. Ryōtei are usually a place where very important business or political meetings can take place in private."
Philharmonia
The Philharmonia is an orchestra from London.
History.
"The orchestra was formed in 1945 by Walter Legge. Legge was not a conductor, but he was a man who organized a lot of music, especially recordings. The orchestra spent most of their time making gramophone recordings, but sometimes they also gave concerts. The conductor Thomas Beecham led their first concert in 1946, but Beecham had always organized his own orchestras and he wanted to organize this one. He even wanted to change the orchestra’s name. The players decided that they did not want Beecham as their conductor. Beecham went on to form another orchestra which he called the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra."
"In the first years of the Philharmonia they were conducted by several world-famous conductors, including Arturo Toscanini, Wilhelm Furtwängler and, especially, Herbert von Karajan. Karajan helped the orchestra to become one of the finest in the world, and he made many recordings with them, including all the Beethoven symphonies."
"In 1954 Karajan left to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Legge found another world-famous conductor, Otto Klemperer. Although he was already quite old, Klemperer made many excellent recordings with the orchestra. In 1959 the orchestra gave Klemperer the title of Music Director for the rest of his life."
"In 1964 Legge thought the orchestra had done enough recordings and he was going to bring it to an end. Both the orchestra and Klemperer wanted it to continue, so the orchestra made their own organizing body (like other London orchestras) and they continued, calling themselves by a new name: the ""New Philharmonia Orchestra"". They gave their first concert under their new name on 27 October 1964. It was a performance of Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 9"", conducted by Klemperer."
"The orchestra gave many more concerts after it became self-governing than it had when Legge had been organizing them. Continuing as the New Philharmonia Orchestra, it got its old name “Philharmonia Orchestra” back again in 1977, and has been known by that name ever since."
"Klemperer retired from conducting in 1971, but was officially still its principal conductor until his death in 1973. Since then the orchestra has been conducted by Lorin Maazel, Riccardo Muti, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Christoph von Dohnányi and Esa-Pekka Salonen who has conducted them since 2008."
Concerts Today.
"Today, the orchestra continues to give many concerts, travelling around Britain as well as abroad. Since 1995 they have been based in the Royal Festival Hall in London. They also give regular concerts at De Montfort Hall, Leicester and the Corn Exchange, Bedford. Abroad they often play in the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam."
Recordings.
"The Philharmonia has made more than one thousand recordings. It has also been heard on the soundtracks of many films, including such classics as Laurence Olivier's 1944 film version of Shakespeare's ""Henry V"", and David Lean's film version of ""Oliver Twist"" (1948)."
Taiko
"means simply ""drum"" in Japanese. Outside Japan, the word is used to refer to any of the different kinds of Japanese drums (, ""wadaiko"", ""Japanese drum"" in Japanese) and to the more or less new art of taiko drumming bands (sometimes better called, ""kumi-daiko"", ). The taiko drum originated in the country of Japan. This drum was created by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. The taiko drum makes a very loud, deep sound."
"In a traditional Japanese village the ""odaiko"" (big drum) defined the extent of the village land. In modern Japan, wadaiko has become more of a performance art, seen only during festivals or in concert. The most famous Wadaiko performance group are 'Kodo' (meaning heart-beat). They are not only the worlds most respected Japanese drumming group, they also maintain many traditional art forms. They group lives on the island 'Sado Higashima' and live together as a community in a traditional way. Many other cultures have adopted this style of drumming, from Germany and the United States to Australia."
Kitagawa Utamaro
"Kitagawa Utamaro (;  – 31 October 1806), also called Utamaro, was a Japanese artist. He was a master of the ukiyo-e style of woodblock prints and painting."

His work was popular in Europe. He influenced artists in Europe who were called Impressionists.
"Sometimes the mother is confused, thinking that nothing has happened to her son. Throughout the film, she writes a letter addressed to Osama bin Laden. He is assumed to be responsible for the attack."
Production.
"Filming began on 26 March 2007 in London, England. Scenes were filmed on location in Northampton Square and the Brunswick Estate in Islington, North London. Filming also took place at Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road stadium and around St Albans Cathedral, St Albans School, and Westminster Lodge."
"The production also visited The Metropolitan Training College facilities near Gravesend to shoot the scenes at the football stadium, after the bomb has exploded."
Reception.
"The film received poor reviews. Tom Charity, after viewing the film at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, gave it one star out of five. He called it an ""ambitious/opportunistic effort that misses the mark, from the one-dimensional characters to the craven plotting and sentimental tone."""
"Philip French called it an ""ambitious British picture on an urgent topical subject [that] is torpedoed by a poor script."""
"""Time Out"" gave it two stars out of six. It wrote ""there are so many things wrong with writer-director Sharon Maguire’s first film since ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" in 2001 that it's hard to know where to start, but the fatal problem is that this is a film with an identity crisis""; the film at times seems like a ""study of guilt and grief"" and at other times a ""conspiracy thriller"" but ""ends up being a compendium of bizarre diversions, most of which are utterly surplus to the film’s half-cocked desire to stick with the experience and emotions of its main character."""

Escape Room 2
"Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is a 2021 psychological horror movie directed by Adam Robitel. The movie stars Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Isabelle Fuhrman, Thomas Cocquerel, Holland Roden, Carlito Olivero, and Indya Moore. It serves as a sequel to the 2019 movie ""Escape Room""."
Plot.
"After escaping the ""sole survivor"" escape rooms orchestrated by the Minos Corporation, Zoey Davis and Ben Miller decide to confront the shadowy organization after finding coordinates to its New York City–based headquarters. Zoey is encouraged by her therapist to move on from her trauma and to get over her aerophobia, but she opts to drive with Ben instead of flying."
"The pair find the headquarters derelict and are accosted by a vagrant who steals Zoey's necklace. She and Ben give chase straight into the Q subway train. Their train car separates from the rest of the train and is redirected to a remote station, sealing Zoey, Ben, and other passengers Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo inside. As the passengers realize in horror that they are once again in Minos' deadly game, the train becomes electrified. Zoey and Ben learn that the others are the ""winners"" of previous escape rooms, having survived them. To escape, the group must collect subway tokens as the electrification increases. Theo is killed while the rest escape. Nathan reveals his escape room group were all priests, Brianna's were all influencers, and Rachel's consisted of people who cannot feel physical pain."
"The next room is a bank with a slowly closing vault and a deadly laser security system. The group manages to decipher the complex route to get around the lasers and escape with just seconds to spare. While in the room, Zoey is perplexed by frequent references to someone called Sonya and that the escape rooms have no apparent connection to the group unlike before."
The next room is a postcard-like beach with more references to Sonya. They discover that the beach is covered in quicksand. Nathan sacrifices himself to save Rachel and is swallowed up by the sand. Zoey finds an alternate route out just as Brianna unlocks the intended exit. An argument on which route to take breaks out; Rachel and Ben side with Zoey. Brianna escapes through the main exit while Rachel and Ben traverse to the alternate route. Ben falls into the quicksand.
"Zoey and Rachel make their way out through a manhole back into the city. Overjoyed at first that they're outside, they quickly realize they are still in the game when they encounter a panicked Brianna. If they don't make it out of this room, acid rain is periodically sprayed on them. The group opens a taxi to escape into but once Zoey enters, the taxi locks Rachel and Brianna out. Zoey falls into the next room while Rachel and Brianna succumb to the rain and die."
"The next room is a child's bedroom containing a diary from Sonya, revealing the rooms are based on a fun day out she had with her mother. Zoey discovers Sonya's mother is Amanda Harper, who survived her fall in her original escape room and was forced into designing escape rooms for Minos after they abducted her daughter. Amanda appears and begs Zoey to become the next puzzle-maker for Minos, warning that she has no choice. Ben is revealed to be trapped in a cage. When Zoey refuses Minos' demand, Ben's cage starts filling with water, but Zoey and Amanda work together to free him. They manage to break out, fleeing the facility. They report their findings to the police, who retrieve the bodies of Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo; the news about Minos goes public. An FBI agent assures Zoey that Minos will be tracked down."
Slavery.
"Slavery has long been practiced in Africa, just like the rest of the world. But two new slave trades would create a much bigger and more violent version of slavery."
"Between the 7th and 20th centuries, the Arab slave trade took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan routes and the Indian Ocean. Between the 15th and 20th centuries (a period of 500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the Americas. While some Africans collaborated with European and Asian slave traders, many were strongly opposed to slavery and avoided, protested, or fought it violently."
"Africans who had been captured and sent to the French colony of Saint Domingue on slave ships played an important role in ending the Atlantic slave trade. They began the Haitian Revolution, which created Haiti, the first country to permanently ban slavery. After this revolution, European empires began to reduce slave trading and abolitionism became more popular. Between 1808 and 1860, the British Navy captured approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard."
Colonialism.
"In the late 19th century, the European powers occupied much of the continent, creating many colonial and dependent territories. They left only two fully independent states: Liberia and Ethiopia (which the Europeans called “Abyssinia"")."
"Egypt and Sudan were never formally made a part of any European colonial empire. However, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922."
Modern history.
"African independence movements had their first success in 1951, when Libya became the first former colony to become independent. Modern African history is full of revolutions and wars, as well as the growth of modern African economies and democratization across the continent."
"A civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) began in 1998. Neighbouring African countries have become involved. Since the conflict began, it has killed an estimated 5.5 million people."
Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries.
Climate.
"From north to south, Africa has most types of climate. In sequence from the north:"
"Running north-east to the south is the East African Great Rift Valley. This has mountains, volcanoes, deep rifts and valleys, rivers and lakes."
"In fact, Africa has examples of most of the Earth's climate types."
Rainfall.
"Much of North Africa is dry and hot: it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive much rain. In Saharan Africa, there are few rivers or other water sources. Underground water sources are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An oasis is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert."
"In that part of the world, the wind comes mostly from the east. That does bring rain, but the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau block the monsoon rain and prevent it from getting to North Africa. Also, the Atlas Mountains near the north coast"
of Africa prevent rain from coming in from the north. That is another rain shadow.
These two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the Sahara desert.
"Conditions and winds are different further south, where huge amounts of rainfall near the equator. The equator runs across the middle of Africa (see red line drawn on map). That means much of Africa is between the two tropics:"
Plants and animals.
"Africa has a lot of wildlife. There are many types of animals there. In particular, it is now the only continent that has many native species of large mammals. Some of them occur in very large numbers. There are antelope, buffalo, zebra, cheetah, elephant, lion, giraffe, rhinoceros, apes, hyaena, and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers."
Politics.
"The African Union (AU) is an international organisation. It aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial, and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament. A person becomes President of the AU by being elected to the PAP and then gaining majority support in the PAP."
"Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire. There are 54 UN member states in Africa."
People.
Africa was the homeland for the first people.
"People who come from Africa are called Africans. People in the north are called North Africans and people in the south are called South Africans. Languages in eastern Africa include Swahili, Oromo and Amharic. Languages in western Africa include Lingala, Igbo, Hausa and Fulani. The most popular language in Northern Africa is Arabic."
The most populated country in Africa is Nigeria.
African diaspora.
Countries with significant African descendents outside Africa:

Carnival
"Carnival is a public festival which takes place in many cities and towns in many countries around the world. It is in February or March each year. Carnival can sometimes last for several weeks. In some places there is only one day of celebration. There are often street parades, bands, costumes and many people wear masks. Carnival is linked to religious traditions in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, and it is also linked to local customs."
Background.
Lent.
"Many Christian churches have a 40-day ""season"" of fasting called Lent, in which Christians prepare for Easter which is one of the two most important feasts in the Christian year (the other being Christmas). Easter is in late March or April. Lent always begins on a Wednesday, which is called Ash Wednesday in February or March. On that day, many people go to church and have some ash smeared on their forehead as a sign of sorrow for their sins. Then for 40 days, they try to work hard on improving themselves and thinking about the teachings of Jesus. It is usual for people to ""give up"" something for Lent. They might stop smoking or stop watching TV so they can spend more time reading the Bible or talking with the family. Many people give up all their favourite foods and have no cake, wine, beer, chocolate, ice cream or other luxury foods."
"The name ""carnivale"" comes from Italian and means ""putting aside the flesh"". This means that during Lent people were not to think about their ""flesh"" (their bodies) but do things that were good for their souls. The word ""flesh"""" also means ""meat"" so many people would eat no meat during Lent."
Mardi Gras.
"Mardi Gras means ""Fat Tuesday"". This was the day just before Lent. The first day of Lent was called Mecredi Meagre meaning ""Mean Wednesday"". (""Mean"" used to mean ""poor"" and ""thin"" rather than ""nasty"".)"
"During the Middle Ages in Europe, it was normal for people to have a big feast on the Tuesday before the Lenten fast started. In many towns this developed into a big public party, with entertainment in the town square. There is a famous painting by Pieter Bruegel dating from the 1550s and showing the ""Battle of Carnival and Lent"". (See top of page)"
About Pieter Bruegel's famous painting.
"In this picture by Pieter Bruegel, a man representing Carnival is pushed on a barrel by people in costumes and masks. He is about to do battle with Lent. His weapon is a skewer covered with pieces of roast meat. He balances a blackbird pie on his head. Lent, who is very skinny, fights him with two little fish on a bread-board. The person at the front wears a mask and plays a very noisy instrument called a ""rummelpott""."
Modern celebrations of Carnival.
"Nowadays many cities and towns around the world celebrate Carnival for a week or more. The final day of the celebration is Mardi Gras, when there is often a parade. In some cities the Mardi Gras parade is held on the weekend before Lent begins, rather than on the Tuesday, so as not to disturb the business and traffic of the town."
"In some towns such as the Belgian town of Binche the preparations for the Carnival are complex and start many weeks before Carnival takes place, with most of the town's people taking part in some way. The Carnival of Binche is listed with UNESCO as an event of great historic importance because it has been held there in almost the same way for more than 500 years."
"Carnival is celebrated differently around the world, but there are some things that are similar:"
"In the Carnival of Rio de Janeiro, which is one of the biggest and most famous in the world, a major feature is the glamorous costumes as both men and women wear bright colours and wonderful headdresses to dance down the street to the sound of many bands. In Rio there are many very large and expensive decorated ""floats""."
"In New Orleans the bands are one of the most important parts of the Carnival celebrations. In Düsseldorf in Germany, one of the features of the Carnival parades are the enormous models of politicians and other well-known people. In Sydney, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardis Gras which started out as a parade for Sydney's homosexual community, now includes exhibitions, live theatre and competitions, and stretches over two weeks."
"In Venice the Carnival was celebrated from December 26 until Lent began. During that time, people were allowed to disguise themselves by wearing masks in the street. In the 1930s this was forbidden by the Italian Government, but in 1980 a mask-makers shop was set up in Venice again. Soon the old tradition was brought back, and now many people dress in costume and wear masks for two weeks before Lent begins."
"In Brussels in Belgium, the main Carnival procession is held in the Grande Place, the town square in front of the Gothic Town Hall with its huge tower. Every part of the procession is ruled by a tradition, but some of the traditions are so old that no-one remembers what they mean anymore. At the beginning of the procession is a large group of people dressed in beautiful costumes of silk and velvet, who act out an historic scene of the coming of the King of Spain and his royal court to Brussels 500 years ago. When they have taken their seats, there comes an amazing procession which includes stilt walkers, fire eaters, Goldilocks with a dancing bear, a mad camel, a wizard, lots of men in huge feathery headdresses, and the Archangel Michael whose job is to frighten the Devil. These characters are traditional to Brussels. In every city, the characters that take part are different."
Uruguay.
"The country of Uruguay in South America is a fun place to be during Carnival. In Uruguay, Carnival has its own special musical performance."
"During February and March, it is summer in Uruguay. Everybody goes into the streets, from old people to children. There are people dancing, singing, and playing a special kind of music. This kind of dance and music is called murga."
"People do murga performances in groups. The biggest groups have 17 people. They wear funny clothes with lots of colors. They play the drums and sing. The members of the groups are not professional singers or dancers. They are people with other jobs. Each group prepares and practices their own dance and songs for months. Then, they try to be the best group at the festival. Each group's dance and songs last about 45 minutes. The songs are stories about important people or events in the news, so people think watching murga is like watching a play at the theater."
"Uruguay’s Carnival started over 100 years ago. It is the world's longest and is about 40 days long. People still work during that time, but in the evenings and on weekends, they enjoy the festival."
"Different uses of the word ""carnival""."
"Although the word ""carnival"" still has its old meaning, it is often used to mean public entertainments of different kinds. Some towns have carnivals that have nothing to do with Lent and are at different times of year. Nowadays there are all sorts of different carnivals. Some of these carnivals, like the Notting Hill Carnival in London and the Melbourne Cup Racing Carnival in Australia are very famous."
"The word ""carnival"" is now used for festivals, parades and competitions of all sorts. There are school sports carnivals, folk carnivals, multi-cultural carnivals, horse racing carnivals, wine and food carnivals and boating carnivals."
Fasting
"Boyd was a photographer on the trip over the Arctic Ocean in 1941. The crew on the trip to the Arctic called her the ""Ice Woman""."
Boyd was the first person to fly over the North Pole. She did this in 1955.
"She was born in San Rafael, California. She died in San Francisco."
Ranulph Fiennes
Sir Ranulph Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes (born 7 March 1944) is an English explorer.
"Fiennes was born in Windsor, Berkshire. He was educated at Eton College."
"Fiennes wrote many books. He wrote 'The sett','Mad,bad and dangerous to know' , 'The secret Hunters' and much more."
"Fiennes has led over 30 expeditions. Ranulph did the first unsupported walk across Antarctica. Fiennes holds many records for his 52,000-mile expedition. It ended successfully on August 29, 1982. Fiennes is the only man alive ever to have travelled around the Earth's circumpolar."
He became an English explorer after joining the armed forces.
Fiennes was brought up in South Africa and lived in England for the rest of his life. He climbed Mount Everest successfully in 2009.
State ratifying conventions
State ratifying conventions are one of the two ways established by Article Five of the United States Constitution for ratifying proposed constitutional amendments. Ratifying conventions have only been used on one occasion. This was in 1933 and was used to ratify the 21st Amendment. All other proposed constitutional amendments have been offered to the state legislatures for ratification.
"The Constitution also provides that state ratifying conventions may also be used to propose a constitutional amendment. However, to date, none of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by state conventions. A state ratifying convention may be called by a two-thirds vote by a state legislature."

Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Validated on December 5, 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment (Amendment XXI) to the United States Constitution canceled the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and ended the Prohibition Era in the United States. It is the only Amendment to repeal another amendment. It is also the only Amendment to have been ratified by state ratifying conventions rather than by state legislatures."
Background.
"The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution had started a period in the US known as Prohibition. During this time the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages was illegal. Passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 was the chief goal of the temperance movement. but it soon proved highly unpopular. Crime had soared under Prohibition as gangsters, such as Chicago's Al Capone, became rich from a very profitable black market for alcohol. The federal government was unable to enforce the Volstead Act. In 1932, wealthy industrialist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. stated in a letter: As more and more Americans opposed the Eighteenth Amendment, a political movement grew for its repeal. However, repeal was complicated by grassroots politics. Although the U.S. Constitution provides two methods for ratifying constitutional amendments, only one method had been used up until that time. This was ratification by the state legislatures of three-fourths of the states. However, the wisdom of the day was that the lawmakers of many states were either obligated to or simply afraid of the temperance lobby. For that reason, when Congress formally proposed the repeal of Prohibition on February 20, 1933, it chose the ""other"" ratification method established by Article V. That is by state conventions."
Implementation.
State and local control.
"The second section bans the importation of alcohol in violation of state or territorial law. This has been interpreted to give states essentially absolute control over alcoholic beverages. Many U.S. states still remained ""dry"" (with state prohibition of alcohol) long after its ratification. Mississippi was the last, remaining dry until 1966. Kansas continued to prohibit public bars until 1987. Many states now delegate the authority over alcohol granted to them by this Amendment to their municipalities or counties (or both), which has led to many lawsuits over First Amendment rights when local governments have tried to revoke liquor licenses."
"Because of these differences, a certain piece of work may be under copyright in one country, and in the public domain in another."
Problems with copyright.
Creativity.
"Some people argue that copyright laws make it easier for people to make new works and think of new ideas. After all, if authors get to make money for the time, effort and money they put in, then they will want to make more works later, and make more money."
"But others believe that copyright laws make it harder to be creative. Without copyright, other people could reuse existing work, and copyright law often stops that."
Publisher control.
"If an author wants to sell a work, it's often easiest to give the copyright to a publisher. The publisher will do all the selling, and in return for that service, will keep part of the money. But the publisher has many different things to sell, and they may not want to sell the work the author made. Authors often find it very hard to find a publisher willing to sell their work."
"But without a publisher, it can be even harder for an author to sell his or her work. In many markets, a few big publishers own the copyrights to almost everything available, and stores will not want to sell works published by small authors themselves. Many people say copyright law helps big publishers stay in control, and keeps smaller authors out of the market. (tragedy of the anticommons)."
Open content.
"As a solution to these problems, groups of authors have come up with the idea of open content. With open content, authors give everyone permission to copy, change and give away or sell their works, as long as they follow certain rules. These rules are explained in an open content license. Some possible open content rules are:"
The term for Open Content is sometimes called Copyleft.
Republic of China
"The Republic of China (), was a country in East Asia that governed all of China before. The People's Republic of China (PRC) is located to the northwest; Japan is to the northeast; the Philippines is to the south. The Chinese Nationalists lost the Chinese Civil War to the Communists in 1949 and moved the government of the Republic of China from Nanjing to Taipei. Constitutionally, it still claims the ownership of all of China, including Mainland China, Hainan and several off-shore islands, Taiwan, Mongolia, northern Myanmar (Burma), and Tuva (now Russian territory), as part of the ROC, however this is rarely noted in recent years."
Territory.
"The territory the Republic of China (ROC) controls is known by most people as the island of Taiwan. Most places on Taiwan Island are called ""Taiwan Province"" by the government of the Republic of China for official business, except the two largest cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung. West of Taiwan Island, there are three small groups of islands that also belong to ROC. They are:"
"The ROC used to govern Mainland China too, from 1911 - 1949, and was a founding member of the UN (as China) in 1945. Today, Mainland China is governed by the Communist People's Republic of China; see History and Political problems of China. However, ROC still declares Mainland China as its territory officially. The Republic of China also used to govern Mongolia."
Administrative divisions.
There are administrative divisions in different levels and types.
"157 Districts (區 qū ㄑㄩ), 17 Country-controlled cities (縣轄市 xiànxiáshì ㄒㄧㄢˋㄒㄧㄚˊㄕˋ), 41 Urban Townships (鎮 zhèn ㄓㄣˋ), and 153 Rural Townships (鄉 xiāng ㄒㄧㄤ) stand the 3rd level. Districts stand under either Special municipalities or Provincial cities; Country-controlled cities, Urban Townships, and Rural Townships stand under Counties."
"Villages (里 lǐ ㄌㄧˇ or 村 cūn ㄘㄨㄣ) stand the 4th level, and Neighborhoods (鄰 lín ㄌㄧㄣˊ) stand the 5th level."
History.
"The Nationalists, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, got rid of the Qing Dynasty ruled by the Manchus, then they established the ROC and ended Imperial Dynastic Rule in late-1911. The ROC at that time had Mainland China and all of what is now called Mongolia."
"After the Japanese were defeated by the Allies during World War II, Taiwan was controlled by the ROC."
"In 1949, the Chinese Communists fought a war against the Nationalists and won. They established the People's Republic of China. The Nationalists left mainland China and arrived in Taiwan."
Politics.
"After the ROC created a base on Taiwan, it hoped one day to capture the Mainland. But Chinese Communists grew stronger, so the Nationalists never did go back. The Communists say they replaced the ROC as the only government of China and also calls Taiwan their own."
"Polls show a majority of people in Taiwan want to never be a part of the People's Republic of China. Some of these people believe in complete Taiwan independence and want to rename the ROC (Taiwan) to ""Republic of Taiwan"" so Taiwan can participate in international affairs. Most others want the ""status quo"", which means keeping everything the way it is now. A small minority wish to someday unite with the People's Republic of China; they want Chinese reunification."
Language.
"Most Taiwanese people speak the Standard Chinese language known as Mandarin, and others speak local dialects such as Min Nan (Taiwanese) or Hakka. The Cantonese language, spoken in parts of southern China (for example, the province of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau), is not spoken in Taiwan. A small percentage of Aboriginal Taiwanese speak aboriginal languages, but the rest of the Chinese people have treated them badly, and many of these people, and their languages, struggle to survive. Some older Taiwanese people who went to school while the country was under Japanese rule can speak Japanese."
"After the Nationalist government fled the Mainland in 1949, they brought Mandarin and promoted it in Taiwan. Then everyone in the ROC had to learn Mandarin. But, unlike the people in Mainland China, the Taiwanese never changed to simplified Chinese characters and so they have always used traditional Chinese characters. In the past, students were not allowed to speak their mother tongue in school and were expected to speak only Mandarin. Taiwanese, Hakka, and native languages were considered bad until the early 1990s, when education in these languages began to be taught in some school systems. They were promoted, but by this time, many young people could speak only Mandarin."
"Currently, nearly one third of Taiwanese report knowing some amount of English. Full English fluency is not common, however. The government plans to expand English education and make it an official language by 2030."
"The success of the first series started two revival series: one series that ran for several seasons on CBS and in syndication in the 1980s, and another series that ran on UPN from 2002 to 2003. It would also lead to a movie, a radio series, a comic book, a magazine and other spin-offs that would go on for 50 years."
"Aside from Serling himself, who wrote nearly two-thirds of the series' total episodes, writers for ""The Twilight Zone"" included authors such as Charles Beaumont, Richard Matheson, Jerry Sohl, George Clayton Johnson, Earl Hamner, Jr., Reginald Rose, Harlan Ellison and Ray Bradbury. Many episodes also featured adaptations of classic stories by such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Lewis Padgett, Jerome Bixby and Damon Knight."
"""Twilight Zone""'s writers often used science fiction as a way for social commentary. Television networks and sponsors who had censored all possible offensive material from the mostly live dramas were not aware of the methods developed by writers such as Ray Bradbury for dealing with important issues through fantasy. Themes include nuclear war, mass hysteria, and McCarthyism, subjects that were not allowed on more ""serious"" primetime television."
"The first series contained 156 episodes. Seasons 1, 2, 3, 5 were half hour shows. Season four (1962–1963) contained one-hour episodes."

Catherine Deshayes
"Caterine Deshayes, sometimes known as Catherine Monvoisin, or simply La Voisin was a murderous French serial killer. She was born around 1640, and executed as a witch on 16 February 1680, in Paris; together with several others. She played an important role in the so-called Affair of the Poisons. She lived from charging high fees to make horosocopes. She celebrated black masses, practiced abortions, sold love potions and poisons. She is said to have sacrificed infants. Together with the Hellfire club this is one of the earliest known examples of theistic satanism."
"Many nobles were among her clients, among them, Madame de Montespan a courtesan of Louis XIV."

Marge injures her shoulder in the semi-finals and she is told that she will never sweep again and that the American mixed curling team must concede the gold medal to Sweden. Lisa buys so many Olympic mascot pins that she doesn't have anymore money left so she trades her pearl necklace for a mascot pin from the 1924 Winter Olympics. Bart offers to help Lisa with defeating her pin collecting addiction and manages to get back her necklace by tricking the pin vendor with ""Fatov,"" who is a phony mascot that was ""created"" in advance for the 2014 Winter Olympics but the mascot is really Homer's mouth, clipped by Bart from his driver's license. When Marge is about to leave Vancouver, she reveals that she is left-handed to Homer and says that she always used her right hand to not seem unusual. She has enough strength to change Maggie's diaper and dress her with one hand. They both decide to re-participate in the gold medal game where they defeated Sweden and won the gold medal."
Ball and socket joint
"A ball and socket joint (enarthrosis, spheroidal joint) is a joint in which the ball-shaped surface of a bone fits into the cup-like indentation of another bone. This type of joint allows the bone to move in a 360° angle—with more freedom than other joints."
Examples.
Examples of this type of joint occur:
Alexandre Étienne Choron
"Alexandre Étienne Choron (Caen, 1837 – 1924) was a French chef. As ""chef de cuisine"" of the celebrated restaurant Voisin on the rue Saint Honoré, Choron is best known for his invention of Choron sauce, a béarnaise sauce enriched with tomato concentrate."
"Choron is also remembered for the food he served during the Siege of Paris by the Prussians, which began on 19 September 1870. During the siege, Parisians were reduced to eating cats, dogs, and rats. The bourgeois did not want to eat such ""low"" animals, and the ""de luxe"" restaurants had plenty of customers. As food reserves dwindled, these restaurants, including Voisin, improvised. Choron served exotic animal dishes at Voisin. For the midnight Christmas meal of 1870, Choron had a menu mostly of the best parts of the animals kept in the ""Jardin d'acclimatation"" (one of the Paris zoos). The menu – stuffed head of donkey, elephant consommé, roasted camel, kangaroo stew, bear shanks roasted in pepper sauce, wolf in deer sauce, cat with rat, and antelope in truffle sauce – has become legendary. The menu's wines were Mouton-Rothschild 1846, Romanée-Conti 1858 and Château Palmer 1864."
"Choron became famous for his elephant dishes (): ""Trompe d’éléphant in sauce chasseur"" and ""Éléphant bourguignon"". After the elephant at the ""Jardin d'acclimatation"" were used at the Christmas table, the two elephants (Castor and Pollux) at the Paris' ""jardin zoologique"" were consumed on 31 December 1870 at Voisin. In early January, it was the elephant at the ""Jardin des Plantes"" (Paris' botanical garden) which was sent to the abbatoir. It was bought by Choron for his restaurant at the price of 15 francs per pound. By 13 January Voisin was out of elephant meat and substituted horse. The siege was lifted two weeks later."

"There are many political parties in Greece, but only seven are in the Greek parliament. Until 2015, only two political parties formed governments, the PASOK party (which is social democratic) and New Democracy (ND, which is conservative). The government ousted in the 2015 election was led by PASOK, DIMAR, AND ND. Other parties include the Communist party, the left-wing SYRIZA party, the nationalist party and others. SYRIZA, led by Alexis Tsipras, won the 2015 parliamentary election held on January 25 of that year, and entered into a coalition government with the small right-wing party ""Greek Independents""."
The New Democracy Party won the 2019 election.
Divisions.
"The divisions of Greece are called 'Peripheries'. As of January 2011, there are 13 peripheries in Greece. Peripheries are subdivided into 'peripheral units', and previously they were known as 'prefecture', but prefectures were abolished in 2011. The most populated peripheries in Greece are Attica, where the capital city of Greece, Athens, is, and Central Macedonia, where Greece's second-largest city, Thessaloniki, is. All the peripheries, and their capital cities, are:"
Demographics.
People.
"Greece is a small country compared to other countries such as the United States, Spain , Italy, the United Kingdom and Russia. The population of Greece is estimated to be over 11 million. Most of the people in Greece are Greek people, and they form 94% of the population of the country. There are also many Albanians in Greece, and they make up 4% of the population. Other nationalities make up for another 2% of the country."
"The Greek government recognizes only the Muslim minority in the country, the Turkish one in the region of Western-Thrace. They include Pomak and Xoraxane Roma. The majority of them live in cities like Xanthi and Komotini. The dispute between Greece and the Republic of North Macedonia has resulted in the refusal of Greece to acknowledge the existence of a Macedonian minority. The 2001 population census showed only 747 citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia in Greece. The Republic of North Macedonia says that there are a maximum of 300,000 ethnic Macedonians in Greece, but Greece says that if there is a minority in the country, it would not be more than 30,000 people, in the northern part of the country, near the border with the Republic of North Macedonia. This is also supported by international organizations."
Greek flag.
"The Greek flag was officially adopted in 1828 as a civil and state ensign (a flag for use only on boats and ships) and as a national flag when flown outside of Greece, for example on embassies. A different flag (white cross on a blue field) was used as a land flag within Greece from 1828 until 1969 and from 1975 to 1978. In 1978 the current flag became national flag and the older land flag was abolished."
"There are many theories about the origin of the color of the flag. One says that blue represents the color of the sea and the white represents the waves, and others include white for the waves and blue for the sky and white for purity and breaking away from tyranny, and blue for Greece. There are nine stripes on the flag, which according to the legend represent the nine syllables in the phrase “Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος’’ which means “freedom or death.’’ The cross stands for Christianity."
Economy.
"Greece is a capitalist country, like the United States and France. Greece has the largest number of trading ships (a 'merchant navy') in the world. Tourism is also a major source of income for Greece. In the 20th century Greece had its own currency but now uses the Euro as most other European Community countries do."
"Greece has adopted some welfare state policies, such as public healthcare and free education, like many other European countries. Greece, however, has not collected enough taxes to pay for them. The pension system is especially expensive."
"This is putting Greece in a very difficult situation when the country has accumulated a debt of about €350 billion or debt by 170 percent of the country's total GDP. Greece also has a trade deficit, meaning that it buys more things than it sells. The country is cutting costs and asking for loans in order to avoid bankruptcy."
Tourism.
"About 30 million tourists visit Greece each year. That is more than the country’s entire population. To serve the many tourists, Greece has many international airports. Tourism also makes up more than 20% of the Greek GDP."
Sweden
Sweden () is a Nordic country in the part of Europe called Scandinavia. Its neighbors are Finland and Norway. Sweden is also connected to Denmark in the south by a bridge. It is a developed country. It is famous for its welfare state. People who live in Sweden are called Swedes.
"The population of Sweden is about 10 million people. Sweden's capital city is Stockholm, which is also Sweden's largest city, with almost one million people. Other large cities are Gothenburg and Malmö. These cities are all in the southern half of the country, where it is not as cold as in the north. Swedes drink filmjölk, it is a traditional fermented milk product from Sweden. It is made by fermenting cow's milk. Glögg, is spiced mulled wine which people drink around Christmas. It normally contains red wine, sugar, orange peel, and spices. Swedes eat yellow pea soup with pork (or pork sausages) along with mustard."
"Sweden is a constitutional monarchy because it has a king, Carl XVI Gustaf, but he does not have any real power. Sweden is a parliamentary state meaning that the government is elected by the parliament which is appointed by the people. The country is democratically ruled by a government headed by an elected prime minister. Ulf Kristersson was elected Prime Minister in September 2022. He took office in October 2022."
"Sweden has an official majority language, Swedish (the Swedish word for the language is ""svenska""). Sweden has five official minority languages: Finnish, Yiddish, Sami, Meänkieli, and Romani."
"Sweden became a member of the European Union (EU) on 1 January 1995. Unlike most countries in the European Union, Sweden is not a member of the Eurozone and has not begun to use the euro as currency. This is because the people have voted against using the euro. The currency remains the Swedish krona (Swedish crown)."
History.
"Sweden has been a kingdom for a thousand years. In the Middle Ages, Sweden had the same king as Denmark and Norway. In the early 16th century Sweden got its own king, Gustav Vasa. During the 17th century Sweden was a great power. Sweden had taken Estonia, Latvia, and Finland and parts of Norway, Germany, and Russia. In the 18th century Sweden became weaker and lost these places. In the early 19th century, Sweden's king died without an heir and the Swedish parliament voted for Jean Baptiste Bernadotte as the new king. Bernadotte fought Denmark and made them allow Norway to enter a personal union with Sweden."
"This was Sweden's last war, and Sweden has not been at war for 200 years. In 1905, the Swedish-Norwegian personal union was dissolved. In many wars, including World War I and the Cold War, the country was neutral, meaning it did not take sides. During World War II, it traded with both the British and the Germans in order to protect its neutrality."
Region.
"Sweden has 25 historical provinces (""landskap""). They are found in three different regions: Norrland in the North, Svealand in the central region, and Götaland in the South."
Counties.
"Sweden is divided into 21 counties. They are Stockholm, Uppsala, Södermanland, Östergötland, Jönköping, Kronoberg, Kalmar, Gotland, Blekinge, Skåne, Halland, Västra Götaland, Värmland, Örebro, Västmanland, Dalarna, Gävleborg, Västernorrland, Jämtland, Västerbotten, and Norrbotten."
County governments largely regulate regional public transportation and healthcare.
"The highway begins in the west at Dongshi District in Taichung. The highway used to go up into the Central Mountain Range along the Dajia River () valley through the townships of Guguan () and Cingshan (). At Lishan there is a branch that heads north to Yilan City. It goes through the mountains to Dayuling () which is the highest point of the route. Here another branch of the highway runs south from Dayuling to Wushe (). Continuing east from Dayuling, the highway goes down into Taroko National Park. It passes through Guanyuan (), Cih-en (), Luoshao () and Tiansiang () before entering Taroko Gorge. After the gorge the road then meets the eastern coastal Su'ao-Hualien Highway."
Closing the damaged highway.
"The highway goes through mountains. Rocks often fall and there can be landslides. Heavy rain from typhoons often push soil and rocks onto the highway so people cannot drive through parts of it. Earthquakes also damage the highway. On September 21, 1999 the Jiji earthquake caused a lot of damage to the highway and cut it in many places between Dongshih and Lishan."
"There was so much damage in 1999 that repairing it would cost a lot of money. The damaged parts of the highway were supposed to re-open in 2004. However, heavy rain from the Typhoon Mindulle added more damage to the highway. These parts were closed. The highway is still closed between Lishan and Guguan. There is no plan to repair it, but the New Central Cross-Island Highway is another way across the island."
Azorina vidalii
"Azorina vidalii (also known as the Azores bellflower) is the only species of the genus ""Azorina"" within the Campanulaceae, the bellflower family. This endemic species of the Azores is used as an ornamental plant in other countries besides the Azores."
"It was first given the name ""Campanula vidalii"" by Hewett Cottrell Watson in ""Hooker's Icones Plantarum"", table DCLXXXIV (684); Watson gave it the specific name ""vidalii"" after ""Capt. Vidal, R.N."", who collected the original plant. Heinrich Feer changed the name to ""Azorina vidalii"", creating a new genus ""Azorina"", in ""Botanische Jahrbücher für Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie"", 12, S. 611."
Description.
"The Azores bellflower is an evergreen, perennial herbaceous plant that grows to a height of 80 to 150 centimetres. It produces branches at the base and these branches are woody in the lower part. The plant has dark green leaves."
"The plant flowers from May to October. The inflorescence has many hanging, waxy, pale pink, bell-shaped flowers . The ""Azorina vidalii"" forma ""alba"" has, as the name suggests, white flowers."
Where it grows.
"The Azores bellflower is rare and usually grows in holes in cliffs near the sea, below the 50 metres of altitude. It is usually accompanied by the plant ""Salicornia"", which also tolerate the salt in the wind coming from the sea. The plant is found in all the islands of the Azores archipelago, but not on the island of Graciosa."
Mars in fiction
"Novels and short stories about Mars have been popular for over a hundred years. The planet's dramatic red color that some people can see is one reason for this. another is that the planet is close to Earth. Also, it looks somewhat like Earth. There are also stories about creatures from Mars on Earth and elsewhere."
"Near the end of the 19th century, the astronomer"
"Giovanni Schiaparelli reported seeing what he thought might be water channels on Mars. Because the Italian for channels is ""canali"", English translations tended to render the word as ""canals"", implying artificial construction. This led to the idea of intelligent beings on Mars before it apparently dried up."
"The following works of fiction deal with the planet itself, with any assumed Martian civilization as part of its planetary landscape."
Novels and short stories.
First stories.
"Several early modern writers, including Athanasius Kircher and Emanuel Swedenborg, hypothesized contact with Mars. Early science fiction about Mars often involved the first voyages to the planet, sometimes as an invasion force, more often for the purposes of exploration."
Living on Mars.
"By the 1930s, stories about reaching Mars had become somewhat trite, and the focus shifted to Mars as an alien landscape. New stories were set in a time after human contact and basic exploration. Some were about the colonization of Mars or otherwise used Mars as a setting rather than a goal."
1960s and later.
"Beginning in 1965, the Mariner and Viking space probes revealed that the canals were an illusion, and that the Martian environment is extremely hostile to life. By the 1970s, the ideas of canals and ancient civilizations had to be abandoned."
"Authors soon began writing stories based on the new Mars (frequently treating it as a desert planet). Most of these works have humans struggling to tame the planet, and some of them refer to terraforming (using technology to transform a planet's environment)."
"A common theme, particularly among American writers, is that of a Martian colony fighting for independence from Earth. It appeared already in Heinlein's ""Red Planet"" and is a major plot element in Greg Bear's ""Moving Mars"" and Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Mars"" trilogy. It is also part of the plot of the movie ""Total Recall"" and the television series ""Babylon 5"". Many video games also use this concept, such as the ""Red Faction"" and ""Zone of the Enders"" series. A historical rebellion of Mars against Earth is also mentioned in the ""Star Trek"" series of novels."
"In the decades following Mariner and Apollo, the once-popular subgenre of realistic stories about a first expedition to Mars fell out of fashion, possibly due to the failure of the Apollo Program to continue on to Mars. The early 1990s saw a revival and re-envisioning of realistic novels about Mars expeditions. Early novels in this renaissance were Jack Williamson's novel ""Beachhead"" and Ben Bova's novel ""Mars"" (both 1992), which envisioned large-scale expeditions to Mars according to the thinking of the 1990s. These were followed by Gregory Benford's ""The Martian Race"" (1999), Geoffrey A. Landis's ""Mars Crossing"" (2000), and Robert Zubrin's ""First Landing"" (2002), which took as their starting points the smaller and more focussed expedition strategies evolved in the late 1990s, mostly building on the concepts of Mars Direct."
Nostalgic Mars fiction.
"Several post-Mariner works are homages to the older phase of Mars fiction, circumventing the scientific picture of a dry and lifeless Mars with an unbreathable atmosphere through such science fiction generic staples as positing its future terraforming, or creating alternate history versions of Mars, where Burroughs' Barsoom, Bradbury's Martian Chronicles or The War of the Worlds are literal truth."
Martians in fiction.
"Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode-von Aesch, or simply Alexander Gode (October 30, 1906 – August 10, 1970), was a German-American linguist, and translator. He helped create the auxiliary language Interlingua."
Oceania
"Oceania is a name used in geography for the region made up of Australia, Polynesia, Melanesia, and several other island nations in the surrounding area. It is often listed as one of the continents of the world."
"The term ""Oceania"" does not have one single agreed definition. The widest definition of Oceania includes the entire region between continental Asia and the Americas, including Australasia, as well as islands in the Pacific Rim such as the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan, and the Aleutian islands."
"On the other hand, the Oceania ecozone includes all of Micronesia, Fiji, and all of Polynesia except New Zealand. Sometimes, people use the term 'Oceania' to include only the Polynesian and Melanesian islands in the Pacific Ocean, as separate from Australasia. When Oceania is treated separately from Australia, the region of Oceania is referred to as ""Australia and Oceania""."
"In the United Nations' geographic regions, Oceania includes Australia and the nations of the Pacific from Papua New Guinea east, but not the Malay Archipelago or Indonesian New Guinea."
"A smaller usage of Oceania as a continent includes only Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and the islands between them. This part of the world is usually called Australasia instead. For these reasons, it is ""not"" correct to say that Australasia is part of Oceania, because what is meant by 'Oceania' is not clear. Australasia has an exact definition in biogeography and geology; Australasia includes New Zealand, Australia (including Tasmania), and Melanesia, New Guinea, and the islands just north and east of Australia. All these are south-east of the Bali–Lombok line, also known as the Wallace Line."
Southern Ocean
"The Southern Ocean is the ocean around Antarctica. It means the waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans around the continent of Antarctica. Since the 1770s geographers have discussed its limits. Nowadays, sixty degrees south latitude is often accepted. Some people call this ocean the Antarctic Ocean."
"The total area is 20,327,000 km², and the coastline length is 17,968 km."
Catalan language
"The Catalan language is a Romance language spoken in Catalonia, Valencian Community, the eastern part of Aragon, the Balearic Islands, a small zone of Murcia (all of them in Spain), Andorra, North Catalonia (in France) and the Italian city of L'Alguer. Together, those places are often called the Catalan Countries."
"The language that most similar is Occitan. Catalan also has similarities to other Romance languages, such as Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese. It came from Vulgar Latin and was first spoken in the in the Eastern Pyrenees in the Middle Ages."
There are about 4 million people who speak Catalan as a first language and about 6 million people as a second language. Catalan is the sixth-most-spoken Romance language and also the most-spoken language that is not an official language in the European Union.
Corset
A corset is a body covering undergarment (clothes worn under others).
It is made in many forms.
Pop music
"Pop music is a type of popular music that many people like to listen to. The term ""pop music"" can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular. The word ""pop music"" was used from about 1880 onwards, when a type of music called music was popular. Styles of pop music in the 2020s (today) include rock music, electronic dance music and hip hop. Pop music tends to change quite a lot so the description is quite flexible."
History.
"Modern pop music grew out of 1950s rock and roll, (for example Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard) and rockabilly (for example Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly). In the 1960s, The Beatles became a famous pop music group. In the 1970s, other styles of music were mixed with pop music, such as funk and soul music. Pop music generally has a heavy (strong) beat, so that it is good for dancing. Pop singers normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an amplifier and a loudspeaker."
How does the business of pop music work?
"There are also many more people working on pop music who are not seen on the stage or in the video. These people include the studio staff (people who help the musicians to record CDs and music videos in music studios), production staff (people who help make the music recordings sound good), distribution staff (people who help sell the music to stores) and retail staff (people that sell the music to people at CD stores)."
"Tour staff help the band to travel around the country (or around the world) for their concert tours. Some tour staff help by carrying heavy musical instruments onto the stage. Other tour staff drive buses or cars, so that the band can get to the concert. Some tour staff operate sound equipment, such as the large amplifiers and loudspeakers that are used to amplify (make louder) the band's music for the audience."
"Promotional staff help to market or promote the band's music, so that more people will know about the band, and buy the band's CDs. Some promotional staff travel to radio stations and give the band's CD to radio station managers or DJs (disk jockeys: the people who announce songs on the radio). Other promotional staff write press releases (short articles) about the band which are sent to the newspapers."
Types of music that became pop music.
"Pop music came from the Rock and Roll movement of the early 1950s, when record companies recorded songs that they thought that teenagers would like. Pop music usually uses musical from the other types of music that are popular at the time. Many different styles of music have become pop music during different time periods. Often, music companies create pop music styles by taking a style of music that only a small number of people were listening to, and then making that music more popular by marketing it to teenagers and young adults."
"Since June 2022, floods in Pakistan have killed at least 1,191 people, including 399 children. The floods were caused by monsoon rains and melting glaciers. It is the world's deadliest flood since the 2017 South Asian floods. On 25 August, Pakistan declared a state of emergency because of the flooding. By 29 August, it was said that around 'one-third' of the country was underwater. By 2 September, the death toll passed 1,200."
Milutin Šoškić
Milutin Šoškić (Serbian Cyrillic: Милутин Шошкић; 31 December 1937 – 27 August 2022) was a Serbian professional footballer. He played as a goalkeeper. He made 50 appearances for Yugoslavia national football team between 1959 to 1966. He won an Olympic gold medal in 1960.
Šoškić died on 27 August 2022 at the age of 84.
"Aptos, California"
"Aptos (Ohlone for ""The People"") is an unincorporated town in Santa Cruz County, California."
Manuel Duarte
"Manuel Almeida Duarte (29 May 1945 – 2 September 2022) was a Portuguese footballer. He played as a striker. He played for the Portugal national football team, making two appearances in 1966."
Duarte died on 2 September 2022 at the age of 77.
Cadena nacional
"In several Latin American countries, a ' (; plural '), also referred to as a ' () or ' () is a joint transmission through the media, generally radio and television stations, which aims to reach the largest number of inhabitants of a State. These types of broadcasts are usually of a political nature, since they are mostly messages from government authorities about different matters of general interest, as well as the transmission of electoral debates for the elections to the executive power of each country."
"The institutional characteristics of the national chain vary according to the legislation and customs of each country.  It may be a resource officially provided for in legislation or the name may be used informally, to describe a coordinated transmission. The coupling of the different media to the signal of the official chain can also be voluntary or compulsory.  Similarly, the national network can be used for different types of transmissions in addition to the official messages of the State authorities."
Criticism.
Argentina.
"During the government of Cristina Kirchner, the number and frequency of ""Cadenas Nacionales"" increased, some media criticized their use as not limited to cases of ""institutional significance""."
"The then National Senator for Citizen Unity Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, at the presentation of his book ""Sinceramente"" in Rosario (Argentina), said that ""he does not regret the national channels, since otherwise the media would not have shown the public policies of the then President of Argentina""."
"During the administration of the President Mauricio Macri, its use decreased."
Chile.
"In Chile, during the period of the Popular Unity, some radio stations (mainly from the opposition), got off the ""Cadenas Nacionales"" to broadcast their normal programming. At that time they were mandatory."
Honduras.
"Another similar situation was the opposition, on the part of the Honduran press, to broadcasting national channels during the government of President Manuel Zelaya, considering that ""in the past the ""cadena nacional"" system was used constantly, mainly by the de facto governments, without satisfactory results""."
Venezuela.
"Mandatory national channels with political content have been strongly criticized by some media, since in some countries they must broadcast content that often differs from their editorial line."
"That was the case of the radio station RCTV in Venezuela, an opponent of Hugo Chávez, which refused to broadcast a message from the ruler in 2007, despite the fact that in said country there is a Law on Social Responsibility in Radio and Television, which obliges radio and television to broadcast information from the Executive Power. Currently, a ""Cadena nacional"" is broadcast almost every day, normally headed by Nicolás Maduro or Delcy Rodríguez."
Expulsion of Jews from Spain
"The decision of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile to banish the Jews from Spain in the year 1492. While Jews who converted to Christianity were not banished, Tomás de Torquemada and the Spanish government still tortured many of them. They did not believe that the converted Jews were really Christian in the Spanish Inquisition."
"Some composers are very precise about writing the dynamics they want. Others leave a lot to the performer to decide. Historically, composers several centuries ago, such as Bach, only wrote occasional dynamic marks. Even Mozart only wrote a few, mostly p and f. By the 19th century composers were writing dynamics in much more detail in their music."
"Sometimes accents are shown by marks similar to dynamic marks. ""Sforzando"" means a strong, sudden accent and is abbreviated as sf, sfz or fz. The notation sfzp (or sfp) means a ""sforzando"" followed immediately by ""piano"""
"The terms ""crescendo"", and ""diminuendo"" (or sometimes ""decrescendo""), mean a gradual getting louder or quieter. They can also be shown by signs known as ""hairpins"". A hairpin opening out is a ""crescendo"", one which closes is a ""diminuendo""."
"For a quick change in dynamics, molto cresc. and molto dim. are often used (""molto"" means ""a lot""). For slow changes poco a poco cresc. and poco a poco dim. are used (""poco a poco"" means ""little by little"", i.e. very gradually.)"
Francesco Botticini
"Francesco Botticini (real name Francesco di Giovanni, 1446 – 16 January 1498) was an Italian painter. He lived in the early part of the Renaissance period. He was born in Florence about 1446 and is best known for his painting called ""Assumption of the Virgin""."
"He died in 1497 or 1498. After he had been an assistant to the painter Neri di Bicci he started his own workshop. The shop was famous for its decorative works, a few of which can be seen in the cloistered church of Empoli. Botticini was influenced by Filippino Lippi and Botticelli who were two very famous Florentine painters."
Grana Padano
"Grana Padano is a type of hard cheese. It is similar to parmesan cheese. The name comes from the noun ""grana"" (‘grain’), which refers to the distinctively grainy texture of the cheese, and the adjective ""Padano"", which refers to the river Po."
"Grana Padano was created by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle. They used ripened cheese as a way of preserving extra milk. By the year 1477, it was regarded as one of the most famous cheeses of Italy. Today, this product is made in the regions of Piedmont, Lombardy and Veneto, and in the province of Trento."
"Like Parmigiano Reggiano, Grana Padano is a semi-fat hard cheese which is cooked and ripened slowly (for up to 18 months). It is produced by curdling the milk of grass-fed cows. The cows are milked twice a day, the milk is left to stand, and then partially creamed. It is produced all year round and the quality can vary seasonally as well as by year."
"A wheel of Grana Padano is cylindrical, with slightly convex or almost straight sides and flat faces. The rind, which is thin, is white or straw yellow."
"Grana Padano cheese has been produced since the 12th century, and production and quality are now overseen by the Consorzio per la Tutela del Formaggio Grana Padano."
North American Free Trade Agreement
"The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trade agreement between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The agreement was signed by U.S. President George H.W. Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and Mexican President Carlos Salinas on December 17, 1992 in San Antonio, Texas, and took effect on January 1, 1994. It removed taxes on products traded between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It also protects copyrights, patents, and trademarks between those three countries. It was updated with the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, which helped set more environment regulations and helped reduce pollution. It was also updated with the North American Agreement for Labor Cooperation, which helped people fight for better work conditions."
"On September 30, 2018, it was announced that the United States, Mexico, and Canada had come to an agreement to replace NAFTA with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA)."
Effects.
"Since it took away taxes between products traded between the US, Canada, and Mexico. Mexico has been buying more products from the US. It saved U.S. companies on the cost of selling products to Mexico, and it saved Mexican companies on the cost of buying things from U.S. companies."
"A benefit of the bill is that labels on products exchanged between the three countries come in French, English, and Spanish. That way, Mexicans and Americans who speak Spanish can read the Spanish label, Americans and Canadians can read the English label, and Canadians who speak French can read the French label."
"NAFTA also encourages more immigration from Mexico to the US. Since small businesses can no longer be protected by tariffs, many small business owners in Mexico cannot compete with the prices of subsidized products from the US and therefore many of them have gone under, or they lost more money than they could make. As a result, many Mexicans have gone to the US looking for work. The human rights organization EZLN (Ejército Zapatista de la Liberación Nacional), a revolutionary Mexican grass roots movement, is a strong opponent of NAFTA and points out how its provisions only make the economic situation worse for the poorest in Mexico and better for multi-national corporations."
Job losses.
Small Business Chronicle
"With the increased ease by which Mexico can import food products from the United States, the role of Mexican farmers is overwhelmed by the output of American farming. This is a notable con of NAFTA. According to Thomas Net Industry Market Trends, over 1 million Mexican farmers have lost their jobs as a result of the agreement."
"The American economy lost about 683,000 jobs thanks to NAFTA -- more than 60% of which were in the manufacturing sector. Almost 35,000 Ohioans found themselves unemployed, or without jobs, thanks to a free trade agreement that’s been a disaster for our nation’s industrial base. - Sharrod Brown"
Immigration.
"It was possible that NAFTA would encourage Mexican citizens to stay in their country since their manufacturing work could still reach the American market easily. But since the creation of NAFTA, illegal immigration between Mexico and the United States has only gotten worse. Over the 10-year period between 1990 and 2000, the number of illegal immigrants per year doubled, or increased two times, despite the creation of NAFTA in 1994, according to Thomas Net Industry Market Trends. NAFTA not being more effective in preventing the immigration crisis is a disadvantage to the agreement."
Language revival
Language revival is people trying to make a language spoken often again when it is not spoken or is spoken very little. Language death happens when a language is not used by the people who used to speak it.
Cult.
"There is a temple dedicated to Goddess Laikhurembi in Uripok town in Imphal West district of Manipur. During the Lai Haraoba festival of Uripok, a carnival like atmosphere subdues the sacred traditional ritualistic ceremonies. During the noisy possession of the festive occasions, the maibis dance in the gentle melodies of pena. The maibis became possessed by the spirits when the music stopped and they delivered oracles. During this, the audiences listen to them very attentively."
Lainaotabi
"Lainaotabi () or Leinaotabi () is a goddess in ancient Meitei mythology and religion. She is the youngest wife of God Thongalel of the underworld kingdom (). Thongalel sent her to be the wife of Poireiton, her brother-in-law. Lainaotabi gave birth to a son with Poireiton."
Her legend says she made the first clay pot.
She was worshipped by the people of Ashangbam clan.
Mythology.
Journey from Underworld to human world.
"Lainaotabi was the youngest queen of King Thongaren () of the underworld kingdom (). Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of the King. Poireiton, Thongalel's younger brother, was about to leave on a journey to ""Tai Pang Pan"". The king asked Laikhurembi to go with Poireiton as his wife because Poireiton's own wife had died. However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. So, instead of Laikhurembi, Lainaotabi was sent to accompany her brother in law Poireiton as a wife."
Love with a mortal prince.
"Lainaotabi (Leinaotabi) went with Poireiton, her brother-in-law, on a journey to earth. Later, she became separated from him. She was adopted by King Koupalu as his daughter. Afterwards, she came to be known as ""Koubarol Namoinu"" () alias ""Koubru Namoinu"" (). She fell in love with prince ""Nongban Pombi Luwaoba"" of Luwang dynasty. She met the prince for the first time when he visited King Koupalu. She and prince Luwaoba married and led a happy life. God Thongalel did not want his own wife spending her days with another man. So, the thread of her life was cut short and her soul recalled. However, the Prince did not give up. He challenged God Thongalel to give back his wife's soul or to fight with him. He guarded the dead body of Koubru Namoinu without performing the funeral ceremony. Thongalel first sent his two younger brothers one by one for the fight. Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba defeated his two divine opponents. Finally, Thongalel himself appeared before him. But this time, the prince realised that he was no match for powerful God. So, he begged mercy and kindness to restore Koubru Namoinu's life so that the Luwang dynasty might have further generation. Thongalel felt pity on him. So, he granted the couple to live for another hundred years with marital pleasure. According to legends, Hongnem Luwang Punshiba was the son of Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi) and Nongban Pombi Luwaoba."
Pantheon and worship.
The pantheon dedicated to goddess Lainaotabi (Leinaotabi) was mainly maintained by the Ashangbam clan of Meitei ethnicity in Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). It was recorded in the Loyumba Shinyen (1100 AD).
Nongban Pombi Luwaoba
"""Nongban Pombi Luwaopa"" () or ""Nungpan Ponpi Luwaopa"" () is a Meitei language literary narrative work (puya), about the legendary story of a prince of the Luwang dynasty who got back successfully the life of his wife Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi), from the hands of her former consort Thongalen, the God of death and the ruler of the underworld. It is the story of love, courage and perseverance. It is an old story of near tragic end. In the legend, there's a fight between the mortal and the god."
"It mentions about the dowry system (Awonpot) of the then ancient times. It is, in a sense, the reverse of the Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba."
Story.
"It is a story of love fulfilled after a near tragic event and is, perhaps, unique of its kind. Nongban Pombi Luwaoba, the leading character of the same name was a Prince of the Luwang dynasty born of King Nungpan Pamingnapa and Queen Santhong Huimuleima. He soon grew into manhood and felt lovesick. He set out alone to cover the wide world in search of a love to quench the thirst of his heart and was welcomed by the King Koubru when he approached him for a rest. There he met the princess, Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi) and was instantly smitten with her beauty and had his heart lost to her. The princess, formerly the youngest wife of Thongalel, the God of death, who while accompanying her younger brother in law on a sojourn to earth got separated from him and was later adopted by the king as his daughter. Returning home hastily, the prince requested his parents to get the princess engaged to him. And this was carried out without delay with the offer of choice and the delicious fruit in prickles to the king and the queen. The couple accepted the proposal with a good grace and regarded it as an occasion ordained by Providence. The marriage having been performed with due solemnity, the young couple began to lead a happy and contented life. But this was desined not to last long, for the God did not take kindly to his own wife spending her days as an ordinary mortal in the company of another man. So, her fatal thread was cut short and her soul recalled. However, the distraught Prince did not not take his tragic fate lying down and taking the help of Nongta Chinkhanyang, a pheasant, sent a request to the Lord of the netherworld to give back the soul of his wife or take the challenge of a single combat. Thus, he kept guarding the mortal remains of Koubru Namoinu without the obsequies being performed. Thongalel first sent his younger brother armed with deadly weapons for the fight in which the prince settled his opponent's hash and kept him bound under the heavy weight of a slab. The Lord's second brother too met the same humiliation and at last, Thongalel himself appeared in all splendor in the field of honour. But the prince was prudent enough to realise that he was no match for powerful God, he fell prostrate before him and begged mercy and kindness to restore Koubru Namoinu to him so that the Luwang dynasty might have further progeny. Thongalel, being visibly moved, readily granted the prayer and left for the dark abode. Thus, the couple were united to live for another hundred years with conjugal bliss and Hongnem Luwang Punshiba, a son was born to them."
Tharon
"Thāron or Tharol is an ancient Meitei literary work (puya), about the lore of the twelve lunar months of a year. It describes the changing pattern of nature in the following months. It is one of the masterpieces of the writers of the ancient times."
"The terms, ""Tha"" means month or moon and ""ron"", derived from ""lon"" means knowledge, lore or tradition."
"The names of the twelve lunar months were given in Ancient Meitei language in the manuscript. However, the following illustrates both the Ancient Meitei as well as Modern Meitei names, with their Gregorian equivalents:"

John Hancock
"John Hancock (January 12, 1737 – October 8, 1793) was an early American patriot, a leader in the American Revolutionary War, and an American statesman. He was the first man to sign America's Declaration of Independence. In modern America, ""John Hancock"" is a synonym for signature."
"Hancock's ancestors arrived in the English colonies in 1652. In 1737, Hancock was born in Braintree (now Quincy, Massachusetts). When John Hancock Jr. his father died, he was adopted by his uncle, a merchant in Boston, Massachusetts. At his uncle's death in 1754, Hancock inherited the business. He became a leading merchant in Boston and one of the richest in the colonies."
"In 1768, British officials seized his ship, the ""Liberty"". It carried a shipment of wine. The officials said he was smuggling. Boston patriots rioted and he was acquitted. This incident was one of the events that led to the American Revolutionary War."
Hancock had several important jobs in Colonial America and the early United States of America. He was president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in 1774 and 1775. He used his money to support American independence. The British thought him a very dangerous man.
"Hancock was president of the Continental Congress in 1774 and 1775. He wanted to lead the Continental Army. George Washington got the job instead. With 5,000 troops, he tried to free Rhode Island from the British. He was not successful."
Hancock led the convention that adopted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780. He was first Governor of the state Massachusetts. He served nine terms. Hancock suffered from gout in his later life. He died in 1793.
Huldrych Zwingli
"Huldrych (or Ulrich) Zwingli or Ulricus Zuinglius (January 1, 1484 – October 11, 1531) was the leader of the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland, and founder of the Swiss Reformed churches. Separately from Martin Luther, Zwingli arrived with similar final beliefs. He did this by studying the Bible from the point of view of a humanist scholar. Zwingli's father was named Ulrich Zwingli also and his mother was named Margaret Meili. Zwingli had 2 sisters and 7 brothers."
"Zwingli was born in Toggenburg, Wildhaus, St. Gallen, Switzerland, to an important family of the middle class."
Zwingli's Reformation was supported by the judge and people of Zürich. It led to major changes in the lives of the people and state matters in Zürich.
"Zwingli was killed at Kappel am Albis, in a battle against the Roman Catholic Cantons of Switzerland."
20th-century classical music
"20th-century classical music is classical music written during the last century. During earlier periods of music history composers from different countries wrote in styles which were often quite similar. For example, composers in the Classical music period (about 1740-1820) had fairly similar ideas about what forms to use (e.g. sonata form), what instruments should be used in orchestras or how to write good tunes."
"Classical music from the 20th century is extremely varied. There are lots of different “schools” (meaning: ways of thinking) as lots of composers had their own ideas about how to compose in ways that were different from what had been done before. A lot of these genres (types of music) had names ending in “ism”: there was serialism, Expressionism, Neoclassicism, Impressionism as well as jazz, world music (music from non-European cultures) and folksong and, later on electronic music and then Minimalism and even post-modernism."
"The names of periods in history were usually given to them many years afterwards. For example, the term Middle Ages was not used until long after the Middle Ages had finished. It is difficult to know what to call the period we live in now. In music people often talk about “Modern Music” meaning any music written after 1900. We also talk about “Contemporary Music” meaning more or less the same thing (“contemporary” means “things that are happening in our time”, i.e. “living composers”). Now that the 21st century has started some musicians are starting to talk about “20th century music” (1900-2000) and a period called “Contemporary Music” (1975-today)."
This article will discuss classical music written from 1900 to the year 1999.
Reaction to Romanticism.
"Many European composers at the beginning of the 20th century felt that the system of tonality (music in major and minor keys) had been used for so long that it was time to do create a new approach and try something different. Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky were two of the most important composers at that time, and they had very different ideas about how to compose music."
"Schoenberg's music became very atonal (not in any key). Eventually he developed what he called twelve tone music. This was atonal music which was organized by putting the notes of a musical idea in a particular order which could be changed in many ways during the piece. This way of organizing music is called “serialism” (a “series” is a “row of things”). Many composers were influenced by Schoenberg, especially Alban Berg and Anton von Webern."
"Stravinsky came from Russia. He was inspired by Russian culture. He wrote some music for a ballet called Rite of Spring. This music was very new. It had very irregular rhythms which the dancers found very difficult to dance to at first. It also used polytonality (being in more than one key at once). Later on Stravinsky was inspired by music from the 18th century. He used it, but made changes to it, adding dissonant notes and strange chords. This is called neoclassicism (“neo” means “new”). Stravinsky's music seemed to many people to be the opposite of serialism, but in his last years Stravinsky started to use serialism as well."
Impressionism.
"In France a movement called Impressionism was popular with painters. Composers were very interested in these paintings. Claude Debussy wrote music which is often called “Impressionistic”. The ideas of clear tonality (being clear about which key the music is in) are often deliberately blurred. He uses interesting chords just for the sound that they make. He used the whole tone scale and pentatonic scale and was inspired by Javanese music. Maurice Ravel’s music is sometimes similar, although he developed his own style. Later French composers include Olivier Messiaen who used a system of new scales which he called Modes of limited transposition. He was also interested in music from around the world, and he also used bird song in his music."
Late Romanticism.
"While all this was happening there were some composers who continued to write in a style which was basically Romantic. Edward Elgar ‘s music is often described as “Edwardian” (from the period of King Edward VII). Other British composers of the time were also inspired by English folkmusic, i.e. Ralph Vaughan Williams, George Butterworth, Roger Quilter and Gerald Finzi. Frederick Delius wrote Romantic music which was also quite Impressionistic. The Russian Sergei Rachmaninoff and the German Richard Strauss continued to write in a Romantic style until their deaths in the 1940s. The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius and the Dane Carl Nielsen wrote great symphonies which were still in a tonal style, and in Italy Puccini was writing operas in a Romantic style, often called “verismo” (“like real life”)."

Oba Chandler
"Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio - November 15, 2011 in Raiford, Florida) was an American convicted murderer who was executed in Florida for the murders of Joan Rogers and her two teenage daughters. The women's bodies were found floating in the Tampa Bay, Tampa in June 1989. They had been bound and gagged and then tossed into the bay with concrete blocks tied to their necks while still alive."
"Billboards where at the later stages of the investigation used in trying to find however did the murders, the billboards that was spread all over Tampa had pictures of the Rogers women and a picture of the hand-writing of the suspected triple murderer. This method had never been used before, and became useful in searches for missing people later on."
"Chandler was arrested in September 1992. He was put on trial where he was found guilty of the murders by a 12-member jury. In November 4, 1994 he was sentenced to death by a deadly injection by the judge in the case. Before his execution, Chandler was locked up at Union Correctional Institution in Florida. Author Thomas French in 1998 won the Pulitzer Prize for his article series Angels &amp; Demons which told the story of the murders."
Background.
Early life.
"Oba Chandler was born in Cincinnati in the state of Ohio. He was the fourth of five children. His parents were Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson. At the age of 10, Chandler's father Oba Chandler Senior hanged himself in the Chandler family's basement. This upset Oba so much that he jumped into his father's grave during the funeral in 1957 while gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt. Afterwards, Oba's life spun out of control and he was arrested many times and had been arrested 20 times by the time he was a teenager. As an adult, he was charged with a long list of crimes, including theft, having fake money, burglary, kidnapping and armed robbery. Chandler would also father a total of eight children before his arrest, the latest one being Whitney born in February, 1989 with his wife at the time Debra Chandler. Between May and September of 1991 Chandler worked as an informant for the US customs Tampa office, at the same time as Tampa police investigated the Rogers family triple murder."
Facts of the murders.
"Joan Rogers and her two daughters, Michelle (17 years of age) and Christe (14 years of age) left their family dairy farm on May 26, 1989 in Willshire for a vacation in Florida."
"They had never before left the state of Ohio. On their last day in Florida they became lost and drove into Tampa to ask for directions to the nearest hotel, in a store they came across Oba Chandler and asked him. It is thought that he saw the Ohio state car license plates on Joan's car and used that as means to ask the family to join him out for a boat trip later."
The discovery of the bodies.
"The women's bodies were discovered floating in the Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989 with bound hands and feet with concrete blocks tied to their necks and duct tape over their mouths. The first body was found floating over the Sunshine Skyway bridge when a sailboat on its way home to Tampa after a trip to Key West, had just crossed under the Sunshine Skyway when many people on board saw an object in the water. They soon realized it was a dead body of a female. Soon another body was found and yet another third body was also dragged out of the bay within an hour. All three bodies had been tied and gagged and had concrete blocks tied around their necks. Autopsies thought the women had been tossed into the bay while still alive."
Investigation.
Subsequent investigaton.
"The Rogers women where identified a week after their bodies where found in the bay. A hotel maid had discovered that a hotel room had stood unused for several days. And when the reports about the murders started to leap into the media the hotel decided to contact investigators in the case. Soon it stood clear that it was indeed the families room after fingerprints where matched to those of the victims, some snaphots from a camera was also discovered in the room which showed where the family had traveled and also a last shot over Tampa Bay. This photo was taken just minutes before the Rogers women went out to meet Oba Chandler to go on a boat ride out on the bay."
Incriminating fact and arrest.
"The case remained unsolved and cold for several years, partly due to the volume of tips pouring in to the police who investigated the crime."
"Chandler would not be arrested for the murders until September 24, 1992. His handwritten directions and palmprint on a brochure found in the Rogers' vehicle, along with a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure, were the primary clues that led to his being named a suspect. Also, authorities had posted the handwriting from the brochure on billboards, which was historic as it was used for the first time in an attempt to find the unknown killer, and this led to a tip from a former neighbor who was able to provide a copy of a work order that Chandler had written. A handwriting analysis conclusively matched the two."
Sentence and aftermath.
"The Rogers women were all buried on June 13, 1989 after a funeral service at the Zion Lutheral Church in their hometown of Willshire, Ohio. About 300 people among them family and friends of the victims attended the service. Numerous police officers were also present to keep all news media and crews out of the church during the funeral service, this because of the huge media interest for the case by media at the time. Chandler was tried and found guilty of the murders, and sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. After sentencing, the jury forewoman commented regarding the death sentence that ""They need to do this swiftly. The man is a mutation of a human being and he needs to be destroyed."" In July 2008, it was revealed that Chandler was on Florida's short-list of executions."
"Profiling experts believe that Chandler may have killed previously, based on the speculation that a first-time killer would not be experienced or bold enough to abduct and kill three women at once. Chandler remains a suspect in a 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island, he is also a suspect in a rape case concerning a Canadian woman weeks before the Rogers women's murder. However, Chandler has never been charged with other murders. Chandler got an Institutional Adjustment disciplinary report on December 15, 2001, for disobeying orders in prison. All of Chandler's appeals since his 1994 conviction have been denied, the latest one in May 2007. Author Thomas French in 1998 won the Pulitzer prize for his article series Angels &amp; Demons which told the story of the murders."
Execution.
"Oba Chandler was executed on November 15, 2011 with a lethal injection at 4:25 pm in Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida."
All Saints' Day
All Saints' Day is celebrated by Catholic Christians on November 1. Other Christians celebrate it as well. (May not be on the same day) It is a mandatory Catholic holiday. It is celebrated in the Catholic Church.
Controversies.
"In 2009, several groups, including the American Family Foundation, attacked SpongeBob for being homosexual. The character had recently appeared on a music video with other kids' show characters to promote diversity and tolerance. However, the creator said in 2002 that SpongeBob is asexual, meaning that he does not seek sexual partners at all."
Decreasing quality.
"Many fans and critics believe that after season 11 and the first movie, the series started to decline in quality. This was because many writers from the first three seasons seasons left (although Doug Lawrence, Aaron Springer, Erik Wiese and C.H. Greenblatt still stayed). Some of the later episodes were poorly received because the characters did not act the way they acted in the first three seasons. However, apparently, the show's quality improved once more after the second movie, when Stephen Hillenburg returned, until his death in 2018."
Paul &amp; Paula
"Paul &amp; Paula (Ray Hildebrand, born December 21, 1940, and Jill Jackson, born May 20, 1942) are a pop/rock singing duo. They charted three ""Billboard"" Top 40 singles in 1963."
Seafood
Seafood is food made from fish or other sea animals such as shrimp and lobsters. The harvesting (collecting) of seafood is called fishing.
Seafood is rich in protein and is usually thought as healthy food.
Peer review
"Peer review is a process used when publishing documents where the work is reviewed by the author's peer group (someone in their field). It is a way of checking and reviewing a person's work. It is often used by scientists, scholars, medical professionals, engineers, and in some aspects of government."
"For example, scientists report new discoveries through a peer review process. This means that they ask other knowledgeable scientists (peers) to review their report, and check for any problems. The problems must be fixed before the report is released to other scientists. This process helps to maintain the trustworthiness of scientific discoveries."
Puerto Rico
"Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is a U.S. territory in the Caribbean Sea. This means that it is part of the United States and citizens of Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States as well. Puerto Rico is not an independent country, but there has been a movement for independence for almost two centuries. There have been protests, votes, and armed attacks for independence."
"Puerto Rico has almost 4 million (4,000,000) people. Its political system is based on a republican system. It has two official languages: Spanish and English. The currency used is the United States dollar. ""Puerto Rico"" means ""rich port"" in Spanish."
"The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico includes the largest, main island and a number of smaller islands, including Mona, Vieques, and Culebra. Of those three smaller islands, only Culebra and Vieques are populated all year. Mona is unpopulated, but employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources sometimes visit the island to inspect it and its wildlife. People can visit the island for hiking and camping by getting the permission needed. San Juan, on the northern side of the main island, is the island's largest city and the capital of the territory. The common languages are Spanish spoken by 94.7% of the population and English, spoken by 5.3%."
"On May 3, 2017, Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy after a massive debt and weak economy. It is the largest bankruptcy case in American history."
Status with respect to the USA.
"Puerto Rico is one of the unincorporated territories of the USA. Because it is not a state, citizens cannot vote in U.S. national elections unless they have an address in one of the 50 US states. These are organized, self-governing territories with locally elected governors and legislatures. Puerto Rico elects a Resident Commissioner to the U.S. House of Representatives."
History.
"The history of Puerto Rico began when the Ortoiroid people started living in the island between 3000 and 2000 BC. Other tribes, for example the Saladoid and Arawak Indians, lived in the island between 430 BC and 1000 AD. When Christopher Columbus arrived at the island in 1492 and named it ""San Juan Bautista"", the people living there were the ""Taínos""."
"Since it is in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico formed an important part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest, and colonization of the New World. The Spanish spread race-based slavery across the island. In the 19th century, slave revolts and the abolitionist movement brought an end to legal slavery."
"The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European countries for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In 1898, during the Spanish-American war, Puerto Rico was invaded and became a possession of the United States."
"During the 20th century, Puerto Rico's political status changed from time to time. The Foraker Act of 1900 created a civil government to replace the military government made after the Spanish–American war, and the Jones Act of 1917 gave Puerto Rican people United States citizenship. Afterwards, in 1952, the drafting of Puerto Rico's own Constitution and democratic elections were established."
"The political status of Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth controlled by the United States, is still not completely defined. Many people want to resolve this status, while others want the status to remain the same. Of the people who want to change the status, some want Puerto Rico to become a new U.S. state, while others want Puerto Rico to become a fully independent country."
"In May 2022, Members of Congress sponsoring competing bills on how to resolve Puerto Rico’s territorial status and its relationship to the U.S. have come together to introduce new legislation combining both. The proposed legislation combines elements of the pro-statehood bill introduced by Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress and a Republican, alongside the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, both New York Democrats. The draft legislation says that a plebiscite to resolve Puerto Rico’s political status shall be held on November 5, 2023."
Geography.
"Puerto Rico is an archipelago, with a main island where most of the population lives, two smaller islands (Vieques and Culebra) with residents, and many other smaller islands. The main island has a mountain range in the center, which covers most of the island. The highest point is 4,390 feet (1,338 meters)"
Itanium 9300 (Tukwila): 2010.
"The Itanium 9300 series processor, code-named ""Tukwila"", was released on February 8, 2010, with greater performance and memory amount."
"Tukwila uses a 65 nm process, has between two and four cores, up to 24 MB CPU cache, Hyper-Threading technology and new memory controllers. It also has double-device data correction, which helps to fix memory issues. Tukwila also has Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) to replace the Itanium bus architecture. It has a maximum inner-processor bandwidth of 96 GB/s and a maximum memory bandwidth of 34 GB/s. With QuickPath, the processor has built-in memory controllers, which controls the memory using QPI interfaces to communicate with other processors and I/O hubs. QuickPath is also used with Intel processors using the ""Nehalem"" architecture, so that Tukwila and Nehalem might be able to use the same chipsets."
"Tukwila incorporates four memory controllers, each of which supports multiple DDR3 DIMMs via a separate memory controller,"
"similar to the Nehalem Xeon processor code-named ""Beckton""."
Itanium 9500 (Poulson): 2012.
"The Itanium 9500 series processor, code-named ""Poulson"", is the follow-on processor to Tukwila and was released on November 8, 2012."
"Intel says it skips the 45 nm process technology and uses the 32 nm process technology instead; it features 8 cores, has a 12-wide issue architecture, multi-threading additions, and new instructions for parallelism, including virtualization."
"The Poulson L3 cache size is 32 MB. L2 cache size is 6 MB, 512 I KB, 256 D KB per core. Poulson's size is 544 mm², less than Tukwila's size (698.75 mm²)."
"At ISSCC 2011, Intel presented a paper called, ""A 32nm 3.1 Billion Transistor 12-Wide-Issue Itanium Processor for Mission Critical Servers."""
"Given Intel's history of sharing details about Itanium microprocessors at ISSCC, this paper most likely refers to Poulson. Analyst David Kanter speculates that Poulson will use a new architecture, with a more advanced form of multi-threading that uses as many as two threads, to improve performance for single threaded and multi-threaded work."
New information was released at Hot Chips conference.
"The new information claims improvements in multithreading, reliability improvements (Instruction Replay RAS) and some new instructions (thread priority, integer instruction, cache pre-fetching, data access hints)."
"In Intel's Product Change Notification (PCN) 111456–01, it listed 4 models of Itanium 9500 series CPU, which were removed in a revised version of the document. The parts were later listed in Intel's Material Declaration Data Sheets (MDDS) database. Intel later posted Itanium 9500 reference manual."
The models are:
Market share.
"In comparison with its Xeon server processors, Itanium has never been a large product for Intel. Intel does not release production numbers. One industry analyst estimated that the production rate was 200,000 processors per year in 2007."
"According to Gartner Inc., the total number of Itanium servers (not processors) sold by all vendors in 2007, was about 55,000. (It is unclear whether clustered servers counted as a single server or not.) This compares with 417,000 RISC servers (spread across all RISC vendors) and 8.4 million x86 servers. IDC reports that a total of 184,000 Itanium-based systems were sold from 2001 through 2007. For the combined POWER/SPARC/Itanium systems market, IDC reports that POWER captured 42% of revenue and SPARC captured 32%, while Itanium-based system revenue reached 26% in the second quarter of 2008."
"According to an IDC analyst, in 2007, HP had about 80% of Itanium system revenue."
"According to Gartner, in 2008, HP had 95% of Itanium sales. HP's Itanium system sales were at $4.4 Billion at the end of 2008, and $3.5 Billion by the end of 2009,"
"compared to a 35% decline in UNIX system revenue for Sun and an 11% drop for IBM, with an x86-64 server revenue increase of 14% during this period."
"In December 2012, IDC released a research report stating that Itanium server shipments would remain flat through 2016, with annual shipment of 26,000 systems (a decline of over 50% compared to shipments in 2008)."

Systems.
", only a few providers have Itanium systems, such as HP, Bull, NEC, Inspur and Huawei. Intel offers a chassis that can be used by system integrators to build Itanium systems."
"HP, the only one of the industry's top 4 server manufacturers to sell Itanium systems today, creating at least 80% of all Itanium systems. HP sold 7,200 systems in the first quarter of 2006."
"Most Itanium systems sold are enterprise servers and machines for large-scale technical computing, with each system costing about US $200,000. A typical system uses eight or more Itanium processors."
Chipsets.
"The Itanium bus communicates with the rest of the system. Enterprise server makers differentiate their systems by making their own chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Creation of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them has developed chipsets to support technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express."
"Currently, modern chipsets for Itanium supporting such technologies are manufactured by HP, Fujitsu, SGI, NEC, and Hitachi."
"The ""Tukwila"" Itanium processor model had been designed to share a common chipset with the Intel Xeon processor EX (Intel's Xeon processor designed for four processor and larger servers). The goal is to streamline system development and reduce costs for server OEMs, many of whom develop both Itanium- and Xeon-based servers. However, in 2013, this goal was pushed back to ""evaluated for future implementation opportunities""."

Main battle tank
"A main battle tank (MBT), also called a battle tank, is a tank that is used as the most powerful combat vehicle in modern armies. They were made to replace the light, medium and heavy tanks used in World War II with just one tank. Lighter armor made it easier to put bigger guns on tanks without adding weight. Light tanks are still used in places where heavy ones cannot go."
MBT's are the main force in ground fights but get help from other combat vehicles and soldiers who travel in infantry combat vehicles. They also get help from observation or attack aircraft.
History.
Cold War.
Medium tanks were the earliest MBTs. MBTs started replacing medium tanks when guns on medium tanks became powerful enough to win against heavy tanks. Heavy tanks could not carry armor strong enough to win against medium tanks.
The nuclear weapon threat and other anti-tank weapons in the Cold War made countries add more protection to survive in all types of combat. Weapon designers made powerful cannons to defeat the armor.
"The British Centurion is generally considered to have been the world’s first main battle tank, although the term was not popularised until long after it entered service. The British followed this up with the Chieftain main battle tank, which entered service in 1966. The first Soviet main battle tank was the T-64 and the first American MBT was the M60 Patton. By the late 1970s, MBT's were manufactured by France, West Germany, Britain, India, Japan, the USSR, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States."
The Soviet Union made MBTs very quickly because it needed them for their type of war. The Soviet Union improved the cannon by replacing the loader crewman with an automatic autoloader. This made the turret smaller which also makes the tank harder to see or hit The Soviet Union made missiles that could be shot much farther than other ammunition.
Gulf War.
"After the Cold War, American tanks quickly defeated Iraqi tanks in the Gulf War. The American MBTs were still not as good as attack helicopters at destroying Iraqi tanks. Some people said that the MBTs could not stop an enemy force from attacking."
Swami Vivekananda
"Vivekananda (Shami Bibekānondo) (January 12, 1863–July 4, 1902) was the chief disciple of Shri Ramakrishna Paramahansa. At birth, he was called Narendranath Datta (Bengali: নরেন্দ্রনাথ দত্ত). He was the founder of Ramakrishna Mission. He introduced Hindu philosophy of Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and America. He brought Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the end of the 19th century."
"Vivekananda is considered to be a major force in the revival of Hinduism in modern India. He is perhaps best known for his inspiring speech beginning with ""Sisters and Brothers of America"". Through this he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions at Chicago in 1893."
Vivekananda talked about Jnana Yoga in one of his discourses—
"""“ The Mahabharata is an epic that most Indians know. Let me give you a summary through Vyasa’s initial shloka. This shloka holds the entire summary of this gigantic epic. The shloka is given in the initial of the Vyasa’s texts itself which says-"""
"The Hastinapur (Duryodhana) is an old tree of spirituality, the incarnation of all virtues, i.e Vrisha Karna is its trunk, king Dhritarashtra and Bhishma are its roots, Drona, Dushashana and Kauravas are its branches, the evil Shakuni is its blooming flower and I myself Krishna Dwaipayana along with Narada and saptarishis are its twigs. Indraprastha (Yudhisthira) is a new tree of righteousness, Krishna is its trunk, Sages and Brahmins are its roots, Bhima and Arjuna are its branches, Nakul and Sahdev are its twigs, Vrishaketu is its fruit."
"""I would also like to narrate you interpretation of shlokas by sage Bhasa whose writings and proses included scraps of history, tales and legends. He regarded the त्रिदुष्टम or the 3 evils against the progress of Bharata- evil Indra, Drona and Arjuna. The shloka was written in Sanskrit, translated in Prakrit language. It’s English translation goes like this."""
"The great Aryavartha shall never go on the path of progress if it has evils in this society who discriminate worthy men and who are arrogant in their nature. Ravana too was arrogant through his deeds and his name vanished away from history forever. The त्रिसदुष्टम- Arjuna, his arrogant preceptor Drona and his evil father Indra are an allegory of discrimination and Kshatriya arrogance of the society. There will always be domination-discrimination, arrogance and the त्रिदुष्टम in every society, consider it a rule of the nature but for every त्रिदुष्टम, there will be a heroic Karna to shatter this arrogance and dominance, and shall attain great fame and name in world."
"In his youth he visited the ramakrishna Samaj and later he came in contact with Sri Ramakrishna. Sri Ramakrishna initiated him, and after his death Narendranath left his house and went on to found the Ramkrishna movement."
Vivekananda's mission.
"Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to humankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions."
Ashford Black Marble
"Ashford Black Marble is a kind of dark limestone, which was mined from Ashford-in-the-Water, in Derbyshire, England. Once cut, turned and polished, its shiny black surface becomes very beautiful. Strictly speaking, Ashford Black Marble is not a marble formed by heat, but a smooth sedimentary rock, a hard mass of dusty minerals. To make art objects, Ashford Black Marble can be cut as materials of them and put together with other fine stones. Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals."
History.
Ashford Black Marble had been used for decorative purpose since the prehistoric age. Bess of Hardwick was known to use Ashford Black Marble.
"Henry Watson played important roles in the development of the local industry of inlaying Ashford Black Marble in the 1750s. He was the uncle of Derbyshire geologist White Watson, and had a water-powered mill at Ashford in the Water."
"Pots, obelisks, and other decorative items of AMB were frequently traded during the late 18th and early 19th century. John Mawe had a museum in Matlock Bath that dealt in black marble. Ann Rayner carved Black Marble into pictures using a diamond. Many art objects of Ashford Black Marble are collected in local institutions, including those of Derby Museum, Buxton Museum, and Chatsworth House. In 2009, huge blocks of Ashford Black Marble were found underground in Derby. The auction of these was planed because these blocks are valuable. The rocks might have been abandoned when an ""Ashford Black Marble"" manufacturer moved in the 1880s."

Red Bull Brasil
"Red Bull Brasil, also known as RB Brasil, is a Brazilian association football club from Campinas, São Paulo. The club was founded in 2007 by initiative of energy drink-maker Red Bull GmbH. Red Bull Brasil plays in the top tier of Campeonato Paulista, the São Paulo state league. In 2017, Red Bull Brasil makes their second appearance in the fourth tier of Campeonato Brasileiro (the first was in 2015)."
Great American Interchange
The Great American Interchange was an important zoogeographic event about three million years ago. Land and freshwater fauna migrated between North America and South America.
"The migration happened during the Pliocene, 3.6–2.6 million years ago (mya). The volcanic Isthmus of Panama rose from the seafloor and bridged the two continents."
The land bridge in what is now Panama joined the Neotropic (roughly South America) and Nearctic (roughly North America) ecozones to form the Americas.
"The interchange is visible from both stratigraphy and nature. Its most dramatic effect is on the distribution of mammals, but weak-flying or flightless birds, reptiles, amphibians, arthropods and even freshwater fish also migrated."
"The differences in the fauna of North and South America had been known for some time. Both Humboldt and Darwin discussed it. The interchange as a concept was first fully laid out in 1876 by the ""father of biogeography"", Alfred Russel Wallace. Wallace had spent 1848–1852 exploring and collecting specimens in the Amazon Basin. Others who made significant contributions to understanding the event in the century that followed include Florentino Ameghino and George Gaylord Simpson."
"Similar interchanges occurred earlier in the Cainozoic, when the former Gondwana continents of India and Africa made contact with Eurasia, about 50 and 30 mya respectively."
Plate tectonics.
"When the global continent Pangaea broke up early in the Jurassic period, the great southern supercontinent Gondwana was formed. It separated from Laurasia 200–180 mya."
"In stages, Gondwana also broke up, eventually into half-a-dozen continents we recognise today. They were Australasia, Indian subcontinent, Africa, Madagascar, Antarctica and South America."
"South America drifted west from Africa, starting about 130 mya in the Lower Cretaceous. There was open sea between them by 110 mya. The last connection of South America with any part of Gondwana was a link with West Antarctica, which broke in the Oligocene, only 30 mya."
Relevance to biogeography.
"When Gondwana was separated from Laurasia, evolution of most animals and plants went on separately in the two great supercontinents. Later, as Gondwana broke up, most of its fauna and flora also evolved separately."
"This is not obvious in Africa and India, since they moved north and joined the Eurasian continent long ago. Animals and plants moved north and south there also, but the original pattern is now hard to see. But in Australasia and South America the pattern is clear."
"The mammals are a good example. Eutherian mammals evolved in Laurasia but few got to Gondwana before it was separated. Earlier groups of mammals did get to Gondwana. They were the marsupials, the monotremes and other (now extinct) therian mammals."
"Thus, when South America was completely separated, it had only the earlier types of mammals, including some early eutherians such as the Xenarthra. The groups which evolved later, and which dominate the northern continents, only got to South America by the Great American Interchange."
South America's endemic fauna.
"After the late Mesozoic breakup of Gondwana, South America spent most of the Cainozoic era as an island continent."
"Its ""splendid isolation"" allowed the fauna to evolve into many forms found nowhere else on earth, most of which are now extinct."
Early mammals.
"The endemic mammals initially consisted of metatherians (including marsupials, xenarthrans, and a diverse group of South American ungulates."
Marsupials appear to have travelled from South America through Antarctica to Australasia in the late Cretaceous or early Tertiary.
"Ratites (relatives of South American tinamous) probably migrated by this route about the same time, in the direction from South America towards Australia/New Zealand."
"Other taxa that may have dispersed by the same route (if not by flying or rafting) are parrots, chelid turtles and (extinct) meiolaniid turtles."
"One living South American marsupial, the tiny Monito del Monte, is more closely related to Australian marsupials than to other South American marsupials. Since it is the most 'basal' (= primitive) australidelphian we know, its group probably evolved in South America and then colonized Australia."
A 61 mya old platypus-like monotreme fossil from Patagonia may be an Australian immigrant.
"Marsupials in South America included didelphimorphs (opossums), shrew opossums and several other small groups."
Predators.
"The borhyaenids and the sabertooth ""Thylacosmilus"" were once considered to be marsupials. They are sparassodont metatherians, the sister group of the marsupials. Sparassodonts were the only South American mammals to specialize as carnivores. Their relative inefficiency left opportunites for nonmammalian predators to be more prominent than usual (similar to the )."
Reception.
"IGN rated the game a 9.1 out of 10 and said ""The hardcore fans will get plenty of enjoyment out of the difficult AI, the awesome multiplayer modes and the super deep Create-A-Wrestler mode.”"
"GameSpot gave the game a 6.5 out of 10 and stated ""While the game does some things very well, it generally falls short of expectations."""
Absurd
Absurd can refer to several different things:
Matthew Fox
"Matthew Chandler Fox (born July 14, 1966) is an American actor. He is known for his roles as Charlie Salinger on ""Party of Five"" and Jack Shephard on the supernatural drama television series ""Lost""."
John C. McGinley
"John Christopher McGinley (born August 3, 1959) is an American actor, comedian, spokesperson, and writer. He is known for his roles as Perry Cox in ""Scrubs"", Bob Slydell in ""Office Space"", Sergeant Red O'Neill in Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" and Marv in Stone's ""Wall Street"". He has also written and produced for television and movies. McGinley is also an author and a spokesperson for the National Down Syndrome Society."
Evolution (professional wrestling)
"Evolution is a professional wrestling stable that competes in the WWE. The stable was created on January 20, 2003 and broke up on October 3, 2005."
"The members of the stable were Triple H, Randy Orton, Batista and Ric Flair. Triple H acted as the leader and Flair acted as a mentor. The members of the stable each portrayed evolutions of professional wrestling with Ric Flair being ""the past"", Triple H being ""the present"" and Randy Orton and Batista being ""the future"". They all portrayed heels."
"On April 14, 2014, Evolution, not including Ric Flair, reunited. They came down to the ring to their theme ""Line in the Sand"" by Motörhead and attacked The Shield."
"On the June 2 episode of ""Raw"", Batista quit the WWE after he had his title match request denied by Triple H. Later in the night, Triple H said that he had a ""Plan B"" in his quest to destroy the Shield, which prompted Rollins to turn on and attack his group members Reigns and Ambrose."
Nôm
"Nôm is a script formerly used in Vietnam. It involved the use of Chinese characters to write Vietnamese. The Van Ban bell, engraved in 1076, has the earliest known example of a Nôm inscription. The earliest surviving Nôm literature dates from the 13th century. The script was in common use until the 1920s. It was replaced by the Vietnamese alphabet. The Vietnamese alphabet is a form of the Latin alphabet."
"Classical Chinese was used by the royal court and for other official purposes. The Temple of Literature in Hanoi was the best-known school for the study of Chinese. Students who passed the civil service examinations could go on to become magistrates. Confucian scholars saw Chinese as the language of education and looked down on Nôm, while popular opinion favored Nôm. Only a small percentage of the population was literate in any language, but nearly every village had at least one person who could read Nôm."
"In Nôm, a Vietnamese word can be written using a Chinese character for a word with a similar meaning or pronunciation. Each character represents an idea. Such characters are called ""ideographs."" In addition, each character represents a syllable, or sound. Because traditional characters have this dual property, nearly every syllable in modern Vietnamese has acquired a semantic meaning. Like Chinese, Vietnamese is a tonal language. Since the issue of tone does not arise for Japanese or Korean, native phonetic scripts could develop for these languages without this complicating factor."
"Sino-Vietnamese characters were eventually displaced by an alphabetic script. Unlike alphabets used elsewhere, the Vietnamese alphabet has marks to indicate tone. In contrast to South Korea and Japan, modern Vietnam does not require students to study the traditional characters. Fewer than 100 scholars worldwide can read Nôm. Vietnamese literature written in Nôm, including classics like ""Tale of Kieu"" and the poetry of Ho Xuan Huong, can now be read only in translation. However, character calligraphy remains popular as a home decoration and as a symbol of good luck. The Han-Nom Institute, founded in 1970, collects and studies relevant manuscripts. The Nôm Ideographs were added to Unicode in 2001. Unicode is an international electronic encoding standard."
Language issues.
"Chinese characters are used to write various languages in China and elsewhere, including Mandarin, the most widely spoken language in China, Cantonese, spoken in Hong Kong and southern China, and Classical Chinese, traditionally used for formal writing. The characters were formerly used in Korea and in Vietnam. Japan uses a mix of Chinese characters and native phonetic script. Even characters that retain their original meaning in all languages may be read in various ways. The character 十 is given as ""shí"" in Chinese romanization (pinyin), ""jū"" in Japanese romanization (Hepburn), ""sip"" in Korean romanization (Revised Romanization), and ""thập"" in the Han-Viet system used in Vietnam. In all these languages, the meaning of the character is “ten.”"
Syntax.
"Modifiers normally come before the noun in Chinese, but follow the noun in vernacular Vietnamese. Chinese texts published in Vietnam often included a line-by-line translation into Nôm. Even when the same characters appear in both languages, the order is different. Many Chinese phrases gained currency as loan words. Later, the word order could be reversed to correspond to normal Vietnamese syntax. The word ""Vietnam"" is from Chinese ""Nányuè"" (南越), meaning “Southern Yue”. In Han-Viet, the same characters are read as . The word order was reversed in modern times. In Chinese, the phrase “Chinese characters” is written 漢字. This is romanized as ""hànzì"" in pinyin, kanji in Japanese, hanja in Korean, and in Han-Viet. In modern Vietnamese, they are ."
Character construction.
"The majority of the characters used in Nôm are of Chinese origin and are composed phonosemantically. For example, the character ""喃"" is read as ""Nôm"", whose phonetic component ""南"" similar to the Cantonese pronunciation ""Naam4"" and means “chattering.” This rule is consistent in all Chu Nôm characters as all Vietnamese made characters are composed using this method. The word ""Nôm"" does not have any negative connotation in Vietnamese, but rather suggests plain talk, something easy to understand."
"Nôm includes thousands of characters not found in Chinese. In contrast, Japan developed only a few hundred kokuji, Korea just a handful of rarely used gukja. These characters were created by authors who combined pre-existing elements. One element, called the ""semantic component"", indicates the character's meaning, either pictographically or ideographically. The other element, called the ""phonetic component"", gives pronunciation. For example, the reading ""ba"" is indicated by the character . In Mandarin, this character has the same pronunciation as in Vietnamese, but it's meaning is unrelated: ""to long for."" For the character (⿺巴三), the character 三 which means ""three"" is added as the semanic component. ""Father"" is also ""ba"", but written as (⿱父巴). ""Turtle"" is ""con ba ba"" (; ⿰虫巴). Most Chinese characters were created by the same method. As the correspondence between sound and meaning is compounded in Vietnamese created characters than it is in Chinese characters, the same approach resulted in two distinctions between Nôm characters; chữ Nôm (字喃; native characters) and Hán Nôm (漢喃; Han characters)."
"Of the 9,299 Nôm Ideographs, nearly half are specific to Vietnam. Each character has a codepoint assigned by Unicode. The characters for the V0, V1, and V2 sets were extracted from two Nôm dictionaries published in the 1970s. The V3 characters were extracted from manuscripts."
Absinthe spoon
"An absinthe spoon is simply a special spoon, placed over a glass of absinthe. There are holes in the spoon, over which a sugar cube is placed. Then, cold water is poured over the sugar to dilute and sweeten the absinthe."
Domain name
"A domain name is a human-readable web address (e.g. ""google.com"") that points to an IP address and helps users to access websites or other resources in a convenient way."
Extensions.
"""See main article: URL"""
"Domain names have extensions (called ""top-level domains"") at the end of the URL. For example "".com"", "".net"" and "".org"" are the most commonly used domain name extensions. The most popular domain extension is .com with more than 100 million domains registered. The .com extension stands for ""commercial"", .org for organization and .net for network."
"There are also country-specific domain name extensions. For example, the United Kingdom has the "".uk"" domain extension and Japan has "".jp""."
Edinburgh International Festival
"The Edinburgh International Festival is a festival of music, theatre, opera, dance, visual arts and literature that takes place every year in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. Each year it is held for about three weeks in late August and early September."
"The festival started in 1947. A key person was Rudolf Bing, who was then the manager of the Glyndbourne Opera Festival. Bing was later General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1950 to 1972. He was naturalized as a British subject in 1946 and knighted in 1971. His idea was to heal the wounds of war through the languages of the arts. Since 2014 the director of the festival has been Fergus Linehan."
"At first the Festival concentrated on classical music. Its later events were based on the traditional arts: classical music, ballet, sculpture and fine art. Since 1999 the permanent home of the festival is at The Hub, near Edinburgh Castle. Several large theatres, concert halls and churches in Edinburgh are used for the events, e.g. Usher Hall, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh Playhouse, The Queen's Hall and The Hub."
"About ten other festivals are held in Edinburgh at the same time as the Edinburgh Festival. The result is festivals with more than 2,500 performances and events per day in Edinburgh in August, many times bigger than the next biggest arts festivals anywhere in the world."
2020 is the only year the Festival has not been held. The reason was the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic.
Edinburgh Festival Fringe
"The Edinburgh Festival Fringe (The Fringe) is the world’s largest arts festival. It started in 1947. It takes place every year at the same time as the Edinburgh International Festival: late August and early September. There are hundreds of different events. There are concerts, theatre, opera, and dance and many informal events."
"The organisers are the Festival Fringe Society: they publish a programme every year, sell tickets and give advice to performers from the Fringe office on the Royal Mile."
"The Edinburgh Festival itself is recognised to offer high-quality events. However, the Fringe events are variable, and entry has no real quality barriers. It is largely an open event where almost any theatrical or show event can be performed. Its lack of supervision means the shows are of unpredictable standard. All events have an entrance charge, which is reasonable because theatres do charge performers."
Ante Pavelić
"Ante Pavelić (14 July 1889 ; Bradina,Austria-Hungary– 28 December 1959 ; Madrid,Spain) was the founding member of the Croatian national socialist/fascist Ustaše movement and terrorist organization in the 1930s. Later, during World War II, he will be the leader (""Poglavnik"" - Head) of the Independent State of Croatia, a puppet state of Nazi Germany."
Early life.
"Ante Pavelić was born in Bradina, a small village roughly 15 kilometres south west of Hadžići in Bosnia and Herzegovina, then Austria-Hungary, although he draws his roots from southern Lika, in the small town of Krivi Put on the central part of the Velebit plain. His parents moved to Bosnia. As an adult, Ante Pavelić decided to move to Zagreb to study the law. An extremist even in his youth, he became a member of the organization known as the ""Frankovci"" whose founder, Dr. Josip Frank, was the father-in-law of Slavko Kvaternik, an Austro-Hungarian army officer. In 1919 he was the interim secretary of the Pure Party of Rights. In 1921 he was arrested along with several other members of the party but was released; he defended them at the trial and lost. Kvaternik had long been a strong advocate of Croat separatism and the German ideas on a separate Croat state found in him a ready tool."
"Pavelić's quarrelsome nature became more and more apparent in the years immediately after the first war when he became involved in one dispute after another with the Centralist Party and the Croat Peasant Party of Radić. He was the sole representative of his Party in the ""Skupština"" (Yugoslav Parliament) but rarely attended sessions and, when he did, he sulked in his seat and only occasionally indulged in a long harangue in protest against some measure which he did not approve."
1920s and 1930s.
"In the early 1920s, Pavelić began to establish his contacts with Croat émigrées in Vienna and Budapest and later entered into close accord with the Macedonian terrorist society IMRO. In 1927 he acted as counsel for the defense of the Macedonian terrorists at the Skopje trials."
"In 1927 he was elected to the Zagreb city council. He held the position of the party secretary in the Party of Rights until 1929 and the beginning of royal government in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Shortly after the proclamation of the establishment of the government Alexander I of Yugoslavia in January 1929, Pavelić fled abroad and was subsequently sentenced to death in absentia at Belgrade for his part in anti-Serb demonstrations organized at Sofia by Bulgarian and Macedonian terrorists. He then co-founded the Ustaše terrorist organization and went underground."
"Camps for training terrorists and saboteurs were set up in Italy and Hungary, chiefly at Brescia and Borgotaro in Italy and Janka Puszta in Hungary and an armed insurrection was attempted in 1933 when the Ustaše, armed by the Italians, attempted to invade the country by crossing the Adriatic sea in motorboats. This was unsuccessful but its lack of success probably was instrumental in the decision to assassinate King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Two attempts were made, the last one successful and Aleksandar was slain at Marseilles 9 October 1934 along with the French Foreign Minister, Louis Barthou."
"According to Pliny the Elder, an expedition of Mauretanians sent by Juba II to the archipelago visited the islands: when King Juba II dispatched a contingent to re-open the dye production facility at Mogador (historical name of Essaouira, Morocco) in the early 1st century CE Juba's naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, Madeira and probably the Cape Verde islands, using Mogador as their mission base."
"We have even recorded historically that, according to Pliny the Elder, the Greek Xenophon of Lampsacus stated that the Gorgades (Cape Verde islands) were situated two days from ""Hesperu Ceras"" (today called Cap-Vert), the westernmost part of the African continent, showing a knowledge of the area by the Romans."
"Furthermore, according to Pliny the Elder and his citation by Gaius Julius Solinus, the sea voyage time crossing the Gorgades (Cape Verde islands) to the islands of the Ladies of the West (""Hesperides"", actual São Tomé and Príncipe and Fernando Po) was around 40 days: this fact has created academic discussions about the possibility of further Roman travels toward Guinea and even the Gulf of Guinea. A Roman coin of the emperor Trajan has been found in Congo."
"Aelius Gallus in 25 BCE led an expedition across the Red Sea against the Sabaeans of Arabia Felix (modern Yemen). In order to control Sabaea the Romans took control of both sides of the entrance to the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, since Cornelius Gallus had established a garrison at Arsinoe (near Assab, in actual Eritrea) on the Ethiopian shore."
This was the only Roman outpost in eastern Africa south of Egypt and lasted a few decades.
Maritime commerce.
"Emperor Augustus decided that the circumnavigation of Africa should also be attempted (in 1 BC). Romans had two naval ouposts in the Atlantic coast of Africa: Sala near present Rabat and Mogador in southern Maroc (north of Agadir). The island of Mogador prospered for the local exploitation of purple (highly esteemed in imperial Rome) from Augustus until Septimius Severus times. Augustus, based even in the discovery of a sunken merchant ship from southern Spain in the Djibuti area (done by his adoptive son Gaius Caesar when he sailed toward Aden), wanted to organize an expedition from Egypt to Mogador and Sala around Africa."
The eastern coast of Africa south of Egypt was at the center of a huge sea commerce between Rome and India through the Somali coast.
"Roman books such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and Ptolomey's ""Geography"" list a string of market places (emporia) along this coast. Finds of Roman-era coins along the coast confirm the existence of this huge trade even in coastal Tanzania, and Ptolomey's Geography refers to a town of Rhapta as ""metropolis"" of a political entity called Azania near actual Zanzibar. Archaeologists have not yet succeeded in identifying the location of Rhapta, though many believe it lies deeply buried in the silt of the delta of the Rufiji River."
"The scholar Felix Chami found archaeological evidence for extensive Roman trade on Mafija island near the Kenyan coast and, not far away, on the African mainland, near the mouth of the Rufiji River and the northern Mozambique coast, which he dated to the first few centuries AD."
"Roman coins have been found in Zimbabwe and Madagascar, supporting the possibility that Roman vessels sailed south of Azania toward the area of the gold mines of the Zambesi river and the legendary Greater Zimbabwe kingdom."
The Little Match Girl
"""The Little Match Girl"" is a story by Hans Christian Andersen. It was first published in December 1845. Andersen got the idea to write the story after seeing a print by Johan Thomas Lundbye of a little girl selling matches. The story has been adapted to various media including an animated movie."
Story.
"A little match girl in poverty lights all the matches she carries to keep herself warm on a cold New Year's Eve. Afraid of beating by her father when she could not sell any match, she could not return home. In the glow of the firelight, she sees wonderful visions of a Christmas tree and a festive dinner. In the sky, she sees a shooting star, which her late grandmother had told means someone is on their way to Heaven. The last vision is her dead grandmother, the only person to ever show her any love. The little match girl dies in the cold, and ascends into Heaven with her grandmother."
The Steadfast Tin Soldier
"""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The story was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C.A. Reitzel on 2 October 1838 in the first booklet of ""Fairy Tales Told for Children."" The booklet includes Andersen's ""The Daisy"" and ""The Wild Swans"". The story was Andersen’s first story not based upon a folk tale or a literary model. ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" has been adapted to various media including ballet and animated movie."
"The story tells of a tin soldier who loves a paper ballerina. He falls from the window in the toy room. After many adventures, he is returned to the toy room. A little boy throws the tin soldier in the fire. A breeze blows the paper ballerina into the fire. The two toys are destroyed together."
"Joan G. Haahr writes in ""The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales"": ""The story is unusual among Andersen's early tales, both in its emphasis on sensual desire and in its ambiguities. Blind fate, not intention, determines all events. Moreover, the narrative questions the very decorum it praises. The tin soldier's passive acceptance of whatever happens to him, while exemplifying pietistic ideals of self-denial, also contributes to his doom. Were he to speak and act, the soldier might gain both life and love. Restrained, however, by inhibition and convention, he finds only tragedy and death. The tale is often read autobiographically, with the soldier viewed as symbolizing Andersen's feelings of inadequacy with women, his passive acceptance of bourgeois class attitudes, or his sense of alienation as an artist and an outsider, from full participation in everyday life."""

Background.
History.
"Chinese characters were introduced to Vietnam after the Han Empire conquered the country in 111 BC. Independence was achieved in 939, but the Chinese writing system was adopted for official purposes in 1010. Vietnamese began to use Chinese characters to write in their own language at about this time. The Van Ban bell, engraved in 1076, is the earliest known example of a Nôm inscription. Nguyen Thuyen composed Nôm poetry in the 13th century. However, none of his work has survived. The oldest surviving Nôm text is the collected poetry of King Tran Nhan Tong, written in the 13th century. Many Nôm documents were destroyed by the Chinese during the Ming occupation of 1407-1428. Nguyen Trai (1380–1442) wrote both Chinese and Nôm literature in the 15th century. Trinh Thi Ngoc Truc, consort of King Le Than Tong, is credited with a 24,000-character bilingual Chinese-to-Vietnamese dictionary written in the 17th century."
"Unlike Chinese, Nôm was not studied or classified systematically for most of its history. Vietnamese authors who had studied Chinese applied the principles of Chinese writing to their native language. Although official records were generally kept in Chinese, Nôm was used under two short-lived dynasties, the Ho dynasty (1400-1407) and the Tay Son (1778–1802). King Minh Mang (1820-1841) opposed literacy and the use of Nôm. In 1838, Jean-Louis Taberd wrote a Nôm dictionary that eventually gained general acceptance and wide circulation. In 1867, Catholic scholar Nguyen Truong To petitioned King Tu Duc to replace Classical Chinese with Nôm in official usage. The king did not consent to this, but he did respond with various efforts to promote Nôm. A decree was issued entitled ""Please respect ""quốc âm"" [the national voice]."""
"In the 19th century, there was a flowering of popular literature written in Nôm, including such classics as Nguyen Du's ""The Tale of Kieu"" and the poetry of Ho Xuan Huong. Although only 3 to 5 percent of the population was literate, nearly every village had someone who could read Nôm aloud for the benefit of other villagers."
"In Korea and Japan, the traditional writing system was simplified so it could be taught to the general public. Vietnam's educated class looked down on Nôm as inferior to Chinese, so it was not interested in doing the work required to simplify and standardize the system so that it could be used for mass communication."
"Like Chinese, Vietnamese is a tonal language. It has nearly 5,000 distinct syllables, far more than other East Asian language do. Phonetic scripts used elsewhere, including hangul in Korea and kana in Japan, do not indicate tone, so they cannot be applied to the Vietnamese language. As in Chinese, a semantic meaning is attributed to every syllable. This characteristic of the language may be can considered a result of the traditional writing system."
"Beginning in the late 19th century, the French colonial authorities promoted the use of the Vietnamese alphabet, which they viewed as a stepping stone toward learning French. Language reform in other Asian nations stimulated Vietnamese interest in the subject. Following the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, Japan was often cited as a model for Asian modernization. Nationalists embraced the alphabet as ""quốc ngữ"" (the national language), and as a tool for promoting literacy. The Confucian education system was compared unfavorably to the Japanese system of public education. Nationalist writer Phan Boi Chau encouraged the young to ""study in the East,"" meaning Japan."
"The popularity of Hanoi's short-lived Tonkin Free School suggested that broad reform was possible. In 1910, the colonial school system adopted a ""Franco-Vietnamese curriculum,"" which emphasized French and alphabetic Vietnamese. The teaching of Sino-Vietnamese characters was discontinued in 1917. On December 28, 1918, King Khai Dinh declared that the traditional writing system no longer had official status. The civil service exam was given for the last time at the imperial capital of Hue on January 4, 1919. This exam tested knowledge of Chinese. The examination system, and the education system based on it, had been in effect for almost 900 years. China itself abandoned Classical Chinese soon afterward as part of the May Fourth Movement."
"In the 1920s, the Vietnamese alphabet became the country’s dominant writing system. By the 1930s, the use of Sino-Vietnamese characters was largely restricted to books with limited woodbock printings intended for the Buddhist clergy. In more recent times, the traditional characters have been used mainly in calligraphy, such as wedding decorations. In 2012, manuscripts in Classical Chinese were translated to support Vietnam's claim to the Paracel Islands."

Dio Chrysostom
"Dio Chrysostom (; ""Dion Chrysostomos""), Dion of Prusa or Dio Cocceianus (c. 40 – c. 115 AD) was a Greek speaker, writer, philosopher and historian of the Roman Empire. He lived in the 1st century, from about the year 40 to around the year 115. He is also known as Dion of Prusa or Dio Cocceianus. Eighty of his ""Discourses"" (or ""Orations"") are known. A few Letters and a funny mock essay In Praise of Hair, as well as a few other fragments also survive. His surname ""Chrysostom"" comes from the Greek ""chrysostomos"", which literally means ""golden-mouthed"". He should not be confused with the Roman historian Cassius Dio, nor with the 4th-century bishop John Chrysostom of Constantinople."
Cauchy's integral formula
"In mathematics, Cauchy's integral formula is a central statement in complex analysis. The statement is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy. It expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk. The statement also provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function. Cauchy's formula shows that, in complex analysis, ""differentiation is equivalent to integration"": complex differentiation, like integration, behaves well under uniform limits – a result denied in real analysis."
"Magdalen College, Oxford"
"Magdalen College is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. The Bishop of Winchester, William of Waynflete, founded the college in 1458. The full name of the college is ""The President and Fellows of the College of St. Mary Magdalene in the University of Oxford""."
"At dawn on May Day, the College choir sings hymns from the top of the Magdalen Tower. Large crowds gather each year on Magdalen Bridge to hear the choir."
"Mansfield College, Oxford"
"Mansfield College is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. It was founded in 1838 as Spring Hill College in Birmingham. Spring Hill College moved to Oxford in 1886. At that time it was renamed Mansfield College, in honor of its largest donors, George and Elizabeth Mansfield. The college's main building was designed by Basil Champneys, and was completed in 1889."
"The first female student at Mansfield was admitted in 1913. In 1955, Mansfield was named a Permanent Private Hall at Oxford University. In 1995, Mansfield was granted a Royal Charter making it a full member of the University."
Chlöe Howl
"Chlöe Howl (born 4 March 1995) is an English singer. On 4 March 2013, her first extended play ""Rumor"" was released for free download. In June 2013, she released the video for her first single ""No Strings"". She released her second extended play ""No Strings"" on August 23. ""No Strings"" was played in the movie ""Kick-Ass 2""."
Howl was nominated for BBC's Sound of 2014 prize on 3 December 2013.
"On 5 December 2013, was nominated for the 2014 BRITs Critics' Choice Award."
Plot.
"After killing GLaDOS and escaping Aperture Science Laboratories, Chell, the protagonist of ""Portal"", is taken back to the labs and placed in suspended animation for many years. While she sleeps, the laboratories become more and more run down, because no one is there to take care of them. Once she wakes up, a small, dim-witted robot, known as a core, named Wheatley tries to help her escape the building. In the process, he accidentally reactivates GLaDOS, who, still angry with Chell for killing her, forces Chell to perform tests similar to the ones she performed in ""Portal""."
"While Chell solves the puzzles and GLaDOS repairs the building, Wheatley works behind the scenes to free Chell. Once he does, they try to sabotage GLaDOS's weapons, including her turrets and neurotoxin. In a confrontation with GLaDOS, Chell presses a button that removes GLaDOS from controlling the laboratory and puts Wheatley in her place. In anger, GLaDOS reveals that Wheatley is an intelligence-dampening sphere, created by scientists to distract GLaDOS from evil by distracting her with a constant stream of stupid ideas. Wheatley is outraged and becomes power-mad. He puts GLaDOS's AI into a potato and turns on Chell, sending them both deep underground to an abandoned part of the facility."
"Chell and GLaDOS end up in the ruins of Aperture Science Laboratories, started in the 1950s. While exploring the area, recorded messages by Aperture Science founder Cave Johnson and his secretary Caroline tell the history of the company and explain the many dangerous tests performed there. As Chell moves further up in the labs, time moves forward as well, into the 1970s. Cave reveals that the company is bankrupt and must use homeless people as test subjects rather than the astronauts and Olympic athletes they had used before. Here Chell reunites with GLaDOS, whom she places on her portal gun and carries with her."
"As they move forward, GLaDOS begins to repeat things that Caroline says and becomes confused. When they move into part of the lab that was used during the 1980s, a message from Cave says he has gotten cancer from working with moon dust and he is dying. After a rant about the unfairness of life, he says that he wants Caroline to run the company after he dies. GLaDOS comes up with a plan to destroy Wheatley once they find him."
"Chell and GLaDOS make it to the Enrichment Center near the surface and find Wheatley. GLaDOS attempts to short-circuit him by telling him a paradox. Unfortunately, Wheatley is not smart enough to understand it and the plan fails. Wheatley has discovered his new body gives him a feeling of euphoria when a subject solves a test. He tried to make cubes with legs to solve puzzles, but they were not good at it. Instead, he forces Chell to solve puzzles. As she solves more tests, Wheatley's feelings of euphoria become weaker, so he builds more and more complicated tests by smashing together test chambers that GLaDOS built."
"When Wheatley cannot get the result he wants from the tests, he decides to kill Chell and GLaDOS. They escape and eventually find him, leading to the final fight. GLaDOS helps Chell attach broken personality cores to Wheatley to weaken him and she tries to press the button that switched GLaDOS and Wheatley in the first place. When she is unable to, she shoots a portal on the floor below Wheatley and another on the moon, which can be seen through a hole in the roof. Wheatley is pulled from GLaDOS's body and released into space. Chell is almost pulled out too, but GLaDOS saves her and closes the portals."
"After saving Chell, GLaDOS speaks kindly to her, explaining that when she was created, she was given part of Caroline's personality. She thanks Chell for helping her find where Caroline's personality is in her ""brain"", then deletes it. Returning to her former self, GLaDOS tells Chell that she is too difficult to kill so she will stop trying and release her instead. Chell is sent to the surface by an elevator while the turrets sing opera. Once she makes it out, the Companion Cube is thrown at her, and she is free to go. As the credits roll, GLaDOS sings the song ""Want You Gone""."
Thriller (genre)
"A thriller is a genre found in literature, movies and television. It uses suspense, where the audience is made to wonder what is going to happen next. Thrillers often have a horror or crime theme. Some examples of thriller movies are ""Psycho"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", ""Argo"" and ""The Birds""."
Over the Limit (2011)
"Over the Limit (2011) is a future professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event to be made by WWE, which will happen on May 22, 2011 at the KeyArena in Seattle, Washington. It will be the second Over the Limit event."
Background.
Raw matches.
"The main event for the Raw side of the PPV was determined on the May 9 edition of Raw. The Miz, Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio faced off in a triple threat match where the winner would face John Cena for the WWE Championship at Over the Limit. The Miz won the match by rolling up Mysterio. After the match was over, as had been announced, Cena come out to announce what type of match he had chosen. He tole the Miz, if he wants his title back, it's simple, you only ""have to make me say two words"", thus he announced the match would be an ""I Quit"" match."
"Also on Raw, carrying over from their WrestleMania and Extreme Rules matches, Jerry Lawler challenged Michael Cole to one final match at Over the Limit, where if he lost he would personally induct Cole in to the WWE Hall of Fame and give him his Hall of Fame ring. Cole initially said no and started bragging about his Mothers Day with his mother the day before in front of Lawler, whose mother died in February. This prompted King to try and attack Cole who was in his ""Cole Mine"" (a Plexiglas box meant to protect Cole from Lawler). As King went to attack, he was attacked from behind by Cole's mentor Jack Swagger. A little later in the show, Lawler came back out and attacked Cole through the holes cut in the ""Cole Mine"" by yanking Cole's head repeatedly against the plexiglas by his tie. After he was saved, Swagger accepted the match against Lawler on behalf of Cole, much to Cole's displeasure."
Balkan Wars
The Balkan Wars were a series of wars fought in the Balkan Peninsula in 1912 (First Balkan War) and 1913 (Second Balkan War).
"The First Balkan War was fought by Greece, Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria (the Balkan League) against the Ottoman Empire. The main objective of the Balkan League was to annex the European territories of the Ottoman Empire, because large numbers of the people of the Balkan League lived under Ottoman rule. The war was a success and the Ottoman Empire lost almost its entire European territories."
"The Second Balkan War was fought by Greece, Serbia, the Ottoman Empire and Romania against Bulgaria. Because Bulgaria felt that Greece and Serbia got more lands than they deserved, Bulgaria declared war on Greece and Serbia, which repelled the attacks. The Ottoman Empire and Romania declared war on Bulgaria, because they wanted to gain Bulgarian territories, and by the end of the Second Balkan War Bulgaria had lost almost all its gains from the First Balkan War."
"The Balkan Wars resulted in huge casualties. The Bulgarians lost around 65,000 men, the Greeks 9,500, the Montenegrins, 3,000, and the Serbs at least 36,000. The Ottomans lost as many as 125,000 dead. In addition, tens of thousands of civilians died from disease and other causes."
"After the Treaty of Istanbul in 1913, a population exchange was made by the Ottoman Empire with the Kingdom of Bulgaria, 9714 Muslim's (Turks and Xoraxane Roma) from Haskovo in North Thrace, was expelled to Ottoman Empire, and 9472 Orthodox Christian Bulgarian from Edirne in East Thrace was expelled to Kingdom of Bulgaria."
"Derecho and tornado outbreak of April 4–5, 2011"
"The April 2011 derecho and tornado outbreak was a large scale event where tornadoes and derechoes, or widespread straight-line winds, damaged parts of 3 states resulting in 9 fatalities. The event happened from April 4 to April 5th."
History.
"On April 3, supercells formed in Illinois, and a squall line of severe thunderstorms formed in Iowa. The severe thunderstorms made large hail, and strong wind, and potentially tornadoes. Then, heavy rain formed west of the severe thunderstorms but the line kept producing severe weather. On April 4, the supercells also turned into a squall line of severe thunderstorms. The storms produced tornadoes. Then, supercells formed in Tennessee and produced tornadoes. By the night of April 4, the 2 lines of storms collided and moved East. By April 5, the severe thunderstorms were in New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida and moved out to sea. The storm produced a lot of tornadoes. Plenty of severe thunderstorm and tornado watches and warnings were issued."
Impacts.
Illinois.
"This publicity became a problem for Holding. The leaders at Kiwirrkurra were angry with him for giving the story to the press. The newspaper had published photographs of the family members without their permission. It had caused other reporters to try to enter their community to get information. They also did not agree with how the media was defining the event. The little information the press had been given had led to romanticised reports of a ""first contact"" or a ""discovery"". But from the Pintupi point of view, the family were relatives whom they knew and had a history with. As they saw it, the group had not been ""discovered"", but were just coming back together after being separated."
Health.
"When they had first arrived, a doctor from Kintore had examined the family and decided they were strong, fit, and very healthly. But in a few days time, they all got sick. They did not have any natural immunity to diseases. Holding wanted a government team of medical specialists to treat them. But Kiwirrkurra's leaders would not let any other doctors look at the family. The only people who were allowed to treat them were the local ""ngangkari"" (medicine man) and the doctor at Kintore."
"At this time, the Pintupi still blamed government doctors for the deaths of many of their people who had come in from the desert during the 1960s. These people had died from infection and disease, and Holding was trying to avoid this happening again. By early November, serious concerns about the survival of the family were being raised. The secretary of the department of Aboriginal Affairs, Charles Perkins, strongly criticised the Kiwirrkurra leaders for violating the family's civil rights. He said that if they did not get the proper medical care, all nine of them would die within two months."
"The doctor at Kintore thought that it was the Pintupi's responsibility to decide what was best for their own. They trusted him, and let him treat the family. All nine of the family members had caught coughs and a bacterial infection called treponema. The doctor treated them and gave them several immunisations. They eventually became healthy again."
Today.
"The eldest brother, Piyiti, returned to the desert in 1986. He left in secret and covered his tracks so nobody could follow him. It is not clear why he left, or whether anyone knows why. One local claimed it was because he had heard stories about Pintupi people dying from diseases, and was afraid it would happen to him. McMahon thinks it was because he found it hard to adapt (adjust) to things—particularly conflict, since he had lived all his life with his family. There are different theories about what happened to Piyiti. Some people think he is still living in the desert. Warlimpirrnga, in an interview in 2004, claimed to have seen Piyiti in Alice Springs, and said he now calls himself ""Yari Yari""."
"The others stayed at Kiwirrkura for many years. In 1998, Papalya died from kidney failure. She was probably almost 70 when she died, and was buried in Kiwirrkura. Nanu died in March 2001, also close to 70 years old. Because of a major flood at Kiwirrkura at the time, she was buried in Kintore."
"The six remaining members became painters of the Papunya Tula school. The three brothers—Warlimpirrnga, Tamayinya (now known as Thomas) and Walala—now live mostly in Alice Springs. Their paintings have often sold for several thousands of dollars. Warlimpirrnga, particularly, is one of the most well-known artists of the Western Desert style. He has paintings in several national art galleries across the country. He and Yalti have three children. Except for Thomas, they are all married with children. Takariya separated from Freddy West and remarried. Yalti, Yukultji and Takariya still live in Kiwirrkurra. All six of them still speak only Pintupi."
The family became the last group of people living a traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle in Australia. They were the last Aboriginal people to make contact with modern civilisation.
Walala Tjapaltjarri
Walala Tjapaltjarri (born Walala Tjapangati) is an Australian Aboriginal artist. He is one of the most well-known artists of the Western Desert style.
Early life.
"Walala was born in the late 1960s or early 1970s. He was born at Marua, near Lake Mackay. He grew up living a nomadic, traditional way of life in the desert. His family had never come into contact with modern, Euro-Australian society. He had never seen a white person, and his family always thought the aeroplanes they saw flying overhead were ghosts or spirits. Before Walala was born, his father Lanti had lived for a short time at the mission in Balgo. But he had run away after getting into trouble for stealing food. It was his decision to stay in the desert, and kept his family far away from the towns. Walala's mother was named Watjunka, and he was Watjunka's only child. He also had two other mothers, Papunya and Nanu, who were his father's secondary wives (and his mother's sisters). His father and Watjunka both died when he was young. The family finally came into contact with outsiders in October 1984, and were settled at Kiwirrkurra. He and his family became known as the last Aborigines living a traditional nomadic way of life in Australia."
"He is now married with two children, and lives between Kiwirrkura, Alice Springs, and Yuendumu, where his wife is from. He paints at Hoppy's Camp, outside Alice Springs."
Painting.
"Walala began painting in December 1987, a few years after settling at Kiwirrkurra. He was introduced to painting by his cousin Warlimpirrnga. He taught Walala about using paints and canvas. Walala joined the Papunya Tula artists, and he, Thomas and Warlimpirrnga eventually gained fame internationally as the Tjapaltjarri Brothers. Although he normally paints using ""Tjapaltjarri"" as a surname, Walala's skin name is ""Tjapangati""."
"His paintings depict scenes from the Tingari cycle (sacred and secret songs about the ancestors of the Pintupi). He uses only four colours at most, sticking to earthy, ochre colours to reflect the desert landscape. The places he depicts in his paintings are part of his traditional country, including Marruwa, Mintarnpi, Wanapatangu, Mina Mina, Naami, Yarrawangu and Wilkinkarra (Lake Mackay). These were places where the ancestors stopped for ceremonies when travelling across the country."
"Walala uses acrylic paintings on canvas. His early work was in the flowing ""dot"" style of painting typical of the Papunya Tula artists. His style became different during the late 1990s, and began to paint rigid rectangles, replacing dotted lines with thick, solid lines."
"His first exhibition was in 1997, for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in Darwin. Most of his work is shown in exhibitions alongside the works of other Aboriginal artists. He has paintings in permanent collections in Australia, Europe and the United States. Walala paints the most out of the three Tjapaltjarri brothers. When painting regularly, he earns up to AU$2000 a day. His paintings often sell for many thousands of dollars."
Thomas Tjapaltjarri
"Thomas Tjapaltjarri (born Tamayinya Tjapangati, also often known as Tamlik) is an Australian Aboriginal artist. He and his brothers Warlimpirrnga and Walala have become well-known as the Tjapaltjarri Brothers. Thomas and his family became known as the last group of Aborigines to come into contact with modern, European society. They came out of the desert in 1984, and became known as ""the last nomads""."
Early life.
"Thomas was born in the desert of Western Australia sometime in the 1960s. He and his family lived a traditional nomadic way of life on the western side of Lake Mackay. They had never come into contact with European society. Most other Pintupi families had been settled in remote towns to the east and west of their traditional country during the 1950s. Thomas' father, Lanti (or ""Joshua""), had lived for a short time at the mission in Balgo, but he had run away after getting into trouble for stealing food. It was his decision to stay in the desert, and kept his family far away from the towns."
"Thomas' mother was named Nanu. He also had two other mothers, Papunya and Watjunka, who were his father's secondary wives. He had two younger sisters, Yalti and Yukultji, a younger half-brother Walala, and four other ""siblings"" (cousins by blood relation). His father died sometime around 1980. The family finally came into contact with outsiders in October 1984, and were settled at Kiwirrkurra. The event was big news at the time, and the family became famously known as ""the last nomads"". Thomas was diagnosed with epilepsy shortly after this."
Painting.
"Thomas began painting in December 1987, a few years after settling at Kiwirrkurra. His cousin Warlimpirrnga had already made a name for himself as an artist and he encouraged Thomas to paint too. Thomas and Walala joined the Papunya Tula artists, and they and Warlimpirrnga eventually gained fame internationally as the Tjapaltjarri Brothers. Although he normally paints using ""Tjapaltjarri"" as a surname, Thomas' skin name is ""Tjapangati""."
"His paintings depict stories from the Pintupi dreaming. They are mostly about places and events in the Tingari cycle (a cycle of myths about the ancestors of the Pintupi). His designs are inspired by those painted on the body during ceremonies. He uses acrylic paints on canvas, sticking to earthy colours (black, white and ochres). He paints simple shapes with dotted lines, which is a style that his brothers also use."
"He has had paintings shown in many exhibitions around Australia, and also in Switzerland, Germany, France and the United States. His larger paintings sell for at least AU$6000 in Alice Springs and AU$9500 in galleries in Melbourne and Sydney."
"Thumbelina lives alone as best she can in the fields. When winter comes, she needs to find a place to live. She is finally given a home by an old field mouse. Thumbelina thanks the mouse by taking care of her little house."
"The mouse thinks Thumbelina should marry her neighbor, a smart and well-to-do mole. Thumbelina finds the idea of being married to such a creature hateful. After all, he spends all of his days underground and never sees the sun or sky."
"The field mouse does not listen to Thumbelina's protests. She continues to urge the marriage. At the last minute, Thumbelina flies away with a swallow to a far, sunny land. Thumbelina brought the swallow back to health during the winter. They have been friends ever since."
"The swallow carries Thumbelina to a sunny land. In a field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just her size and to her liking. They wed. Her husband gives her a pair of wings so she can fly with him on his travels from flower to flower. She is given a new name, Maia."
"In the last page of the story, the swallow has flown to a poet's window, and tells him the complete story of Thumbelina."
"""Note:"" Mary Howitt was the first to translate the story into English. She disliked the encounter with the witch. In her translation, she starts the tale with a beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once the barleycorn is planted, tiny Thumbelina (Tommelise) emerges from its flower."
Background.
"Hans Christian Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark on 2 April 1805. His father was Hans Andersen, a shoemaker. His mother was Anne Marie Andersdatter, a laundress. Andersen was an only and a spoiled child. He shared a love of books with his father. His father read him ""The Arabian Nights"" and the fables of Jean de la Fontaine. Together, they built panoramas, pop-up pictures, and toy theatres. Father and son took long walks into the countryside."
"Andersen's father died in 1816. From then on, Andersen was on his own. Andersen was a tall, thin boy who was bullied by other boys. He wanted to escape them, and his poor, illiterate mother. He advertised his artistic talents to the middle class of Odense. He sang and danced in their homes. On 4 September 1819, the fourteen-year-old Andersen left Odense for Copenhagen with gifts of money he had received from his neighbors. He carried a letter of reference to the ballerina Madame Schall, and had dreams of becoming a poet, a ballet dancer, or an actor."
"After three years in Copenhagen without someone to support him, Andersen finally found an interested gentleman in Jonas Collin, the director of the Royal Theatre. Collin believed in the boy's talents. He managed to have the king send Andersen to a grammar school in Slagelse, a country town in west Zealand. He thought Andersen would continue his education at Copenhagen University at the right time."
"At Slagelse, Andersen was taught by the short, fat, balding thirty-five-year-old Simon Meisling. This man was interested in Ancient Greece and Rome, and had translated Virgil's ""Aeneid"". Andersen was not the brightest student in his class, and Meisling gave Andersen his sharp disapproval. ""You're a stupid boy who will never make it,"" Meisling told him. Meisling is believed to be the model for the learned mole in ""Thumbelina""."
"Fairy tale and folklore researchers Iona and Peter Opie believe that ""Thumbelina"" is a ""distant tribute"" to Andersen's friend, Henriette Wulff, the small, delicate, handicapped daughter of the Danish translator of Shakespeare. She loved Andersen as Thumbelina loves the swallow; however, there is no written evidence to support the ""distant tribute"" theory."
Sources.
"“Thumbelina” is completely Andersen’s invention. He knew other tales of little people such as the old English fairy tale of ""Tom Thumb"" and Jonathan Swift’s ""Gulliver's Travels"" with its tiny, six-inch Lilliputians. He may have found inspiration in these tales for ""Thumbelina"". He knew Voltaire‘s short story, “Micromégas“ (with its cast of huge and tiny peoples), and E. T. A. Hoffmann’s hallucinatory, erotic tale ""Meister Floh"". In Hoffmann's tale, a tiny lady torments the hero. A tiny girl also appears in Andersen‘s prose fantasy, ""A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager"" (1828). Another image from literature similar to Andersen’s tiny being inside a flower is found in E. T. A. Hoffmann’s ""Princess Brambilla” (1821)."
First printing and critical reception.
"Andersen printed two booklets of ""Fairy Tales Told for Children"" in 1835. The first booklet was printed in May, and the second in December. ""Thumbelina"" was first printed in the December booklet by C. A. Reitzel on 16 December 1835 in Copenhagen. ""Thumbelina"" was the first tale in the booklet. The booklet included two other tales: ""The Naughty Boy"" and ""The Traveling Companion"". ""Thumbelina"" was printed again in collections of Andersen's works in 1850 and 1862."
"The second booklet of ""Fairy Tales Told for Children"" featured ""The Tinderbox"", ""Great Claus and Little Claus"", ""The Princess and the Pea"", and ""Little Ida's Flowers"". The third booklet, printed in 1837, included ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Emperor's New Clothes""."
"The first reviews of the seven tales of 1835 did not appear until 1836. The Danish critics did not like them. They thought the informal, chatty style of the tales and their lack of morals were not appropriate for children’s stories. One critic however thought that ""Thumbelina"" was “the most delightful fairy tale you could wish for.”"
"The critics did not believe Andersen should write other fairy tales. One journal never mentioned the first seven tales at all. Another advised Andersen not to waste his time writing fairy tales. One critic stated that Andersen ""lacked the usual form of that kind of poetry [...] and would not study models"". Andersen felt he was working against their ideas of what a fairy tale should be. He returned to writing novels, believing that this was his true calling. The critical reaction to the 1835 tales was so rough that Andersen waited a year before printing ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". These two tales appeared in the third and final booklet of ""Fairy Tales Told for Children"" in 1837."
English translations.
"Mary Howitt was the first to translate ""Tommelise"" into English. She printed it in 1846 as ""Thumbelina"" in ""Wonderful Stories for Children"". However, she did not approve of the opening scene with the witch. Instead, she had the childless woman provide bread and milk to a hungry beggar woman. The childless woman was then rewarded with a barleycorn."
"Charles Boner also translated the tale in 1846 as ""Little Ellie"". Madame de Chatelain called the tiny child 'Little Totty' in her 1852 translation. The editor of ""The Child's Own Book"" (1853) called the child throughout, 'Little Maja'. H. W. Dulcken's widely printed volumes of Andersen's tales appeared in 1864 and 1866. Mrs. H. B. Paulli translated the name as 'Little Tiny' in the late-nineteenth century."
"In the twentieth century, Erik Christian Haugaard translated the name as 'Inchelina' in 1974. Jeffrey and Diane Crone Frank translated the name as 'Thumbelisa' in 2005. Modern English translations of ""Thumbelina"" are found in the six-volume complete edition of Andersen's tales from the 1940s by Jean Hersholt. Erik Christian Haugaard’s translation of the complete tales was published in 1974."
Commentaries.
"Fairy tale and folklore researchers Iona and Peter Opie have written that ""Thumbelina"" is an adventure story from the female point of view. They believe the story teaches the reader that people are happiest with their own kind. Thumbelina is a passive character and the victim of circumstances, they point out. Her male counterpart Tom Thumb (one of the tale’s inspirations) is an active character. He makes himself felt, and exerts himself."
"Folklorist Maria Tatar sees “Thumbelina” as a runaway bride story. She notes that it has been viewed as an allegory about arranged marriages. She points out that ""Thumbelina"" is a fable about being true to one’s heart. ""Thumbelina"" upholds the notion that the love of a prince is to be valued above all else."
"Tatar points out that in Hindu belief, a thumb-sized being known as the innermost self or soul dwells in the heart of all beings, human or animal. This concept may have absorbed by European folklore, then taken form as Tom Thumb and Thumbelina. Both characters seek transfiguration and redemption. She sees parallels between Andersen’s tale and the Greek myth of Demeter and her daughter, Persephone. Despite the pagan references in the tale, she notes that ""Thumbelina"" refers to Christ‘s suffering and resurrection, and the Christian concept of salvation."
"Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager writes that “Thumbelina” was the first of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings and hardships of one who is different. As a result of being different, Thumbelina becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to use the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul. Andersen identified with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble."
"Roger Sale believes Andersen's feelings of social and sexual inferiority were expressed in the tale by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds. The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina’s inferiors. They should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply ""different"". He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority."
"Jacqueline Banerjee views the tale as a story about failure. “Not surprisingly,“ she writes, “”Thumbelina“ is now often read as a story of specifically female empowerment.“ Susie Stephens believes Thumbelina herself is a grotesque. She observes that “the grotesque in children’s literature is [...] a necessary and beneficial component that enhances the psychological welfare of the young reader“. Children are attracted to the cathartic qualities of the grotesque, she suggests."
"Sidney Rosenblatt in his essay, ""Thumbelina and the Development of Female Sexuality"" believes the tale may be analyzed from the perspective of Freudian psychosexual development. He believes the story is one of female masturbation. Thumbelina herself, he posits, could symbolize the clitoris, her rose petal coverlet the labia, the white butterfly ""the budding genitals"", and the mole and the prince the anal and vaginal openings respectively."
Adaptations.
Sierra Entertainment
Sierra Entertainment was an American video game developer/publisher founded in the late 1970s by Ken and Roberta Williams.
Games.
"The company is known for making the graphic adventure game genre, including the first game, Mystery House. It is also known for its adventure game series King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Gabriel Knight, Leisure Suit Larry, and Quest for Glory, as well as being the original publishers of Half-Life."
Affiliation.
"After 17 years as a lone company, Sierra was bought by CUC International in February 1996 to become part of CUC Software. However, CUC International was caught in an scandal in 1998. Therefore many of the original founders of Sierra including the Williamses left the company. Sierra remained as part of CUC Software as it was sold and renamed several times over the next few years; Sierra was dissolved as a company and reformed as a division of this group in 2004. The former CUC Software group was acquired by Vivendi and branded as Vivendi Games in 2006. The Sierra division continued to operate through Vivendi Games' merger with Activision to form Activision Blizzard in 2008. However, it was shut down later. The Sierra brand was revived by Activision in 2014 to re-release former Sierra games and some independently developed games."
History.
Founding (1979 - 1982).
"Sierra Entertainment was founded in 1979 as On-Line Systems in Simi Valley, California, by Ken and Roberta Williams. Ken, a programmer for IBM, had planned to use the company to create business software for the TRS-80 and Apple II. Ken had brought a teletype terminal home one day in 1979, and while looking through the host system's catalog of programs, discovered the text adventure ""Colossal Cave Adventure"". He encouraged Roberta to join him in playing it, and she was thrilled by the game; after Ken had brought an Apple II to their home, she played through other text adventures such as those by Scott Adams and Softape to study them. Dissatisfied with the text-only format, she realized that the graphics display capability of the Apple II could improve the adventure gaming experience. With Ken's help in some of the programming, Roberta designed ""Mystery House"", inspired by the novel ""And Then There Were None"" and the board game ""Clue"", using text commands and printout combined with graphics depicting the current setting."
"On-Line Systems leased their first office space from Ponderosa Printing, a modest space in the back of a small town print shop."
Mystery House.
"""Mystery House"" was released in 1980. It was a great success with 15,000 copies sold, earning 167,000 American dollars (equivalent to 525,539 American dollars in 2020). It is the first computer adventure game to have graphics, although made with crude, static, monochrome line drawings. The two decided to shift the company's focus to developing more graphical adventure games. ""Mystery House"" became the first of their ""Hi-Res Adventure"" series. The ""Hi-Res Adventure"" series continued with ""Mission Asteroid"", which was released as ""Hi-Res Adventure #0"" though being the second release. The next release, ""Wizard and the Princess"", also known as ""Adventure in Serenia"", is considered a prelude to the later ""King's Quest"" series in both story and concept. Through 1981 and 1982, more games were released in the series including ""Cranston Manor"", ""Ulysses and the Golden Fleece"", ""Time Zone"", and ""The Dark Crystal"". A simplified version of ""The Dark Crystal"", intended for a younger audience, was written by Al Lowe and released as ""Gelfling Adventure""."
Rebranding (1982 - 1988).
"On-Line Systems was renamed Sierra On-Line in 1982, and they moved to Oakhurst, California. The ""Sierra"" name was taken from the Sierra Nevada mountain range that Oakhurst was near, and its new logo had the image of a mountain reflecting that. By early 1984 ""InfoWorld"" estimated that Sierra was the world's 12th-largest microcomputer-software company, with $12.5 million in 1983 sales."
"The company weathered the video game crash of 1983 by seeing only a 20% increase in sales, after analysts in 1982 had predicted a doubling in 1983 of the entire software market. The company had spent much of 1983 developing for a Commodore machine and the TI-99/4A which were both obsolete by the end of the year. Ken Williams was reportedly described as ""bewildered by the pace at which computers come into and fall out of favor"", and Williams said, ""I've learned my lesson. I'm not moving until I understand the market better."""
"Many of Sierra's most well known series began in the 1980s. In 1983, Sierra On-Line was contacted by IBM to create a game for the new PCjr. IBM offered to fund the entire development and marketing of the game, paying royalties. Ken and Roberta Williams accepted and started on the project. Roberta Williams created a story featuring classic fairy-tale elements. Her game concept includes animated color graphics, a pseudo 3D-perspective where the main character is visible on the screen, a more competent text parser that understands advanced commands from the player, and music playing in the background through the PCjr sound hardware. For the game, a complete development system called Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) was developed. In mid-1984, ""King's Quest: Quest for the Crown"" was released to much acclaim, beginning the ""King's Quest"" series."
Sierra On-Line expanded into a larger headquarters in the early-1980s.
"While working to finish ""The Black Cauldron"", programmers Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy began to plan for an adventure game of their own. After a simple demonstration to Ken Williams, he allowed them to start working on the full game, which was named ""Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter"". The game was released in October 1986 as an instant success, spawning many sequels in the ""Space Quest"" series in the following years."
"Al Lowe, who had been working at Sierra On-Line for many years, was asked by Ken Williams to write a modern version of Chuck Benton's ""Softporn Adventure"" from 1981, the only pure text adventure that the company had ever released. ""Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards"" was a great hit and won the Software Publishers Association's Best Adventure Game award of 1987. It can be deduced that the game first became famous as an early example of software piracy, as Sierra sold many more hintbooks than actual copies of the game. A series of ""Leisure Suit Larry"" games followed."
"Ken Williams befriended a retired highway patrol officer named Jim Walls and asked him to produce an adventure series based on a police theme. Walls proceeded to create ""Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel"", which was released in 1987. Several sequels followed, and the series was touted for adherence to police protocol (relevant parts of which were explained in the games' manuals), and presenting some real-life situations encountered by Walls during his career as an officer."
"""Quest for Glory"" is a series of hybrid adventure/role-playing video games designed by Corey and Lori Ann Cole. The first game in the series, ""Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero"", was released in 1989. The series combines humor, puzzle elements, themes and characters borrowed from various legends, puns, and memorable characters, creating a five-part series of the Sierra stable. Although the series was originally titled ""Hero's Quest"", Sierra failed to trademark the name. Milton Bradley successfully trademarked an electronic version of their unrelated joint Games Workshop board game, ""HeroQuest,"" which forced Sierra to change the series' title to ""Quest for Glory"". This decision caused all future games in the series (as well as newer releases of ""Hero's Quest I"") to switch over to the new name."
"In 1987, Sierra On-Line started to publish its own gaming magazine, about its upcoming games and interviews with the developers. The magazine was initially named ""The Sierra Newsletter"", ""The Sierra News Magazine"", and ""The Sierra/Dynamix Newsmagazine"". However, since Sierra Club already published a magazine called ""Sierra Magazine"", the name of the magazine published by Sierra On-Line was changed to ""InterAction"" in 1991. It was discontinued in 1999."
"Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter engine, introduced with ""King's Quest"", was replaced in 1988 with Sierra's Creative Interpreter in ""King's Quest IV"". The game was released under both engines, so those who had newer computers could use the new engine and better rendering technology."
Sunkist (soft drink)

Thomas Letsch
Thomas Letsch (born 26 August 1968) is a German football manager. He is the manager of Eredivisie club Vitesse Arnhem.
Managerial career.
Early career.
"we've got one that gives you like a penny a can,"
"so if you,"
Really?
Yeah
For smashed cans?
"Well, actually, you have to give, put them in there unsmashed."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, when you do that it, it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot."
"Oh, can you, can you hold on for just a minute?"
Sure.
"I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because, okay, just succeed"
Okay.
Okay?
"Oh, okay,"
"well, I guess, I guess,"
"Well, I heard it that, I heard it that time"
Yeah
"Okay,"
"well, anyways, you guys only get a penny a can."
"Well, when you buy like, uh, canned drinks and stuff like that, do they charge you for the deposit?"
"Uh, no,"
you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that.
Yeah.
Exactly
"and so it's like they charge you for the deposit,"
"so when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, like, reimbursed."
"Oh, okay."
Type of thing.
"Okay,"
"no,"
they don't charge us that extra nickel.
"That's sort of nice, though"
"and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them, you know."
Huh.
"That's not a, that's not a good solution either."
Not at all.
"I'm not real sure what the,"
What do you think about capital punishment?
"Well, I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes."
Yeah.
Which crimes do you feel that?
"Well, I think first degree murder, uh, probably warrants it."
Yeah.
"Because of,"
so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent
Right.
"selling, I think should also."
Exactly.
Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever.
Yeah
"I come from a state that has, well I originally come from the state that has, uh, the death penalty."
I come from Florida.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, they're pretty liberal on it."
"They tend to, like, fry people left and right.  which,"
Yeah
"that's,"
go ahead.
Go ahead.
Texas is too.
"Texas, I saw on T V the other night, is the, has had forty-six in like the past several years."
Yeah.
"So they're pretty hip on it too, I guess."
"They do it by lethal injection, at Huntsville."
"He was pretty good,"
"but as far as influencing young people, I think that that is, uh, that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age."
You can't play football at fifty-five.
Right.
"But it is a good healthy, wholesome lifestyle, uh,"
anything can be warped.
Yeah.
"But I think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to, to move into maturity safely."
Uh-huh.
Something to stay active at for a long time.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"That's right,"
that's right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"And a lot of seniors, a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're, you know, in their later years."
"Yeah,"
and they can still get good at it.
"That's right,"
that's absolutely right.
"And it's something that,"
"Well, maybe that's what I'll do when I have time later on,"
"Yeah,"
"when you're too old to do anything else go play golf,"
Yeah
yeah
"But it's, it's also something that husband and wife can participate in"
Uh-huh.
"or, you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles."
True.
"You know, you can go to the country club together."
"the monotonous the monotonous,"
yeah.
no
"that's not,"
"I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about, well, I'm better than you, and blah, blah, blah."
Uh-huh.
I don't like that.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"I like the funny, satire,"
"and then some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in urban society."
Yeah.
It really does.
"It talks about, um, race relations and police relations"
"and, um, that, that"
I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I'm, with you though,"
I like classical
Uh-huh.
"um, I don't like to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the time, anyway."
"I like easy listening, just kind of, you know,"
I guess I don't care much for rock and roll any more.
"I used to like it all right,"
but I don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason.
"Um, let's see."
"Country western, uh, I'm not quite as big on that."
"Some of it's okay, uh"
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's about my opinion of that"
yeah
"It's, it's okay, um,"
we got that.
Okay.
Pretax insurance?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But we call it the cafeteria plan,"
I wonder why.
Um?
"I said, I wonder why."
"Oh, it's probably what the first guy who did it, called it."
Cafeteria?
Yeah.
He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it
Maybe
so. Let's see what else can we do?
"Changes,"
I'll tell you what we could do.
What?
"We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money. You know, do a little bit better research on who gets hired"
Uh-huh.
"Because you know,"
"You mean, like for health insurance?"
"Well, not only just health insurance, I mean for the whole benefit of the company."
"See, I look at it this way. If the company folds, I got to go find a job."
Yeah.
Okay.
"Now, if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs, just about anybody in the company, and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job, then we should find a place to put them or you know, boot them out."
"Well, that's easier done in a company than it is in, uh, school teaching."
"Well, frankly, I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid."
Thank you
What?
"I said, thank you."
Yeah.
Yeah
"I know a lot of companies that waste so much that,"
"I'm even trying,"
you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building And they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster
Yes.
"and I thought, I don't understand this, you know."
Yeah.
"We're trying to cut cost and everything like that, and, and recycle and all that stuff"
"and, and here we are wasting."
"And I don't understand, sometimes, the way, the thinking, the logic behind it."
"Well the last time, uh, someone moved offices in my building"
"and, uh, the, uh, properties people came in with all, with the good cardboard boxes."
"Not the cheap ones of course. And packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around,"
Uh-huh.
"I, I took several home because I'm moving pretty soon"
and they're good boxes.
That's exactly what I did.
And they were just going to throw them away.
"Exactly what I did, exactly."
Yeah.
Because I didn't want to waste that.
Huh-uh.
And it's hard enough to find good packing boxes .
Right
"and, and these boxes are,"
you can unfold them.
Right.
"So, you know, there, they don't take up much storage space."
"Exactly right,"
well that's very good
"Yeah,"
I was just thinking
"I wonder, I wonder how, how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where I am in Minneapolis."
"I really,"
"From what I understand, it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana."
"And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the,"
"what is it,"
it's based on common law
and the rest of the country is not or something like that.
Yeah.
Pretty strange.
"But, uh, fortunately I never have had to go in even, even for jury duty."
"Yeah,"
"I haven't either other than,"
"But, uh, that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in for, uh, as a witness."
He may subpoena me.
So we'll see what happens.
"But, uh,"
I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better. .
Yeah.
"It's,"
"there are too many big problems, you know."
"There's, there's such a backlog of court cases right now. You know, to try to get them all in in a good time"
I know.
and we already have too many lawyers as it is.
Yeah.
"And if it's criminal cases we, you can't put them in jail because there's no room left."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"And, in fact, they're even letting some go."
Yeah.
"I, I, I'm originally from Florida"
I do miss that.
Around here in Plano there are very few trees
"and it's pretty flat and, and kind of barren"
"and that's the only thing that we don't like about living in Texas, is we miss all the beautiful trees and the Fall"
"and, and, um, uh, the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is, you know, in the north. Um, or even where you are."
"Uh, we definitely have a lot of trees here."
"A lot of leaves to rake up too, I bet."
Yes
but fortunately the home owner's association does all that.
"Does that,"
"well, see, that's another plus."
"Yes,"
I don't have to worry about that
"and this is the time of year we're starting to lose,"
they're all falling now.
"That's right,"
"that's right,"
they are.
I'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done.
"We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but, not, not much. Just, just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks"
"and if you didn't do anything about it, then they'd probably the leaves just blow away"
Right.
It's not too bad.
"Okay,"
do we have to speak for a certain amount of time?
"No,"
I don't think so.
Okay.
Okay.
It was really nice speaking to you.
It was good to speak with you too.
"Okay,"
"so. Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?"
"I think they have, uh, one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves."
Yeah.
"And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, uh, CODA Plan."
Uh-huh.
"It's certainly a, a supplemental way, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"and I suppose if, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan."
Right.
But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.
Uh-huh.
"So it's not, uh,"
"all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation."
"It's not going to build up, quite enough,"
yeah.
"So, I have to find a way to supplement that."
Yeah.
"Well, they just, they seem to make it so easy to save."
"You know, one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world,"
"but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds, just coming straight out of my check."
"And it's probably not a great investment,"
"but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know."
"I kind of have to trade off, you know."
"If you never see it you don't spend it,"
"so And it's,"
"I understand though,"
"it,"
Yeah.
"Uh, believe me, I do that myself."
Do you?
Yeah?
And I disagree with you.
Yeah.
"Well, course it, it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and your willingness, one, to, to work during the summer or, or part time. And two, uh, to, to take out loans to assume, uh, debt after college."
That's right.
"There's,"
"The, the responsibility of that."
"And, uh, uh, uh, they could, they could work and earn money towards college."
"Also if they stay within their state, you get a lot more financial aid"
"or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school, uh,"
Yes.
"and, like I said, if they was willing to work, uh, in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third"
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is.
"By the time, I have an eleven year old is my oldest,"
"so, it's not too far away,"
"but it's,"
Mine is twelve.
"Oh, okay."
"But it's getting there,"
"I mean, we still have, definitely can put away the money for college now."
"Uh, I would advise that, that they did not have a car at college."
"They would,"
"That's my gut feeling, too."
"I,"
my son is certainly not persuaded of that
Hello?
"Yes,"
I'm here.
"Oh, yeah, uh,"
"yes,"
I didn't have a car in college.
"I think it's more an a burden to, to provide for."
No.
"I think so, too."
"He, he'll come home though, and he'll shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds,"
"and he'll tell me what a great day he had, and about this great shot he made and everything ."
"Uh-huh,"
"well I shot in the hundreds,"
but I made this one good one
"Yeah,"
"this one, on this one hole"
"Did you have to listen to long stories about, now on the seventeenth hole I hit it and went this way"
Uh-huh.
"those are, it's hard for me to, act nice about that when it goes on and on,"
"Well, one thing that is a, is a drawback about it, I think, is the cost."
Yes.
"Membership in the clubs is expensive,"
"the equipment is very expensive,"
"requires special shoes,"
"requires special, you know, special equipment."
"There's so many,"
"Right,"
"and then they want to play another course that's not, they're not a member of"
That's right.
and other fees.
"That's right,"
that's right.
It really is high.
"It can get very expensive,"
"and I can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro, because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
And they don't give those sessions away.
"And nor do they give, uh, instructions away."
Right.
As a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if I thought I'd be interested in golf.
Right.
Yeah.
"And I suspect it, in cases like,"
"I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though, rather than civil."
Is that right?
"Well, I, I, we're at liberty to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Well, uh, in the case of, civil, uh, things, I think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage"
"and I think that may be where jury use is overdone,"
"I mean there are cases where they could be settled,  maybe  out of court a little more efficiently."
Right.
"But the lawyers are really, uh,"
it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible
"so. Uh, I was wondering too, if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in, in a criminal cases."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that."
But I am in favor of it for criminal cases
so there's a difference of my view there for those two.
Right.
Right.
"Yeah,"
well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that
Have you ever had to serve jury duty?
well I was called once when I was nineteen
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me"
"and, I was doing school and things like"
"they, they let me out."
Uh-huh.
I've never had to it since
"actually they, they fold, so when you get in tight situations, you can fold them back."
"Yeah,"
But they're
"well, see that's the reason we couldn't make, really make them,"
"at first we were going to get a pick up truck, with a camper on the back of it, of it,"
uh-huh.
"but then that gas mileage was just atrocious,"
"I mean it's, unreal,"
Uh-huh.
"it's, it just practically don't get any."
"Well, they have got, some of the newer ones they, you know, with the aerodynamic features,"
"you can get pretty, pretty decent gas mileage."
Yeah.
"And then, uh, he talked about a van,"
"and I said, well, you know, I don't know, I don't know how the gas is on most of these."
And another thing was
"that's the reason I said you know, there was such a big difference you know, in a little economy car,"
but I said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
But really and truly the safety features
"but I wouldn't get one that,"
"if it had, the seat belts on the door now I wouldn't get it."
Yeah.
Period.
"Ford now announced I think in ninety-two, they're going to put, uh, air bags in their, in their vans."
Oh that would be good.
"So, uh, and I think, I, I believe safety,"
"I, I, I, I really do believe in this stuff, uh,"
"and I, I think it can go, ,"
"I'm not,"
"and there was discussion for a while about, uh, building a garbage burning, uh, electric generation plant"
Uh-huh.
"but it just wasn't cost effective, at the time."
Oh.
"And there's, there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city"
"but there isn't any, uh, advertising campaign."
There's just not any push to recycle.
Huh.
"I recycle my newspapers and, uh, my aluminum stuff."
"Right,"
that's what I do.
"But, uh, they make it as hard as possible,"
it's not very convenient to do.
"Right,"
when they put centers and stuff like that.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well we have those, uh, which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans."
I don't know if you all have those things around.
Yes.
"And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center,"
and you can just stop by.
"Now everything else like the uh, paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers"
"but, but for aluminum that's real nice"
Uh-huh.
and I started doing that at work.
"Um, I put out a, a trash can and, and for people to put their aluminum cans in,"
Uh-huh.
"and that's really helped a lot,"
"I mean, everybody's pitched in"
"and, you know, it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can."
Yeah.
"so I bought one that's more like living in a,"
"once you're inside, you don't know you're in a town home."
"Oh, that sounds lovely."
It is.
They're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side
Uh-huh.
so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you.
Uh-huh.
"So in, in your area then there's probably a lot of, um, career type people that have those type homes"
and
"Yes,"
definitely.
"uh-huh,"
"and, um, the area that we're settled in is, um, definitely young, young families with, with kids."
"They're still doing, um, a lot of building in the neighborhood."
"So the people that move here seem to move from all over the country, which we're from, um, the northeast,"
"and, um, seems like a people just don't, or also don't have any family around."
"So it, um, also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors,"
"and you know, um But, um ,"
"Well, we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who don't want the heat of Florida but don't want the heat of the, the cold of the northeast"
Uh-huh.
so they settle sort of in-between.
"Right,"
right.
Uh-huh.
"Now it's, um, is it very wooded around where you are,"
"there lots of pretty trees and,"
Yes
Yeah.
"as a matter of fact this is a, uh, this particular community that I live in is very wooded."
"Oh, how pretty."
It is nice.
the air bags are a good deal
"but, uh, surprisingly, uh, they're, uh,"
"you really need to do,"
"you need a combination of both the air bags and the, uh, and the seat belts"
"Oh I think so too,"
"so,"
I don't think they should do away with the seat belts now.
Yeah.
I'm
but I think you need the shoulder thing
Yeah.
"I think you need the thing around your waist,"
"but, I think you need that bag to pop out too."
Yeah.
"You know, because I know so many people, here that have been killed in head on collisions, where maybe if they had, had that, that air bag, they may still be walking around."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But, uh, I think it's fantastic."
I wish they required it in everything.
"Every new car that came out, I wish they would require it in it."
"It would be that would do to our insurance rates, you know, if, if, uh, if the insurance companies says it, says we're not going to pay, you know, a claim, if, if the car doesn't have, uh, air bags."
Would be interesting wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"Uh, that wouldn't be fair"
"but, uh,"
"Well, no because what they would do is, that's what they're going to plan on, you know,"
"they would have to do it,"
the insurance company would have to do the same thing.
"They're given like, a ten year time limit where,"
Yeah.
okay.
"These cars, I guess they figure all the old cars, will be off the roads or something by the, in ten years"
Exactly.
"And, then her little brother's only two years behind"
Exactly.
"and he says, well, I don't know,"
I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.
"And I said, that's great."
Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.
"That's right,"
That's right
"Well, you know, T I, you know, T I offers some good stuff"
"and then I think there's, I mean I think there's some negatives,"
"but there's going to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go."
"I have, you know, all,"
this is the first really large company I've worked for. I've
"always been involved in little small, you know, privately owned owned firms"
"and so I've never had the, the big benefit package."
"So, I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies, you know."
"It, when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what, what they offered."
"So, I've been real pleased."
"Well, that's fantastic,"
Yeah.
"and on whole I would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors."
Think so?
"Uh, I can see some, some potential changes that probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. Such as offering a, a smorgasbord. Having a larger variety of benefits"
Uh-huh.
"but, but here's the amount, that, that T I is going to pay for it,"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
and you can pick what you want
"and, yeah."
now it's up to you
"it's menu selection, so, to speak."
I do desktop publishing at work
and I have a machine at home
and I belong to the user's group
"and I, I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out."
Yeah?
All right.
"But, uh, technically, I'm not actually in the industry."
I don't work a computer company.
No?
I'm an abuser.
"Well, that's, that's all right."
"But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know, keep up with the changes as they happen."
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"Something that I find uncomfortable is, you know, you, you want to buy something, say you want to buy a personal computer"
"and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for, you know,"
"let, let's take the example, the modem for, you know,"
Yeah.
"Okay,"
what baud rate do you get?
"Well, you know, it used to be that you get a twelve hundred"
"So, um, how do you feel about the crime in your city?"
"Is it, uh,"
"Well, um, Minneapolis isn't too bad."
"Uh, I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, that's kind of gone up in scale and, and some other things."
"Uh, I personally had a little experience the other day."
"Uh, somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck."
"Oh, really."
"But, actually, you know, when you look at, at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live, it's really quite a bit better. Uh, because I came from Florida"
Uh-huh.
"and, well, my little girl goes to tap dance,"
and my little one goes to preschool
"and, um, I'm home with the children, just do a lot of running around."
"It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type, I don't know, life."
"Um, what about you?"
"I'm, I'm single,"
"and I, I live in a town home here in Raleigh,"
Uh-huh.
and it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area
Uh-huh.
Okay.
"we, we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes,"
Uh-huh.
"and at the time that I bought this one it was just a, a much better arrangement for me personally."
I'm not home a lot.
"I travel a great deal with my job,"
Uh-huh.
and so it was easier to have a home that didn't exactly that somebody else looks out for the maintenance.
Was sort of maintenance free.
Yeah.
"Oh yeah,"
"well, um, that, that sounds, that sounds pretty good for"
"I know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends, not so much now, but to, um, maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds,"
"and it's a lot of work, owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it."
It's
It certainly is.
"sometimes I think, um, it would be nice to have a town home, with not having all that responsibility."
"Well, if you ever get one, be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear."
"I, that's the main thing when I was shopping for one,"
"I wanted to make sure I could, I couldn't hear my neighbors"
and that was
Right.
"And the only other avenue that I can think of is, uh, looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying, well, we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money."
"As for, for instance, I think you probably remember the military getting caught, um, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars."
Yep.
Right.
"And it was just,"
"I mean you can go to K-Mart and buy them for, uh, eight dollars or I think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats,"
Yeah.
"so. So it gives you idea that,"
Yeah.
Definitely
I think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.
"Sure,"
sure.
"So,"
"I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I think that, that maybe more widespread than well, than we'd like to have think."
Than we think.
Sure.
Sure.
"But, but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure."
Uh-huh.
It sure is.
"The, you know, as far as,"
I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days
"and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing"
"but, uh, you know, they're getting paid for this,"
and it was something more than just the conferences.
"They were using it as eating out, uh,"
"when you think about people, uh, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress."
Uh-huh.
"Well,"
"and, yeah,"
"and, and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person"
"and, you know, I see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the next, you know, about who gets it and who doesn't get it, you know."
"But that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there."
"It seems like, it depends on what, what group you happen to be in, what, what you're going to get and what you're not going to get"
"so,"
"Well, that's for sure."
"Which is the same,"
"but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,"
"that's,"
"Oh, I'm sure personalities always come into play."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, just in this size of organization,"
Our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive.
Where do you live?
I live in San Antonio.
San Antonio!
Uh-huh.
"Well, uh, I live in Garland"
"and we're just beginning to,"
"we, we just built a real big recycling center, that recycles everything imaginable"
Uh-huh.
"but, as far as, uh, trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing, they're testing that."
Uh-huh.
"So, they're really not full, full force into it,"
"but they're trying,"
"so we're attempting it,"
but I wish we could do more.
"Yeah,"
"there's, there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio."
I used to work for the power company here
"he's, he's making straight A"
"and, you know, it just, it, it was there, it was just, I guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time."
"Yeah,"
"it, uh,"
"right,"
"survival becomes more of a priority than, than education,"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"and unfortunately, you know, there's, uh, there's and old joke about, uh, you know,"
education's wasted on the youth anyway.
"You don't, you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway."
"Right,"
exactly.
"I know when I went to school, uh, my attitude was kind of one of, you know, these people are, you know, taking a tremendous amount of my time, you know,"
Uh-huh.
and I've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again.
exactly.
"I guess today that would be, uh, some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing,"
but.
Um.
"The, uh, the cure, some of the cures that I've heard for this that, that sort of make sense,"
Uh-huh.
"uh, most teachers after they have taught for a very long, especially at the, the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, it's kind of these intervention programs."
"Now, a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism"
"and that's communism,"
Right.
"and that's, you know,"
and then it gets political.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, boy."
Yeah.
"and I don't have that in my current operation,"
"but, uh, you mentioned, uh, flexible work schedule"
"and that's, that's good."
Yeah.
"And, uh, what other benefits do you think are important?"
"Oh, well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
that's true.
"I just prefer to worry about today,"
probably not a practical attitude
but that's who I am
"so,"
"Well, and that's an individual thing."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"with, uh, with our current, uh, organization, we do have a nice retirement package"
"and also a, a nice thing that, that we have in our corporation is a, uh, is a profit sharing plan where we can, uh, participate in the, the profits of the company. If we're, you know, if we've been there a while and we're vested, uh, which means that, you know, we have a, an interest, uh, in the company that we can, uh, get some of the benefits of the, either the profit high times or, or in a sense, suffer during the low times"
Right.
"and, uh, also, uh, in one of my wife's, uh, companies where she worked, they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that, that,"
"Okay, uh,"
"some of the T V shows I like to watch are, uh, mostly evening, evening shows"
"and, uh, like for instance the one I'm looking forward to, to tonight is TWENTY TWENTY."
I usually watch those prime time programs.
Right.
"Uh, I like to watch FORTY-EIGHT HOURS."
"Never miss that and, uh, sometimes PRIME TIME LIVE."
"Uh, and then the week goes by"
and I don't think I ever watch anything else.
"You know, the, the Sunday night movies, I watch those kind of things. But, uh, most, but basically a lot of documentary things and, you know, what's going on and that kind of thing."
"I I have a few, you know, favorite shows that I try not to miss."
Fantastic experience.
"I've got two, as I said, I've at U T now in Austin, and one at home,"
and I always say that I've learned so much more from them than I ever taught them.
Yeah.
It's a fantastic experience.
"Oh, we're really excited about it."
Oh yeah.
"You know, one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems, he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing, like on a Saturday morning, if they've been out at a party Friday night."
Yeah.
"If you're not too sure what's going on, he tells parents all the time, haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked."
"The key thing that I think, that we try to do, is that bring all the friends over here."
"Have our house as a place where they can come at any time, so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome"
Right.
and they're always over in someone else's house.
"So our, we've been lucky that our house is usually the place where the kids could come, you know."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
I think that's a really good thing to encourage.
"And then you can keep an eye, you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want."
"But at least you see what's going on,"
"and you always have your house welcome, then your children think that, you know, you're cool parents and all that."
Right
Well good luck with your expected baby there.
"Oh well, thanks."
"My wife was yelling, was talking in my ear,"
"she said, reminded me to say that they're very cheap until they get to start driving."
Uh-huh.
"And we have one, of course, I say, in college driving. And one going to drive this summer,"
"so kids are, cost you practically nothing, because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything."
"But you wait until they go and get a car, insurance, that's when they get expensive."
"As they get older you know, they cost practically nothing from one to five,"
Yeah.

= = = Walsh convention = = =
Walsh is a convention used in the card game of bridge in response to an opening bid of 1. The convention has its origins in the Walsh System developed by Richard Walsh.
"In general, the Walsh convention is not used in four-card major systems such as Acol, but may be employed in some five-card major systems; especially those that use a prepared club, rather than better minor. The opening bid of 1 will therefore have shown either clubs or a balanced hand."
"When responder is too weak to force to game diamond suits are bypassed in favour of major suits, regardless of the length of the diamond suit. For example, holding , the response to the opening bid of 1 would be 1 rather than the normal 1."
"Continuations vary according to other details of the system being played. If Checkback Stayman is being played, then the auction 1 – 1; 1NT – 2 would show this hand and end the auction. If New minor forcing is being used, then 3 is used as the sign off bid instead."
"When the values to force to game are held, the procedure is abandoned, and suits are bid in the normal order. Responders reverse from diamonds into a major thus becomes game forcing. So, holding , the auction starts 1 – 1; 1NT – 2."
"The main purpose of the convention is to avoid missing major suit fits when opener has something akin to a weak notrump, and would rebid 1NT over the normal 1 response. The major suit fit is likely to provide a safer resting place when the hands are weak, as well as potentially scoring better (a concern perhaps only at matchpoints)."
It is a form of Canapé and thus the responses of 1 and 1 to a 1 opener are alertable in the UK under EBU regulations.

"The principal industry is tourism, based around its golden sandy beach, and a variety of bars and restaurants. Spanish, Irish , German and British visitors are catered for, and the resort has a relaxed atmosphere in contrast to the lively resort of Magaluf on the west coast of the island. Sa Coma is more family oriented, and evening entertainment centres on hotels, rather than in bars or clubs."
"Some of the shops in Sa Coma also cater for tourists, with many products in the supermarkets being imported from tourists' home countries. In addition to the duty-free and sport shops, there are 'Perfumerías' (perfume shops) and a Carrefour hypermarket within Sa Coma town (previously owned by Eroski)."
Sa Coma has some of the best hotels and Bars and Pubs. The beach is also very good with fine-grained sand and shallow water.
Sa Coma caters for touring Rugby Union teams (15 a side) throughout the year.

= = = Convoy OB 293 = = =
OB 293 was a North Atlantic convoy which ran during the battle of the Atlantic in World War II.
"It was notable for seeing the loss to the Kriegsmarine (KM) of , with her commander KL Günther Prien, the person responsible for the sinking of two years previously."
"OB 293 was a west-bound convoy of 37 ships, either in ballast or carrying trade goods, and sailed from Liverpool on 2 March 1941 bound for ports in North America."
"It was escorted by an escort group of two destroyers, and , and two corvettes, and . They were led by LtCdr Rowlands of ""Wolverine"", which would stay with them till they left the Western Approaches. (At this stage of the campaign escort groups were too scarce to provide ""end-to-end"" cover)."
On 6 March 1941 the convoy was sighted by commanded by Prien.
"After sending a sighting report he set to shadowing the convoy, being joined throughout the day by three other boats. They were (Kretschmer), (Matz) and (Eckermann)."
On the night of the 6/7 March the pack launched its attack.
"In the early hours of 7 March ""U-99"" slipped into the convoy from ahead, to attack on the surface; she torpedoed the tanker ""Athelbeach"", sinking her, and the whale factory ship ""Terje Viken"", which was damaged."
"""U-70"" hit a freighter ""Dunaff Head"", which sank, and a Dutch tanker, ""Mijdrecht""."
"She was only damaged, however, rounding on"" U-70"" and attempting to ram; ""U-70"" was forced to crash-dive to escape."
"""UA"" hit a freighter but did not sink her."
The response of the escorts was swift and effective. The U-boats were subjected to a fierce bombardment as the warships chased down contacts; over 100 depth charges were expended over a 5-hour period.
"""UA"" was damaged but was able to escape;"
"""U-99"" only escaped by diving deep and waiting out the attack."
"""U-70"" was damaged in the onslaught and forced to the surface, where she was fired on and sunk by the corvettes ""Camellia"" and ""Arbutus""."
"""U-47"" avoided damage and was able to stay in contact with the convoy, sending further reports and requesting re-inforcements. He had also been able to torpedo ""Terje Viken"", which was straggling after being damaged, though she still remained afloat. The escorts attempted to bring her to port, but she finally sank on the 14th; her loss was credited to both ""U-99"" and ""U-47""."
"Meanwhile, on the night of 7th/8th, at about 1am on the 8th, ""Wolverine"" sighted a U-boat on the surface which she identified as ""U-47"". She and "" Verity"" attacked, and after 4 hours, which had shown evidence of damage, the U-boat was driven to the surface within yards of ""Wolverine"", before diving again. The destroyer sent down a pattern of depth charges and was rewarded with an underwater explosion, marked by an orange glow, and flames that broke the surface."
"""Wolverine"" was credited with destroying ""U-47"", and this featured in the official record until the late 1990s. However, after reviewing the available records modern historians regard this attack as being directed against ""UA"", which was badly damaged, but survived to reach port."
"No conclusion can be reached about the fate of ""U-47"", and it is thought likely to be the result of a diving accident."
"The success of the defence of OB 293, with the loss of the U-boat ace Prien, coupled with the successful defence of Convoy HX-112, and the loss of two more aces, Kretschmer and Schepke, one week later, marks a minor turning point in the Atlantic campaign."

"As a divisional point, Biscotasing did not last much beyond the era of construction, as Chapleau, about midway between Sudbury and Lake Superior, was selected to replace it. Soon after, the town lost its importance as a railroad town but still existed as a quiet fur trading town. The railway provided an inland access point to waterways flowing south to Lake Huron and north to James Bay, and the town subsequently developed as a centre for Indian trade in the region."
"The local water routes also helped to develop Biscotasing as a major centre for lumbering. In 1884, Public Lands Surveyor James Allan noted that timber in the area had been overrun by fires and was of very little value, consisting mostly of scrubby spruce and small pitch pine. The same year a sawmill was in operation at Biscotasing, mostly to serve the requirements of CPR construction."
"The first permanent sawmill was established by Sadler and O'Neil in the early 1890s. Robert Booth and Patrick Shannon, were also actively logging this region from 1895. Booth and Shannon produced square timber, which was taken by CPR to Papineauville for export to Britain, from the Port of Quebec in Quebec. By 1903 Booth and Shannon were the only lumber producers in Biscotasing, possibly having taken over and expanding the O'Neil mill which closed in 1898."
"The original Booth and Shannon mill was destroyed by fire 1913-06-13. It was subsequently rebuilt, at which time Robert Booth left the partnership, with Patrick's son, the firm was reorganized as P. & G. Shannon. In 1923 the mill was sold to Midland lumbermen Pratt and Shanacy. The mill closed in 1927 for lack of timber. The mill was dismantled and removed by 1938."
"Many of the old buildings in Biscotasing that survive today are from the sawmill era. A small steam locomotive, once used to switch cars of lumber from the mill to the lumber piling grounds, sat for many years, derelict on the mill property, across the tracks, opposite the Pratt and Shanacy company store. In 1958, David L. Pratt, of Toronto donated his father's steam engine for display at the Algonquin Provincial Park Logging Museum."
"From railway construction camp, to fur trade depot and lumbering centre, in 1922 Biscotasing became the first place in Northern Ontario to use aircraft (Curtiss NC) for forest fire surveillance."

"In number theory, a provable prime is an integer that has been calculated to be prime using a primality-proving algorithm. Contrast with probable prime, which is likely (but not certain) to be prime, based on the output of a probabilistic primality test. In principle, every prime number can be proved to be prime in polynomial time by using the AKS primality test. In practice, other methods which guarantee that their result is prime, but which do not work for all primes, are useful for the random generation of provable primes."

"Frio and Kyaro, two teenagers, love the Tales legends and read about them every day before they go to sleep. After an earthquake, Dr. Brown finds an ancient time traveling machine in the ruins. Using this, they can go see the Tales legends. They go to sleep and prepare for tomorrow."
"Before Frio went to sleep, he read a Tales legend again. But this one ended strangely: the hero arrives too late and the world is destroyed."
"When Frio and Kyaro wake up, they find out the machine has been stolen. Not long after they find out, a re-color of the machine appears. The one boarding it was Dr. White, Dr. Brown from 100 days into the future whose hair had turned white from extreme stress."

"Tales of the World: Narikiri Dungeon 3 is a turn-based tactical RPG as well as a real-time RPG. Battles take place in enclosed areas that include ally parties and enemy units. Players move parties (consisting of three characters each) by selecting the sprite of the party's player-controlled character, and selecting the target location on the map. The limit of where the party can travel is indicated by dots between the target destination and the starting point of the party. When the dots are gray, the party can move to that location, as long as an obstacle does not block him/her. If it is red, then the target is out of range. The player can alter the destination of the party at any time during the player's turn. When the player ends the turn, all ally parties will move simultaneously. When one of the players' parties comes in contact with an enemy party, the player engages in a LMBS-style battle. In a typical RPG fashion, players level up their party members to gain stat increases. Like many Tales games, Narikiri Dungeon 3 includes the aspect of cooking: players can use acquired ingredients to prepare meals that affect party members, like replenishing HP, or temporarily gaining a certain stat in battle."

"""Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress"" (also titled ""Long Cool Woman"" or ""Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress)"") is a song written by Allan Clarke, Roger Cook, and Roger Greenaway and performed by the British rock group The Hollies. Originally appearing on the album ""Distant Light"", it was released as a single on 17 April 1972 (on Parlophone in the United Kingdom), selling 1.5 million copies in the United States and two million worldwide. It reached No. 2 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 in September 1972. ""Billboard"" ranked it as the No. 24 song for 1972."
"On the day ""Long Cool Woman"" was recorded at AIR Studios, the group's producer, Ron Richards, was ill and, as a result, the song was produced by the group. The song is different from most other Hollies songs in that there are no three-part vocal harmonies, and the song features lead guitar and lead vocal work by Allan Clarke. Upon his return, Ron Richards mixed the recording."
"The song was written in the swamp rock style of Creedence Clearwater Revival, in terms of the vocal, rhythm, and melodic style. It came out in the spring of 1972 (the same year Creedence split up). Clarke imitated John Fogerty's vocal style, which was based on the Creedence song ""Green River"". According to Clarke, the song was written ""in about five minutes""."
"In the Hollies' native United Kingdom, the song was only a modest success for the band, peaking at number 32 on the charts. However, it was a smash hit in the United States, peaking at number 2 for two weeks behind Gilbert O'Sullivan’s ""Alone Again (Naturally)"". It was their highest charting single in that country. It also topped the charts in South Africa and peaked at number 2 in New Zealand and Australia. By this time, Clarke had already left the band, but he feels that ""it wasn't unfortunate"", since he had co-written the song. Clarke rejoined the Hollies in the summer of 1973, partly due to the success of this song."
"Soyarabai was a saint from the Mahar caste in 14th century Maharashtra, India. She was a disciple of her husband, Chokhamela."
"Soyarabai framed large literature using blank verse of her own devising. She wrote much but only about 62 works are known. In her Abhang she refers to herself as Chokhamela's Mahari, accuses god for forgetting Dalits and of making life bad. Her most basic verses concern the simple food she gives the god. Her poems describe her devotion towards god and voice her objections to untouchability."
"Soyarabai believed that ""The body only can be impure or polluted, but the soul is ever clean, pure knowledge. The body is born unclean and so how can anybody claim to be pure in body? The body has much pollution. But the pollution of the body remains in the body. The soul is untouched by it."""
Soyarabai undertook an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur with her husband. They were harassed by orthodox Brahmins but never lost their faith and peace of mind.
= = = Atmospheric optics ray-tracing codes = = =
Atmospheric optics ray tracing codes - this article list codes for light scattering using ray-tracing technique to study atmospheric optics phenomena such as rainbows and halos. Such particles can be large raindrops or hexagonal ice crystals. Such codes are one of many approaches to calculations of light scattering by particles.
"Ray tracing techniques can be applied to study light scattering by spherical and non-spherical particles under the condition that the size of a particle is much larger than the wavelength of light. The light can be considered as collection of separate rays with width of rays much larger than the wavelength but smaller than a particle. Rays hitting the particle undergoes reflection, refraction and diffraction. These rays exit in various directions with different amplitudes and phases. Such ray tracing techniques are used to describe optical phenomena such as rainbow of halo on hexagonal ice crystals for large particles."
Review of several mathematical techniques is provided in series of publications.
The 46° halo was first explained as being caused by refractions through ice crystals in 1679 by the French physicist Edmé Mariotte (1620–1684) in terms of light refraction
Jacobowitz in 1971 was the first to apply the ray-tracing technique to hexagonal ice crystal. Wendling et al. (1979) extended Jacobowitz's work from hexagonal ice particle with infinite length to finite length and combined Monte Carlo technique to the ray-tracing simulations.
"The compilation contains information about the electromagnetic scattering by hexagonal ice crystals, large raindrops, and relevant links and applications."

The album features guest appearances from Daz Dillinger, Spice 1, Jay Rock, G-Wiz, Hit “Skrewface”, Big Kill, Lil Sodi, Problem, Y.B., D-Edge, G.I. Fleezy and BJ the Chicago Kid."
"On March 23, 2013, the first song from the album titled ""The Color Purple"" was released. In an April 2013, interview with HipHopDX, Freddie Gibbs spoke about when the album would be released, saying: ""I’m ‘bout to drop that ""ESGN"" album probably in June for the summer time, just to hold niggas over before we drop that ""Cocaine Piñata"" with Madlib. ""ESGN"" is gonna be me, G-Wiz, D-Edge, Hit Screwface, G.I. Fleezy and Big Kill. We putting that shit together right now. It’s gonna be kind of on that Jay-Z Dynasty: [Roc La Familia] type shit. I got a lot of records that I like. We’re gonna fuse that thing together and make that shit work to show what we’re working with collectively. Basically, this album gave me a chance to breathe and breathe fire on mothafuckas I’ve been wanting to breathe fire on. So it’s really giving me a little outlet right now. Once I whack niggas on this mothafuckin’ album then I’m gonna fall back on they ass and just chill for the summertime, get my dick sucked and drink drinks with umbrellas and shit in them, nigga. Just like Tony Soprano said, niggas is getting wacked. Niggas is getting’ clipped. This album is strictly for niggas that’s getting they nuts clipped."" On May 14, 2013, Freddie Gibbs announced that his debut album ""ESGN"" would be released in July. On May 27, 2013, he announced on his Twitter account that the album would be released on July 9, 2013. On June 11, 2013, the first single from the album ""One Eighty Seven"" featuring Problem was released. On June 13, 2013, the second song from the album ""Freddie Soprano"" was released. On June 17, 2013, the music video was released for ""Eastside Moonwalker"". The album was later released three weeks before its original July 9, release date on June 20, 2013. On July 1, 2013, the music video was released for ""Lay It Down"". On July 15, 2013, the music video was released for ""Have U Seen Her"" featuring Hit Screwface. On August 26, 2013, the music video was released for ""The Real G Money"". On January 8, 2014, the music video was released for ""One Eighty Seven"" featuring Problem."
"In June 2013, during an interview with ""XXL"", Freddie Gibbs previewed the album. He spoke about “Eastside Moonwalker”, saying: ""That’s one of the dopest tracks. Shout out to GMF. He produced that. It’s showing people that I’m the staple of the game when it comes to Gary [Indiana]. Michael Jackson is dead, so I gotta pick up the torch and run with it for my city. Actually, I am the only person grabbing it. I am just doing what I got to do. I’m the eastside moonwalker. I stay high, baby.” He also spoke about “Freddie Soprano”, saying: ""That’s the definitive verse from the album. Basically, telling y’all what it is. How I feel about what’s what."" He spoke about “F.A.M.E.” which features Daz Dillinger and Spice 1, saying: ""[The acronym stands for] ‘Fuck All My Enemies.’ You know who I am talking about. If you an enemy—fuck you. I grew up listening to Daz and Spice-1. If it wasn’t for guys like that, I wouldn’t be rapping. Any project I do, I try to pay homage to guys that I respect. Last project I fucked with Jadakiss. He's one of the guys that when I came up, I came up listening to. He's still an athlete in this game. He's still one of the best in it. He don’t get his credit. I always try to pay homage to the guys that were instrumental in my career with me coming up. That's why I linked up with Daz and Spice-1. [This is a diss] track to anybody who want it. If the shoe fits, wear it. I’m talking shit about all of you niggas. If the shoe fits, wear it. If you pick up the shoe and you put it on. You want to take to Twitter and you want to get on your track and say something about Freddie Gibbs, make sure you got your hardhat on."" He spoke about “Lay It Down” which is produced by Willie B, saying: ""Shout out to Willie B. He fuck with Jay Rock and them. He produced that shit. That’s one of them hard-hitting joints. It’s going straight to the point. Lay it down. That’s a robbing song."" He also spoke about “Have U Seen Her” which features Hit Skrewface, saying: ""This is featuring my boy Screwface. SMKA, they produced that. That’s one of them bangers. It’s hard.”"
"""ESGN"" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, which indicates ""generally favorable reviews"", based on 5 reviews. Anthony Asencio of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying ""Ultimately, ""ESGN"" may not be a cultural event. It doesn’t introduce a new sound, nor does it feature many moments we haven’t heard before. Yet what makes this album important are all the reasons Hip Hop needs Freddie Gibbs. On any one album, he can give you pieces of Tupac, UGK, Three 6 Mafia, and blend them into a harmony that would make Bone Thugs-n-Harmony proud. And on that point, ESGN is a massive success."" Chris Mench of ""XXL"" gave the album an L, saying ""None of this criticism is to say that ""ESGN"" is a bad album. Freddie is a talented rapper with great flow and a wise selection of collaborators, and many songs are individually effective. Rather, it is simply an album that lacks a clear perspective on the many heavy topics it tackles. A first time listener may walk away feeling very familiar with Freddie Gibbs’ sound, but still unsure of who exactly he is."" David Amidon of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying ""For those hip-hop fans forever in pursuit of the latest glass-shattering bass and semi-auto mob rules, ""ESGN"" is likely 2013’s flagship release. This is Gibbs’ deep breath; let's see what direction he takes off running in next."""
"Chris Bosman of Consequence of Sound gave the album four out of five stars, saying ""Gibbs’ EPs and mixtapes tend to run long, and ""ESGN"" – at 19 tracks — is no exception. The length is a weakness. The bleakness of Gibbs’ world, even when it's going well, can leave you gasping. The shock is somewhat lost in the number of tracks. In the scheme of the album, it's a minor quibble. ""ESGN"" digs new paths through rap's hallowed grounds. It may not be the crossover success that those who ride for Gibbs would love to see, but it doesn’t diminish this excellent record."" Jonah Bromwich of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 6.9 out of 10, saying ""On “Hundred Thousand"", Gibbs supplies a perfect—and, true to form, concise—review of ""ESGN"" himself. “Ain’t trying to be the man, just trying to maintain.” Callin an album ""more of the same"" sounds dismissive but its something that fans are often happy to receive and there are those for whom 20 tracks of Gibbs rapping nearly perfectly will be enough. But for everyone else, ""ESGN"" comes as an unwelcome reversion to the mean. It's the sound of a rapper more than happy to maintain his narrow lane after being burned by the industry, one who's lost the ambition to leave his comfort zone, at least for the time being."""

"As of the first half of 2016, Winchester/Olin did manufactured and release for sale some WSSM ammunition. The product is only manufactured periodically, often on inconsistent intervals."
"The 243 WSSM is an addition to the Winchester Super Short Magnum (WSSM) family of cartridges, which also include the .223 WSSM and the .25 WSSM, and the idea behind the 243 WSSM was to develop a compact, higher velocity version of the well-established and internationally popular .243 Winchester unveiled by Winchester in 1955. The 243 WSSM was first introduced in 2003."
"The 243 WSSM's case is unusually short and fat in profile, contrasting markedly with most other rifle cartridges, and is intended to take advantage of what ballisticians have shown is the more uniform and efficient burning of propellant powder when it is held in a short, fat stack by the cartridge case."
"In their ballistics tables, Winchester list a very high muzzle velocity of with a projectile for this cartridge. Based on Hodgdon reloading data typical velocities should range from approximately with a bullet to approximately with a bullet. The percentage gain in performance over the older .243 Winchester is around 10% or less."
"This cartridge is usually used for small game such as varminting, and used for animals as large as deer."
Compared to other factory 6mm sporting cartridges the 243 WSSM is capable of functioning in the AR-15. Other factory produced 6mm cartridges like the 243 Win. and 6mm Rem. are both too long for the AR-15 and require the AR-10 platform.
"The 243 WSSM is 3/8 inch shorter than the 243 Win. giving the 243 WSSM the ability to fit in a super-short action rifle. Thus 243 WSSM rifles can be lighter, have stiffer actions and have faster actions to cycle."
The 243 WSSM gives generally a 10% increase in velocity over the 243 Win.

"In addition, common Fulani were inspired by Adama's exploits and formed into bands. Adama created a new position for their leaders: The ""lamido"" (plural: ""lamibe""), who was the leader of a particular territory, as opposed to an ardo, leader of a particular people. Both groups received flags of command and shared the same status in Adama's armies. Before his death, Adama would appoint over 40 non-ardo lamibe. They would prove his most loyal lieutenants."
"Adama turned his attentions on the only major state in Fumbina that could present a threat to his fledgling emirate: Mandara. It was an attractive target. It lay between Bornu to the north and Baghirmi in the Chad Basin, so its fall would facilitate the conquest of these areas. Its people were already Muslim, though they mixed the religion with pagan practices. Moreover, it had a large population from whom soldiers could be conscripted, and it was renowned for its excellent horses. Mandara was well organised, however, and would not be an easy prize. The people who lived there, the Mandarawa, had a long-standing rivalry with the Fulani, who had fought them under the Bornu in previous years. This animosity only served to drive more Fulani to Adama's armies, though, as many veterans were eager for another crack at an old rival. Furthermore, Fulbe rulers Modibo Damraka and others were already embroiled in fighting against the Mandara in the Diamaré Plain. Sentiment for jihad was high."
"Adama reached Guringa in 1809 with a large army in good morale. He quickly conquered the Mandara settlement at Guider and headed north, taking several more villages along the way. Outside of the Mandara capital, Dulo, Adama demanded that the king, Bukar Djiama, swear his allegiance and convert to Islam untainted with paganism. Bukar agreed to acknowledged Adama's right to rule his own subjects, but he refused to yield his own sovereignty. Adama and his men took Dulo with little fighting."
"Adama searched for someone to rule the settlement, but he found no one whom he felt adequate for the post. Meanwhile, his troops revelled in their plunder. No one expected the Mandara counterattack, which was launched from nearby Mora. Adama fled the town, and Dulo fell from his grasp forever."
"Adama and his men retreated to Yola (in present-day Nigeria). The town would become his capital by 1841. From here, he and his lieutenants continued to expand the emirate, which he named Adamawa after himself. The subordinates had to send him tribute in the form of cattle. Large settlements such as Maroua, Garoua, and Ngaoundéré fell to Adama or his lieutenants. By 1825, the Fulani had penetrated the Adamawa Plateau. Nevertheless, Adama lived in relatively moderate surroundings and never acquired great wealth."
"From Yola, Adama began the administrative tasks necessary for his nascent state. He did this with Usman's advice; he was to foster understanding between his people and their governors, facilitate communication between elders and their subordinates, and prevent the stratification of society based on class or wealth. The empire eventually took on three administrative tiers. At the centre was the ""emir al-Mu'minin"" (""commander of the faithful""), Adama himself, ruling from Yola and answering only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. A contingent of councillors and administrators directly aided him, and a household staff of non-Fulbe and slaves doubled as his bodyguard. Below him were a number of district leaders, the lamibe, who ruled key settlements. Under them were a number of villages, each headed by a village chief."
"Meanwhile, some of the older ardo'en grew powerful through their own conquests. They regarded the unconquered areas near their territories as their own private backyards and defended these zones from all comers. This sometimes surfaced in their relations with Adama, such as when Bouba Njida of Rai refused to come to Adama's aid when the emir was fighting the Namchi at Poli. Instead, Bouba waited for Adama to retreat from the area to bring in his own forces and finish the enemy off. He then sent prisoners from the battle to Adama as a gift."
"Adama died in 1847 and was laid to rest at Yola (his tomb survives to this day). Adamawa covered 103,000 km² from Lake Chad to Banyo and was inhabited by 1,500,000 people. Further expansion to the south had proved difficult and undesirable since the presence of the tsetse fly and thick jungle made cattle rearing difficult there."
"Adama's son Muhammadu Lawal succeeded him after a brief regency under Hamidu bi Adama. Eventually, three of Adama's other sons would at some point serve as Emir of Adamawa. Not until the British and German colonial periods would the emirate come to an end."
"Despite their loss of independence, the Fulani were now the preeminent ethnic group of Northern Cameroon. They spread Islam throughout the region, establishing it as the dominant religion. Education also flourished, as new converts learned Arabic writing and studied the Qur'an. Trade flourished, and communications with it. The conquests were also important ecologically. Lands that had once been used for cultivation now became part of Fulani pastureland. Herdsmen cut down trees to make way for cattle, and they burned grasses that their herds later trampled. Centuries of such behaviour have replaced the region's forest with savanna."
"Ironically, the Adamawa was more sparsely populated after Adama's conquest. Rather than fight the Fulani invaders, many peoples fled, displacing others in turn. The Adamawa Plateau, once home to many of Cameroon's ethnic groups, soon became a pastureland, and the forest zone of Cameroon became more heavily populated."

= = = Maria Taferl = = =
"Maria Taferl is an Austrian market municipality of 872 people in the District of Melk and the most important pilgrimage site in all of Lower Austria. After Mariazell, Maria Taferl is the most important pilgrimage destination in all of Austria."
"Maria Taferl is located in the Nibelungengau in Lower Austria on a bank over the Danube. 47.48 percent of the municipality is forested. As the Maria Taferl Market, which takes place on the so-called ""Taferlberg"" (""Taferl Mountain""), the remaining districts are found in the hilly surrounding area. To the south, the basilica is widely visible throughout the town."
"Little is known about the early settlement of Maria Taferl. The Celtic Kingdom of Noricum was located on the northern shore of the Danube. During Roman times, the Danube served as the border of the Province of Noricum. Even today in the church plaza, there is a stone of Celtic origin, on which heathen sacrifices were made. This attests to Maria Taferl's long tradition as a place of religious activity."
"Maria Taferl and the surrounding countryside belonged to the territory of the Ostarrichi during the time of the Bambergs in the Middle Ages. It then became part of the Habsburg holdings. For a long time, it was part of the land of the Lords of Weißenberg, whose seat lay in the nearby town of Münichreith. It is assumed that the various districts of the town were already established during the Middle Ages. The history of the modern market of Maria Taferl begins in the 17th century."
"The first church was built around a shrine to the Holy Mother, which is the origin of the name ""Maria Taferl."" The legends say that the statue of the Pietà at the shrine was an offering from Alexander Schinagel, a forester, who had a miraculous recovery from a serious illness. It replaced a crucifix there, which had also been the site of a miracle, for when local shepherd Thomas Pachmann tried to chop down the oak on which it was placed, he gravely injured both his legs. After a prayer to the Virgin Mary, his almost fatal wounds stopped bleeding. The old oak was destroyed by fire in 1755, which also damaged the statue."
The church building was built from 1660 to 1710. Its construction was begun under the imperial architect Georg Gerstenbrand and the Italian Carlo Lurago. Its famous cupola was built by Jakob Prandtauer from 1708 to 1710. He also designed the current appearance of Melk Abbey. The Maria Taferl church is built in the baroque style with ample amounts of gold leaf and a frescoed ceiling. In the center of the high altar is the namesake Marian stature. The building's rear houses its crypt.
"According to an inscription in the building's interior, the building of the church gave the local inhabitants new courage after the Plague, the Turkish Wars, and the Thirty Years' War had all taken their toll. It also supported the ideas of the Counter-Reformation in the heartland of the Catholic House of Habsburg. All this speaks to Maria Taferl as an important manifestation of the Catholic faith on the main traveling route of the Danube."
"There are many traditional stories of angelic processions here, which come from the 17th century. The tradition of pilgrimage to Maria Taferl also dates back to that time. In 1760 alone, there were 700 pilgrimage processions and over 19,000 masses said there. The church is also a kind of information treasure chest about its pilgrims, their origins, and their number. Within it are the gifts of the pilgrims, who came on account of illness and were cured. Another reason for Maria Taferl's importance as a pilgrimage destination was the stone cross, a gift from the citizens of Freistadt for pilgrims who died on the journey. It is also evidence of the exhausting nature of pilgrimage in those days. The murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his family lived in the nearby Artstetten Castle and is known to have regularly attended mass at Maria Taferl."
"Maria Taferl became a ""Basilica minor"" in 1947."
"By 2010, the basilica's interior should have undergone a complete restoration. It will then celebrate a double jubilee: 350 years since the laying of its cornerstone in 1660, and 300 years since its completion in 1710. The interior's last restoration was around 50 ago; the exterior was restored in 1982, and in 1998, the domes of the two towers were re-covered."
"Besides the basilica, in Maria Taferl there is also a monument for the Fallen of both World Wars. These men are honored annually at meeting of veteran's groups."
There is a folk belief that the water from the well at Maria Taferl can help with eye complaints.
"Other landmarks in the town are the Elementary School Museum, as well as the mechanical nativity, which tells the story of Maria Taferl's origins."
The municipality of Maria Taferl is divided into seven districts:
The mayor of Maria Taferl is Herbert Gruber and the Chief Officer is Daniela Lahmer. In the Municipal Council the 15 seats went to the following parties: ÖVP 10 and SPÖ 5.
"After agriculture, tourism is the most important economic activity in Maria Taferl."

"Govenlock is an unincorporated community within Rural Municipality of Reno No. 51, Saskatchewan, Canada. Previously held the status of a village with a peak population of 151 residents, until its village status was dissolved on January 1, 1976. The former townsite of Govenlock is located on Highway 21 & Highway 13 also known as the historic Red Coat Trail, about 15 km east of the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. Very little remains of the former village of Govenlock, many cement foundations and wooden sidewalks can still be found scattered around the town site, the only building that still stands as of 2010 is the old community hall and a commemorative plaque in remembrance of Govenlock's rich history."
"Govenlock, like so many other small communities throughout Saskatchewan, has struggled to maintain a sturdy population causing it to become a completely abandoned ""ghost town"" with a population of 0 citizens. Prior to January 1, 1976, Govenlock was incorporated under village status, but was dissolved into an unincorporated community under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Reno on that date."
"In 2006, Govenlock had a population of 0 living in 0 dwellings, a 0% increase from 2001. The community had a land area of and a population density of ."
"In 1910, a Moose Jaw resident by the name of William Govenlock moved to the area with his family after applying for a homestead. They were one of the first pioneer families of Southwest Saskatchewan. In 1913, William negotiated a land deal with the Canadian Pacific Railway, starting a new town later named in his honour. That same year William established a post office for the area, with his wife Bessie as the first postmaster."
"In 1914 a pioneer named John Linder built Govenlock's first Hotel. The hotel stood two stories tall with ten rooms. Three years later a man named James Gaff stopped at the Hotel for a rest; after finding out that no rooms were available James immediately purchased the hotel for $4,500."
"Even though the liquor trade was big business during that time, Govenlock's future looked promising even without the steady stream of liquor. The town boasted its impressive CPR station, section house, a few grain elevators, two general stores, blacksmith shops, a livery barn, two machine agencies, pool room, laundromat, school, meat shop, a service station selling Model T Fords, and a hotel. Most of these businesses were connected by wooden sidewalks, a common feature in the pioneer prairie days."
"After Montana's prohibition declaration in 1919, large groups of Americans from that state frequently crossed the border by train to visit Govenlock to purchase booze."
"Indicating that Govenlock had a promising future, the pioneer town had a chamber of commerce. It was the liquor trade that fuelled Govenlock's prosperity. Four liquor warehouses were established in the centre to serve a booming liquor trade. With liquor trade and the frequent influx of imbibers, gambling and parties became common, attracting not only thirsty folks from across the border, but many bachelors from all parts of Southwestern Saskatchewan who wanted to let loose."
"Over the years a poolroom and two-story dancehall building was built and owned by Henry Buss. During the early days, Govenlock was a place for people of both countries to socialize and relax. As the American booze customers waited for their liquor orders, many would mingle with the people of Govenlock and settle down for a game of pool or a game of high-stakes poker. Revelry and good times were staples in Govenlock during their early days."
"Busy American booze traders were also a staple in Govenlock. To avoid legal problems, bootleggers would have to obtain a tourist pass at Canada border entry points. They would come to the pioneer town in their Fords, Studebakers, Packards, and Hudsons. The empty cars' rears were filled with sand bags until they filled up at the liquor houses. This was done to avoid suspicion when they rode empty of booze, light without a load. Canadian beer cost 12 cents per bottle and was said to be highly prized. Whiskey was more expensive and more lucrative. It was transported in barrels. Each barrel had three burlap sacks, with 24 four-quart bottles - wrapped in straw - in each sack. A barrel wholesaled for $24. When it reached the United States, it sold for $140. A carload of 14 barrels of beer and five cases of whiskey could fetch a profit of $2,500."
"The bootlegging trade was good business for several years and there were few legal hassles for the rumrunners. Mounties and provincial police intervened to ensure that the liquor went through the hands of locals before crossing the United States border. Even a few of the Govenlock residents tried their hand at bootlegging, but they soon found out that more of the liquor was stolen than they sold."
"When 1922 rolled around, so did the end of bootlegging that fueled Govenlock's prosperity. It was then that the Government of Saskatchewan announced it wanted better control of the liquor trade and restricted liquor export houses to cities with 10,000 people or more. This started the slow end of the once promising pioneer town of Govenlock. Over the years and one by one, stores and shops soon closed and residents left. In 1962 the only grain elevator left in Govenlock was toppled and demolished. By 1990, rural municipality officials brought in the bulldozers and demolished all but one of the remaining buildings that stood in Govenlock, including the old Govenlock Hotel."
"The only building left is the community hall, built in 1948. Also a commemorative plaque marks the area where Govenlock was located. It honors Govenlock's wild past and wild spirit of its hell-raising pioneer days."

A possible new utilization for crambe are biofuels since the oil composition is suitable for processing.
"Genetically, ""C. abyssinica"" has a set of 2n=90 chromosomes and is hexaploid. However, it shows low genetic variation in important agronomic traits, e.g. erucic acid content. Thus, improvement of cultivars through selection is difficult to achieve. A new source of variation could be found in the related taxon ""Crambe hispanica"". Recent efforts are found in the field of gene technology. To overcome the limited genetic variation, gene technology has been used in recent years to improve different important agronomic traits of crambe. Site-directed mutagenesis could be another tool for further improvement of the crop. However, the genetic control of many agronomic traits are unknown, thus the potential for genetic improvement is limited at the moment. Additionally further research aims to assess the potential of using the seed cake in protein-based plastic production and to find further uses for the whole plant."

"231st Street is a local station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of West 231st Street and Broadway in the Kingsbridge and Riverdale sections of the Bronx, it is served by the 1 train at all times."
"This station opened on January 27, 1907 as the 230th Street station, but was built near the site of the originally proposed northern terminus of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line at Bailey Avenue and 230th Street, a block southeast of the current station. It was also near two former Kingsbridge railroad stations owned by two separate branches inherited by the New York Central Railroad; one was along a former segment of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad (now the Hudson Line), and the other was for the New York and Putnam Railroad (now abandoned)."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On July 9, 1948, the platform extensions at stations between 207th Street and 238th Street were opened for use at the cost of $423,000."
"In 2002, it was announced that 231st Street would be one of ten subway stations citywide, as well as one of five on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, to receive renovations. The station was extensively renovated in 2003–2004, which included installation of elevators for both platforms to make it fully ADA-accessible and replacing the exit-only turnstiles on the 242nd Street-bound platform with High Entry/Exit and Exit-Only turnstiles ones, allowing both access and exit from that side."
"This elevated station has two side platforms and three tracks. The center track that bypasses this station is not used in revenue service. This is the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line's southernmost station in the Bronx (Marble Hill–225th Street station is physically on the mainland of New York State, but legally part of Manhattan)."

"The Global Change Award, is an innovation challenge created by the H&M foundation. It created a trend report in 2017 to look at the future of sustainable fashion. Five ""megatrends"" are identified by the organisation that will lead the future of sustainable fashion. The first ""megatrend"" is ""Power of Nature"" which is the industry looking into materials that have always been looked at as waste as a more sustainable method to making new clothing. The materials that will mitigate negative impacts from the industry include vegan materials from the earth and recycling old fabric into new clothing. The second ""megatrend"" is ""Rent a Closet""; this initiative has been around for a while. This trend ultimately lowers the new purchase of clothing and disposal of clothing, which means less waste. Rent the Runway is an example of the ""Rent a Closet"" trend. Rent the Runway started as a company that would give luxury brands like Hervé Leger, Vera Wang, Etro to people who may not be able to afford the clothing at regular retail price. Renting and sharing clothing is also known as CFC (collaborative fashion consumption) a sustainable fashion trend consumers are getting involved in. The third trend is ""Long Live Fashion"" is the revival of Vintage clothing. Vintage clothing is a way to lower the amount of clothing that gets disposed of and ends up in landfills. Companies like RE/DONE, Vintage Twin and Frankie Collective sell re-paired vintage clothing. Repairing and reselling clothing has less negative impact than creating new clothing does. The fourth megatrend is ""innovative recycling"" which is looking at waste as value. The industry is starting to create incentives for consumers to participate in the recycling of clothing."
Tailored couture is one option for the future of a greener fashion industry as it can potentially lead to less waste and more jobs improving the economy. Tailored couture is no longer desired because of the convenience of malls and stores provide but the consequence of the convenience is the pollution of the environment. Tailored clothing if it were to become the norm mass production of clothing that will not be bought can be reduced and reusing and redesigning old clothes to fit could reduce the amount of old worn out unfitting clothes thrown out or given away.
"In 2019, the UK Parliament's Environment Audit Committee published a report and recommendations on the future of fashion sustainability, suggesting wide-ranging systemic change, not least government regulation and tax-incentives for sustainable practices, such as lowered VAT for repair services. As highlighted in the report, wide political and social changes are needed to push industry towards more sustainable practices and levels of consumption: brands doing ""less harm"" is not enough. The report finishes with the following statement;""Retailers must take responsibility for the social and environmental cost of clothes. They should use their market power to demand higher environmental and labour standards from suppliers. Offering rental schemes, lifetime repair and providing the consumer with more information about the sourcing and true cost of clothing are all measures that can be more widely adopted. Shifting business practice in this way can not only improve a business’s environmental and social impact but also offer market advantage as they respond to the growing consumer demand for responsible, sustainable clothing.""(p.54)"

In Canada, the song reached #1 on the RPM Magazine charts, August 9, 1965. The song comes from the album ""Down in the Boondocks""."
"The song is sung from the perspective of a self-proclaimed ""boy from down in the boondocks."" He sings of a girl who lives nearby, for whom he feels love and he steals away with occasionally. The people who live or are born in the boondocks are suggested to be a lower class than those in the city. The girl's father is the singer's boss man, which, along with the social division, prevents him from proclaiming his love and connecting with them, despite the shared feelings (which is the basis for the line ""but I don't dare knock on her door/for her daddy is my boss man""). The singer proclaims that ""one fine day, I'll find a way, to move from this old shack,"" presumably to be able to join the higher class members of society and finally be able to date the girl within the public eye."

"King Abdullah Port is estimated to cover 17 square kilometers, it will be the largest in the region with a capacity of over TEU|20 million of containers per year. The first concession was given to National Container Terminal (NCT) and the operator is currently operating on four container berths. The port will have facilities to handle cargo and dry bulk, and will be equipped to receive the world’s largest vessels notably with its state-of-the-art Ship-to-shore cranes able to handle 25 containers across and the deepest draft in the region -18m. The port is the kingdom's first to be owned and funded by the private sector. The port serves as a linking passage between three continents, Asia, Africa and Europe. The port is considered an important part in the transportation network that connects between the contents and delivers goods to around 400 million people in the Middle East."
"In 2018, King Abdullah Port at KAEC had ranked second among the world’s fastest-growing ports."
"The residential area is planned to include 260,000 apartments and 56,000 villas. It will be divided into smaller residential, commercial, and recreational areas. Parks and green spaces will be used extensively throughout the residential area. The area is estimated to be home for around half a million residents, and another ten thousand tourists. Each district would feature its own public amenities, such as mosques, shops and recreational venues."
"The Resorts Area will be designed to feature services and amenities, hoping to draw both local and international tourists. Set to become a major destination on the map of Saudi Arabia and the map of the Middle East as a whole. It will include hotels, shopping centers and other recreational facilities. The number of hotel rooms and suites are proposed to be 25,000 hotel rooms in more than 120 hotels. Among the tourist draws at the resort is an 18-hole golf course, with training facilities and driving range. An equestrian club, yacht club and a range of water sports will also be constructed."
"The Educational Zone is a part of plan to bring the Saudis capabilities and aspirations in technology to globally competitive levels. The Educational Zone is planned to consist of multi-university campus flanked by two Research & Development parks. The multi-university campus is designed to accommodate 18,000 students, and a 7,500 faculty and staff members."
"The central business district (CBD) is planned to offer 3.8 km² of office space, hotels and mixed-use commercial space. The Financial Island, within the CBD, has now been doubled in area to cover 14 hectares (35 ac) of land, which will be the largest regional financial nerve center for the world’s leading banks, investment houses and insurance groups."
"A common Renaissance and Baroque theme is females that are abducted or seduced by divinities. This includes Leda and the swan as Zeus, as well as Europa, Antiope, and Danae. Many portrayals of women being seduced by divinities are shown in a sensual manner. For instance, Rubens's ""Leda"", is very erotic. Leda is shown fully nude with her buttocks and left breast being visible. The swan is caressing her on her most intimate area with its neck cradled between her breasts. The swan is depicted as a graceful animal who also can ravish."
"There are many variations to the myth of Leda and the swan. Leda is sometimes called Nemesis and other times they are two separate people. Leda was married to the king of Sparta, Tyndareus. She is the mother of several children though she is most known for giving birth to Clytemnestra, Helen, Pollux, and Castor. The most common myth claims that Zeus transformed himself into a swan to couple with Leda. Some versions claim that she loved Zeus and willing had sexual relations with him, while other versions claim she was seduced and therefore was not willing. That same night, she coupled with Tyndareus also. Leda then gave birth to four children at the same time. The two pairs of twins resulted in Helen and Pollux belonging to Zeus, and Clytemnestra and Castor belonging to Tyndareus. Though each pair is attributed to either Zeus or Tyndareus, each man is said to be the father of all four children. Castor and Pollux were called the Dioscuri meaning “Zeus’s sons,” even though Castor was mortal because he was the son of Tyndareus and Pollux was immortal because he was the son of Zeus."
"According to Hermes in Lucians’ ""The Dialogues of the Dead"", Leda and her daughter (Helen of Troy) are the only women worthy of the title “beauties of old.” Rubens's depictions of Leda clearly embody the phrase. With Leda's curvy figure, alabaster skin, and golden hair, she is a sight to behold. Because Rubens was known for this type of female figures, Leda was the perfect subject to paint. Rubens became famous partly for his Rubenesque figures and were not common at the time, making his two ""Leda’s"" stand out even more."

= = = Control Center (iOS) = = =
"Control Center (or Control Centre in some countries) is a feature of Apple Inc.'s iOS operating system, introduced as part of iOS 7, released on September 18, 2013. It gives iOS devices direct access to important settings for the device by swiping a finger up from the bottom of the display (or a swipe down from the top right corner on iPhone X, XS and XR series and iPad devices). It is similar to the SBSettings tweak for iOS jailbreaking."
"Control Center gives iOS users quick access to commonly used controls and apps. By swiping up from any screen – including the Lock screen (if the control center is set to be accessed from the lock screen) – users can do such things as switch on Airplane mode, turn Wi-Fi on or off, adjust the display brightness and similar basic functions of the device."
"Since iOS 7, it also included an integrated flashlight function to operate the reverse camera's flash LED as a flashlight. The flashlight feature is only available on iPhone and iPod Touch, and iPad Pro. Beginning with iOS 9.3, a Night Shift toggle became available through the Control Center on all iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad models that have an Apple A7 chip or later."
"Other functions are offered, such as the ability to turn Bluetooth, and Do Not Disturb on or off; lock the screen's orientation; play, pause, or skip a song, see what is playing; connect to AirPlay-enabled devices; and quickly access the clock, calculator, and camera apps. Users also have access to AirDrop, previously only available on Macs and newly added to iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch models using the Lightning connector in iOS 7, as a method of transferring files between Apple devices."
"In iOS 7 through iOS 9, it featured a single-paged slide up panel with a blurred background, which provided a layer of translucency over the content below. The design for the most part remained the same, aside from a few small, occasional changes. Due to the intense resources needed to create a blurred effect, iPhone 4, iPad 2 and iPad 3 do not feature a translucent background, and instead feature a grey background with slight transparency without blur."
"In iOS 10, it morphed into a card-like design with a white background, and separated into three separate cards accessible by swiping horizontally. The first card consisted of main device controls, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Do Not Disturb, while the second page was dedicated to media controls, and the third page for controlling HomeKit enabled devices linked in the Home application."
"The Control Center received a significant redesign in iOS 11, unifying its different pages into one and allowing users to 3D Touch (or long press on devices without 3D Touch) the icons for additional options, and vertical sliders allow users to adjust volume and brightness. The Control Center is customizable via the Settings app, and allows for a wider range of settings features to be shown, including cellular service, Low Power Mode, and a shortcut to the Notes app. These changes are still present in the current stable release of iOS 12."
"iOS 12 brought few new additions to Control Center, but of them, the most notable being updates to Do Not Disturb. Now, when users 3D Touch, or long press the Do Not Disturb icon, it allows them to automatically set when a Do Not Disturb session will end. Current options include setting it to turn off after one hour, when leaving your current location, the next morning, or when a calendar event ends."
"Control Center has received generally positive reviews. In contrast for the user having to access the Settings application to change most preferences, Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch thought that ""separating [Control Center] from that function and making it accessible throughout the iOS user interface via a simple swipe up from bottom is a really big improvement."""
"The iOS 11 update was criticized for changing the way the buttons for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work; more specifically, the toggles would disconnect devices from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, while leaving the radios on. The Electronic Frontier Foundation stated that this change not only hurt battery life, but was also bad for security, describing the buttons as turning Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ""off-ish"" (greyed out, but not crossed out, as it would appear if switched off directly from the Settings app), as well as further criticizing the connections resuming at 5:00 am everyday."

"A member of the Homo mermanus race, Andromeda is the illegitimate daughter of Attuma of Atlantis by a woman named Lady Gelva. He did not know of her existence until she confronted him and told him he was her father. Andromeda was raised in Atlantean society and trained in the arts of hunting and war and she exceeded any other male except for her father in these skills. Despite her skills, she was considered unworthy of promotion in the Atlantean military because she is a woman even though she was highly decorated."
"Andromeda, inspired by Namor's tales, moved to the surface world, where she used a serum to give herself a human appearance and the ability to breathe out of water. She took the name Andrea McPhee and posed as a surface woman. When she was revealed as an Atlantean, she quickly abandoned her charade and became a member of the Defenders, joining them against a villain named Hotspur."
"She was with the Defenders, christened the ""New Defenders,"" for only a short time, revealing only portions of her background to them. With them, she traveled to outer space and battled the second Star-Thief. She fought Manslaughter as he menaced the team, and then aided the Defenders and the Interloper in battle against fellow Defender Moondragon, and the Dragon of the Moon who was possessing Moondragon. Andromeda sacrificed her life force, joining with Manslaughter, the Valkyrie, and the Interloper to drive the Dragon of the Moon from the Earth, and her body was turned to stone."
"The Dragon would later return, this time without a body. To stop the Dragon of the Moon, Doctor Strange cast a spell which returned the souls of the Defenders fallen in the battle against the Dragon to the bodies of several recently deceased humans, changing them into duplicates of the Defenders. Andromeda's soul entered the body of Genevieve Cross and these Defenders now called themselves the Dragon Circle. Together the Dragon Circle banished the Dragon from Earth and Andromeda returned to the oceans."
"Andromeda played an important part in the 1989 ""Atlantis Attacks"" crossover. Andromeda led a rebellion to stop her father Attuma from invading the surface world, but was bested by Attuma in personal combat. She was kidnapped unconscious by the Deviant priest Ghaur as one of his ""Seven Brides of Set."" Under Ghaur's domination, she accompanied She-Hulk to acquire a piece of Set's life force. In the end the Brides of Set gained their freedom thanks to the Fantastic Four and Avengers."
"Andromeda joined her forces with those of Namor. She was part of the short-lived Deep Six, a group of underwater heroes. During this time her mind and that of Genevieve Cross would repeatedly exchange control and even turn her body into a copy of Genevieve's. Andromeda sacrificed her own mind to save Namor's soul, leaving Genevieve in control of Andromeda's body. Months later, either Genevieve in Andromeda's body or a restored Andromeda herself assisted Namor and the Defenders against Attuma's own Deep Six. Andromeda was last seen as an ally of Namor, living in Atlantis."
Andromeda later appears as a member of Namor's Defenders of the Deep.
"Andromeda has all the powers inherent to the ""Homo mermanus"", but her strength and speed are far greater than that of any ordinary ""Homo mermanus"", though not as great as that of her father, Attuma. She is adapted to live underwater, having gills that allow her to breathe underwater, she can swim at high speeds and her body is resistant to the pressure and the cold of the deep oceans. Her specially-developed vision allows her to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean."
"She can survive only for 10 minutes out of water, unless she uses a special serum that gives her the ability to breathe air. Her stamina, agility, and reflexes are reduced when out of the water."
"She has been trained as an Atlantean warrior, and is very skilled in the arts of hunting and war, wielding a trident as her weapon of choice. She carries a short sword and an 8"" dagger as additional weaponry."
Andromeda also has extensive knowledge of biochemistry.
= = = Great Hinckley Fire = = =
"The Great Hinckley Fire was a conflagration in the pine forests of the U.S. state of Minnesota in September 1894, which burned an area of at least (perhaps more than ), including the town of Hinckley. The official death count was 418; the actual number of fatalities was likely higher."
"After a two-month summer drought, combined with very high temperatures, several small fires started in the pine forests of Pine County, Minnesota. The fires' spread apparently was due to the then-common method of lumber harvesting, wherein trees were stripped of their branches in place; these branches littered the ground with flammable debris. Also contributing was a temperature inversion that trapped the gases from the fires. The scattered blazes united into a firestorm. The temperature rose to at least . Barrels of nails melted into one mass, and in the yards of the Eastern Minnesota Railroad, the wheels of the cars fused with the rails. Some residents escaped by climbing into wells, ponds, or the Grindstone River. Others clambered aboard two crowded trains that pulled out of the threatened town minutes ahead of the fire."
"James Root, an engineer on a train heading south from Duluth, rescued nearly 300 people by backing up a train nearly five miles to Skunk Lake, where the passengers escaped the fire. William Best was an engineer on a train sent specifically to evacuate people."
According to the Hinckley Fire Museum:
"Because of the dryness of the summer, fires were common in the woods, along railroad tracks and in logging camps where loggers would set fire to their slash to clean up the area before moving on. Some loggers, of course left their debris behind, giving any fire more fuel on which to grow. Saturday, September 1st, 1894 began as another oppressively hot day with fires surrounding the towns and two major fires that were burning about five miles (8 km) to the south. To add to the problem, the temperature inversion that day added to the heat, smoke and gases being held down by the huge layer of cool air above. The two fires managed to join together to make one large fire with flames that licked through the inversion finding the cool air above. That air came rushing down into the fires to create a vortex or tornado of flames which then began to move quickly and grew larger and larger turning into a fierce firestorm. The fire first destroyed the towns of Mission Creek and Brook Park before coming into the town of Hinckley. When it was over the Firestorm had completely destroyed six towns, and over lay black and smoldering. The firestorm was so devastating that it lasted only four hours but destroyed everything in its path."
"The fire destroyed the town of Hinckley (which at the time had a population of over 1,400) as well as the smaller nearby settlements of Mission Creek, Brook Park, Sandstone, Miller, Partridge and Pokegama."
The exact number of fatalities is difficult to determine. The official coroner's report counted 413 dead while the fire's official monument notes 418. An unknown number of Native Americans and backcountry dwellers were also killed in the fire; bodies continued to be found years later. Along with the 1918 Cloquet Fire (where 453 were killed) it is one of the deadliest in Minnesota history.
"Today, a section of the Willard Munger State Trail, from Hinckley to Barnum, is a memorial to the fire and the devastation it caused. In the town of Hinckley, on Highway 61, the Hinckley Fire Museum is located in the former Northern Pacific Railway depot. It is located a few feet north of the former depot, which burned down in the fire. It is open from May 1 until the end of October."
Lutheran Memorial Cemetery in Hinckley has a historical marker and granite obelisk as a memorial to those who perished in the fire. 248 residents of Hinckley perished in the fire and are buried in a mass grave at this cemetery. Some are unidentified.
"The Brook Park Cemetery on County Road 126, south of Minnesota State Highway 23, has an historical marker plaque and a memorial to the 23 fire victims of Brook Park, with a tall obelisk on top of a granite marker."
"Thomas P. ""Boston"" Corbett, the Union soldier who killed John Wilkes Booth after Booth's assassination of Abraham Lincoln, is presumed to have died in the fire. His last known residence is believed to have been a forest settlement near Hinckley, and a ""Thomas Corbett"" is listed as one of the dead or missing. Thomas P. ""Boston"" Corbett may not have died in the fire. Thomas Gilbert Corbitt lived in the Town of Thurston, in Steuben County, NY. He was a Civil War veteran in the 50th NY Engineers, Co. E. In late September and early October of 1894, Steuben County newspapers reported that Thomas Corbitt, until recently a resident of Thurston, was burned to death, along with his property, in the great fire at Hinckley, Minn."

It is occasionally referred to simply as Baranof. Baranof Warm Springs is located at ."
"Baranof Warm Springs is located on Warm Springs Bay which is just off of Chatham Strait. Just about a half mile up from the settlement is Baranof Lake, a large glacially-fed freshwater lake. Baranof Lake is fed from small unnamed glacial run-off streams as well as the relatively large Baranof River. Between the half mile outlet between Baranof Lake and Warm Springs Bay there are a series of rapids and waterfalls that have proven to be lethal when run."
"Baranof Warm Springs is located on the southern part of a , exposure of a biotite-quartz diorite batholith that crosses northern Baranof Island."
"Baranof Warm Springs is a very small community, having only caretakers in the winter and intermittent visitors in the summer. There are around 15 seasonal homes. The community lies inside the jurisdiction of the City and Borough of Sitka. Other than property taxes and any dock fees from the new dock (2016) there is only one tax-paying commercial enterprise, the Baranof Wilderness Lodge and Resort. The city, in return, funds maintenance of a boardwalk which serves as the main thoroughfare as well as the dock for transient vessels. The community of property owners (BPOA- Baranof Property Owners Association) pools money together to pay for a seasonal (winter) caretaker for seasonally-inhabited residences, the city-owned picnic shelter (possible shelter for those needing it), the public bath house (which features three separate tubs), and the communal warm springs pools. Another caretaker is hired to tend to the Baranof Lodge from October 1 to May 1 when the owners of the Lodge return."
"Baranof Warm Springs was used frequently by the Tlingit of Angoon. People of western descent did not find the springs until 1891. It was serviced by a post office from 1907 through 1912, under the name of Baranoff."
"Baranof Warm Springs appeared on the U.S. Census twice as an unincorporated village. First in 1930 as Baranof with 25 residents and as ""Baronof"" in 1940 with 10 residents. It was later annexed into the City and Borough of Sitka."
"Baranof Warm Springs is accessible via floatplane with regularly scheduled flights leaving Sitka. The trans-island flight is 30 minutes on a clear day and an hour on an overcast one. The Alaska Marine Highway does not service Baranof Warm Springs and there is no scheduled ferry/marine passenger services to the community. Baranof Warm Springs itself does not feature any roads, and the boardwalk does not accommodate ATVs."
The primary attraction is the warm springs. There are a total of nine separate hot springs with temperatures from lukewarm to 120 degrees F. Only one is developed in a natural state and is located right up against the white water of the Baranof River. The community built a public bathhouse at the waterfront to provide an option for visitors not wanting to bathe communally and/or make the 1/4 mile hike up the trail to the natural springs.
"Small tour boats come in frequently in the summer, but also fishermen, and employees of the Hidden Falls Hatchery visit as well. The warm springs is also the terminus (or occasionally the trailhead) of the Baranof Cross-Island Trail. On the northern end of Baranof Lake there is also a Forest Service cabin that is quite popular. The cabin can only be reached by boat or float plane. The terrain is too steep to hike."

"In addition to the original variant, Just Born also markets ""Hot Tamales Fire"" (originally ""Super Hot Hot Tamales"") with a hotter flavor and darker color."
"In 2011, Just Born released ""Hot Tamales 3 ALARM"" containing a mix of three candies: orange (hot), pinkish (hotter) and dark red (hottest). In 2014, Just Born released ""Hot Tamales Tropical Heat"" that contains three candies, combining the original pungent, spicy flavor with lemon, mango and pineapple flavor."
"A spearmint version, Hot Tamales Ice, was marketed in the late 2000s, but was subsequently discontinued. It was reintroduced again in 2018 combined with the regular Hot Tamales and marketed as Hot Tamales Fire & Ice."
As listed on the original Hot Tamales box and Hot Tamales Fire boxes:
"Sugar, corn syrup, modified food starch, contains less than 0.5% of the following ingredients: dextrin, medium chain triglycerides, fruit juice from concentrate (pear, orange, strawberry, cherry, lime, lemon) sodium citrate, pectin, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, confectioners glaze, carnauba wax, white mineral oil, artificial flavors, artificial color, sodium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, red #3, red #40, yellow #5 (tartrazine), yellow #6, blue #1."

"The Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) is a test used by the United States Department of Defense to test an individual's potential for learning a foreign language and thus determining who may pursue training as a military linguist. It consists of 126 multiple-choice questions and the test is scored out of a possible 164 points. The test is composed of five audio sections and one visual section. As of 2009, the test is completely web-based. The test does not attempt to gauge a person's fluency in a given language, but rather to determine their ability to learn a language. The test will give the service member examples of what a selection of words or what a portion of a word means, then asks the test taker to create a specific word from the samples given."
"Preparation for the DLAB includes multiple study guides and practice tests. These resources give one the appropriate means by which to prepare for the test and gauge a possible outcome. However, a study guide for the DLAB is not like traditional studying - you are not learning content that will be on the DLAB, but rather learning the style of the DLAB. Someone failing the test or getting a low score can always retake the DLAB but only after a wait of 6 months. For most service members, this is too long and will cause them to miss the deadline for submitting their scores. Adequate preparation is thus a near-necessity."
The languages are broken into tiers based on their difficulty level for a native English speaker as determined by the Defense Language Institute. The category into which a language is placed also determines the length of its basic course as taught at DLI.
"To qualify to pursue training in a language, one needs a minimum score of 95. The Marines will waive it to 90 for Cat I and Cat II languages and the Navy will waive it to an 85 for Cat I languages, a 90 for Cat II languages, and a 95 for Cat III languages. The Air Force does not currently offer a waiver. The Army National Guard is able to waive a score of 90 into a Cat. IV language."
"The DLAB is typically administered to new and prospective recruits at the United States Military Entrance Processing Command sometime after the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is taken but before a final job category (NEC, MOS, AFSC) is determined. An individual may usually take the DLAB if they score high enough on the ASVAB for linguist training and are interested in doing so. The DLAB is also administered to ROTC cadets while they are still attending college. The DLAB is also used for the Australian Defence Force."
"Furthermore, the DLAB is a required test for officers looking to either join the Foreign Area Officer program or the Olmsted Scholar Program. The required grade for these programs is a 105, but the recommended grade is at least a 130 or above."
"Military personnel interested in retraining into a linguist field typically also must pass the DLAB. In few select cases, the DLAB requirement may be waived if proficiency in a foreign language is already demonstrated via the DLPT."
"While these scores are required to enter a language program of that category, often placement is based upon need rather than score. For example, a service member that receives a score of 115 may be placed in Russian (category III). The maximum score on the DLAB was 176, but has recently been lowered to 164."

"Aribert went to Konstanz in June 1025, with other bishops of Northern Italy, to pay homage to Conrad II of Germany, the beleaguered founder of the Salian dynasty. There, in exchange for privileges, he agreed to crown Conrad with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, which the magnates had offered to Odo of Blois."
"This he did, on 26 March 1026, at Milan, for the traditional seat of Lombard coronations, Pavia, was still in revolt against imperial authority. He journeyed to Rome a year later for the imperial coronation of Conrad by Pope John XIX on 26 March 1027; at a synod at the Lateran he negotiated a decision of the precedence of the archdiocese of Milan over that of Ravenna. He subsequently joined an imperial military expedition into the Kingdom of Arles, which Conrad inherited upon the death in 1032 of Rudolph III of Burgundy, but which was contested by Odo."
"In the political arena of Italy, power was disputed between the great territorial magnates— the ""capitanei""— with their vassal captains and the lesser nobility— the ""valvassores""— allied with the burghers of the Italian communes."
"Aribert created enemies among the lower nobility, against whom he perpetrated the worst violences, and with the metropolitan of Ravenna, whose episcopal rights, along with those of the smaller sees, he ignored. A revolt soon engulfed northern Italy and, at Aribert's request, Conrad's son, the Emperor Henry III, travelled south of the Alps in the winter of 1036/37, to quell it. The Emperor, however, took the position of champion of the ""valvassores"" and demanded that Aribert should make a defence against charges brought against him, but Aribert refused, on the grounds that he was the emperor's equal."
"The Constitution of Illinois is the foundation of the government of Illinois and vests the legislative power of the state in the Illinois General Assembly. The Illinois Constitution in turn is subordinate only to the Constitution of the United States, which is the supreme law of the land."
"Pursuant to the state constitution, the Illinois General Assembly has enacted legislation. These legislative acts are published in the official ""Laws of Illinois"" and are called ""session laws"". The ""Illinois Compiled Statutes"" (ILCS) are the codified statutes of a general and permanent nature."
"The Illinois Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) makes additions, deletions, and changes to ILCS. There is no official version of the ILCS. There are several unofficial versions: Illinois State Bar Association's/West's ""Illinois Compiled Statutes"", West's ""Smith–Hurd Illinois Compiled Statutes Annotated"", and LexisNexis's ""Illinois Compiled Statutes Annotated""."
"Pursuant to certain statutes, state agencies have promulgated regulations. The regulations are codified in the ""Illinois Administrative Code"". The ""Illinois Register"" is the weekly publication containing proposed and adopted rules. There also exist administrative law decisions."
"Both the ""Illinois Administrative Code"" and ""Illinois Register"" are maintained by the Illinois Secretary of State. The ""Illinois Administrative Code"" was last printed in 1996. The General Assembly's Joint Committee on Administrative Rules also publishes online versions."
"The ""Flinn Report"" is a weekly newsletter published by the Joint Committee meant to inform and educate Illinois citizens about current rulemaking activity."
"Illinois's legal system is based on common law, which is interpreted by case law through the decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois and the Illinois Appellate Court. The official reporter for opinions of the Supreme Court and the Appellate Court are published on the website of the Illinois Supreme Court using a public domain case citation. There are also unofficial sources such as West's ""Illinois Decisions"" (an Illinois-specific version of the ""North Eastern Reporter"") with opinions since 1886. Illinois Appellate Court decisions from before 1935 are not binding. Illinois Circuit Court decisions are not published, but jury verdicts and settlements are published in the monthly ""Illinois Jury Verdict Reporter"", with regular updates from the ""Chicago Daily Law Bulletin"", and the weekly ""Cook County Jury Verdict Reporter"".

= = = Egocentric presentism = = =
"Egocentric presentism is a form of solipsism introduced by Caspar Hare in which other persons can be conscious, but their experiences are simply not ."
"Similarly, in related work, Hare argues for a theory of perspectival realism in which other perspectives do exist, but the present perspective has a defining intrinsic property."
"In one example that Hare uses to illustrate his theory (starting on page 354 of the official version of his paper), you learn that you are one of two people, named A and B, who have just been in a train crash; and that A is about to have incredibly painful surgery. You cannot remember your name. Naturally, you hope to be B! The point of the example is that you know everything relevant that there is to know about the objective world; all that is missing is position in it, that is, whose experiences are , A's or B's. This example is easily handled by egocentric presentism because under this theory, the case where the present experiences are A's is fundamentally different from the case where the present experiences are B's. Hare points out that similar examples can be given to support theories like presentism in the philosophy of time."
Several other philosophers have written reviews of Hare's work on this topic. Giovanni Merlo has given a detailed comparison to his own closely related subjectivist theory.
= = = Perspectival realism = = =
"As Hare points out, the same type of argument is often used in the philosophy of time to support theories such as presentism. Of course, we can say that A is happening on [insert today's date]. But, it can be argued, this misses the fact that A is ""simply"" happening (right now), not relative to anything."
Hare's theory of perspectival realism is closely related to his theory of egocentric presentism.
Several other philosophers have written reviews of Hare's work on this topic.
= = = HMS Desperate (1896) = = =
"HMS ""Desperate"" was a two funnel, 30-knot destroyer ordered by the Royal Navy under the 1894 – 1895 Naval Estimates. She was launched in 1896, served in Home waters and the Mediterranean before World War I. She was based in Portsmouth during the war and was sold for breaking in 1920."
She was laid down as yard number 305 on 1 July 1895 at the John I. Thornycroft & Company shipyard at Chiswick on the River Thames. She was launched on 15 February 1896. During her builder's trials her maximum average speed was 30.3 knots. She had her armament fitted in Portsmouth. She was completed and accepted by the Royal Navy in February 1897. During her acceptance trials and work ups her average sea speed was 25 knots.
"In the meantime, Nicky (Fionnula Flanagan), not having any news from Birch, arrives at the McCawley home to find out what happened. Quentin (Justin Rain) reluctantly admits to his father Rafe (Graham Greene) that he killed Birch when Birch broke into their home and attacked him. He does not tell him though that he kept the artifact."
"Nicky, suspecting that Birch is dead, tricks Rafe into revealing that Birch was killed when he broke into their home, but Rafe takes the blame to protect his son. In the meantime, Quentin has another ""vision"" of his brother Luke (Wesley French), who tells him that he should kill Nicky too because she knows everything, but Quentin refuses."
"Meanwhile, Sukar finds all the items he needs and he and Irisa take over the radio station. Nolan gets there right after them thinking that Sukar wants to direct a falling Ark to Defiance. The falling Ark, if it impacts on Defiance, will destroy the city completely and everyone will die. He attempts to stop him by shooting him and throwing him from the Gateway Arch."
"Irisa however, who does not believe that Sukar wanted to destroy Defiance, completes his task and activates the transmission. It is discovered that Sukar only wanted to change the direction of the falling Ark to save Defiance."
"Doctor Yewll (Trenna Keating), while examining Sukar, finds out why Sukar ""rose"" and why he was healing so fast. It was not because of the God Irzu but because of little robots called nanites that were injected into his body by the razor rain object. Now that Defiance is safe, the nanites have gone dormant, and will no longer heal Sukar's injuries. Sukar survived the fall from the Arch, but he is paralyzed and in coma."

"""Goodbye Blue Sky"" received mediocre/positive reviews."
"Rowan Kaiser from ""The A.V. Club"" gave a C grade to the episode saying that despite there were some cool moments and interesting ideas on it, it was not serving a larger purpose. ""“Good Bye Blue Sky” isn't notably worse than several previous episodes of ""Defiance"", but it frustrated me much more than those did. There are some cool moments, some disjointed ones, a lot of interesting ideas, and a famous song covered at the end. I normally enjoy that. But my problem with this episode is that it doesn't serve a larger purpose."""
"Lisa Macklem from ""Spoiler TV"" stated that the episode is particularly well-written. ""I really enjoyed the peeling away of more layers on the show this week. The episode did a good job in illustrating that the tensions don’t just occur between human and Votans – though it’s understandable that those relationships pose the most opportunity for misunderstanding."""
"Jim Garner from ""TV Fanatic"" rated the episode with 3/5. """"Defiance"" this week didn't so much feature a single main story, but instead focused on three arcs. Sadly, this left it feeling like ""Good Bye Blue Sky"" was doing far too much in a short amount of time."""

"SKEPP is an independent Belgian skeptical organization. The organization’s name is a backronym for ""Studiekring voor de Kritische Evaluatie van Pseudowetenschap en het Paranormale"" (""Study Circle for the Critical Evaluation of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal"")."
"SKEPP is a nonprofit organization emanated from the Belgian astronomical society, ""Vereniging voor Sterrenkunde"", and was founded in 1990 by, among others, Prof. Etienne Vermeersch, Prof. Willem Betz, Tim Trachet and Prof. Jean Paul Van Bendegem."
The goals of the organization are:
"SKEPP gets most of its funding from member fees. On the initiative of board member and former editor-in-chief Tom Schoepen, SKEPP has been publishing its own three-monthly magazine since 2000, ""Wonder en is gheen wonder"", a magazine for science and reason, which focuses on both pseudoscientific topics and topics related to the philosophy of science. The editors include Prof. Dr. Johan Braeckman (Ghent University), Dr. Griet Vandermassen (Ghent University), Geerdt Magiels and SKEPP founder Tim Trachet."
"In 2012, SKEPP hosted a series of lectures and discussions, featuring prominent scientists and philosophers, under the name Het Denkgelag, which has since grown out to become an independent non-profit that organises skeptical conferences. In 2015, SKEPP hosted the meant-to-be-yearly event ""Zomerschool Kritisch Denken"" (Summerschool Critical Thinking) aimed at educational professionals. Currently, SKEPP organises the monthly local editions of Skeptics in the Pub in Ghent, Antwerp and Leuven."
"Since 1996 SKEPP gives out annual awards to non-members: the ""Zesde vijs"" (the “Sixth Screw”) and the ""Skeptische Put"" (de “Skeptical Pit”)."
"The ""Zesde Vijs"" is awarded to ""someone who has distinguished themselves in the past year in spreading objective knowledge regarding pseudoscience and the paranormal, or who has made themselves noticed in the media by presenting a nuanced critical view or a thoroughly documented argumentation"". This prize has been awarded to, among others:"
"The ""Skeptische Put"" is awarded to ""someone who, according to SKEPP, has displayed exceptionally uncritical thinking and who has totally misunderstood the popularization of science and knowledge"". The ""Skeptische Put"" has been awarded to, among others:"
"Since its founding, SKEPP has become quite widely known via the Belgian media. They are often called upon to present their critical perspective on paranormal or pseudoscientific topics. In 2004 the organization made headlines when thirty skeptics at Ghent University conducted a “mass suicide” attempt by taking an overdose of homeopathically diluted snake venom, belladonna, and arsenic. The goal of this action was to demonstrate that homeopathic products contain no active ingredients. Additionally, the Belgian health insurance organization were accused of putting themselves above the law as commercial entities by reimbursing alternative treatments. According to SKEPP, by reimbursing alternative treatments, health insurance organizations will give the impression to the Belgian public that these are effective medications or treatments."
"In 2014, the Belgian court of appeal in Brussels proved SKEPP right against the appeal of the Dutch physician Robert Görter, who was called a quack by the organization in 2004."
"Since 1 October 2012 the organization has pledged to award the 1-million-euro ""Sisyphus prize"", to anyone who can demonstrate paranormal abilities under controlled conditions. This includes paranormal phenomena as well as homeopathy."
"The same challenge is also offered by various other European skeptical organizations and serves as the equivalent of the American One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which was offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation."
"As of 8 March 2014, its website describes the prize as ""the 25 000 euro prize"". Applying for the prize would cost 50 euro. It informs that ""the text and protocol are being rewritten and will soon be available again""."

= = = Salomée Halpir = = =
"Regina Salomée Halpir (1718 – after 1763) was an 18th-century oculist. She often earns the title of the first female doctor from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. What is known about her life is known from her memoirs, written in 1760, which is a unique example of travel memoir and women's literature. Halpir expressed decidedly un-womanly characteristics and ambitions. Instead of dedicating her life to raising children and being a good wife, as dictated by the 18th-century social norms, Halpir strove to become a successful medical doctor and expressed her hunger for travel and adventure."
"She is known under a great variety of names. Her first name is often given as Salomea, Salome, or Salomėja. In her memoir, she referred to herself as Salomea, but she signed the dedication as Regina. Her maiden name is rendered as Rusiecki, Rusiecka, Ruseckaitė, Rusieckich. Halpir or Halpirowa is her married name from the first marriage. Her name from the second marriage is rendered as Pilstein, Pilsztyn, Pilsztynowa, Pilštyniova, or Pichelstein. Even after bitter divorce from her second husband she continued to use his last name, perhaps because it sounded more noble. In the dedication of her memoir she used the fourth surname – Makowska. It has been suggested that it is the surname of her third husband, but the origin of that surname remains unknown."
"Halpir was born near Navahrudak, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, to the family of Joachim Rusiecki of petty nobility. At the age of 14 she was married off to a German Lutheran oculist Dr. Jacob Halpir. The couple moved to Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, where Dr. Halpir practiced medicine and had many clients while facing cut-throat competition from Jewish and Muslim doctors. Despite, or perhaps because of, her being a poorly educated Christian woman in an Islamic country, Halpir was trained by her husband and assisted him in his operations eventually becoming an accomplished physician herself, with a specialty in cataract surgery. Her status as a female helped her find a niche serving female patients and her status as a foreigner helped her skirt Islamic traditions that severely limited women's freedom. Halpir never received any formal training in medicine."
"Later, her husband fell ill. He died leaving Halpir with their 2-year-old daughter, Constance. After this, Halpir embarked on an extensive journey throughout Europe. During the Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39), she bought four Austrian prisoners of war. Three of them were ransomed by relatives while the fourth, ensign Pilstein, became her second husband. She traveled to Poland where Michał Kazimierz ""Rybeńko"" Radziwiłł made her husband an officer and offered her the position of doctor's residence in Nesvizh. Harpin traveled to Saint Petersburg to free some Turkish prisoners of war. There she gained access to the imperial court and met Empress Anna of Russia and future Empress Elizabeth of Russia. After several months she returned to Poland. She divorced her second husband, whom she bore two sons, after she accused him of adultery, attempting to poison her, and extortion. She moved to Vienna where Prince József Rákóczi fell in love with her, but she declined his marriage proposal. Halpir became romantically involved with a Polish nobleman, seven years her junior, who took advantage of her wealth. She also accused him of starving one of her sons to death. She returned to Constantinople and became a physician of the women in the harem of sultan Mustafa III. Until recently, her destiny after 1760, when she completed her memoir, was unknown. Dariusz Kołodziejczyk has found that in 1763 she was employed as a physician in the Khan’s harem in Bakhchysarai and as such she served as an informant of the Russian consul Aleksandr Nikiforov."
"Halpir's 388-page autobiography was discovered by a Polish historian Glatman in the library of Prince Czartoryski. The memoir was published as ""Proceder podróży i życia mego awantur"" (My Life's Travels and Adventures) in Poland in 1957. A number of the events in the memoir seem far-fetched and implausible. For example, she described how her leg became limp and visibly shorter due to a magic omen. Therefore, biographical accuracy of her memoir is disputed and some researchers prefer to treat it more as a work of fiction than factual autobiography."

"An Intent in the Android operating system is a software mechanism that allows users to coordinate the functions of different activities to achieve a task. An Intent is a messaging object which provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications in the Android development environment. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, where it can be thought of as the glue between activities: Intents provide an inter-application messaging system that encourages collaboration and component reuse."
"An Intent is basically a passive data structure holding an abstract description of an action to be performed. ""For Dummies"" likens an Intent to flicking a switch: ""Your intent is to turn on the light, and to do so, you perform the action of flipping the switch to the On position."""
"The concept was created as a way to allow developers to easily remix different apps and allow each type of task (called ""activity"") to be handled by the application best suited to it, even if provided by a third party. Although the concept was not new, the Android architecture doesn't require elevated privileges to access the components, which makes it an open platform."
"Activities in Android are defined as classes that control the life cycle of a task in the user interface. The activities supported by an application are declared in a manifest, so that other applications can read what activities are supported. Intents in one application can start particular activities in a different application, if the latter supports the message type of the Intent."

= = = Nema aviona za Zagreb = = =
"Nema aviona za Zagreb (""There Is No Plane to Zagreb"") is a 2012 Dutch film by Louis van Gasteren. The film is a retrospective of events in the director's life from 1964 to 1969, filmed by him in that period and reflected on from his vantage point over 40 years later at the age of 90. It is also Jan de Bont's first film credit as cinematographer since 1992's ""Basic Instinct""."
"In 1964 van Gasteren decided to film all his movements, both outward and inner. He narrates early in the film, ""I wanted to make a film about my memories, my observations and experiences. As a filmmaker, I can make that visible."" Explaining his idea to his wife in the film, he says, ""I want to show everything, because every observation I make fits in with that. Look Jacq, every step I take (he takes a deliberate step forward in the room) – also inwards (points to his chest) – everything I am involved in (gestures at the objects in the room)."""
"The film crisscrosses the globe. Countries the film is shot in include the Netherlands, Switzerland, England, Yugoslavia, France, Canada, West Germany, the United States, India, and Spain. The film mixes documentary with enacted scenes, and is shot in both color and black-and-white."
"The film winds up being a journey of a man in search of truth, seeking to shed lies and illusions, as well as reconcile his relationships with human beings."
"As the film opens, a ninety-year-old Louis van Gasteren—a documentary filmmaker and artist famed in the Netherlands—is seated in a video editing suite, watching scenes of himself in the 1960s, a time when ""anything was possible."" He reflects on how much he has changed, and that he is that same person and yet is not."
"We then go back to 1964. Van Gasteren is touring a carnival with his second wife, Jacqueline, their baby girl Mardou, and two older children from his first marriage. The family rides the carousel and sees the sights, including a ""Fat Lady"" exhibit of a mother and daughter weighing 900 pounds."
"From there Louis begins to recall his own youthful memories. His father, Louis van Gasteren, Sr., was a famous actor, and his mother, Elise Menagé Challa, was a singer who gave up the concert stage to promote Communism and traveled rural Spain to learn the songs of the peasants. We learn that his mother died by suicide a few months after his father’s death, and thoughts of his parents are with him every day."
"The film takes a turn of style as Van Gasteren begins to act, playing himself as a good-timer who cheats on his wife with casual encounters. In the course of his travels he runs into an Italian journalist in Belgrade. The two decide to book a flight to Zagreb on a lark, but are told by the travel agent, ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"" (""There is no plane to Zagreb"" in Serbian). Not knowing the language, they find the expression hilarious, and repeat it wherever they go. But later, when alone, the expression begins to haunt Louis. It becomes a personal catchphrase. ""What ""Nema"" expresses is good will and a great incapacity. ""Nema"" and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark."" What this means is never entirely clear, but what we see is that from this point forward Louis becomes a sincere seeker of truth."
"He begins to be more critical of his assumptions about life and what he was told in his youth, and conducts a series of experiments to test them. Next he questions what he really sees, how many different angles and dimensions man can perceive, and whether life is simply one big illusion. To answer these questions, he experiments with LSD, which at that time was permitted for therapeutic use."
"Shortly afterward, it is reported that a young American has died from jumping out a window while tripping on LSD, apparently believing he could fly like a bird. Troubled by this, Louis travels to a U.S. military base in Germany to talk to the boy’s parents, as well as to Millbrook, New York, to meet the LSD-advocate Timothy Leary. In the two skillfully interwoven interviews, a flower-bedecked Leary boasts that people come to his estate to find God through LSD, while the grieving parents puzzle over what went wrong with their son, who had been so healthy and virtuous. These conversations only leave Louis with more questions. He then goes to India to question the spiritual master Meher Baba about LSD and the search for God."
"First asserting that his own experience of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that had it not been for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did."
"From the time of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby daughter as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ’60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world. And to the accompaniment of live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own Beat poetry in English."
"At last Louis travels to the Spanish seaside and seems to resolve the loss of his mother by rescuing a man-sized living turtle being sold at market. Together with his children, Louis rows the gasping turtle out into the harbor and releases it back into the sea, to the joy of the whole family. The camera shifts to a café in which a flamenco singer improvises for the family a touching tribute to Mardou, ""a little angel of God."""
"At the end of the film we see Louis drive down a road and reach a dead end where a mountain of rubble has collapsed into the road. He steps out of the car in silence and faces the mountainous obstacle. It seems to symbolize that he had come to a halting place in the film’s story, or a terminus in that phase of his life. In 1969 Louis stopped making the film."
"In his editing room at ninety years old, Louis van Gasteren at last reveals the heart-breaking event that blocked him from completing the film in the ensuing decades. But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally found the courage to do it. With this we see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute."

"Aitken was drafted 8th overall in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by the Boston Bruins. He played in three games over the course of his two-year entry-level contract. For the 2000–01 season he went to the Czech Republic to play for HC Sparta Praha of the Czech Extraliga. He returned to North America after only a year, and made it back to the NHL during the 2003–04 season with the Chicago Blackhawks, playing 41 games, scoring just one assist. He moved to the Austrian Hockey League for Klagenfurt AC for the 2006–07 season before retiring from professional hockey."
= = = Howard Gordon = = =
"Howard Gordon (born March 31, 1961) is an American television writer and producer."
"He is well known for his work on the Fox action series ""24"" alongside the Showtime thriller ""Homeland"", which he co-developed with Alex Gansa and Gideon Raff, and for the FX political drama ""Tyrant"", which he co-developed with Craig Wright. He also produced the NBC science fiction thriller ""Awake""."
"Gordon was born to a Reform Jewish family in Queens, New York City and graduated from Roslyn High School. After graduating from Princeton with a major in creative writing in 1984, Gordon came to Los Angeles with fellow filmmaker Alex Gansa to pursue a career in writing for television. Both broke into the industry with single episodes of ABC's """". Their ""Spenser"" work turned industry heads, and the pair joined the series ""Beauty and the Beast"" as staff writers, and were later named producers."
"In 1990, the Gansa-Gordon team was signed to a two-year deal with Witt-Thomas Productions, during which they produced several pilots. One was an ABC project called ""Country Estates"", which caught the attention of producer Chris Carter."
"Soon after, Carter invited Gordon and Gansa to join ""The X-Files"" as supervising producers; Gordon wrote or co-wrote several scripts each season, before departing from the series in 1997 to pursue other projects."
"After co-writing one episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", Gordon created his own show, the short-lived ""Strange World"" in 1999. ""Strange World"" went to seed 13 episodes in, but Gordon and ""Strange World"" writer Tim Minear's services were quickly snapped up by ""Buffy"" creator Joss Whedon on another project: ""Angel"". After two years with ""Angel"", Gordon jumped ship in 2001 for FOX's successful ""24"", where he would write several episodes in Seasons 1 & 2, then crafted the entire story arcs for Seasons 3 and 4. Gordon temporarily left ""24"" in the middle of the 2004 season to re-join Minear, this time as co-creator of another FOX series, ""The Inside"". Despite ""The Inside"" 's cancellation and short run, talk circulated of including the two Minear-Gordon series, ""Strange World"" and ""The Inside"", on a special DVD set sometime in 2006."
"Beginning in 2006, Gordon became ""24""'s showrunner, a title he held through its final season."
Gordon is also the author of the Gideon Davis novels.
"In 2010, after finishing ""24"", Gordon began co-developing (along with Gideon Raff and Alex Gansa) the thriller ""Homeland"" for Showtime. Based on the Israeli series ""Prisoners of War"", it centers on a woman (Claire Danes) who works for the CIA and is convinced a recently returned American prisoner of war (Damian Lewis) has been turned by al-Qaeda. The show premiered Sunday, October 2, 2011, at 10/9 central. It has been met with major critical acclaim and maintained a steady viewership rating throughout its first season. Showtime premiered its fourth season on October 5, 2014."
"In 2012, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for writing the ""Pilot"" of ""Homeland"" and the series itself won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series."
"In 2011, Gordon signed on to NBC's new Kyle Killen fantasy pilot ""Awake"" as an executive producer. When NBC picked the project up to series status, Gordon added writer and showrunner to his occupational duties on the show. The series only ran from March 1 to May 24, 2012 before it was cancelled."
"Most recently, 2015 would see him working as an executive producer on the horror-drama series ""Second Chance"" for Fox Television Network. The pilot for ""Second Chance"" is based on a script written by Rand Ravich, who also worked as an executive producer on the series."
= = = Klotho (biology) = = =
Klotho is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the KL gene.
"This gene encodes a type-I membrane protein that is related to β-glucuronidases. Reduced production of this protein has been observed in patients with chronic kidney failure (CKF), and this may be one of the factors underlying the degenerative processes (e.g., arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and skin atrophy) seen in CKF. Also, mutations within this protein have been associated with ageing, bone loss and alcohol consumption. Transgenic mice that overexpress Klotho live longer than wild-type mice."
"Klotho is a transmembrane protein that, in addition to other effects, provides some control over the sensitivity of the organism to insulin and appears to be involved in ageing. Its discovery was documented in 1997 by Makoto Kuro-o ""et al."" The name of the gene comes from Klotho or Clotho, one of the Moirai, or Fates, in Greek mythology."
"The Klotho protein is a novel β-glucuronidase (EC number 3.2.1.31) capable of hydrolyzing steroid β-glucuronides. Genetic variants in ""KLOTHO"" have been associated with human aging, and Klotho protein has been shown to be a circulating factor detectable in serum that declines with age."
"The binding of certain fibroblast growth factors (FGF's) viz., FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23, to their fibroblast growth factor receptors, is promoted via their interactions as co-receptors with β-Klotho."
"Klotho-deficient mice manifest a syndrome resembling accelerated human aging and display extensive and accelerated arteriosclerosis. Additionally, they exhibit impaired endothelium dependent vasodilation and impaired angiogenesis, suggesting that Klotho protein may protect the cardiovascular system through endothelium-derived NO production."
"Although the vast majority of research has been based on lack of Klotho, it was demonstrated that an overexpression of Klotho in mice might extend their average life span between 19% and 31% compared to normal mice. In addition, variations in the Klotho gene (SNP Rs9536314) are associated with both life extension and increased cognition in human populations."
"The mechanism of action of klotho is not fully understood, but it changes cellular calcium homeostasis, by both increasing the expression and activity of TRPV5 and decreasing that of TRPC6. Additionally, klotho increases membrane expression of the inward rectifier channel ROMK. Klotho-deficient mice show increased production of vitamin D, and altered mineral-ion homeostasis is suggested to be a cause of premature aging‑like phenotypes, because the lowering of vitamin D activity by dietary restriction reverses the premature aging‑like phenotypes and prolongs survival in these mutants. These results suggest that aging‑like phenotypes were due to klotho-associated vitamin D metabolic abnormalities (hypervitaminosis)."
"Recently it has been found that the decreased Klotho expression may be due to DNA hypermethylation, which may have been induced by the overexpression of DNMT3a. Klotho may be a reliable gene for early detection of methylation changes in oral tissues, and can be used as a target for therapeutic modification in oral cancer during the early stages."

= = = August Thyssen = = =
"August Thyssen (; Eschweiler, 17 May 1842 – Landsberg Castle, Ratingen, near Kettwig, 4 April 1926) was a German industrialist."
After he had completed his studies at the Politechnische Schule Karlsruhe and a commercial school at Antwerpen he like his brother Joseph Thyssen joined the bank of his father Friedrich Thyssen.
"In 1867 Thyssen and several members of his family founded the iron works ""Thyssen-Foussol & Co"" in Duisburg. When this company was dissolved in 1870, he used the new capital to establish with his father the ""Walzwerk Thyssen & Co"" that would become the base of an industrial empire in the industrialized Mülheim an der Ruhr, where the high of iron and steel prizes contributed to the making of his fortune. Initially he managed different companies separately in a decentralized fashion, but eventually he united them through a holding company. The largest company of his was the coal mining company ""Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser"" in Hamborn (now part of Duisburg) that he had acquired in 1891."
"He built the first 500-ton blast furnace in Germany, the first 100-ton Martin furnace, and the first large tube (iron pipe size) works. Together with Hugo Stinnes Thyssen was a cofounder of RWE."
"On 3 December 1872 in Mülheim an der Ruhr he married Hedwig Pelzer (1854–1940), daughter of Johann-Heinrich Pelzer and wife Hedwig Troost. They divorced in 1885. The four children during the marriage were Fritz, August, Heinrich and Hedwig. To avoid the possibility that his divorce would lead to a partitioning of his industrial empire, Thyssen transferred the property to his children, but retained the management rights for himself during his lifetime."
"The Thyssen conglomerate became the nucleus of Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG, the biggest mining and steel cartel in the world, prior to World War II. Thyssen was refounded in 1953 and joined with KruppHoesch to become ThyssenKrupp AG in 1997."
"Thyssen purchased most of Beeckerwerth, including Haus Knipp, in the early 20th century."
"He was the first in his family to start acquiring a collection of works of art, including six pieces by his friend sculptor Auguste Rodin."
"Thyssen's firm was a vertically integrated company, controlling all aspects of the steelmaking process. He owned his own fleet of ships, a network of docks and a railroad. Although he was one of the richest men in Germany, to the day he died his ethos was ""If I rest, I rust."" He lived a simple life; he ran his empire from a dingy office in Mülheim, drove an old car, wore off-the-peg suits, and was known to drink and eat with his workers. He was also an ardent republican."
Thyssen died in 1926 of pneumonia following complications from eye surgery.

= = = Swaledale sheep = = =
"Swaledale is a breed of domestic sheep named after the Yorkshire valley of Swaledale in England. They are found throughout the more mountainous areas of Great Britain, but particularly in the Yorkshire Dales, County Durham, and around the pennine fells of Cumbria."
"Swaledales are noted for their off-white wool, curled horns and white around their nose and eyes. They are used for the production of lamb/mutton, the North of England Mule sheep, and as Pedigree breeding stock. Together with the Rough Fell, Herdwick, and Dalesbred sheep, they are one of the four variations associated with the English Lake District."
"Well suited to the exposed regions in which they predominantly live, the Swaledales are very hardy, thick coated, able bodied, and bold. The ewes make excellent mothers and are known for being able to rear lambs well, even in adverse conditions. They are of a medium build, with black faces marked with bright white around the nose and eyes, and both males and females grow curled horns, however the males horns are much larger. Their coats are thick and very coarse, and are considered a uniform white or off-white colour. The wool they produce, although durable, resilient and usable for a number of applications, is worth very little, with the British Wool Marketing Board paying approximately 40 pence per kilo of wool. The marketed fleece and fibre may contain kemp that is not white, so some yarns and prepared fibres from the Swaledale are grey. The sheep are also known for their tender and good-flavoured lamb and mutton."
"The Swaledales as a breed are related to Scottish Blackface and Rough Fell sheep, both of which are also predominant in upland locations in the United Kingdom and noted for their ability to thrive in exposed locations. Although the specific origins of the breed are unknown, a non-indigenous and exotic ancestor for the Swaledale was considered by two noted names of the eighteenth century, John Naismyth and Charles Findlater. Published in 1796, Naismyth's opinion in ""Young's Annals of Agriculture"" was that the origin of the black-faced highland breeds was ""impossible to trace"". Robert Trow-Smith in his book ""A History of British Livestock Husbandry, 1700–1900"" wrote: ""... it has already been suggested that this family stood outside the main stream of ancient British sheep..."" and that the root of the Swaledale and Scottish Blackface breeds could be the Argali. This tenuous link between domestic sheep and the wild Argali has since been proved to be insupportable due to a significant difference in genetic make-up and number of chromosomes."
"Before the Swaledale, Scottish Blackface, and Rough Fell emerged as distinct breeds, their 17th-century forerunner was the Linton. It was named after the West Linton market in Peeblesshire, which specialised in selling the hardy Lintons for Scottish Highland and other upland farming. At the beginning of the 18th century, the market is recorded as having sold upwards of 9,000 sheep in a single day, numbers which surely helped establish the breed firmly in upland areas."
"The Swaledale Sheep Breeders Association was founded in 1919 and originally consisted of farmers living within a seven-mile radius of the Tan Hill Inn, on the North Yorkshire moors. The association is an active organisation point for Swaledale sales, shows, breeding, and products."
"There are approximately 1,200 flocks of pedigree Swaledale sheep in the United Kingdom. Fine pedigree tups (rams) sell for approximately £2,000 to £5,000 on average, though the highest price paid at auction for a prized ram was £101,000. Being a hardy breed, farmers are able to rear their Swaledale flocks in remote and exposed locations, generally without needing to provide indoor accommodation."
"The sheep produce commercially viable mutton and wool. Swaledale mutton has good flavour and tenderness. Wool colour and coarseness prevents Swaledale wool from fetching high prices, but its strong and durable properties make it suitable for carpets, rugs, and insulation. However, the wool is also used for spinning and knitting of clothing, though on a lesser scale to its other uses."
"The Swaledale sheep is an official symbol of the Yorkshire Dales. In 2003, plans were submitted to build a Swaledale sheep visitor centre in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, declaring Kirkby Stephen as the ""spiritual home of the Swaledale sheep"". These plans drew strong opposition from the town of Hawes, in Yorkshire, a strong competitor in terms of Swaledale sales, and which had its own plans for a visitor centre."
"A control flock of Swaledales has been used to study and develop scrapie-resistant sheep. An infectious, persistent, and spontaneous disease, animals infected with scrapie must be quarantined and destroyed. The experimental breeding involved selecting a group of Swaledale sheep with low suspectability to the disease, injecting them with the agents of the disease, and breeding from the survivors. The research has concluded that the offspring of the infected sheep are more able to survive scrapie."
"A commercially successful breed, the North of England Mule, has been produced from the Swaledale ewes, by mating with Bluefaced Leicesters. The offspring of this cross are now one of the most prolific lowland sheep."
"Swaledale cheese is an award-winning cheese that is manufactured in the Swaledale area, though not exclusively from sheep of this breed."
"The Chinatown stop is located on George Street, north of Campbell Street. It is named after Sydney's Chinatown precinct. The Capitol Square stop on the Dulwich Hill Line is nearby. The design was to include two side platforms, but was changed to an island platform in the project's Submissions Report. The location was also moved 15 metres north."
"The Haymarket stop, known as Rawson Place during development, serves as an interchange for buses heading towards the west via Broadway. The design includes two side platforms for trams and an adjacent platform for buses, which allows bus – tram cross-platform transfers."
"The Central Chalmers Street stop is located on Chalmers Street, serving the eastern side of the Central railway station precinct. The stop was originally known simply as Central during development, but was renamed to distinguish it from the existing Central stop on the Dulwich Hill Line at the station's Grand Concourse. The new stop consists of one side platform and one island platform."
"The stop was originally proposed to consist of three double length (90 metre) platforms, with one of the platforms to only be used during special events - the roadway being open to general traffic at other times. This third platform was removed in the project's Submissions Report, with a crossover to the north of the stop provided instead. The Report also proposed diverting most general traffic via Randle Street and converting the section of Chalmers Street opposite the station into a pedestrian/traffic shared zone. As a result of the December 2014 decision to increase the length of the trams, plans to run double length trams during special events at Moore Park were abandoned. Consequently, the Modifications Report reduced the platform length from 90 metres to 75 metres. The third platform was reinstated in an urban design plan released in 2017. This report also proposed closing Chalmers Street to through traffic."
"The Surry Hills stop is located on Devonshire Street, adjacent to Ward Park in Surry Hills. The design originally featured an island platform but was changed to side platforms in the project's Submissions Report. Groundwork for a second Surry Hills stop at Wimbo Park for a potential future station if required will be completed in the initial construction phase."
"The Moore Park stop serves the Moore Park precinct. In regular service the stop serves Sydney Boys High School, Sydney Girls High School and The Entertainment Quarter. The stop is also designed to handle major events at the New Sydney Football Stadium and Sydney Cricket Ground, with grade separated access to the platform. At-grade access to the stop will be provided for regular use and for disabled passengers during major events. The design features a 75-metre island platform."
"The stop's design experienced a number of modifications. Initially, an overhead concourse was proposed for access to the stop during special events with at-grade access at other times. School students would have used the existing footpath and pedestrian crossing of Anzac Parade."
"In the project's Submissions Report, the stop was moved 250 metres south and a pedestrian bridge over Anzac Parade and the light rail tracks was included in the design, replacing an existing at-grade crossing of the road and an associated set of traffic lights. The bridge was to be connected to the concourse. In December 2014, the overhead concourse was removed, with underground access for major events provided at both ends of the platform. At-grade access will be used by disabled passengers during major events and by all passengers at other times. The bridge will now be a separate structure. As a result of the decision to increase the length of the trams, plans to run double length trams during major events were abandoned. Consequently, the platform length was reduced from 90 metres to 75 metres."
"Community submissions responding to the changes in the Modifications Report raised concerns about the safety of a large number of school students crossing the tracks during peak schools hours. In response, TfNSW stated that it will consider opening the subways during these hours. A condition of approval for the changes proposed in the Modifications Report requires the preparation of ""a safety case demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator, that schoolchildren can safely access the Moore Park stop during peak school start and finish times""."
"Royal Randwick, known as Alison Road and then Royal Randwick Racecourse during development, is located on existing park land adjacent to Centennial Park on Alison Road, opposite the racecourse. This required the construction of a new retaining wall approximately 200 metres long and three metres high together with increasing the height of an existing 1,100-metre long levee by up to 300 millimetres and the removal of approximately 50 established trees."
"The design features an island platform. The proposed location was switched from the south side to the north side of Alison Road in December 2014. This is intended to reduce impacts on the racecourse, improve bus access during major events and provide better access to the nearby Centennial Park and Randwick TAFE. This change includes the removal of right turn access from Alison Road into Darley Road."
"The Wansey Road stop is located on Alison Road, adjacent to the intersection with Wansey Road. The design features an island platform and was originally to be located on Wansey Road itself, but was moved to Alison Road in the project's Submissions Report. The stop was originally proposed to be named Wansey Stables."
"The UNSW High Street stop serves the north-eastern part of the University of New South Wales campus. It was to have been located at the southern end of Wansey Road, adjacent to High Street, but was moved onto High Street itself as part of the project's Submissions Report. As part of the changes to the Randwick stop, the design was changed from an island platform to two side platforms."
"The Randwick stop is located the eastern end of High Street in Randwick. The stop was originally proposed to be named Randwick Junction. The design features an island platform. The site will be a major interchange between buses and light rail. Bus stops are proposed for Belmore Road, Avoca Street and Clara Street."
"The original design featured two side platforms located in High Cross Park adjacent to Belmore Road. This location attracted criticism from community members due to loss of trees and parkland. The stop was redesigned in the project's Submissions Report to reduce the loss of green space in the park, however a campaign to move the stop continued. Randwick City Council requested the stop be moved to High Street, outside the Prince of Wales Hospital and TfNSW ultimately agreed to do this. A location within High Cross Park was considered to provide the best interchanges between trams and buses."
"ES Marks, known as Carlton Street during development, will be located on Anzac Parade south of the intersection with Carlton Street. The stop will serve a residential area. It is named after the nearby ES Marks Athletics Field. The design features an island platform."
"Kensington, known as Todman Avenue during development, will be located on Anzac Parade north of the intersection with Todman Avenue. The stop serves a residential area and a shopping strip on Anzac Parade in the suburb of Kensington. The design features an island platform."
"UNSW Anzac Parade serves the western part of the University of New South Wales campus and the National Institute of Dramatic Art. The design includes an island platform in the centre of Anzac Parade, north of the University Mall."
"The stop was to be located on the eastern side of Anzac Parade and include one island platform and one side platform – though only two tracks. In the project's Submissions Report, the side platform was removed and the stop was moved to the centre of Anzac Parade."
"The Kingsford stop, known as Strachan Street during development, will be located on Anzac Parade to the south of the intersection of Strachan Street and Middle Street in Kingsford. The stop serves a residential area and a shopping strip on Anzac Parade. The design features an island platform."
"Juniors Kingsford, originally Nine Ways and known as Kingsford during development, will be located on the southern side of the Nine Ways intersection in Kingsford. The design features two island platforms with the light rail using the two outer platforms and buses using the two inner platforms, providing cross-platform transfers. Terminating facilities for trams are located south of the stop. In August 2018 TfNSW submitted a proposal with the Geographical Names Board for the stop to be renamed from Nine Ways to Juniors Kingsford which was approved in January 2019."
"In 2014, TfNSW investigated an extension along the southern Anzac Parade corridor. Three potential options were examined; a 1.9 kilometre extension to Maroubra Junction, a 5.1 kilometre extension to Malabar and an 8.2 kilometre extension to La Perouse. An extension to Maroubra Junction has the support of Randwick City Council."

These three new tube-nosed bats were discovered by a team from the Hungarian Natural History Museum (HNHM) and Fauna and Flora International (FFI). All three of these bats live in tropical forests, making them endangered by deforestation."
"It was filmed in Mapleton, Utah."
"The film is about a small, idyllic town in rural Utah. Wes (Richard Dutcher) is the town sheriff, a widower, and one of seventeen bishops in the town. There had never been a murder reported in the town until one day when Wes comes upon the crime scene of a murdered woman. Since Wes has no experience in murder investigations and because he wants to keep the murder's influence out of his town, he calls in the FBI from their closest office in Salt Lake City, Utah. Suspicion becomes rampant as more murders occur, until the killer is finally exposed."
"The film has a 71% ""Fresh"" rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 62 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews""."
"Lawrence Van Gelder of ""The New York Times"" praised the acting of Dutcher, Brown, Brimley, and Morgan, calling it, ""impeccable."" He also described the film as, ""an example of concise, skillful filmmaking."""

"The Quaker Oats Company, known as Quaker, is an American food conglomerate based in Chicago. It has been owned by PepsiCo since 2001."
Quaker Oats was founded in 1901 by the merger of four oat mills:
"The company expanded into numerous areas, including other breakfast cereals and other food and drink products, and even into unrelated fields such as toys."
"Quaker Oats in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was photographed during the 1930s by Theodor Horydczak, who documented the building, operations, and factory workers at the plant."
"During World War II, the company, through its subsidiary the Q. O. Ordnance Company, operated the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant, which manufactured millions of pieces of various artillery munitions (41 warehouses and 219 magazines of total 280,800 ft² were built)."
"In 1968, a plant was built in Danville, Illinois. This plant currently makes Aunt Jemima pancake mixes, Oat Squares, Life Cereals Quaker Oh's, Bumpers, Quisp, King Vitamin Natural Granola Cereals, and Chewy granola bars, as well as Puffed Rice for use as an ingredient for other products in other plants."
"In 1969, Quaker acquired Fisher-Price, a toy company and spun it off in 1991."
"In the 1970s, the company financed the making of the film ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", obtaining in return a license to use a number of the product names mentioned in the movie for candy bars."
"In 1982 Quaker Oats purchased US Games, a company that created games for the Atari 2600. It went out of business after one year. That same year, Quaker Oats acquired Florida-based orange juice plant Ardmore Farms, which it would own until selling it to Country Pure Foods in 1998."
"In 1983, Quaker bought Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., makers of Van Camp's and Gatorade."
"Quaker bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994 and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million. Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000. It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners, Dr Pepper Snapple Group."
"In 1996, Quaker spun off its frozen food business, selling it to Aurora Foods (which was bought by Pinnacle Foods in 2004)."
"In August 2001, Pepsico acquired Quaker Oats for $14 billion dollars."
"The major Canadian production facility for Quaker Oats is located in Peterborough, Ontario. The factory was first established as the American Cereal Company in 1902 on the shores of the Otonabee River during that city's period of industrialization. At the time, the city was known as ""The Electric City"" due to its hydropower resources, attracting many companies to the site to take advantage of this source. The Trent–Severn Waterway also promised to provide an alternate shipping route from inland areas around the city, although it appears this was never used in practice. On 11 December 1916, the factory all but completely burned to the ground. When the smoke had settled, 23 people had died and Quaker was left with $2,000,000 in damages. Quaker went on to rebuild the facility, incorporating the few areas of the structure that were not destroyed by fire."
"When PepsiCo purchased Quaker Oats in 2001, many brands were consolidated from facilities around Canada to the Peterborough location, which assumed the new QTG (Quaker Tropicana Gatorade) moniker. Local production includes Quaker Oatmeal, Quaker Chewy bars, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Aunt Jemima instant pancake mixes and pancake syrups, Quaker Oat Bran and Corn Bran cereals, Gatorade sports drinks and the Propel fitness water sub-brand, Tropicana juices, and various Frito-Lay snack products. Products are easily identified by the ""manufactured by"" address on the packaging. The Peterborough facility exports to the majority of Canada and limited portions of the United States. The Quaker plant sells cereal production byproducts to companies that use them to create fire logs and pellets."
"Starting in 1902, the company's oatmeal boxes came with a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford, Connecticut. The lots, sometimes as small as 10 feet by 10 feet, were carved out of a 15-acre, never-built subdivision called ""Liberty Park"". A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, redeemed their coupons for the free deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the ""oatmeal lots"". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several tracts would need to be combined before building could start. The legal deeds created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from them. In the mid-1970s, the town put an end to the oatmeal lots with a ""general foreclosure"" condemning nearly all of the property, which is now part of a BiC Corporation plant."
"In 1955, Quaker Oats again gave away land as part of a promotion, this one tied to the ""Sergeant Preston of the Yukon"" television show in the United States. The company offered in its Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice cereal boxes genuine deeds to land in the Klondike."
"The Quaker Oats logo starting in 1877 had a figure of a Quaker man depicted full-length, sometimes holding a scroll with the word ""Pure"" written across it, resembling the classic woodcuts of William Penn, the 17th-century philosopher and early Quaker. Quaker Oats advertising dating back to 1909 did, indeed, identify the ""Quaker man"" as William Penn, and referred to him as ""standard bearer of the Quakers and of Quaker Oats."""
"In 1946, graphic designer Jim Nash created a black-and-white head-and-shoulders portrait of the smiling Quaker Man, and Haddon Sundblom's now-familiar color head-and-shoulders portrait (using fellow Coca-Cola artist Harold W. McCauley as the model) debuted in 1957. The monochromatic 1969 Quaker Oats Company logo, modeled after the Sundblom illustration, was created by Saul Bass, a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences and corporate logos. In 2012, the company enlisted the firm of Hornall Anderson to give the 'Quaker man' a slimmer, somewhat younger look. The man is now sometimes referred to as ""Larry"" by insiders at Quaker Oats."
"And in 1965, a new advertising slogan was introduced: ""Nothing is better for thee, than me""."
"The company states that their current 'Quaker man' logo ""does not represent an actual person. His image is that of a man dressed in Quaker garb, chosen because the Quaker faith projected the values of honesty, integrity, purity and strength."""
"The company has never had any ties with the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). When the company was being built up, Quaker businessmen were known for their honesty (truth is often considered a Quaker testimony). ""The Straight Dope"" writes ""According to the good folks at Quaker Oats, the Quaker Man was America's first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal, his registration taking place on September 4th, 1877."""
"Members of the Religious Society of Friends have occasionally expressed frustration at being confused with the Quaker Oats representation. In recent years, Friends have twice protested the Quaker name being used for advertising campaigns seen as promoting violence. In 1990, some Quakers started a letter-writing campaign after a Quaker Oats advertisement depicted Popeye as a ""Quakerman"" who used violence against aliens, sharks, and Bluto. Later that decade, more letters were sparked by Power Rangers toys included in Cap'n Crunch cereal."
"From 1946-1953, researchers from Quaker Oats Company, MIT and Harvard University carried out experiments at the Walter E. Fernald State School to determine how the minerals from cereals were metabolized. Parents of mentally challenged children were asked for permission to let their children be members of a ""Science Club"" and participate in research. Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. They were not told that the food their children were fed contained radioactive calcium and iron, and the consent form contained no information indicating this. The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign. The company was later sued because of the experiments. The lawsuit was settled on 31 December 1997."
"In 2010, two California consumers filed a class action lawsuit against the Quaker Oats Company. Plaintiffs allege that Quaker marketed its products as healthy even though they contained unhealthy trans fat. Specifically, Quaker's Chewy Granola Bars, Instant Oatmeal, and Oatmeal to Go Bars contained trans fat, yet their packaging featured claims like ""heart healthy,"" ""wholesome,"" and ""smart choices made easy."""

"Dr. S. Revathi (pen name: Kutti Revathi) is an Indian lyricist, poet, activist and a doctor. She has published three books of poetry and is the editor of ""Panikkudam"", a literary quarterly for women's writing and also the first Tamil feminist magazine. Post several literary meetings and reviewing poetry collections by fellow students, she began working on some of her own pieces. Following school, she studied Siddha medicine and got a bachelor's degree in Siddha medicine and surgery, one of the oldest medical systems in the world that derived from her native Tamil Nadu. She had been pursuing her doctoral research in medical anthropology at the Madras Institute of Development Studies in Chennai. Revathi received the Sigaram 15: Faces of Future award for literature from India Today and was awarded a travel grant in 2005 by the Sahitya Akademi to meet leading litterateurs from India. She is a contemporary Tamil poet and has published numerous controversial poetry collections."
"Works by her are noted to be much women-centric. ""Panikkudam"" the first Tamil feminist magazine by her claimed varied aspects such as family, politics, business, discovery of feminine language, introducing modern play, novels, short stories and poetry created by women writers. Interviews of women writers, introduction to modern poetry and short stories, translations of such works into Tamil from World languages, discussions of the creative process and sangam literature were some of the elements that made the part of the magazine. In the field of poetry, her first release in the year 2000 was ""Poonaiyai Pola Alaiyum Velicham"". Kutti Revathi's second book, ""Mulaigal"" that was published in 2002, evoked a storm of protest and stirred controversies from the conservatives of the Tamil literary establishment. The consequences of release were such that a group of outraged male film lyricists damned the book. The debate extended to parameters of cultural debate: obscene calls, letters and threats ensued, and comments on the author's morality were freely aired. While one lyricist demanded that writers of her types must watch out for dire consequences, the other exhorted the public to burn them on Chennai's Mount Road. However she explained, ""My aim is to explore 'Mulaigal' (breasts) as an 'inhabited' living reality, rather than an 'exhibited' commodity."" Adjoint to the content, an essay titled ""With Words I Weave My Body"", she discussed the ways in which a patriarchal tradition, fearful of sharing the power of the written word, compelled women to imprint narratives on their bodies. Her third release was ""Thanimaiyin Aayiram Irakkaigal"" in 2003."
"In 2007 the English translation of her poetry ""Body's Door"" was released. ""Shattered Boundaries"" another collection of her poems in English translation was released in 2012."
"Revathi was roped in for the 2013 film ""Maryan"" two-and-a-half years ago when the film's director Bharatbala was on the lookout for a Tamil scholar. For the same film's soundtrack album, she wrote lyrics of the melancholic song ""Yenga Pona Raasa"" and the track ""Nenjae Ezhu"". Upon the musical success of the album especially the track ""Nenjae Ezhu"", her lyrical styles were critically applauded. She wrote the lyrics for the song ""Ennile Maha Oliyo"" that was aired on MTV Coke Studio (India). And She also has written a song for the music scored by Oscar composer AR Rahman in Tamil Version of the film MOM directed by Ravi Udyawar."

= = = Indigenous Mexican Americans = = =
"Indigenous Mexican Americans or Mexican American Indians are American citizens who are descended from the indigenous peoples of Mexico. Indigenous Mexican-Americans usually speak an Indigenous language as their first language and may not speak either Spanish or English. Indigenous Mexican-Americans may or may not identify as ""Hispanic"" or ""Latino""."
"California is home to a large and growing population of Indigenous people of Mexican birth or descent. 200,000 people in the state are descended from one or more of Mexico's over 60 Indigenous groups. Many of these Indigenous Mexican-Americans hail from the indigenous people of Oaxaca, with California being home to between 100,000 and 150,000 indigenous Oaxacans. 50,000 are estimated to be Mixtec, an indigenous people from the La Mixteca region of Western Oaxaca and nearby portions of Puebla and Guerrero."
"The slur ""Oaxaquita"" (""Little Oaxacan"") is sometimes used as a derogatory term that is used by Spanish-speaking Mexican-Americans against Indigenous Mexican-Americans. The term carries the connotation that being from Oaxaca is negative and is often used against any Mexican-American who is short or fat. The slur ""indito"" (""little Indian"") is also used against Indigenous Oaxacans. Indigenous Mexican-Americans have been subjected to ridicule, derision, stereotyping, teasing, bullying, and other forms of discrimination and abuse by non-Indigenous Mexican-Americans. Dynamics of racism and discrimination that exist within Mexico also exist within Mexican-American immigrant communities."
"Discrimination against indigenous Oaxacan and Mixtec people can also come from Mexican-Americans who, although also coming from an indigenous Mexican background, have stopped speaking a Mixtecan or other Indigenous language. Those who have assimilated by adopting the Spanish or English languages may look down upon Indigenous people who have preserved their language and culture."

"= = = Sir Walter Strickland, 9th Baronet = = ="
"Walter William Strickland, ""de jure"" 9th Baronet (26 May 1851 – 9 August 1938) was an English translator and radical. He became known as the ""Anarchist Baronet"" because he wandered around the world for much of his life espousing radical causes. After receiving Czechoslovakian citizenship in 1923, he renounced his British citizenship and later moved to Java."
"Strickland was born in Westminster while the family estate was at Hildenley Hall near Malton, North Yorkshire. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was the eldest son of Sir Charles Strickland, 8th Baronet (1819–1909), the only child of his first marriage to Georgina, daughter of Sir William Milner, 4th Baronet, but never formally used the title he inherited upon his father's death."
"In 1888, he married Eliza Vokes (1860–1946). A polyglot fluent in ancient and modern languages, he wrote several books and pamphlets and translated works of the Czech poet Vítězslav Hálek, as well as Molière and Horace."
"He has been linked with the Voynich manuscript. He may have met Wilfrid Voynich during his first years in London, when Voynich was directly involved in the political activities of Russian refugees in London, under the leadership of Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, who founded the SFRF (Society of Friends of Russian Freedom) and the RFPF (Russian Free Press Fund)."
"In the early 1890s, Strickland went to live abroad. In 1911, he sold the family home, which became a convent. After 1912, he did not live in England. Strickland spent some time in Russia and in 1923 became a citizen of Czechoslovakia, formally renouncing his British citizenship and that he would not be using the title. (There is no mechanism for a baronet to renounce the title, although it is possible to cease using it during his lifetime.)"
"In 1931, he moved to Buitenzorg, Java, where he died in 1938. He and his wife had no children and the title passed to a cousin once removed, Sir Henry Strickland-Constable, 10th Baronet."
"In the Punjab region, it is traditional to offer sweet Vermicelli to the shrines of Gugga Ji and sweet fried bread (mathya ()). He is worshiped in the month of Bhadon especially on the ninth day of that month. Gugga is meant to protect against snake bites and he is venerated in shrines known as marris. The shrines do not conform to any religion and can range from antholes to structures that resemble a Sikh Gurdwara or a Mosque. When worshipping Gugga, people bring noodles as offerings and also leave them in places where snakes reside. People perform a devotional dance while dancing on the legendary songs of bravery sung in his praise."

= = = Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum = = =
"Khnumhotep (pronunciation: xaˈnaːmaw-ˈħatpew) and Niankhkhnum (pronunciation: nij-daˌnax-xaˈnaːmaw) were ancient Egyptian royal servants. They shared the title of Overseer of the Manicurists in the Palace of King Nyuserre Ini, sixth pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty, reigning during the second half of the 25th century BC. They were buried together at Saqqara and are listed as ""royal confidants"" in their joint tomb. They are notable for their unusual depiction in Egyptian records, often interpreted as the first recorded same-sex couple, a claim that has met considerable debate."
"Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are believed by Thomas Dowson, Greg Reeder, and some other scholars to be the first recorded same-sex couple in ancient history. The assumed romantic relationship between Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum is based on depictions of the two men standing nose to nose and embracing. Niankhkhnum's wife, depicted in a banquet scene, was almost completely erased in antiquity, and in other pictures Khnumhotep occupies the position usually designated for a wife. Their official titles were ""Overseers of the Manicurists of the Palace of the King"" (see sections Titularies, Banquents and music). Critics argue that both men appear with their respective wives and children, suggesting the men were brothers, rather than lovers."
"Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are depicted in the tomb with their respective families. It has been proposed that they were the sons of Khabaw-khufu and Rewedzawes. They appear to have had three brothers named Titi, Nefernisut, and Kahersetef. Three possible sisters are also attested. They are named Neferhotep-hewetherew, Mehewet and Ptah-heseten. Niankhkhnum's wife was named Khentikawes. The couple appear in the tomb with three sons named Hem-re, Qed-unas and Khnumhezewef, and three daughters, Hemet-re, Khewiten-re and Nebet. At least one grandson is attested, Irin-akheti, the son of Hem-re and his wife, Tjeset."
"Khnumhotep had a wife by the name of Khenut. Khnumhotep and Khenut had at least five sons named Ptahshepses, Ptahneferkhu, Kaizebi, Khnumheswef and Niankhkhnum the younger (possibly named after the tomb owner), as well as a daughter named Rewedzawes."
"Egyptian records note Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum as the heads manicurists for the royal family, but they may have held a number of different official titles and duties"
"On duty at the sun temple, Niankhkhnum or Khnumhotep may have watched over subordinate officials, such as the ""m-r pr Sna"" ""overseer of the magazines"" who in turn supervised crews of porters stocking and withdrawing material from the granaries and store-rooms"
"Care of the king's body and wardrobe in preparation for his public appearances required a large number of aides, apparently working in different ateliers each under its own leadership. In addition to the manicurists whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep supervised (discussed in the titulary section of this article), the palace had attendants under one or more men holding the title ""jrj nfr HAt"" ""keeper of the headdress,"" responsible for the king's wigs and headcloths, ""jrw Snj"" "" hairdressers, who kept him shaven, and an ""m-r n jzwj Xkrwt nswt"" ""overseer of the two chambers of king's adorners."" The post of ""Xkrt nswt"" ""adorner of the king"" was always held by women, who were legally, if not socially, equal to men in Egypt. Neferhotep-Hathor is labeled with this status at the funeral procession of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep."
"How, or how often, personnel in the hairdressers' shop, which from titulary evidence stands higher than the manicurists in 5th and 6th Dynasty prestige rankings, communicated with the latter remains unknown. No hairdressers are labeled at the funeral procession. Ptahshepses, the keeper of the headdress who became Nyussere's vizier, and Ti, overseer of the pyramids and sun temples, are two officials whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep may have worked with Both Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are attested on a harvest scene in the splendid burial estate of Ptahshepses, where they may have been quarry supervisors, yet named as ""jr ant pr aA"" ""palace manicurists,"" quite junior to titulary in their own tomb, which could mean Ptahshepses died while they were younger. A door jamb, besides ""TAtj"" ""vizier,"" displays the title ""HAt-a"" ""one whose arm is in front,"" a pure honorific Allen distinguishes from the ""m-r"" and ""jrj"" titles specifying responsibility domains we've encountered up to now. The ""jrj nfr HAt"" ""keeper of the headdress"" epithet, recorded in many of the rooms, is spelled with the mouth sign (Gardiner D21), not the eye sign (D4), so that it shares the introductory word of ""jrj-pat"" ""hereditary prince,"" another of Allen's honorifics."
"The tomb of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum was discovered by Egyptologist Ahmed Moussa in the necropolis at Saqqara, Egypt in 1964, during the excavation of the causeway for the pyramid of King Unas. It is the only tomb in the necropolis where men are displayed embracing and holding hands. In addition, the men's chosen names (both theophorics to the creator-god Khnum) form a linguistic reference to their closeness: Niankhkhnum means ""life belongs to Khnum"" and Khnumhotep means ""Khnum is satisfied;"""
"The precise king and regnal date of this tomb are unknown; style places it in the latter 5th Dynasty under Nyuserre or Menkauhor. No human remains were discovered inside. It is believed the tomb was built in stages, first a sequence of two chambers cut into the limestone of a low escarpment in the northern area of Saqqara, then a surface-built mastaba structure added to mate with the earlier construction. This would have occurred as the two intended occupants gained resources."
"In a banquet scene, Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep are entertained by dancers, clappers, musicians and singers; in another, they oversee their funeral preparations. In the most striking portrayal, the two embrace, noses touching, in the most intimate pose allowed by canonical Egyptian art, surrounded by what would appear to be their heirs."
"Egyptian tombs feature lists of titles and epithets honoring the deceased or held during life, often giving titles for other persons who appear on a wall. For Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep, the titulary may be condensed as follows:"

"A makeup brush is a tool with bristles, used for the application of makeup or face painting. The bristles may be made out of natural or synthetic materials, while the handle is usually made out of plastic or wood. When cosmetics are applied using the appropriate brush, they blend better into the skin."
"There is a large variety of shapes and sizes of makeup brushes, depending on the face area where makeup will be applied, the cosmetic product and the wanted result. For example, the shape of the brush tip can be chiseled, straight, angular, round, flat or tapered."
Makeup application can alter due to the materials used to create a brush. The bristles of a makeup brush can either be synthetic or natural. The brush itself is important to the application of makeup as it can densely pack on product or loosely pack on product.
"Synthetic bristles are the most common material used in makeup brushes. These brushes are widely found in drugstores and makeup-specific stores. The bristles are made out of plastic, nylon, or other synthetic fibers, and may be dyed. Synthetic bristles are often used with liquid and cream products, as they tend to blend out products more easily and will not absorb product as much as a natural bristle brush. Synthetic brushes are cruelty-free. Synthetic brushes usually last longer than natural haired bristles as they do not degrade and are not as fragile."
"The natural bristles are often dark in color, not super soft, sheds, hold pigments better and difficult to wash. As the natural bristles are very porous they pick up more pigments and distributes them evenly. The natural bristled brushes best applies powder products and it is best to avoid liquid or cream products as they will drink up most of the products. Although natural bristles are more preferred in the cosmetic industry, the bristles themselves can cause allergic reactions to the animal hair."
"Natural bristles may more easily control the product when blending out or even packing on a product, because they have hair cuticles."
= = = Kabuki brush = = =
"A kabuki brush (sometimes called mushroom brush) is a makeup brush with a short stem and dense bristles. The brush head is most often rounded, though it can also be flat. Traditionally, the bristles are made of natural materials like animal hair (e.g., goat or horse hair), but most brushes available now on the market have synthetic bristles."
"It is named after the Kabuki Japanese drama theater where actors wear ""Keshō"", a very heavy makeup that emphasizes the nature of their characters. There, the kabuki brush is used to apply the white rice powder uniformly on the entire face."
"Usually, a kabuki brush is used to apply loose powdered make-up on large surfaces of the face (e.g., foundation, face powder, blush). Because of its design, the brush blends powdered make up evenly on the skin and creates a very natural looking coverage."
= = = St. Josaphat Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia = = =
St. Josaphat Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia is located in the Manayunk section of Northwest Philadelphia at 124 Cotton Street. This parish was merged with those of St. John the Baptist and St. Mary of the Assumption in 2012.
"The church was named in honor of Saint Josaphat, who was born circa 1580 as John Kuncevic in Vladimir, a village of the Lithuanian Province of Volhynia (then a part of the Polish Kingdom begun under the Jagiellonian dynasty), and who rose to increasing positions of authority within the church after professing his faith. Murdered in Vitebsk (Belarus) on November 12, 1623 while working to reunify the diocese he had been assigned to lead, he was declared ""Blessed"" by Pope Urban VIII in May 1643. He was then canonized as a saint on June 29, 1867 by Pope Pius IX and, on the tercentenary of his martyrdom (November 12, 1923) was declared by Pope Pius XI to be the heavenly Patron of Reunion between Orthodox and Catholics."" On November 25, 1963, during the Second Vatican Council, the remains of Saint Josaphat were officially laid to rest at the altar of St. Basil in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. This action was ordered by Pope John XXIII."
"St. Josaphat's parish was founded in 1898. According to historians at the Polish American Liturgical Center in Orchard Lake, Michigan:"
"""Polish Immigrants looking to better themselves financially, settled where there was more work. In the section of Philadelphia called Manayunk, there was a great need for workers in steel, wool and paper plants. Towards the end of the 19th Century near the Schuylkill River, there was a large steel plant under the name of American Bridge Co. later called Penncoyd Iron Works who employed many of these hard working Poles. The Poles living in Manayunk were very happy with their employment, but a little saddened by the fact that they had no Polish Church of their own to which they could go to and pray to God, to sing in their native tongue and to thank God for the graces given them. The nearest Polish Church which they attended was so many miles away, and travel in those days was hard, because the Mother Church, St. Laurentius, was located in the part of Philadelphia called 'Fishtown.'"
"Representatives of the Local Group appealed to the Diocesan Authorities for permission to establish a Polish Church for the Polish People. Archbishop Ryan in 1898 sent Rev. Mieczyslaus Kopytkiewicz to organize the Parish. The first services were held in St. John's Lower Church. (Incidentally, the services were held here also when the present new church was being built.)"""
"The Rev. Henry Chajencki was then placed in charge of the parish in December 1898. Under his leadership, church leaders paid $25,000 for the old Fourth Reformed Presbyterian Church building on the corner of Silverwood and Cotton, and also purchased ""a double home on Grape Street that served as a Rectory and later as a Convent"" as they worked to grow their number of parishioners. A 36-year-old in failing health, Father Chajencki died on Christmas Day in 1900, and was buried in St. John's Cemetery. The Rev. Dr. Thomas Misicki served briefly as the parish's pastor until the Rev. Benedict Tomiak could formally take charge of the post. All three men had been residents of Mt. Carmel, Pennsylvania."
"Father Tomiak, who had been ministering to the poor as a member of the Congregation of the Missionary Fathers of Saint Vincent de Paul when he was drafted into the military and sent to the front to nurse soldiers during the Franco-Prussian War, and had been ordained in 1893 at the age of 50 after resuming his studies in Rome post-war, had emigrated to America shortly thereafter. Following seven years of service in Shamokin and Mt. Carmel he was appointed to his position at St. Josaphat's on January 20, 1901. During his 11-year tenure, he launched a parish parochial school (soon after arriving) and invited the Bernardine Sisters in as faculty, and founded two orphanages (one in West Conshohocken and the other in his native Wolsztyn). As the parochial school's student population grew, the Bernardines were replaced by the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception from New Britain, Connecticut (c. 1905-1910) and then the Sisters of Nazareth (c. 1910-1911)."
"Following the aging Father Tomiak's transition to a new role as Chaplain of the Orphanage, the Rev. Paul Guzik arrived from Matopolska to take over Tomiak's role as head of the parish. Soon after beginning work, Guzik determined that the existing school building was no longer adequate, raised $40,000 to build a ""yellow brick eight-room school,"" and then invited the Bernardine Sisters to return as faculty before making the decision to return to Poland. He was succeeded in 1913 by the Rev. Joseph Poremba, of St. Casimir's Parish of Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. Both the school and the parish flourished under Poremba's leadership, which ended when he died suddenly from a heart attack in 1920. He was then succeeded in June of that year by the pastor of St. Stanislaus in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, Rev. Louis Stachowicz, who went on to lead St. Josaphat's for nearly four decades. Among his successes were the addition of 12 classrooms to the school building between 1927 and 1928, the launch of high school classes in 1939 (the first Polish pastor to achieve this milestone), the construction of a new, $130,000 rectory in 1949, and the construction of a new church building at the corner of Silverwood and Cotton streets with a spacious hall below the structure, which was dedicated on March 16, 1958 by the Most Reverend John F. O'Hara, C.S., D.D., Archbishop of Philadelphia."
"Following Father Stachowicz's death on February 10, 1960, the Rev. John Sielecki of St. Stanislaus Parish became the new parish head. Prior to his death on August 3, 1967, he was able to inspire his congregation to build a new convent for the sisters who served the parish and pay off the high school's tuition debt. Sielecki was then succeeded by another St. Stanislaus priest, the Rev. Paul A. Lambarksi, who immediately set to work improving the school's heating and lavatories after beginning work in October 1967. In short order, he was also actively engaged in preparing for the church's Diamond Jubilee (75th anniversary)."
"In 1973, St. Josaphat's became the fourth Polish parish in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia to celebrate its 75th anniversary Diamond Jubilee."
"On 23 October 2014, Connecting Sydney was announced as the preferred bidder. The contract was finalised in December 2014, when it was also announced that the consortium had been renamed ALTRAC Light Rail, and that the opening date had been brought forward to early 2019. The contract also included the operation and maintenance of the Inner West Light Rail from mid-2015."
"Major construction commenced on 23 October 2015, beginning in the section of George Street between King and Market Streets. To minimise disruption along the length of the corridor, works were staggered across 31 construction zones. The first section of track in the CBD was laid in December 2016, by which time a total of 410 metres of track had already been laid across the project. This increased to around 5 kilometres of track by May 2017. By October 2017, track installation reached the halfway mark, with 12,000 metres of track laid at 23 of the 31 zones along the alignment."
"The CBD and South East Light Rail required significant changes to the bus networks of the Sydney central business district and the Eastern Suburbs. Prior to construction of the light rail, Hillsbus and State Transit bus routes using George Street were permanently removed from the street. The network will be further redesigned when the light rail opens in 2020. Some bus routes from the Eastern Suburbs will be removed from the CBD, with many of the routes integrated with the light rail interchanges at Randwick and Kingsford. Some passengers will be required to change from bus to light rail to complete their journey."
"To accommodate construction of the light rail on George Street, new bus timetables were introduced on 4 October 2015. Buses were diverted from George Street on to other streets in the CBD, including Elizabeth, Castlereagh, Park, Druitt, Clarence and York Streets. Some routes had their terminus changed to such places as Railway Square, Queen Victoria Building and King Street Wharf. A small number of routes were either combined so that they run through the CBD without terminating, removed from the CBD entirely or completely discontinued."
"Construction suffered from significant delays. Major construction of the project was due to conclude in April 2018, though finishing works were to continue for some time after."
"Delays at two zones in the CBD were announced in August 2016. Originally meant to be completed before Christmas 2016, construction work at these zones was to continue for several months longer than originally anticipated. The zones were eventually opened around a year after the planned completion date. Further delays to the project arose during 2016."
"By the beginning of 2018 the whole project was significantly behind schedule. In March 2018 – one month before major works were originally due to be completed – the Transport Minister declined to put a date on when he expected construction of the line to be finished, but noted the government was ""an unhappy customer"" of the ALTRAC consortium."
The relationship between the New South Wales Government and Acciona Infrastructure – the construction company delivering the line – had deteriorated with a dispute arising between the parties over costs incurred from modifications to the line's design. Acciona commenced legal action against the government in April 2018. The company is seeking additional payments totalling $1.2 billion. Later in the month ALTRAC told the government it was working towards a completion date of March 2020.
"In October 2018, Acciona announced further delays to the project, stating that it would not be completed until May 2020."
"In June 2019, TfNSW and ALTRAC (including Acciona) reached an agreement to resolve their commercial issues and legal claims. As part of the agreement, the PPP was extended to 2036, with the government to pay up to $576 million over the duration of an extended PPP term, and ALTRAC shareholders to invest additional equity into the project to meet costs. The settlement package resolved over $1.5 billion of legal claims between TfNSW and ALTRAC, and Acciona withdrew its $1.1 billion legal misrepresentation claim against the government. The agreement also included milestone and incentive payments for light rail services to commence in two stages, with target start dates of December 2019 between Randwick and Circular Quay, and March 2020 between Kingsford and Circular Quay."
"Separate to the light rail budget, Randwick City Council earmarked $68 million to partially mitigate the impacts of the light rail. Projects include replacing some of the car parking spaces that were lost, especially in Kingsford, works to improve traffic flow in the district and public domain works."
"The City of Sydney planned to provide $220 million towards the light rail project. This would include money for public domain works on George Street and surrounding laneways. The centrepiece of these works was to be a large arch structure known as Cloud Arch located outside the Sydney Town Hall, however it was cancelled in late 2018 after cost blowouts. Cloud Arch would have acted as a gateway to the pedestrian section of George Street, with trams passing underneath it."
"In February 2018, testing of the line commenced on a short section of the Randwick branch along Alison Road. Testing along the rest of the Randwick branch and the main line to Circular Quay was achieved in August 2019, while the Kingsford branch, which will open three months later than the rest of the line, commenced testing in October 2019."
There have been criticism of the project from some parties:
"The first L2 passenger service between Circular Quay and Randwick commenced just after 10 AM on 14 December 2019. The opening weekend (14 and 15 December 2019) was fare-free, and 115,000 people used the new tram service during the opening weekend. The launch of the service on 14 December was interrupted by a tram which broke down at Circular Quay around 2:30 PM in the afternoon, within hours of the official opening ceremony. Services were restored by 3:30 PM."
"L3 passenger services between Circular Quay and Juniors Kingsford will commence in March 2020. In the interim until then, to maintain the frequency of light rail services in the CBD, L2 services run between Circular Quay and Central Chalmers Street. When the Kingsford branch opens, these services are expected to continue beyond Central Chalmers Street towards Juniors Kingsford as L3 services."
"The project's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) released in 2013 proposed a redesigned bus network in the CBD and the Eastern Suburbs. Some bus routes which were diverted from George Street to other streets during the construction, were proposed to terminate at Railway Square with their passengers to join the Light Rail while others will be rerouted permanently to the streets to which they were diverted. Twenty bus routes were proposed to be withdrawn or curtailed between Kingsford/Randwick and Railway Square/Circular Quay. A number of bus routes using Anzac Parade would unload city bound passengers at the Nine Ways (now Juniors Kingsford) interchange to board the light rail, then continue along Anzac Parade to the University of New South Wales to unload passengers before terminating in Todman Avenue, Kensington. Some bus routes that were currently operating to the city via Randwick would become feeder services that drop off city bound passengers at the light rail terminus."
The proposed changes for the Eastern Suburbs bus routes as per the EIS were as follows:
"Some bus changes had been made to bus routes in the list since 2013. For example, route 343 currently runs as a through route between Kingsford and Chatswood without terminating at the CBD, and UNSW routes had been reconfigured as bus routes 891, 893 and 898."
The final bus network will be announced in due time and changes to bus services will be implemented four to six weeks after the commencement of L3 Kingsford Line services in March 2020.
"As a member of the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium, Transdev will operate the line until the end of the PPP, set to end at 2036. Services on the Randwick branch are numbered L2 and services on the Kingsford branch are numbered L3."
"The service is operated by 60 five-section Alstom Citadis X05 trams operating in coupled pairs. The first was completed in May 2017, arriving at the Randwick depot on 28 July 2017."
"The line commences outside Circular Quay station heading west on Alfred Street, before proceeding south down George Street, then east via Rawson Place and Eddy Avenue, and south via Chalmers Street to Central station. It then continues east via Devonshire Street over the Eastern Distributor and under Moore Park and Anzac Parade via a tunnel before heading south via the former bus right of way. At the intersection of Anzac Parade and Alison Road the splits into two branches, L3 (to open in March 2020) continues down Anzac Parade to terminate outside the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club at Kingsford, and the L2 branch goes to Randwick via Alison Road, Wansey Road and High Street."

"The 1887–88 British Home Championship was the fifth edition of the annual international football tournament played between the British Home Nations. It was the first edition of the tournament in which Scotland did not at least share in the trophy and was also notable for a record flood of goals, 46 in six games, 26 of them conceded by Ireland, who suffered a disastrous competition."
"England began the tournament in the same vein as they finished it, winning the opening match 5–1 against Wales at the Alexandra Recreation Ground in Crewe. Wales responded to this, and to their shock defeat by Ireland the year previously with an 11–0 thrashing of the visiting Irish, a Welsh record scoreline which remains standing after nearly 120 years. Any hopes of a recovery for the Welsh were however dashed in their final game when Scotland administered a 5–1 beating in Edinburgh."
"England returned to the fray and gained revenge for their narrow defeat in the deciding match of the previous year when they in turn thrashed Scotland 5–0 in London, leaving only the weak Irish in between them and the trophy. Before this however, Ireland received another massive defeat at the hands of Scotland, who beat them 2–10 in Belfast to take second place. In the final game, England needed only a draw to secure the title but managed a win by five goals to one to take their first undisputed championship."

= = = Katanpää-class mine countermeasure vessel = = =
"""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are a class of three multipurpose mine countermeasure vessels (MCMV) ordered by the Finnish Navy. The nearly 250 million euro contract was awarded to the Italian shipyard Intermarine S.p.A. in 2006. Initially, all three vessels were scheduled to be delivered by 2014 and the class was expected to achieve operational readiness by 2015, but there have been various delays and the last vessel was handed over to the Finnish Navy in November 2016."
"The ""Katanpää"" class is expected to remain in service until 2040–2042."
"In its safety and defence policy report of 2004 the Finnish Government announced that, in addition to training mobile coastal troops and protecting sea traffic, the Finnish Navy would start focusing on developing its mine countermeasure capabilities. As a result a decision was made to retire the aging ""Kuha""-class minesweepers and invest in a new mine countermeasure fleet, which would include minehunters and -sweepers, divers and a new mine warfare information system."
"A request for bids was published on 5 June 2004 and by 3 January 2005 the Finnish Navy had received offers from seven shipyards, both domestic and foreign. After an extensive evaluation it was decided to continue negotiations with Intermarine S.p.A of Italy. Kockums AB of Sweden and Navantia SA from Spain. Aker Finnyards Oy (Finland), Armaris SA (France), Lürssen Werft GmbH and Abeking & Rasmussen GmbH (both German) were left out. In November 2006 the contract for three mine countermeasure vessels was awarded to the Italian shipyard Intermarine S.P.A. The total order worth was 244.8 million euros and it will include a spare parts package. About 50% of the total cost is contracted for Finnish companies and the shipbuilding contract includes a 100% offset agreement."
"The construction of the first vessel began in July 2007 with the ceremony of ""start of lamination"" which, for vessels built of composite materials, equals to the steel cutting ceremony. The construction of the second vessel was started in March 2008 and the third vessel in February 2009. The construction of the vessels was delayed by one year after the shipyard was devastated by a flood in early 2009. Two more floods occurred in late 2009, but the damage was not as extensive."
"The lead vessel of the class, ""Katanpää"", began its sea trials in March 2011, but due to additional delays it was not delivered until 4 May 2012. The vessel was shipped to Finland onboard BigLift heavy lift vessel ""Happy Dover"" which left Italy on 21 May. ""Katanpää"" was presented to the public in Helsinki on 9 July 2012, the 94th anniversary of the Finnish Navy. The second vessel, ""Purunpää"", was delivered to the Finnish Navy on 20 August 2013 and arrived in Turku onboard ""Happy Dynamic"" one month later. The third vessel, initially expected by 2015, was handed over to the Finnish Navy in November 2016 and will arrive in Finland in December."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are expected to remain in service until 2040-2042."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels were initially referred to as the MCMV 2010 class after the mine countermeasure development project and ""MITO class"" after the Finnish word for mine countermeasures, ""miinantorjunta"". As naval vessel classes of the Finnish Navy are traditionally named after the lead ship of the class, the new class of mine countermeasure vessels received its final name when the first vessel was named ""Katanpää"" (pennant number 40) on 16 June 2009. The second vessel of the ""Katanpää"" class received its name, ""Purunpää"" (41), on 26 September 2010 and the third one was named ""Vahterpää"" (42) on 3 November 2011."
"The vessels have been named after historical locations, Katanpää being an old island fortress and naval port outside Kustavi in Western Finland, Purunpää an old harbor site in Dragsfjärd and Vahterpää an old naval base outside Loviisa in the Gulf of Finland. The same names were also carried by three of the four BYMS class minesweepers operated by the Finnish Navy in the 1950s. For the new class of vessels, the Finnish Navy has adopted a new prefix ""MHC"" which stands for ""Mine Hunter Coastal""."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are constructed of laminated composite materials. They are long and have a beam of and a draft of . The hull, decks and bulkheads are made of fiberglass, which in places are up to thick. The decks are additionally reinforced with balsa and carbon fiber. This improves shock resistance against underwater explosions and reduces the vessels' magnetic, noise and pressure signatures that could detonate the mines. The low-signature diesel-electric propulsion system consists of two MTU 8V-396-TE74 high-speed diesel engines, each producing , and two Voith Schneider propellers. The ""Katanpää""-class vessels are designed to operate in archipelagoes, coastal regions and open seas, and are capable of operating in ice. They will have a service speed of and a maximum range of ."
"The ""Katanpää""-class vessels will be equipped with an extensive array of equipment to search for, locate and destroy naval mines, ranging from two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and two remotely operated vehicles (ROV) to hull-mounted sensors. The larger AUV, HUGIN (High Precision Untethered Geosurvey and Inspection system), which is manufactured by Kongsberg Maritime, is over four meters long and weighs over . It is equipped with a multibeam echosounder (MBES), a smaller version of the one mounted on the hull of the vessel. This instrument is used to collect topographic information of the seabed and a synthetic aperture side-scanning sonar can be used to detect and classify targets. The smaller AUV, REMUS 100 (Remote Environmental Monitoring Unit), weighs only and can be used to collect information of the sea floor with its side-scanning sonar at depths of up to 100 metres. Two ROVs, a Double Eagle by Saab Underwater Systems of Sweden and SeaFox I by Atlas Elektronik of Germany, can be used to identify and destroy naval mines. The hull-mounted sensors include a Kongsberg EM-710 RD multibeam echosounder and a TOPAS (Topographic Parametric Sonar) sediment echosounder with jets that can penetrate the uppermost strata of the seabed. In addition the vessels will be equipped with American-made Klein Associates Klein 5500 towed side-scanning sonars. Underwater positioning is provided with Kongsberg HiPAP 500 (High Precision Acoustic Positioning) system. The vessels follow a toolbox principle in which a suitable combination of sensors and equipment is selected individually for each mission according to the task and environmental conditions."
"Each vessel of the ""Katanpää"" class is equipped with a Bofors 40 mm L/70 gun for self-defence. The fire control is provided by Atlas Elektronik and the integrated system utilizes EOTS TV/IR multisensors. The system can be controlled from either one of five consoles in the combat information center or from the bridge, although only one console is equipped with the pedals required to control the gun. In addition the vessels are armed with depth charges."

"In 1980, the North Coast rivers were incorporated into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system, effectively eliminating the possibility of any projects to divert them."
"The Peripheral Canal, which since 2015 has been called the California WaterFix, was a planned twin tunnel project that would extend through the center of the Delta, below ground. Earlier designs called for a canal to skirt the Delta to the east, hence its name. It would have drawn water from the Sacramento River to bypass the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, a vast estuary and agricultural region consisting of over of tidal waterways. Supporters of the canal included the Central Valley farmers and the Metropolitan Water District and urban developers in Los Angeles who are beneficiaries of the water. Supporters claimed it would eliminate the need to pull water directly through this sensitive region, reducing salinity intrusion and water quality problems during the dry season. The canal was included in the initial SWP planning, and the lack of the canal is among the principal reasons the SWP has never been able to deliver its full entitlement."
"Opponents to the canal believe the construction project would do extensive damage to the sensitive Delta ecosystem, farms and communities. Opponents also believe there will be long-term damage to the Delta ecosystem from fresh water being removed prior to flushing through the Delta and flowing more naturally to the San Francisco Bay."
"Governor Jerry Brown had supported a ballot initiative in the early 1980s and has stated his intention to finish this project during his current governorship. Supporters of the canal have a strong argument as water being drawn from the southern intakes create problems for wildlife and changes the natural flow in these areas which would be corrected by drawing water further north. Supporters also claim that the California levees are also vulnerable to earthquakes and directing water away from them protects the supply of water. Delta farmers, communities, and commercial salmon and bass fishermen are especially concerned about the canal. However, Delta scientists disagree. The new proposed canal would transport of water to Silicon Valley, southern California and the majority of it would be directed to the Central Valley, a location with political influence and interest in the canal being built."
"Since the 1980s, there has been interest in creating a large off-stream reservoir in the Sacramento Valley. Water ""skimmed"" off high winter flows in the Sacramento River would be pumped into a storage basin in the western side of the valley known as Sites Reservoir. The reservoir would hold about of water to be released into the Sacramento River during low-flow periods, boosting the water supply available for SWP entitlement holders and improving water quality in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. This project has previously arisen in several forms, including proposals for a Glenn Reservoir or the Glenn-Colusa Complex on nearby streams, which would also have been receiving reservoirs for water sent east through the Dos Rios Project's Grindstone Tunnel or other transfers from North Coast rivers."
"With its large storage capacity, Sites Reservoir would increase the production and flexibility of California's water management system, yielding of new water per year. This project is being seriously considered by the Department of Water Resources, as California's water system is expected to face serious shortfalls of per year by 2020. However, the project has been criticized for its high cost, and potential disruption of fish migration when large amounts of water are drawn from the Sacramento River during the wet season."
"The Los Banos Grandes reservoir was first proposed in 1983 and would have served a similar purpose to Sites. The reservoir would have been located along the California Aqueduct several miles south of San Luis Reservoir, and would have allowed for the storage of water during wet years when extra water could be pumped from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. Pumped-storage hydroelectric plants would have been built between Los Banos Grandes and the existing Los Banos flood control reservoir, and between that reservoir and the aqueduct. The current status of Los Banos Grandes remains uncertain, as the DWR has been unable to appropriate funding since the 1990s."
"The existing SWP facilities are collectively known as Stage I. Stage II, which includes such works as the Peripheral Canal and Sites Reservoir, was to have been built beginning in the late 1970s and 1980s – but due to concerted opposition from Northern Californians, environmentalist groups and some economic interests, as well as the state's increasing debt, attempts to begin construction have all met with failure. Parties currently receiving SWP water are also opposed to its expansion, because water rates could be raised up to 300 percent to help pay for the cost. As a result, SWP capacity falls short by an average of each year; contractors only occasionally receive their full shares of water."
"The disparity of costs to the project's various constituents has been a frequent source of controversy. Although the overall average cost of SWP water is $147 per acre-foot ($119 per 1,000 m), agricultural users pay far less than their urban counterparts for SWP water. The Kern County Water Agency (the second largest SWP entitlement holder) pays around $45–50 per acre-foot ($36–41 per 1,000 m) of SWP water, which is mostly used for irrigation. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (the largest entitlement holder) pays $298 per acre-foot ($241 per 1,000 m). This basically means that cities are subsidizing the cost of farm water, even though the cities also provided primary funding for the construction of the SWP."
"In the early 1970s, the SWP system still had a lot of ""surplus"" – water supply developed through the construction of Oroville Dam, which was running unused to the Pacific Ocean because the water delivery infrastructure for Southern California had not yet been completed (and when it was, southern California was slow to use the water). The surplus water was given for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley instead. Because the water would only be a temporary supply, farmers were advised to use it for seasonal crops (such as alfalfa or hay) rather than permanent crops such as orchards. Nevertheless, many farmers used the water to develop new permanent crops, creating a dependency on SWP water that is technically part of Southern California's entitlement, This is now causing tensions as Southern California continues to increase its use of SWP water, decreasing the amount of surplus available to the system, especially in years of drought."
"In dry years, water pumped from the Delta creates a hazard to spring-run salmon. As the Banks Pumping Plant pulls water from the Sacramento River southward across the Delta, it disrupts the normal flow direction of east to west that salmon smolt follow to the Pacific Ocean. Populations of salmon and steelhead trout have reached critically low levels in the decades after SWP water withdrawals began. The fish migration issue has become hotly contested in recent years, with rising support for the construction of the Peripheral Canal, which would divert water around the Delta, restoring the natural flow direction."
Water use and environmental problems associated with the SWP led to the creation of the CALFED Bay-Delta Program (CALFED) in 1994. The primary goals are to improve quality of SWP water while preventing further ecological damage in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta.
"In January 2014, after the moderately dry year of 2012 and the record California drought of 2013, the Department of Water Resources announced that the SWP would be making zero deliveries that year, the first time in the project's history, due to dangerously low snowpack and reservoir levels. On April 18, 2014, the Department of Water Resources increased the SWP allocation back to five percent and that level remained until the initial allocation for 2015 was give on December 1, 2014."

"Robert Eugene Bass (January 28, 1929 – August 17, 2018) was an American basketball coach and executive who worked in college basketball, the American Basketball Association (ABA), and the National Basketball Association (NBA)."
Bass graduated from Oklahoma Baptist University and has a master's degree from the University of Oklahoma.
"Bass' professional coaching career started with the ABA's Denver Rockets (now the Denver Nuggets) in 1967, which he coached for two years. He coached college basketball at Texas Tech for a season-and-a-half from 1969 to 1971. He coached The Floridians of the ABA for two years before the team folded at the end of the 1972 season. The next season, he coached the Memphis Tams; and, at the beginning of the 1974/75 season, Bass was hired by the ABA's San Antonio Spurs, which he coached for nearly two seasons, until the franchise moved into the NBA in 1976 as part of the ABA–NBA merger."
"At that point, Bass moved into the Spurs' front office, assuming the role of general manager. He would, over the years with the team, assume coaching duties on an interim basis as needed—in 1980, 1984, and 1992. He finished his coaching career with a 311-300 record. At the conclusion of the 1989/90 season, Bass won the NBA Executive of the Year Award. Bass would then take a general manager position with the Charlotte Hornets in 1995; in that capacity, he would win the award again in 1997. Bass retired in 2004 (by which time the Hornets had relocated to New Orleans."
"Bass served as the head basketball coach at Oklahoma Baptist for 15 years and was named the NAIA Coach of the Year in 1967. In 1966, his team won the NAIA national title."
Bass was hired as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders replacing Gene Gibson. Bass cited a challenge to return to the college game and a distaste for the long pro season and its demands on his time away from family for accepting the position of head coach at Texas Tech.
"In his first season, the Red Raiders posted a 14–10 record under Bass and finished third in the Southwest Conference (SWC) regular season standings. The 1969–70 team posted the first winning season for the Red Raiders in four years."
"On January 15, 1971, Bass resigned to take the same position with The Floridians of the American Basketball Association after coaching the first 13 games of the 1970–71 Red Raiders season. The following day, Bass coach The Floridians to a 123–119 win over the Utah Stars in Miami. Former Red Raiders player and first-year assistant coach Gerald Myers was named interim head coach for the remainder of the season."

"The first inhabitants of what is now Béjar were the Vettones who settled an area to the south of the city now known as ""La Antigua"" around 400 BC. The city formed part of Roman Hispania in the beginning of the 1st century BC. In AD 713, the city was taken by Muslim Berbers (Moors) from the Visigoths and in the 11th century it was conquered by King Alfonso VI of Castile. Following this, the walls, part of which still stands, are constructed to repel frequent Arab incursions that took place until the definitive conquest."
The city was later the center of the Duchy of Béjar ruled by the powerful House of Zúñiga.
"The name ""Béjar"" is of pre-Roman origin. The original form was ""Bigerra"" and is said to mean ""place of the beehives."" ""Béjar"" could be an adaption from the Spanish word ""abeja"", which means ""bee."" An older spelling of the city's name is ""Béxar"". In medieval documents, ""Vexar"" is found also."

= = = Major Dundee = = =
"Major Dundee is a 1965 Western film directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Charlton Heston, Richard Harris, Jim Hutton, and James Coburn. Written by Harry Julian Fink, the film is about a Union cavalry officer who leads a contentious troop of Army regulars, Confederate prisoners, and Indian scouts on an expedition into Mexico during the American Civil War in order to destroy a band of Apaches who have been raiding United States bases and settlements in the New Mexico territory. ""Major Dundee"" was filmed in various locations in Mexico. The movie was filmed in Eastman Color by Pathécolor, print by Technicolor."
"During the American Civil War, Union cavalry officer Major Amos Dundee (Charlton Heston) has been relieved of his command for an unspecified tactical error at the Battle of Gettysburg (it is implied that he showed too much initiative) and sent to head a prisoner-of-war camp in the New Mexico Territory. After a family of ranchers and a relief column of cavalry are massacred by an Apache war chief named Sierra Charriba (Michael Pate), Dundee, seizes the opportunity for glory, sends out his scout Samuel Potts (James Coburn) to locate Charriba and begins raising his own private army. He attempts to recruit Confederate prisoners led by his former friend turned rival from West Point, Captain Ben Tyreen (Richard Harris). Tyreen bears a grudge against Dundee and refuses his request. Before the war, Dundee cast the deciding vote in Tyreen's court-martial from the U.S. Army prior to the American Civil War for participating in a duel, leading to Tyreen's dismissal from the service and his later becoming an officer in the Confederate Army."
"Dundee begins building his army. Among them are Tim Ryan (Michael Anderson Jr.) who is the only survivor of the massacre, as well as a horse thief, a drunken mule-packer, a vengeful minister, and a small group of black soldiers who were formerly slaves. Dundee reluctantly appoints the inexperienced Lieutenant Graham (Jim Hutton) as his second in command. Eventually, Tyreen changes his mind and accepts Dundee's offer. He binds himself and his men to loyally serve Dundee, but only until Charriba is ""taken or destroyed."""
"When the diverse factions of Dundee's force are not fighting each other, they engage the Apaches in several bloody battles. Though they rescue several young children captured by the Apaches, the Americans lose most of their supplies in an ambush, forcing them to raid a village garrisoned by French troops supporting Emperor Maximilian of Mexico. However, there is little to loot, and Dundee ends up sharing some of his dwindling food with the starving Mexicans. Beautiful resident Teresa Santiago (Senta Berger), the Austrian widow of a doctor executed for his support of the rebels under Benito Juárez, causes further tensions between Dundee and Tyreen as they compete for her attention. Dundee makes it easy for his French prisoners to escape. When they return with reinforcements as he had expected, Dundee surprises them in a night attack and makes off with badly needed supplies. After the successful raid, the men of the command begin to get along. However, one of the Confederates, O.W. Hadley (Warren Oates) attempts to desert. Dundee is forced to order his execution, which again divides the men."
"Teresa and Dundee then have a brief affair. In an unguarded moment with her, he is attacked by the Apaches and wounded in the leg, forcing him to seek medical help in French-held Durango. The doctor successfully removes the arrow, but Dundee has to remain there to recuperate. He is tended by a pretty Mexican, whom he eventually takes to bed. When Teresa comes upon them unexpectedly, her relationship with Dundee comes to an abrupt end. Dundee starts drinking heavily as a result. Graham leads a small group of men to sneak into town to distract the French while Tyreen shames Dundee into resuming his mission."
"Charriba proves difficult to pin down, so Dundee pretends to give up and starts back for the United States. The Apaches give chase and end up in a trap. Charriba is killed by Ryan during the ambush. With their bargain concluded, Dundee and Tyreen prepare to resume their personal battle, but the vengeful French appear, forcing the two men to set aside their differences. With the French having positioned a portion of their force on the American side of the Rio Grande, blocking Dundee's forces from crossing into U.S. territory, the two cavalry forces charge each other at the Rio Grande, with major loss of life on both sides."
"Tyreen sees a French soldier seize the U.S. regimental colors, and seemingly moved by a patriotism he had thought dead, he takes back the captured American flag, and hands it over to Dundee – only to be shot in the stomach. With his last strength, he rides off to singlehandedly delay a second detachment of French cavalry while the others escape across the Rio Grande. Most of the men under Dundee's command have been killed, with only himself, Graham, Potts, Ryan, Sergeant Gomez, the Confederates Chillum and Benteen, and a few other soldiers escaping."
"As Dundee's force heads home, the narration notes that it's now April 19, 1865, and the soldiers are still unaware that the Civil War is over and President Lincoln has been assassinated."
"The screenplay, by Harry Julian Fink, Oscar Saul, and Peckinpah, was loosely based on historical precedents. However, contrary to claims by the production team at the time, it was not actually based on a true story. The film's novelization was written by Richard Wormser. During the Minnesota Dakota War of 1862, Union forces in that state were forced to recruit Confederate prisoners from Texas to make up for their meager numbers in fighting the Indians. Unlike the movie, where there is much animosity between the Union and Confederate troops in Dundee's command, the rebels, called ""Galvanized Yankees"", fought well and without much complaint. Both Union and Confederate forces also battled Apache, Navajo, and Comanche Indians throughout the war along the U.S.-Mexico border, making the scenario of the movie at least somewhat plausible. Before the film's production, Peckinpah had been working on a Custer project, based on the novel by Hoffman Birney ""The Dice of God"", but later abandoned it for this film. (His screenplay was filmed by Arnold Laven, as ""The Glory Guys"")."
"Critics of the film have also pointed out similarities between this and Herman Melville's classic novel ""Moby-Dick"". Many of the characters are similar to those from that book, with Dundee as Captain Ahab, Tyreen as Starbuck, Ryan as Ishmael, and other minor characters, with Sierra Charriba and his Apache tribe substituting for the whale, as is the general plot line (an obsessive idealist drives himself to destruction, disregarding the effects on others). These references to ""Moby-Dick"" were likely intentional on the part of the screenwriters. Some have also pointed out similarities of the plot to the Vietnam War, which are highly unlikely to have been intentional, as the war had not significantly escalated at the time of the film's production."
"The opening scene at the Rostes Ranch and the funeral after the first skirmish with the Indians were inspired by scenes from ""The Searchers"", while the scene in which Dundee's troop exits Fort Benlin, each faction of the command singing its own distinct song, is a deliberate parody of an equivalent scene in ""Fort Apache"". The characterization of Dundee, particularly his personality as a martinet and his relationship with Tyreen, has been related to John Wayne's character in Howard Hawks' ""Red River"". The Mexican Civil War setting recalls Robert Aldrich's ""Vera Cruz"". The film also includes several references to David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" – the execution of Hadley, and Dundee's drunken exile in Durango, closely mirror sequences from this film."
"The film ""seems a direct reaction to [John] Ford's ""Fort Apache"" ... with Charlton Heston cast as a more psychotic, more bluntly careerist version of Ford's Lt. Col. Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda),"" according to a NY ""Times"" review of the film at the time of the 2013 Blu-ray release. Reviewer Dave Kehr went on to write that Peckinpah ""plays Heston's square-jawed intransigence against the aristocratic refinement of a Southern officer (overplayed by ... Harris)"" and that Peckinpah ""would essentially reshape this material into ""The Wild Bunch"" four years later, wisely dividing Dundee's divided character into two separate figures"" played then by Robert Ryan and William Holden."
"Peckinpah found the script in late 1963. The early draft by Fink focused on Trooper Ryan and presented the film as a typical adventure story. Peckinpah largely discarded this, and working closely with acclaimed screenwriter, Oscar Saul (""A Streetcar Named Desire"") began making the movie into a complex character study about Dundee, making him a glory-hungry officer who would do anything to gain fame and recognition. He had the support of Heston, who had seen and enjoyed Peckinpah's previous film, ""Ride the High Country"", and was eager to work with the director. Actor R.G. Armstrong, who had a small part as a Reverend who tags along with the expedition, referred to the 156 minutes version of the film as """"Moby-Dick"" on horseback""."
"The production of the movie was very troubled. Peckinpah was often drunk on the set, and was supposedly so abusive towards the cast that Heston had to threaten him with a cavalry saber in order to calm him down: he even charged Peckinpah on horseback at one point, leading the director to panic and order the camera crane he was working on to be raised fast. Peckinpah also fired a large number of crew members for very trivial reasons throughout the shoot. Columbia studio executives feared that the project was out of control, and that Peckinpah was too unstable to finish the picture, so they cut the shooting schedule of the film by several weeks. Heston gave up his entire salary for the film in order to keep Peckinpah on the project – a gesture rarely equaled in Hollywood history. The studio, however, forced Peckinpah to wrap up shooting very abruptly. Heston alleged that Peckinpah, towards the end of the shoot, simply became drunk and wandered off the set, and that he (Heston) had to finish directing many portions of the movie himself."
"The length of Peckinpah's original cut has been disputed. According to some sources, including the 2005 DVD commentary, the original cut was 4 hours 38 minutes long, which was initially edited down to 156 minutes. Included in the unseen longer cuts were several slow-motion battle scenes inspired by Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"". The movie was also fairly gory for the standards of 1965, and more bloody and violent scenes were cut out. A bombastic musical score by Daniele Amfitheatrof was added to the film despite Peckinpah's protests, as was the title song, ""The Major Dundee March"", sung by Mitch Miller and his Sing-Along Gang. One of the most bizarre parts of the score was the use of an electronically altered sound – three anvils of different lengths played-back at half-speed every time Charriba or the Apaches would be seen or even mentioned. ""Until the Apache is taken or destroyed"" was one of the film's catch phrases."
"At the film's initial release, it was 136 minutes long. After a disastrous premiere – the movie was almost universally panned by critics – an additional thirteen minutes were cut out, despite the protests of Peckinpah and producer Jerry Bresler. Some feel that these cuts ruined the movie's scope and created significant plot holes, though others argue that these plot holes exist even in the extended version."
"""Major Dundee"" helped cement Peckinpah's image as a renegade filmmaker, which he would enhance with the conflicts on his later films, such as ""Straw Dogs"", ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"", and ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"". Others, namely Peckinpah's biographer David Weddle (author of ""If They Move ... Kill 'Em! The Life and Times of Sam Peckinpah""), argue that Peckinpah is just as much to blame for the final product as Columbia and Jerry Bresler. Since its release on DVD, ""Dundee"" has begun to get recognition and notice from the public at large, and not just Western fans."

"The House of Israel is a Jewish community located in Sefwi Wiawso in southwestern Ghana. This group of people, of the Sefwi tribe, built a synagogue in 1998. Many of the men and children read English, but no one knows Hebrew."
"The people of Sefwi Wiawso trace a call for a ""return"" to normative Judaism by Aaron Ahomtre Toakyirafa, a community leader who, in 1976, is said to have had a vision. In 2012, Gabrielle Zilkha, a Toronto-based filmmaker, visited Sefwe Wiawso to do research for a documentary about the House of Israel she is making. According to Zilkha, about 200 people--mostly children--live in the community. She states that the lack of a historical record makes it difficult to verify the groups claims, but that there is an oral tradition dating back 200 years."
"The leader of the House of Israel since 1993, David Ahenkorah received his own vision in taking up the mantle. He has been granted a 40-acre plot of land to build a Jewish school for the community, but they have not yet been able to raise funds for construction. Children currently attend a local school, run by Christians. They built a synagogue in 1998 in New Adiembra, a Jewish neighborhood in Sefri Wiawso. Recently, they painted it blue and white, the colors of Israel. There are several family compounds nearby and about 200 people belong to the synagogue."

= = = Itsekiri people = = =
"The Itsekiri (also called the Isekiri, ""iJekri"", ""Itsekri"", ""Ishekiri"", or Itsekhiri) are an ethnic group of Nigeria's Niger Delta area, Delta State. The Itsekiri presently number just under 1 million people and live mainly in the Warri South, Warri North and Warri South West local government districts of Delta State on the Atlantic coast of Nigeria. Significant communities of Itsekiris can be found in parts of Edo and Ondo states and in various other Nigerian cities including Lagos, Sapele, Benin City, Port Harcourt and Abuja. Many people of Itsekiri descent also reside in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.The Itsekiris are closely related to the Yoruba of South Western Nigeria and more widely to the Urhobo (especially the Okpe) and Edo peoples."
The Itsekiris traditionally refer to their land as the Kingdom of Warri or 'Iwerre' as its proper name – which is geographically contiguous to the area covered by the three Warri local government districts. The area is a key centre of Nigeria's crude oil and natural gas production and petroleum refining and the main town Warri (a multi-ethnic metropolis) forms the industrial and commercial nucleus of the Delta State region.
"The Itsekiri are a people of very mixed ethnic origins who speak a language very closely related to the Yoruba of south western Nigeria and the Igala language of central Nigeria but which has also borrowed some cultural practice from the Edo people of Benin City, given the hegemony that the Benin Empire once exercised over the area, Portuguese in trade terminologies, as the Itsekiri were the first people in Nigeria to establish contact with the Portuguese who were exploring the West African coast, and also more recently, English. Although linguistically related to the Yoruba and Igala ethnic groups, however, through centuries of intermingling modern day Itsekiris are of mixed ethnic origins. They are most closely related to the South-Eastern Yorubaland sub-groups - Ijebu, Akure, Ikale, Ondo and Owo), but also Edo, Urhobo, Ijaw are today mainly Christian (Protestant and Roman Catholic) by religion."
"Thus having had six centuries of direct cultural exposure to Western Christianity and other African influences, contemporary Itsekiri language and culture has successfully evolved into a hybrid of the many cultures that have influenced its development. Similarly owing to the complex genetic mix of most Itsekiris over the centuries, many individuals self-identifying as Itsekiri would usually be a complex mix of any of the aforementioned ethnic and racial groups. Thus modern day Itsekiris may be the only southern Nigerian ethnic group to be almost totally heterogeneous (mixed) in its genetic composition. The total absence of any dialectal variation in the Itsekiri language is also unique for the region and is most likely the result of the early coalescing of the Itsekiri people into a small and highly centralised nation state from the 15th century onward."
"In the 15th century, the early Itsekiris adopted a prince Ginuwa (also called ""Iginuwa"" in Bini Language) from the Kingdom of Benin as a monarch, and quickly coalesced into a kingdom under his rule. Traditionally fishermen and traders, the Itsekiri were among the first in the region to make contact with Portuguese traders. These interactions in the 16th century led the Itsekiri to become primarily Roman Catholic."
"The Itsekiri monarchy has continued to the present day, with the coronation of Ogiame Ikenwoli on 12 December in 2015. The Itsekiri's historical capital is Ode-Itsekiri (also called ""big warri"" or ""Ale iwerre""), though the monarch's main palace is in Warri town the largest city in the area and home to diverse other communities including the Urhobos, Ijaws, Isoko, and many other Nigerian and expatriate groups working in the oil and gas industry."
"The Itsekiri, though a minority group within Nigeria, are considered to be a highly educated and affluent ethnic group with a very high rate of literacy and a rich cultural heritage. The Itsekiris have one of the oldest histories of western education in West Africa, and are noted for producing one of its earliest university graduates – the Olu of Warri Kingdom, Olu Atuwatse I, Dom Domingo a 17th-century graduate of Coimbra University in Portugal. Today, many Itsekiris can be found working in the professions particularly medicine, law and the academic professions and in business, trade and industry and were among the pioneers that led the development of the professions in Nigeria during the early-to-mid 20th century ."
The Itsekiris traditionally lived in a society that was governed by a monarchy (the Olu) and council of chiefs who form the nobility or aristocracy. Itsekiri society itself was organised along the lines of an upper class made up of the royal family and the aristocracy – the 'Oloyes and Olareajas' these were mainly drawn from noble houses including the Royal Houses and the Houses of Olgbotsere (Prime Minister or king maker) and Iyatsere (defence minister). The middle class or Omajaja were free-born Itsekiris or burghers. As a result of the institution of slavery and the slave trade there was a third class 'Oton-Eru' or those descended from the slave class whose ancestors had come from elsewhere and settled in Itsekiriland as indentured or slave labourers. In modern-day Itsekiri society the slave class no longer exists as all are considered free-born.
"Traditionally, Itsekiri men wear a long sleeved shirt called a Kemeje, tie a George wrapper around their waist and wear a hat with a feather stuck to it. The women wear a blouse and also tie a George wrapper around their waist. They wear colourful head gears known as Nes (scarf) or coral beads. Itsekiris are also famed for their traditional fishing skills, melodious songs, gracefully fluid traditional dances and colourful masquerades and boat regattas."
"Before the introduction of Christianity in the 16th century, like many other African groups, the Itsekiris largely followed a traditional form of religion known as Ebura-tsitse (based on ancestral worship) which has become embedded in modern-day traditional Itsekiri culture. Once the dominant form of western Christianity in Itsekiriland for centuries, only a minority of Itsekiris are Roman Catholics today whilst the majority are Protestants notably Baptist and Anglican."
"Whilst genetically, the Itsekiris are a complex mixture of the many different ethnicities and races that have settled in their area, however, the Itsekiri language is very closely related to the Ilaje and other south-eastern Yoruba dialects and to the Igala. It has also been influenced significantly by the Bini, Portuguese and English languages due to centuries of interaction with people from those nations. However, it remains a key branch of the Yoruboid family of languages even retaining archaic or lost elements of the proto Yoruba language due to its relative isolation in the Niger-Delta where it developed away from the main cluster of Yoruba language dialects."
"Unlike nearly all key Nigerian Languages, the Itsekiri language does not have dialects and is uniformly spoken with little or no variance in pronunciation apart from the use of 'ch' for the regular 'ts' (sh) in the pronunciation of some individual Itsekiris, e.g. Chekiri instead of the standard Shekiri but these are individual pronunciation traits rather than dialectal differences. This may be a relic of past dialectal differences. The English language continues to exert a strong influence on the Itsekiri language both in influencing its development and in its widespread usage as a first language amongst the younger generation. Modern standard Yoruba (the variety spoken in Lagos) also appears to be influencing the Itsekiri language partly due to the similarity between both languages and the ease of absorbing colloquial Yoruba terms by the large Itsekiri population living in Western Nigerian cities. Itsekiri is now taught in local schools up to university degree level in Nigeria."
"There are a number of semi-autonomous Itsekiri communities such as Ugborodo, koko, Omadino and Obodo whose history predates the 15th-century establishment of the Warri Kingdom. The Ugborodo community claims direct descent from the Ijebu a major Yoruba sub-ethnic group"
"The half-pass requires more balance, engagement, and collection from a horse than the leg-yield. This is because the horse is slightly bent in the direction of movement in the half-pass. In the leg-yield, the horse is fairly straight or looking slightly away from the direction of travel."
"The half-pass is a schooling movement that requires the horse to engage the hindquarters and increase its impulsion, it can therefore be used to improve both collection or impulsion. The half-pass is commonly seen in dressage tests beginning at the United States Dressage Federation third level."
"The half-pass is usually taught after the haunches-in is well confirmed. It may first be introduced by riding a half-10-meter circle from the long side to the centerline, or a half-volte, and then half-passing in. The circle naturally places the horse's body in the correct bend, and helps to encourage the engagement needed for the movement. The outside hind leg must step well under the horse's body to push the animal forward and sideways. A rider uses an active outside leg slightly behind the neutral position to ask the horse to step forward and under. The outside rein maintains the correct bend and contains the energy of the horse, the inside leg keeps the horse moving forward, and the inside rein guides the forehand in the direction of movement. The rider also uses his or her inside seat bone to help maintain bend. If the rider is off-center or twisted, the horse will also be crooked or off-balance."
"If the horse loses quality in the movement, such as lack of correct bend (haunches leading or inside shoulder falling inward), loss of rhythm, or stiffness, the rider straightens the horse and rides forward."
The beginning and the end of the movement needs special attention concerning control and balance.

"Bellingham International Airport is three miles (5 km) northwest of Bellingham, in Whatcom County, Washington, and the third-largest commercial airport in Washington. BLI covers 2,190 acres (886 ha) of land."
"Bellingham is well known as a low-fare alternative airport to the Vancouver International Airport, and an estimated 65% of customers come from Canada. It is only from downtown Vancouver, and only from the Canadian border, where Greater Vancouver starts. On the Allegiant website the airport is referred to as Bellingham/Vancouver."
"The newly constructed gate area has five gates, a coffee shop and a restaurant with a bar. The second phase of the terminal expansion will add a baggage carousel in addition to larger ticketing and pre-security areas for passengers, should have been completed in phases beginning in 2012 and with completion expected by 2015."
"In 1936 Whatcom County obtained for an airport at the current airport site. Three runways were planned, but it took almost four years to get the first 5000' x 150' runway cleared and paved. Temporary Port of Entry status was secured early, but the slow construction left it in a continually tenuous state – United Airlines would only base there if the field were safe enough for their DC-3s, and it maintained its Port of Entry status. Ultimately they built a terminal, designed by F. Stanley Piper, and the airport was dedicated in 1940, having employed more than 500 people."
"In 1940 the United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the facility and expanded it to three full runways, revetments for parking aircraft, and development of personnel quarters. During World War II the airport was used by Fourth Air Force immediately after the Pearl Harbor Attack for air defense of the Pacific Coast. It was later used by Air Transport Command and Air Technical Service Command as an intermediate ferrying field for Lend-Lease aircraft being flown to Alaska for subsequent transfer to the Soviet Union."
"The United States Army Air Forces closed the facility in September 1946, and it was turned over to the War Assets Administration for disposal. It slowly was returned to Whatcom County and was redeveloped as a civil airport in the late 1940s. With the rising costs and need for repairs, Whatcom county sold the Airport to the Port of Bellingham for one dollar in 1957. Because of costs, the Port of Bellingham could only resurface the longest of the runways (16/34). 16/34 is still the only runway used as it provides adequate year-round wind coverage for aircraft servicing Bellingham. The two diagonal runways have fallen into disrepair, their easternmost ends used as taxiways between tarmacs and the sole remaining runway."
"Airline service from Bellingham had a modest beginning. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Harbor Airlines, a commuter air carrier based in Washington, operated nonstop shuttle service to Seattle/Tacoma International Airport with small Britten-Norman Islander twin prop aircraft. By the mid 1980s, Harbor Air had been replaced by San Juan Airlines, a commuter air carrier based in Bellingham which operated shuttle flights to Seattle/Tacoma with Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante turboprops and Cessna 402 prop aircraft. San Juan Airlines continues to serve the airport at the present time."
"In 1985 Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) initiated Bellingham's first passenger jet service with McDonnell Douglas MD-80s direct to Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco with all PSA flights including a stop at Seattle/Tacoma. PSA was acquired by USAir which continued to serve Bellingham with Boeing 737-300s. Alaska Airlines introduced MD-80 jets in the late 1980s, competing with USAir with both airlines operating nonstop jet service to Seattle/Tacoma and direct one stop service to other destinations. USAir then changed its name to US Airways and eventually merged with American Airlines in 2015; however, by the early 1990s, USAir had ceased serving Bellingham. During the late 1980s, Alaska Airlines was joined by Horizon Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Alaska Air Group, with this regional airline flying nonstop service with turboprops to Seattle/Tacoma. Aircraft operated by Horizon Air into the airport over the years included such propjets as the Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner, the de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 and the Dornier 328. Horizon Air, which currently operates flights for Alaska Airlines, continues to serve Bellingham at the present time with nonstop service to Seattle/Tacoma flown with the Bombardier Q400 turboprop which is the largest and fastest member of the Dash 8 regional airliner family. Commencing in the late 1980s, United Express was serving the airport with nonstop flights to Seattle/Tacoma on behalf of United Airlines via code sharing agreements with the respective operating air carriers. North Pacific Airlines operated the first United Express flights into Bellingham with British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 propjets and were followed by SkyWest Airlines flying as United Express with Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops. United Express no longer serves Bellingham."
In the 1990s homes were purchased to extend the runway in an effort to attract air carriers. The assumption is that there would not be a third runway at Sea-Tac airport. The airport has seen a high turnover rate.
"In September 2010 the airport completed a $26 million resurfacing of the runway to allow aircraft up to the size of Boeing 757s. This project was completed to enable Allegiant Air to operate Boeing 757-200 service nonstop to Hawaii, although this service has since ended. The largest aircraft currently serving Bellingham as of July 2019 are Allegiant Air's Airbus A320 aircraft flying to several destinations on the West Coast."
The airport is expanding the terminal building from . The first phase is complete with a new gate area completed and temporary portable waiting areas removed. The second phase started in 2012 and reach completion by 2015 and will expand the pre-security areas of the airport including the addition of a baggage carousel for arriving passengers. The cost of the expansion to the terminal building is covered by surcharges from passengers and parking fees.
"The current terminal building was built in two phases. The first phase was completed in 1980. The second phase, or the expansion phase, was constructed because of increased passenger volumes and the arrival of new air carriers. In 1985, a separate International Terminal was built to the south in order to accommodate the Federal Inspection Services necessary for international travelers to access the United States; it is connected to the main terminal through a covered walkway. The main terminal is approximately 26,000 square feet and includes three levels, the basement, the ground floor, and the second floor. The basement houses a small storage facility; the ground floor is where the entire passenger processing area is held, and the second floor contains office space. There is one concession stand: Halibut Henry's store where light snacks, coffee drinks, gifts, and sundries are offered. The International Terminal is a one-level building consisting of 4,222 square feet. It serves several functions including the housing of the Federal Inspection Service, FIS offices, and the storage of BLI's Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting equipment."
The early 21st century saw rapid expansion at the Bellingham International Airport from several air carriers operating mainline jet aircraft with these airlines being motivated by the potential passenger loads from lower mainland British Columbia in Canada. Allegiant's commitment to the airport has led to a rapid rise in passenger numbers and the introduction of a number of nonstop destinations served from Bellingham. Other airlines have recognized the potential of Bellingham International's location and further expanded service into the airport.
"In early 2007 Bellingham International hosted nonstop service to three destinations by the short-lived Western Airlines which was operating Boeing 737-400 jets and was based in Bellingham. Western attempted to establish a small hub at the airport with nonstop service to Ontario, California (ONT), Phoenix, Arizona (via the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, AZA) and San Diego, California (SAN). Later the same year, Skybus Airlines operated nonstop flights to their Columbus, Ohio (CMH) hub with Airbus A319 jetliners but then shut down quickly like Western Airlines had done earlier."
"On March 1, 2008, Allegiant Air opened up their sixth base at Bellingham International Airport. The airline currently bases a number of aircraft in Bellingham which serves as a ""focus city"" for the airline. In 2012 Allegiant announced service to two locations in the Hawaiian islands (Honolulu and Kahului) from Bellingham after receiving ETOPS certification from the FAA for their 757 aircraft. Alaska also entered the market with flights to Honolulu, Kahului and Kona. As of July 2019, both Allegiant and Alaska no longer serve Hawaii from Bellingham."
In September 2010 the airport completed a $26 million resurfacing of the runway to allow aircraft up to the size of Boeing 757s to utilize the airport. This project was completed in order to serve Allegiant 757 service to Honolulu and Maui which began operations in November 2012.
"In response to the increased low fare competition offered by Allegiant in their home state, Alaska Airlines expanded service from Bellingham International; first adding daily flights to Las Vegas and followed by a daily roundtrip nonstop to Honolulu, both of which are now discontinued. Frontier Airlines announced in early 2012 the addition of a daily seasonal summer service from Bellingham to its main hub in Denver beginning May 2012. Frontier flew Airbus A319 and Embraer ERJ-190 jets from Bellingham but subsequently ceased serving the airport."
"The runway and taxiway resurfacing and improvement projects were funded with FAA Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants covering 95% of project costs. In 2010 the FAA contribution towards airport projects was $27,267,000. The 5% local match came from BLI Passenger Facility Charge accounts. FAA AIP grants also have contributed to the acquisition of additional Airport Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) equipment, Aircraft de-ice equipment and other surface projects. The BLI PFC fee per passenger is currently at the FAA mandated maximum of $4.50 per enplaned passenger. The Terminal and ramp expansion projects are not AIP eligible as they are revenue generating facilities for the airport. The Port of Bellingham issues Revenue Bonds for $31,719,550 to pay for the terminal expansion. The debt service for the bonds also comes from BLI PFC accounts. In this way, the users of the airport facilities are the ones actually paying for the facility."
"Bellingham International Airport has bustling general aviation activity. Some of which is for the purpose of sightseeing in the San Juan Islands, Victoria in British Columbia, or the Canadian Gulf Islands. The majority of general aviation operations are commercial in nature; charters, flight training, transient, and private business operations provide essential contributions to the economy. It is also a convenient Port of Entry for those flying internationally. General aviation facilities comprise a site of approximately 20 acres south of the passenger terminal facilities. There are total a 73 tie-down spaces; 48 for based aircraft and 25 for transient aircraft. 103 aircraft are sheltered by seven T-hangar and corporate aircraft structures. There is also a terminal building dedicated to general aviation servicing."
"The Washington Air National Guard (WANG) occupies a 7.5-acre site at Bellingham International Airport. The Washington Air National Guard is home of the 262nd Combat Communications Squadron. The 262nd's mission is to train and equip combat communications personnel, where they field, install, operate, and maintain Ground Mobile Force communications. In other words, the 262nd equips soldiers with their battlefield communication systems and trains them how to use and maintain the equipment. The WANG base consists of vehicle storage, a headquarters building, a maintenance building, and other miscellaneous storage buildings."

"Recent archaeological and other evidence suggests Hinduism has had some cultural, economic, political and religious influence in the Philippines. Among these is the 9th century Laguna Copperplate Inscription found in 1989, deciphered in 1992 to be Kavi script (Pallava alphabet) with Sanskrit words; the golden Agusan statue (Golden Tara) discovered in another part of Philippines in 1917 has also been linked to Hinduism."
"There is some growth in the religion as of late, although most temples cater to the same communities. Actual adherents of Hinduism are mostly limited to communities that include indigenous and native peoples, expatriate communities, as well as new converts. There are various ISKCON groups and popular Hindu personalities and groups such as Sathya Sai Baba, and Paramahansa Yogananda (SRF), Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (Ananda Marga) that can be found. Hindu based practices like Yoga and meditation are also popular.

There are also notable archery ranges named after characters in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata called ""Kodanda Archery Range"" (named after Lord Rama's bow Kodanda) and ""Gandiva Archery"" (named after Arjuna's bow Gandiva)."
"One source estimated the size of the Indian community in the Philippines in 2008 at 150,000 persons.Most of whom are Hindus and Christians."
"At present, however, it is limited primarily to the immigrant Indian community, though traditional religious beliefs in most parts of the country have strong Hindu and Buddhist influences."
"Over the last three decades, a large number of civil servants and highly educated Indians working in large banks, Asian Development Bank and the BPO sector have migrated to Philippines, especially Manila. Most of the Indian Filipinos and Indian expatriates are Hindu, Sikh or Muslims, but have assimilated into Filipino culture and some are Catholic . The community regularly conducts philanthropic activities through bodies such as the Mahaveer foundation, The SEVA foundation and the"
"Sathya Sai organization. Most Hindus congregate for socio-cultural and religious activities at the Hindu Temple (Mahatma Gandhi Street, Paco, Manila), the Indian Sikh Temple (United Nations Avenue, Paco, Manila), and the Radha Soami Satsang Beas center (Alabang, Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila). The late ""priest"" (scripture reader in Sindhi and Gurumukhi) of the Hindu Temple, Giani Joginder Singh Sethi, was active in interfaith affairs, accepted visits by school students, and organised the first major translation of Guru Nanak's Jap Ji into Filipino (Tagalog), translated by Usha Ramchandani and edited by Samuel Salter (published 2001)."
There are two Hindu temples in Manila city-Hari Ram Temple (Paco) and Saya Aur Devi Mandir Temple (Paco).
"The archipelagos of Southeast Asia were under the influence of Hindu Odisha and Indonesian traders through the ports of Malay-Indonesian islands. Indian religions, possibly an amalgamated version of Hindu-Buddhist arrived in Philippines archipelago in the 1st millennium, through the Indonesian kingdom of Srivijaya followed by Majapahit. Archeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess Agusan (sometimes referred to as Golden Tara), found in Mindanao in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location. The statue now sits in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and is dated from the period 13th to early 14th centuries."
"Juan Francisco suggests that the golden Agusan statue may be a representation of goddess Sakti of the Siva-Buddha (Bhairava) tradition found in Java, in which the religious aspect of Shiva is integrated with those found in Buddhism of Java and Sumatra. The Rajahnate of Butuan, in present-day Agusan del Norte and Butuan City, used Hinduism as its main religion along with indigenous Lumad nature-worships. A Hindu Tamil King of the Rajahnate of Cebu was also recorded."
"Another gold artifact, from the Tabon Caves in the island of Palawan, is an image of Garuda, the bird who is the mount of Vishnu. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon Caves has been linked to those found from Oc Eo, in the Mekong Delta in Southern Vietnam. These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of Vietnam and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of Nandi – the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repoussé images of Hindu deities."
"In 1989, a laborer working in a sand mine at the mouth of Lumbang River near Laguna de Bay found a copper plate in Barangay Wawa, Lumban. This discovery, is now known as the Laguna Copperplate Inscription by scholars. It is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines, dated to be from the 9th century AD, and was deciphered in 1992 by Dutch anthropologist Antoon Postma. The copperplate inscription suggests economic and cultural links between the Tagalog people of Philippines with the Javanese Medang Kingdom, the Srivijaya empire, and the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of India. Hinduism in the country declined when Islam was introduced by traders from Arabia which was then followed by Christianity from Spain. This is an active area of research as little is known about the scale and depth of Philippine history from the 1st millennium and before."
"Many fables and stories in Filipino Culture are linked to Indian arts, such as the story of the monkey and the turtle, the race between deer and snail (slow and steady wins the race), and the hawk and the hen. Similarly, the major epics and folk literature of Philippines show common themes, plots, climax and ideas expressed in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana."
"According to Indologists Juan R. Francisco and Josephine Acosta Pasricha, Hindu influences and folklore arrived in Philippines by about 9th to 10th century AD. The Maranao version is the ""Maharadia Lawana"" (King Rāvaṇa of Hindu Epic Ramayana)."
"With the advent of Spanish colonialism in the 16th century, the Philippines became a closed colony and cultural contacts with other Southeast Asian countries were limited, if not closed. In 1481, the Spanish Inquisition commenced with the permission of Pope Sixtus IV and all non-Catholics within the Spanish empire were to be expelled or to be ""put to the question"" (tortured until they renounced their previous faith). With the re-founding of Manila in 1571, the Philippines became subject to the King of Spain, and the Archbishop of New Galicia (Mexico) became the Grand Inquisitor of the Faithful in Mexico and the Philippines. In 1595, the newly appointed Archbishop of Manila became the Inquisitor-General of the Spanish East Indies (i.e.,the Philippines, Guam, and Micronesia), and until 1898 was active against Protestants, Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims. As was the case in Latin America and Africa, forced conversions were not uncommon and any refusal to submit to Church authority was seen as both rebellion against the Pope and sedition against the Spanish Crown, which was punishable by death."
"Linguistic influence left lasting marks on every Philippine language. Below are some borrowed terms, which were often Buddhist and Hindu concepts, with the original Sanskrit; some of the words in many Philippine languages are loaned from Sanskrit and Tamil."
= = = Multiplication (music) = = =
"The mathematical operations of multiplication have several applications to music. Other than its application to the frequency ratios of intervals (for example, Just intonation, and the twelfth root of two in equal temperament), it has been used in other ways for twelve-tone technique, and musical set theory. Additionally ring modulation is an electrical audio process involving multiplication that has been used for musical effect."
"A multiplicative operation is a mapping in which the argument is multiplied . Multiplication originated intuitively in interval expansion, including tone row order number rotation, for example in the music of Béla Bartók and Alban Berg . Pitch number rotation, ""Fünferreihe"" or ""five-series"" and ""Siebenerreihe"" or ""seven-series"", was first described by Ernst Krenek in ""Über neue Musik"" (; ). Princeton-based theorists, including James K. , Godfrey , and Hubert S. ""were the first to discuss and adopt them, not only with regards to twelve-tone series"" ."
"When dealing with pitch-class sets, multiplication modulo 12 is a common operation. Dealing with all twelve tones, or a tone row, there are only a few numbers which one may multiply a row by and still end up with a set of twelve distinct tones. Taking the prime or unaltered form as P, multiplication is indicated by ""M"", ""x"" being the multiplicator:"
The following table lists all possible multiplications of a chromatic twelve-tone row:
"Note that only M, M, M, and M give a one-to-one mapping (a complete set of 12 unique tones). This is because each of these numbers is relatively prime to 12. Also interesting is that the chromatic scale is mapped to the circle of fourths with M, or fifths with M, and more generally under M all even numbers stay the same while odd numbers are transposed by a tritone. This kind of multiplication is frequently combined with a transposition operation. It was first described in print by Herbert Eimert, under the terms ""Quartverwandlung"" (fourth transformation) and ""Quintverwandlung"" (fifth transformation) , and has been used by the composers Milton Babbitt (; ), Robert , and Charles Wuorinen . This operation also accounts for certain harmonic transformations in jazz ."
"Thus multiplication by the two meaningful operations (5 & 7) may be designated with M(""a"") and M(""a"") or M and IM ."
"Pierre described an operation he called pitch multiplication, which is somewhat akin to the Cartesian product of pitch-class sets. Given two sets, the result of pitch multiplication will be the set of sums (modulo 12) of all possible pairings of elements between the original two sets. Its definition:"
"For example, if multiplying a C-major chord formula_2 with a dyad containing C,D formula_3, the result is:"
"In this example, a set of three pitches multiplied with a set of two pitches gives a new set of 3 × 2 pitches. Given the limited space of modulo 12 arithmetic, when using this procedure very often duplicate tones are produced, which are generally omitted. This technique was used most famously in Boulez's 1955 ""Le marteau sans maître"", as well as in his Third Piano Sonata, ""Structures II"", ""Don"" and ""Tombeau"" from ""Pli selon pli"", ""Eclat"" (and ""Eclat multiples""), ""Figures-Doubles-Prisms"", ""Domaines"", and ""Cummings ist der Dichter"", as well as the withdrawn choral work, ""Oubli signal lapidé"" (1952) (; ; ). This operation, unlike arithmetic multiplication and transpositional combination of set classes, is non-commutative ."
"Howard Hanson called this operation of commutative mathematical convolution ""superposition"" or ""@-projection"" and used the ""/"" notation interchangeably. Thus ""p@m"" or ""p/m"" means ""perfect fifth at major third"", e.g.: { C E G B }. He specifically noted that two triad forms could be so multiplied, or a triad multiplied by itself, to produce a resultant scale. The latter ""squaring"" of a triad produces a particular scale highly saturated in instances of the source triad . Thus ""pmn"", Hanson's name for common the major triad, when squared, is ""PMN"", e.g.: { C D E G G B }."
"The nascent German association permitted teams from outside the country in their new championship, as long as they were members of one of its regional associations. This is how Prague, a team from Austria-Hungary, managed an appearance in the German national final. Once the DFB joined FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) in 1904, clubs from outside the country were no longer permitted to play in Germany."
"From 1903 to 1944, teams played for the ""Viktoria"" (Victoria Championship Trophy). In 1908, a cup competition named ""Kronprinzenpokal"" for the regional representative XIs was started, the trophy having been donated by Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia. The Viktoria was originally intended to be awarded, on an annual alternating basis, to the championship teams of the DFB and the nation's rugby union teams; however, football became the more dominant sport, the Rugby clubs left the federation and the trophy stayed with the DFB. Championship play skipped a year in 1904, was interrupted by World War I between 1914 and 1918, and again at the end of World War II between 1944 and 1946."
"The last team to win the Viktoria was Dresdner SC, who beat the air-force club Luftwaffen SV Hamburg in Berlin's Olympiastadion 4–0 to end the 1943–44 competition. In the confusion at the end of World War II, the trophy disappeared. It was re-discovered decades later in an East German bank safe-deposit box where it had been placed by a Dresden supporter for safekeeping. It has since been returned to the DFB. In the meantime, a new championship trophy, the ""Meisterschale"" (""Championship Plate""), sometimes nicknamed ""die Salatschüssel"" (the salad bowl), was created in 1949."
"In 1919, there were 150,000 registered football players in Germany; by 1932, there were more than a million. In spite of the formation of a national association, German football held to an ideal of amateurism built around regional and local sports associations who felt that professionalism would diminish sportsmanship and local participation in the game. In the early 1930s, the DFB's president, Felix Linnemann, pushed for the creation of a professional league, or ""Reichsliga"", in which the country's best teams would compete for the national championship. The idea was rebuffed by the regional federations dominating the sport."
"¹ called ""Landesliga"" in some parts of the country, ""Verbandsliga"" in others, and in some parts there is a Verbandsliga (V) ""and"" a Landesliga (VI)."
"² the Bezirksoberliga is not established in all areas of the country, e.g. in Mittelrhein."
"³ the Kreisliga is not established in all areas of the country, e.g. in Mittelrhein."
"The reach of Germany's totalitarian Nazi regime stretched into social institutions at all levels, including their football leagues. Most sports and football associations were disbanded or replaced by Nazi-sponsored organisations. To join a DFB club, a player required recommendations from two non-Marxists to be permitted to play. The DFB gradually lost its independence as it was assimilated into the Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen (DRA) (Reich Committee for Physical Education)."
"Under Hans von Tschammer und Osten as Reichssportsführer, appointed by the Nazis, formerly independent sports organisations became departments of a new organisation which replaced the DRA — Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen (DRL, later NSRL or Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen). As in most of German society at the time, sports associations and football teams took part in the purge of Jews from their organisations as ordered by the regime. A few clubs, such as Alemannia Aachen and Bayern Munich, moved to support or protect their members in the face of these actions."
"Football was re-organised into sixteen Gaue (DRL sub-divisions) in the Gauliga, which was in place from 1933 to 1945. The overall effect of this was positive for German football. Prior to 1933, nearly 600 clubs competed in the top flight. League re-organisation reduced this to about 170 sides and significantly raised the level of competition. This was the beginning of a process of consolidation of the myriad of small regional leagues that would culminate in a stronger, unified national league structure. The German Cup was introduced in 1935. Known initially as the Tschammerpokal, after Hans von Tschammer, the first cup winner was 1. FC Nürnberg. Play for the Tschammerpokal went on until 1943 and was not resumed again until 1953, under its new name."
"The pre-war period saw a number of German sides from Saarland, Danzig and the Memel Region playing in German league and cup competitions even though the Versailles Treaty had handed those regions over to the League of Nations after the end of World War I; football-wise, they had remained within the DFB (or DRL, respectively). In post-war times, 1. FC Saarbrücken (formerly FV Saarbrücken) played in the French Second Division for one season. They won that division handily but were denied promotion to the First Division. The Saarland was to be granted its own FIFA membership until it was re-united with Germany in 1956."
"Twenty years back, FC Schalke 04 dominated German football during the Nazi era and was often held up for propaganda purposes as an example of the new Germany. As the Reich expanded through conquest, teams from Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Alsace-Lorraine and Luxembourg were incorporated into the Gauliga. After the Anschluss, the forced union of Austria with Germany, Vienna's Rapid Wien captured the Tschammerpokal in 1938 and the German national championship in 1941, the latter with a 4–3 win over Schalke, who had been three goals ahead with just fifteen minutes to play in the game."
"During the war, football was used as a morale booster for the population and was supported by the regime. Many teams were sponsored by the Luftwaffe, the SS, or other branches of the military. As the tide turned against Germany, the Gauliga began to crumble as players were called away to military service or were killed in the conflict, stadiums were bombed and travel became difficult. The original sixteen Gauligen broke up into over thirty smaller, more local circuits. The level of play deteriorated and lopsided scores became common, the record being a 32–0 win by Germania Mudersbach over FV Engen. The 1943–44 championship was initially cancelled but eventually went ahead after widespread protest. The 1944–45 season began less than two weeks later, rather than after the usual three-month summer break. The last recorded match in the Third Reich was on 23 April 1945 as Bayern Munich defeated 1860 Munich 3–2. Less than three weeks later, Germany surrendered unconditionally."
"Under Allied occupation all organizations, including sports clubs and associations, were initially banned. However, within a year, sports-only organizations without political affiliation were permitted, and in the American, British and French occupation zones, most pre-war clubs were reconstituted. Oberliga play resumed in 1945–46 on a regional basis in the South and South-West; Berlin and the other regions followed and, in 1948, 1. FC Nürnberg defeated 1. FC Kaiserslautern 2–1 to become the first post-war national champions. At the time, there was no ""prize"" to play for. The Viktoria trophy traditionally awarded to the nation's best side had gone missing in the chaos of post-war Germany. In 1949, Nürnberg and each winning side since VfB Leipzig in 1903, would have their names engraved on the newly created Meisterschale, nicknamed ""the salad bowl"" for its shape. The German Cup competition introduced prior to the war also returned, with Rot-Weiss Essen's 2–1 victory over Alemannia Aachen in 1953."
"Through the 1950s, there were continued calls for the formation of a central professional league, especially as professional leagues in other countries began to draw Germany's best players away from the amateur domestic leagues. At the international level the German game began to falter as German teams often fared poorly against professional teams from other countries. A key supporter of the central league concept was national team head coach Sepp Herberger who said, ""If we want to remain competitive internationally, we have to raise our expectations at the national level."""
"In spite of this, Germany (as West Germany) managed to win its first World Cup in 1954 defeating heavily favoured Hungary 3–2, the only ""amateur"" (i.e. semi-professional) side ever to do so. The unexpected victory was called ""The Miracle of Bern"" by a delighted nation. An oddity of the 1954 World Cup preliminary rounds was the fielding of a separate side by the German state of Saarland, which was occupied by the French and did not become a part of West Germany again until after a plebiscite and treaty negotiation. The Saarlanders acquitted themselves well, finishing second in their group ahead of Norway and behind group winner West Germany."
"Meanwhile, in East Germany, a separate league was established with the formation of the DS-Oberliga (Deutscher Sportausschuß Oberliga or German Sports Association) in 1949. The league was renamed the Fußball Oberliga DFV in 1958 and was generally referred to simply as the DDR-Liga or DDR-Oberliga. The league fielded 14 teams with 2 relegation spots."
"The defeat of the national team by Yugoslavia (0–1) in a 1962 World Cup quarter final game in Chile was one impetus (of many) to the formation of a national league. Under new DFB president Hermann Gösmann (elected that very day) the Bundesliga was created in Dortmund at the Westfalenhallen on 28 July 1962 to begin play starting with the 1963–64 season. The new German professional league was modelled on the long-established English league, which had been set up in 1888."
"At the time, there were five Oberligen, or Premier leagues, in place representing West Germany's North, South, West, Southwest, and Berlin. East Germany, under Soviet occupation, maintained its separate league structure. Forty-six clubs applied for admission to the new league. Sixteen teams were selected based on their success on the field, economic criteria and representation of the various Oberligen."
The first Bundesliga games were played on 24 August 1963. Early favorite 1. FC Köln (45:19) was the first Bundesliga champion over second place clubs Meidericher SV and Eintracht Frankfurt (both 39:25).
"The new league was met with enthusiasm early on and large crowds came out to watch the nation's top teams. No single team was able to dominate through the 1960s — in seven seasons from 1963–64 through to 1969–70, seven different teams won the championship. The 1965–66 season saw the promotion of Bayern Munich to the top league and in 1968–69 they won their first championship on their way to becoming the most dominant side in Bundesliga history."
"The 1960s also saw one of the strangest incidents in the history of the Bundesliga. The licence of Hertha BSC Berlin was revoked for the 1964–65 season and the team relegated to the Regionalliga Berlin (Regional leagues being the leagues below the Bundesliga at the time) for breaking the league's player salary rules, partially in an attempt to entice players to Berlin at the time of the construction of the Berlin Wall and high Cold War tensions. The last place clubs, Karlsruher SC and FC Schalke 04, tried to avoid being demoted by laying claim to Hertha's place. It was decided to suspend relegation for one season and increase the number of teams in the league from 16 to 18 to accommodate the two teams which would normally be promoted from the Regionalligen. The politics of the Cold War era led to a space being held open for a Berlin side to replace Hertha in a show of solidarity with the former capital city. What followed was the debacle of the promotion of Tasmania 1900 Berlin, which went on to the worst season in league history."
"West Germany made another appearance in the final of the World Cup in 1966, losing (4–2) to England in extra time that included a famously controversial goal."
"The young league got off to a difficult start in the decade as a scandal broke with Kickers Offenbach president Horst-Gregorio Canellas putting forward evidence of players being bribed to affect the outcome of games. Allegations were that a number of clubs, including Bielefeld, Hertha, Schalke, and Köln, were involved. The scandal caused a disastrous loss of confidence in the Bundesliga and game attendance plummeted. Investigations by the DFB led to the banning of many players, although most of these sentences were commuted. Arminia Bielefeld, identified as the club central to the scandal, was stripped of all points they had earned during the 1971–72 season and then relegated to the league below."
"Enthusiasm for the sport was restored by host West Germany's win in the 1974 World Cup and the first wins by Bundesliga sides in the European Champions Cup (a triple by Bayern Munich in 1974, 1975 and 1976) and the UEFA Cup (Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1975). Attendance rose steadily after the end of the bribery scandal, putting some teams on solid enough financial footings to be able to attract the first foreign stars to the league in the 1977–78 season."
"The Bundesliga was dominated by two sides through the 1970s. Borussia Mönchengladbach became the first team to successfully defend its title with its win in 1970–71. Bayern Munich became the first three-time champion with wins in 1971–72, 1972–73 and 1973–74. Borussia Mönchengladbach then turned a triple of its own over the following three seasons. After wins by Köln and Hamburg, Bayern closed out the decade by matching Mönchengladbach's five titles."
"The 1980s were a rather bleak decade for the Bundesliga. There was a general decline in attendance throughout the league: in the 1977–78 season average attendance for a Bundesliga match was over 26,000 — the best since 1964–65. By 1985–86 that figure bottomed out at just 17,600 spectators per game. The country's football was also affected by the general European problem of hooliganism and the appearance of neo-Nazi fan groups. The German domestic game became a graceless, rough-edged, brute physical contest devoid of the kinds of star players fans had enjoyed watching in earlier decades. The best German players were regularly lured south to play in Serie A by cash-rich Italian clubs. Bayern Munich's domination of the Bundesliga became numbingly repetitive as they took six of ten titles in the 1980s."
But by the end of the decade the stage was set for some fundamental changes to the Bundesliga. The league signed its first rich television contract and German re-unification and the subsequent merger of the football leagues of East and West Germany was on the horizon.
"In 1991, a year after German reunification, East Germany's Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR, or Football Federation of the German Democratic Republic, was merged into West Germany's DFB. East German sides were seeded and assigned to various levels within the West German league structure, which was itself modified to accommodate the influx of new clubs. To facilitate the union with the eastern league the Bundesliga temporarily expanded to 20 clubs in the 1991–92 season and added the DDR-Oberliga's top two sides, Dynamo Dresden and Hansa Rostock. The Bundesliga returned to an 18 team slate in the following season with Dresden managing to stick in the top league, while ""Rostock"" was relegated. These two teams continued to make appearances in the Bundesliga through the 1990s. The only other former East German sides to earn promotion to the Bundesliga to date are FC Energie Cottbus and VfB Leipzig, while a half dozen others of these clubs have played in 2. Bundesliga."
"Beginning with the 1995–96 season, the league adopted a new scoring system. Teams were now awarded three points for a win rather than two as had been traditional, with a view toward encouraging more effort through a greater reward in the standings."
"Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Bundesliga again enjoyed increasing popularity in Germany. This was on one hand due to the success of the German national football team (third World Cup title in 1990 and third European Championships title in 1996). The Bundesliga also began to take a more deliberate approach to marketing and promoting itself and its member clubs, following the example of other more widely recognized European leagues."
"In 1998, 1. FC Kaiserslautern became the first (and so far, only) team in Bundesliga and German history to win the league championship as a newly promoted team, having won the 2. Bundesliga title the previous year."
"Secondary design factors included engine and propeller rating factors, minimum internal accommodation levels, safety regulations, and a limit on the number of sails carried on board. Later on, crew limits were introduced, and limits on the use of exotic materials, such as carbon fibre and Nomex, and also scantlings for hull structural design developed by the American Bureau of Shipping."
"In a handicap race, the IOR length was used to compute a ""time allowance"". In Europe this was calculated on the duration of the race, in seconds per hour, known as Time on Time, whereas in the USA they preferred to base it on the length of the race, as seconds per mile, known as Time on Distance. Time on Distance is easier to calculate at any point in the race, but can cause significant anomalies in tidal waters as the distance sailed through the water can differ significantly from the distance over the ground, due to the effect of the tide."
"The IOR rule was also used to define ""level rating classes,"" where each class had a maximum IOR rating, and the first boat to finish was the winner, with no handicapping. The first of these was the One Ton class, so named because there was a spare trophy from the defunct One Ton rating class, and this then spawned the Mini Ton, 1/4 Ton, 1/2 Ton, 3/4 Ton and Two Ton classes, as well as unofficial 50-footer, ULDB 70, and Maxi classes. The official classes each had an annual world championships."
"The IOR was run by the ITC, or International Technical Committee, of the Offshore Racing Congress, chaired between 1979 and 1987 by the late Gary Mull of San Francisco. As with all published handicapping formulae, there was an ongoing game between the designers finding ways of designing boats that took advantage of shortcomings in the measurement system and handicapping formulae, and the rule makers closing the loopholes to ensure fair racing and a reasonable competitive life for the boats. As the racing became more competitive, the rate of change in the rule accelerated, and also the boats at the top of the fleet became stripped out racing machines that performed well but were expensive and also difficult to sail, and this resulted in a loss of popularity. However even if club sailors could not compete against the top boats, the IOR did generate a reasonably level playing field across the sailing spectrum, with club sailors buying production race boats or custom boats past their prime, and moving up to more competitive boats as they wanted to sail up the fleet. Towards the end of its life the IOR had become a stable rule, but by then it had a reputation of changing too often, and this sowed the seeds for its successors. IMS was introduced as a more ""scientific"" rule for racing yachts, driven by the USA, whereas Channel Handicap was introduced in 1983 by the RORC as a simple club level rule that would hopefully feed people into IOR racing - though in fact it proved to be the final nail in the coffin for the IOR rule."
"Boats had a short competitive life for two reasons: the overall increase in performance of newer boats due to better design and construction, and also the effect of changes in the handicapping rules. The first was catered for by an ""age allowance"", which reduced the handicap of boats as they got older. The second was catered for to some extent by grandfather clauses in the IOR rules, but this did not cater for designer's ability to design to the rule increasing with every year. This, plus the annual rule changes, gave boats a competitive life of no more than 2 or 3 years at the top level."
"Initially designs were heavy displacement, with a fine, often V shaped stern as well as a fine bow. These were powerful boats for sailing to windward, but had limited performance offwind as well as often having an alarming tendency to broach - designers included Sparkman & Stephens and Dick Carter. Then Ron Holland's quarter-tonner ""Eygthene"" began the next phase of increasingly lightweight boats with fuller sterns giving more of a wedge shape, and a change from masthead rig to a fractional rig. This dinghy influence gave much faster performance reaching and downwind, and although windward performance was not as good, it improved as the designs developed. The ultimate in this stage was the various lightweight centerboard designs with internal ballast, but these were not sufficiently seaworthy for offshore racing and so were penalised so heavily that they were effectively banned. Designs then moved to a more moderate displacement, and as race courses moved from offshore racing with plenty of reaching towards windward/leeward round the cans, racing designs became narrower and less powerful but more easily driven."
"A good reference on the IOR Rule, including an analysis of the different formulae and measurements used, can be found in the book ""The Offshore Yacht""."
"Today, modern Maxis or ""Super-Maxi's"" are simply limited to 30m (98'); encouraging improvements in boat design, and exciting sailing; not simply rule modification, as still plagues the America's Cup competition."
"The introduction of VPPs, or Velocity Prediction Programs, morphed the science of yacht performance measurement. Inherent to the IOR was the concept of a measurement officer taking discrete hull measurements and the IOR formula assumed the hull lines behaved continuously between measurement points. The IMS took the actual hull lines and analysed their continuum, essentially eliminating funny bumps or hollows in the ensuing yachts and generally rendering much cleaner, faster lines that were far more exciting, safer to sail, and had higher resale value."

"State Road 1 (SR 1) is a north–south state highway in eastern Indiana, consisting of two segments. Its southern segment begins at U.S. Highway 50 and Interstate 275 in east-central Dearborn County, just east of Lawrenceburg, and ends at Interstate 469 south of Fort Wayne. Its northern segment begins at Interstate 69 on Fort Wayne's north side, and ends at U.S. Route 20 in east-central Steuben County, approximately east of Angola."
"State Road 1 begins at an interchange of Interstate 275; this is I-275's only exit in Indiana. Just after the interchange there is a stop light at U.S. Route 50 (US 50). SR 1 travels north-northwest until it reaches I-74; just beyond I-74 it crosses Indiana State Road 46 (SR 46). SR 1 continues north until it meets U.S. Route 52 (US 52) just west of Cedar Grove. Then US 52 and SR 1 continue north-northeast for until they reach Brookville; here, US 52 turns west on its way to Indianapolis, while SR 1 continues north-northwest for where it meets Indiana State Road 44 (SR 44). SR 1 and SR 44 travel together for where SR 1 turns north-northeast towards downtown Connersville. North of Connersville, SR 1 travels north-northwest until it reaches Cambridge City, where SR 1 crosses U.S. Route 40 (US 40). After the intersection at US 40, SR 1 heads north-northeast. After SR 1 has an interchange with Interstate 70 (I-70), then heads due north towards U.S. Route 36 (US 36). SR 1 turns east onto US 36 for , then leaves US 36 and travels generally due north until it reaches Fort Wayne. Just south of Fort Wayne, SR 1 ends at an interchange with Interstate 469 (I-469)."
"On the north side of Fort Wayne at the Dupont Road interchange of Interstate 69 (I-69), the northern section of SR 1 begins and heads east. The road heads away from I–69 as a six-lane divided highway, along the south edge of the Parkview Regional Medical Center complex, passing through numerous commercial properties. The highway narrows to a four-lane divided highway at Diebold Road and then enters an area of mixed commercial and residential properties. At Tonkel Road, SR 1 begins to curve northeast toward Leo and narrows to a two-lane highway. The route then leaves Fort Wayne, passing through rural farm land with scattered houses. Curving due north to enter Leo on Main Street, SR 1 then passes through residential areas of that town. North of downtown Leo the highway curves northeast and passes through a mix of commercial and residential properties. As the road enters DeKalb County it curves to run due north. The highway then enters Spencerville, passing through the center of town. After Spencerville, the road curves northeast, before again turning back north. The highway enters St. Joe and takes a sharp curve to head due east. The route crosses CSX Railroad tracks and makes another sharp curve heading due north. The road continues north until it meets SR 8. The two routes head east-southeast for a concurrency, until SR 1 departs the joint section heading due north. The road then passes through rural farmland, with a few houses, as a two-lane highway. Upon entering Butler it crosses the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks, before encountering a signalized intersection with US 6 in downtown Butler. SR 1 then leaves Butler heading due north until it intersects DeKalb County Road 46, at which point the highway turns northwest. The route enter Hamilton and begins a concurrency with SR 427, heading northeast and passing Hamilton Lake. After , SR 1 leaves the concurrency heading due north. The highway then continues in that direction until reaching its northern terminus at US 20."
SR 1 began at US 50 and Main Street in Lawrenceburg and traveled north on Main Street until Main Street became Ridge Avenue. It then followed Ridge Avenue until it met the current SR 1.
"Between the late 1940s and late 1950s, SR 1 had three or more lanes. This started in Bluffton and continued north to Fort Wayne."
"Before being split into two sections on either side of Fort Wayne, SR 1 traveled on a continuous route through that city. From the present northern terminus of its southern section at Interstate 469's exit 6 in south-central Allen County, it continued north on Bluffton Road to pass just east of Fort Wayne's main airport (then known as Baer Field). In the Waynedale district of southwestern Fort Wayne, SR 3 joined Bluffton Road from the southwest at Lower Huntington Road. From there the routes originally continued together northward, hugging the bank of the St. Mary's River before curving east to bridge it. SR 1/SR 3 then immediately turned right (south) onto Broadway for about before turning east on Rudisill Boulevard. From there the routes continued to a one way pair of Clinton Street (southbound) and Lafayette Street (northbound), which then carried a concurrency of US 27 from Decatur and US 33 from St. Marys, Ohio. At Lima Road, SR 3 continues north, as US 27 and SR 1 got on I-69 northbound until exiting at Dupont Road."
"In later years, after the decommissioning of SR 3 through Fort Wayne and the completion of the Baer Field Thruway (later renamed Airport Expressway), SR 1 was rerouted to turn right onto that roadway, which deposited motorists onto Paulding Road at Fairfield Avenue. From there SR 1 headed east along Paulding Road to its intersection with US 27/US 33 (now Lafayette Street), where it turned left (north) and joined those routes to downtown Fort Wayne."
"North of Rudisill Boulevard, the original concurrency of US 27/US 33/SR 1/SR 3 (as well as the later concurrency of the first 3 routes) followed the Lafayette Street/Clinton Street pair to downtown Fort Wayne, where US 33 departed to the west. North of downtown, Lafayette Street became Spy Run Boulevard (still one-way northbound) until it terminated at the north end of the one-way pair with Clinton Street. From there the three (later two) combined routes continued north for a few blocks on Clinton Street to Northrup Street, where they curved northwest onto the latter roadway. Just south of Coliseum Boulevard SR 930 (then U.S. 30), Northrup Street becomes Lima Road, and continues north-northwest to I-69."
"At that point, SR 3 continued (later resumed) northbound on Lima Road to Kendallville, and US 27 and SR 1 both entered I-69 northbound, with SR 1 concurrent with the freeway until the Dupont Road interchange and US 27 concurrent with I-69 into Michigan."
"At one point, the northern terminus was at SR 120 just west of the Ohio State Line."
= = = Territorial Support Group = = =
"The Territorial Support Group (TSG) is a Met Operations unit of London's Metropolitan Police Service (MPS). In 2012 it consisted of 793 officers and 29 support staff. It specialises in public order containment, among other specialist policing. The TSG is a uniformed unit of the MPS that replaced the similarly controversial Special Patrol Group in 1987. TSG units patrol the streets of London in marked police vans or ""carriers""; using the call sign ""Uniform"". Generally each carrier has an advanced (police) driver, five constables and a sergeant. Territorial Support Groups often comprise three carriers, eighteen constables, and three sergeants reporting to an Inspector. They separately patrol designated patches. When deployed, it is by the MPS Information Room. Due to the public order nature of their role often numerous carriers will be assigned, a common situation being drunken rowdiness at public house closing time. TSG officers can be identified as TSG from the distinctive ""U"" in their shoulder numbers."
Today the TSG has three main tasks in the policing of the Metropolitan Police District:
"Although public order is not the TSG's only role, it is certainly their most visible and well-known. Like most Police Support Unit vehicles, TSG vans are equipped with mesh window shields and officers are equipped with acrylic glass riot shields, visored 'NATO' helmets, shin and elbow guards, along with fireproof coveralls when required. This level of protection allows them to deal with many violent situations, including riots, football violence and suspects armed with a variety of weapons. TSG officers are trained to a higher standard of operational readiness in their public order role than most other Police Support Units outside London; TSG training is refreshed every five weeks as a matter of routine. Exercises are conducted predominantly at the MPS Specialist Training Centre in Gravesend, Kent, though other sites are used as required, and encompass all public order scenarios; officers will undergo extensive riot training including being petrol bombed in large-scale engagements, prison clearance tactics, football stadium scenarios, night club scenarios, aircraft, rail and various 'angry-man' scenarios, as well as additional specialist training. TSG units spend considerable time training with other specialist police teams as well as certain military units. Also, if a siege situation is present, but firearms are not involved, TSG will often be deployed to counter the threat. Reflecting this role the unit's former head, Commander Michael Johnson, was tactical commander for the London 2012 Olympics."
"TSG provides support to regular divisional officers through high-visibility patrols, surveillance and decoy operations while also providing a presence on the streets. Boroughs are also supported through the provision of a 'Commissioner's Reserve' a section of TSG that is on standby all year round; it is designed so such units are always available for rapid response of a sizeable number of officers anywhere within the Metropolis to quell public order problems, from a bar brawl to large-scale public disorder. Day to day TSG assist the boroughs in handling and relocating particularly violent prisoners."
"TSG is equipped and trained to deal with the aftermath or evacuation during or after a terrorism emergency in London, and the unit includes a CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) trained team. Working closely with SO15 (the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command) TSG also has counter-terrorism responsibilities."
"Potential TSG candidates are selected from mainstream divisional officers. Officers are selected on merit and much emphasis is placed upon their personal policing ability, motivation, resilience and good communication skills. Fitness and stamina are also seen as essential attributes of TSG personnel. Applicants must be recommended by a senior officer (minimum rank of Inspector) whilst on division."
"Mercedes Sprinters are the standard vehicle of TSG and each van transports six Constables and a Sergeant. Three of these vans can form an operational Serial ready to respond to incidents; following the national PSU model this would include an Inspector, three Sergeants, eighteen Constables, two medics and three drivers."
"In English, they self-identify as ""Syriac"", sometimes expanded to ""Syriac-Aramean"" or ""Aramean-Syriac"". In Swedish, they call themselves ""Syrianer"", and in German, """" is a common self-designation."
"The Aramean Democratic Organization, based in Lebanon, is an advocate of the Aramean identity and an independent state in their ancient homeland of Aram."
"Self-identification of some Syriac Christians with Arameans is well documented in Syriac literature. Mentions by notable individuals include that of the poet-theologian Jacob of Serugh, (c. 451 – 29 November 521) who describes Venerated Father St. Ephrem the Syrian (c. 306 – 373) as ""He who became a crown for the people of the Aramaeans [armāyūthā], (and) by him we have been brought close to spiritual beauty"". Ephrem himself made references to Aramean origins, calling his country Aram-Nahrin and his language Aramaic, and describing Bar-Daisan (d. 222) of Edessa as ""The Philosopher of the Arameans"", who ""made himself a laughing-stock among Arameans and Greeks.” Michael the Elder (d. 1199) writes of his race as that of ""the Aramaeans, namely the descendants of Aram, who were called Syrians.” Bar Hebraeus (d. 1286) writes in his Book of Rays of the ""Aramean-Syrian nation""."
"However, references such as these to an Aramean identity are scarce after the early Middle Ages, until the development of Aramean nationalism in the late 20th century."
"In 2014, Israel has decided to recognize the Aramean community within its borders as a national minority, allowing most of the Syriac Christians in Israel (around 10,000) to be registered as ""Aramean"" instead of ""Arab"". This decision on part of the Israeli Interior Ministry highlights the growing awareness regarding the distinctness of the Aramean identity as well as their plight due to the historical Arabization of the region."
"Most of the Maronites identify with a Phoenician origin, as do much of the Lebanese population, and do not see themselves as Assyrian, Syriac or Aramean. This comes from the fact that present day Lebanon, the Mediterranean coast of Syria, and northern Israel is the area that roughly corresponds to ancient Phoenicia and as a result like the majority of the Lebanese people identify with the ancient Phoenician population of that region. Moreover, the cultural and linguistic heritage of the Lebanese people is a blend of both indigenous Phoenician elements and the foreign cultures that have come to rule the land and its people over the course of thousands of years. In a 2013 interview the lead investigator, Pierre Zalloua, pointed out that genetic variation preceded religious variation and divisions:""Lebanon already had well-differentiated communities with their own genetic peculiarities, but not significant differences, and religions came as layers of paint on top. There is no distinct pattern that shows that one community carries significantly more Phoenician than another."""
"However, a small minority of Lebanese Maronites like the Lebanese author Walid Phares tend to see themselves to be ethnic Assyrians and not ethnic Phoenicians. Walid Phares, speaking at the 70th Assyrian Convention, on the topic of Assyrians in post-Saddam Iraq, began his talk by asking why he as a Lebanese Maronite ought to be speaking on the political future of Assyrians in Iraq, answering his own question with ""because we are one people. We believe we are the Western Assyrians and you are the Eastern Assyrians."""
Another small minority of Lebanese Maronites like the Maronites in Israel tend to see themselves to be ethnic Arameans and not ethnic Phoenicians.
"However, other Maronite factions in Lebanon, such as Guardians of the Cedars, in their opposition to Arab nationalism, advocate the idea of a pure Phoenician racial heritage (see Phoenicianism). They point out that all Lebanese people are of pre-Arab and pre-Islamic origin, and as such are at least, in part, of the Phoenician-Canaanite stock."
"The Saint Thomas Christians of India, where they are known as Syrian Christians, though ethnically unrelated to the peoples known as Assyrian, Aramean or Syrian/Syriac, had strong cultural and religious links with Mesopotamia as a result of trade links and missionary activity by the Church of the East at the height of its influence. Following the 1653 Coonan Cross Oath, many Saint Thomas Christians passed to the Syriac Orthodox Church and later split into several distinct churches. The majority, remaining faithful to the East Syriac Rite, form the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, from which a small group, known as the Chaldean Syrian Church, seceded and in the early 20th century linked with what is now called the Assyrian Church of the East."
"""Syrian"" is a national identity for a citizen of the Syrian Arab Republic, whether Christian or not."
"In India, ""Syrian Christians"", also known as Saint Thomas Christians, ""are a distinct, endomagous ethnic group, in many ways similar to a caste. They have a history of close to two thousand years, and in language, religion, and ethnicity, they are related to Persian as well as West Syrian Christian traditions""."
"Outside of India, Syrian Christians are all those Christians whose liturgies are in the Syriac language, even if they have been Arabized or live in other continents. A distinction is made between East and West Syrians in accordance with their use of the East Syriac Rite or the West Syriac Rite."
"Although inclusive of both Western and Eastern Syrian Christians, the term ""Syrian Christians"" is sometimes used in contexts where it refers more specifically to the Church of the East."
"Members of the Church of the East have been called Nestorians, since their church does not use ""Mother of God"" as a description of Mary, mother of Jesus, choosing instead to call her ""Mother of Christ"", and has therefore been accused of the Christological doctrine known as Nestorianism, which emphasizes the distinction between Christ's humanity and divinity to such an extent that its critics say it makes of him two distinct individuals. The justice of imputing this heresy to Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431, whom the Assyrian Church of the East venerates as a saint, is disputed. David Wilmshurst states that for centuries ""the word 'Nestorian' was used both as a term of abuse by those who disapproved of the traditional East Syrian theology, as a term of pride by many of its defenders [...] and as a neutral and convenient descriptive term by others. Nowadays it is generally felt that the term carries a stigma"". Sebastian P. Brock says: ""The association between the Church of the East and Nestorius is of a very tenuous nature, and to continue to call that Church 'Nestorian' is, from a historical point of view, totally misleading and incorrect – quite apart from being highly offensive and a breach of ecumenical good manners."""
"Apart from its religious meaning, the word ""Nestorian"" has also been used in an ethnic sense, as shown by the phrase ""Catholic Nestorians""."
"Members of the Syriac Orthodox Church are sometimes called Jacobites, after Jacob Baradaeus, an appellation that leaders of that church have both deplored and accepted. They are sometimes also called Monophysites, a term they have always disputed, preferring to be referred to as Miaphysites."
"In Western media, Syriac Christians are often spoken of simply as Christians of their country or geographical region of residence: ""Iraqi Christians"", ""Iranian Christians"", ""Syrian Christians"", and ""Turkish Christians"". The ""Assyrian International News Agency"" interpreted this as ""Arabist policy of denying Assyrian identity and claiming that Assyrians, including Chaldeans and Syriacs, are Arab Christian minorities"". John Joseph states that, in Anglican writing, ""'Assyrian Christians', which originally had only meant 'The Christians of geographical Assyria', soon became 'Christian Assyrians'"", and cites J. F. Coakley, who remarked that, in the same context, ""the link created between the modern 'Assyrians' and the ancient Assyrians of Nineveh known to readers of the Old Testament [...] has proved irresistible to the imagination""."
"They are also spoken of as Arab Christians. This too the ""Assyrian International News Agency"" interpreted as ""Arabist policy"" and mentioned in particular the dedication by the ""American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee"" of a webpage to the Maronite Kahlil Gibran, who is ""viewed in Arabic literature as an innovator, not dissimilar to someone like W. B. Yeats in the West"". The vast majority of the Christians living in Israel self-identify as Arabs, but the Aramean community have wished to be recognized as a separate minority, neither Arab nor Palestinian but Aramean, while many others wish to be called Palestinian citizens of Israel rather than Arabs. The wish of the Aramean community in Israel was granted in September 2014, opening for some 200 families the possibility, if they can speak Aramaic, to register as Arameans. Other Christians in Israel criticized this move, seeing it as intended to divide the Christians and also to limit to Muslims the definition of ""Arab""."
= = = Mahmoud Salah = = =
"Mahmoud Salah (aged 23) was a Palestinian member of al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, who was stopped by Israeli police in East Jerusalem on March 8, 2002 and shot dead some 30 minutes later."
The circumstances surrounding his killing are disputed. The AFP news agency published eleven photographs taken by an amateur photographer through his window which depict the apprehension and shooting.
"Israeli police claim that Saleh had a large explosive device strapped to his waist, and that after being apprehended ""attempted several times to detonate the bomb by rubbing his chest against the ground in the hope of activating the detonation switch."" The police statement reported that ""[i]n order to prevent the murder of the policemen and the bomb disposal officer, the suicide bomber was shot and killed by police"" and ""[t]he bomb was [then] dismantled with the aid of a bomb disposal robot."""
"The BBC and other agencies claimed there are discrepancies between the police statement, the photographs and the ""testimonies of more than 10 eyewitnesses, who said the man was shot half-an-hour after his arrest when he was completely subdued."""
"The Urban Legends Reference Pages website concluded that ""Without having all the photographs at hand, a guide to demonstrate their correct sequencing, and more non-partisan news reports or accounts of the incident, we can only state that these pictures are, as the BBC termed them, ""graphic, but inconclusive."""
= = = Bishop of Kilmore = = =
"The Bishop of Kilmore is an episcopal title which takes its name after the parish of Kilmore, County Cavan in Ireland. In the Roman Catholic Church it remains a separate title, but in the Church of Ireland it has been united with other bishoprics."
"The see of Kilmore was originally known as Breifne (Latin: ""Tirbrunensis"", ""Tybruinensis"" or ""Triburnia""; Irish: ""Tír mBriúin"", meaning ""the land of the descendants of Brian"", one of the kings of Connaught) and took its name after the Kingdom of Breifne."
"On July 13, Arum issued a July 16 midnight deadline for Mayweather. ""Mayweather has until the end of the week. He could wait until the last minute. If it's Friday [July 16] and it's 11 p.m., and he says we have a deal, we have a deal,"" Arum would explain to Dan Rafael of ESPN. On July 15, Top Rank's website unveiled an official countdown to the deadline entitled ""Money"" Time: Mayweather's Decision."
"As soon as the deadline for Mayweather's response expired, Arum held a conference call. Arum revealed to the media that the negotiations he had been referring to consisted of a series of conversations with HBO Sports President Ross Greenburg. He also revealed that there was no actual direct communication with any representative from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions. ""I had a couple of conversations with Ross [Greenburg] and I laid out all the terms that would be acceptable to our side and I also informed him about the concession that Manny had made regarding drug testing. He got back to me in a couple of weeks and told me that he had had discussions with Al Haymon, representing Floyd Mayweather, and that everything looked good and we were nearing a resolution,"" Arum explained. During a Q & A session following his opening statement, Arum further explained, ""We have never talked to anybody on the Mayweather side and all conversations on our part were through Ross Greenburg and he reported on all conversations on the Mayweather side from Al Haymon."""
"On July 19, 2010, Ellerbe denied that negotiations ever took place and said nothing was ever agreed on. ""Here are the facts: Al Haymon, Richard Schaefer and myself speak to each other on a regular basis and the truth is no negotiations have ever taken place nor was there ever a deal agreed upon by Team Mayweather or Floyd Mayweather to fight Manny Pacquiao on November 13. Either Ross Greenburg or Bob Arum is not telling the truth, but history tells us who is lying,"" stated Ellerbe. Three days later, Schaefer backed Ellerbe's statement that negotiations never took place."
"Regarding comments he made suggesting that contracts for the megafight were close to being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, ""I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on."""
"Also on July 26, Greenburg released a statement saying he had been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, ""I had been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, carefully trying to put the fight together. Hopefully, someday this fight will happen. Sports fans deserve it,"" Greenburg revealed in a prepared statement sent out to select members of the media. Schaefer again supported Ellerbe's denial of negotiations and challenged both Greenburg and Arum to take lie detector tests. ""I think it's unfortunate that Ross made that statement. I fully stand behind the statement I made. I have not negotiated with Ross and I am not aware of any negotiations that have taken place,"" Schaefer told ESPN."
"On September 2, 2010, Mayweather unleashed a profanity-filled racist internet rant against Pacquiao via Ustream. He was misquoted as referring to Pacquiao as ""a yellow chump"" but he actually called him a ""little young chump"" and said, ""Once I stomp the midget, I’ll make that queer make me a sushi roll and cook me some rice."" In addition, he said, ""I'm going to cook that [expletive] with cats and dogs. Have some rice with a little barbecue dog."" The following day Mayweather apologized. ""I want to apologize to everybody.  ... I don't have a racist bone in my body, you know. I love everybody,"" Mayweather said. ""I was just having fun. I didn't really mean it, nothing in a bad way."""
"On July 8, 2011, ESPN reported that Pacquiao was willing to agree to random drug testing—but not by USADA. ""We have agreed in the Pacquiao camp to unlimited random testing done by a responsible, neutral organization,"" Arum told Yahoo!. ""We don't believe USADA is a neutral organization. I don't think anybody's test is as vigorous as the test administered by the Olympic Organization. And we can arrange for the Olympic Organization to handle the test under the supervision of the Athletic commission respective of the state where the fight is going to be held."" However, the following day, Pacquiao's top adviser, Michael Koncz, stated that Pacquiao had never agreed to testing all the way up to fight day. ""Will we give blood five days, seven days before the fight? You know, that's something I have to talk to Manny about, but we have nothing to hide,"" Koncz said."
"On January 20, 2012, Mayweather spoke directly to Pacquiao via telephone. ""He ask about a 50/50 split,"" Mayweather said. ""I told him no that can't happen, but what can happen is you can make more money fighting me then you have made in your career."" Mayweather offered to pay a flat fee of USD 40 million for a proposed fight but would not allow Pacquiao to share in the revenue. Pacquiao said, ""I spoke to Floyd ...and he offered me an amount. He didn't talk about the pay-per-views here and that's it. I can't agree with that. I told him I agree with 55 and 45 (split)."""
"Pacquiao appeared on the ESPN program ""First Take"" on September 20, 2012, and said he had no problem with the drug-testing issue. ""Whatever he wants to do,"" Pacquiao said. He said he was willing to be tested even on the night of the fight. On September 25, Mayweather and Pacquiao reached a confidential settlement in their federal defamation case. In a statement released through the mediator in the case, the Mayweathers said they ""wish to make it clear that they never intended to claim that Manny Pacquiao has used or is using any performance-enhancing drugs, nor are they aware of any evidence that Manny Pacquiao has used performance-enhancing drugs."""
"The ""Telegraph"" reported on December 20, that Mayweather said Pacquiao’s association with promoter Bob Arum is the reason why the bout will not happen. ""We all know the Pacquiao fight, at this particular time, will never happen, and the reason why the fight won't happen is because I will never do business with Bob Arum again in life, and Pacquiao is Bob Arum's fighter,"" Mayweather said."
"On January 7, 2014, Fighthype.com published an interview with Mayweather in which he called Pacquiao a ""desperate dog"" who is chasing a megabout due to his tax problems. In response, Pacquiao challenged Mayweather to a fight for charity. ""I challenge him to include in our fight contract that both of us will not receive anything out of this fight,"" Pacquiao said. ""We will donate all the proceeds from the fight—guaranteed prize, should there be any, gate receipts, pay-per-view and endorsements—to charities around the world."" He added, ""Floyd, if you’re a real man, fight me. Let’s do it for the love of boxing and for the fans. Let’s do it not for the sake of money. Let’s make the boxing fans happy."""
"As reported by at least five major media outlets (""USA Today"", ""Los Angeles Times"", ""The Hollywood Reporter"", ""The Wall Street Journal"" and the ""New York Post""), serious negotiations leading to success were kickstarted in May 2014 by a very unlikely source: a Hollywood waiter/actor named Gabriel Salvador (Bones, Bluebloods, Rizzoli & Isles, ). Salvador forged a friendship with CBS Network President Leslie Moonves when Moonves became a regular at Craig's restaurant in West Hollywood, where Salvador worked part-time as a waiter and where his son Elijah worked out at Freddie Roach's gym. Salvador and Moonves bonded over their mutual love of boxing. CBS is the parent company of the Showtime Network, which had invested heavily in boxing and spent top-dollar on a multi-year deal with Mayweather. Salvador told Moonves that he believed he could make the fight happen if he could get Moonves together with Pacquiao confidant and trainer Roach. Salvador believed he could do so based on his connection to both men and his ""unshakeable feeling"" that together they could cut through the politicking and power struggles that seemed to have stymied prior negotiations. Moonves agreed that Salvador should approach Roach to make an introduction with a view to making the fight a reality. Eventually, Salvador approached Roach and asked him if he would be willing to meet with Moonves to get the wheels in motion. Roach agreed and asked Salvador to set up a meeting."
"The first meeting between Moonves and Roach took place on May 28, 2014, at the Scarpetta restaurant in the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills, which Salvador attended. Both Roach and Moonves agreed the long-awaited bout had to happen and Roach gave Moonves the green-light to start making things happen. Roach later helped Moonves make peace with Pacquiao promoter Bob Arum. Moonves then brought the warring elements from both boxers' camps together and, with Salvador's help, even arranged meetings at his home. After difficult negotiations, it was not long after that both camps agreed to fight on the night of May 2, 2015. The consensus is that but for Salvador's key introduction, the fight would not have happened. Both Moonves and Pacquiao promoter Bob Arum have confirmed Salvador's pivotal role."
"For his role, Salvador maintains that he is a ""finder"" entitled to a finder's fee. But Salvador has yet to be paid that fee by either CBS or Roach/Pacquiao. The fight grossed more than $600 million, with the television networks taking in more than $400 million and Pacquiao grossing more than $160 million."
"On December 12, 2014, Mayweather proposed a May 2, 2015, fight with Pacquiao, citing his indirect frustration at not being able to make the fight happen in the past by stating that Pacquiao had lost to both Juan Manuel Márquez and Timothy Bradley respectively. He also stated that he (Pacquiao) was ""not on his level"". Mayweather then went on to close his comments with, ""Let's make this fight happen for the people and for the fans."""
"On January 13, Pacquiao agreed to terms for the fight. Bob Arum claimed that now only Mayweather's camp was holding up an official agreement. On January 27, Mayweather and Pacquiao finally met each other face to face for the first time during an NBA game between the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks in Miami. Pacquiao said they exchanged phone numbers and would communicate with each other. Pacquiao's advisor, Michael Koncz, said that the two future Hall of Famers later met at Pacquiao's hotel for about an hour to discuss the pending superfight and work out the remaining issues. Top Rank promoter Bob Arum expressed optimism that the fight could be finalized by Super Bowl Sunday at the soonest and that there would be no further deadlines for the fight, stating that the negotiations are nearly complete. On January 30, TMZ reported that the fight had been agreed upon by both sides and that a formal announcement would be made in the ""next couple of days."" However, members from both sides, including Bob Arum and Stephen Espinoza, refuted the report, saying that the deal had not been finalized yet and that negotiations on what would be a joint pay-per-view (Showtime–HBO) telecast of the fight were still clearing out the last significant issues before the deal could be finalized."
"On February 20, Mayweather announced that the fight was official and a contract had been signed for a fight to take place on May 2, 2015, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The fight was expected to shatter PPV buy records and gross millions of dollars with the ticket prices ranging from $3,500 to $250,000 and the PPV was expected to cost USD 89.95 for SD and USD 99.95 for HD. Boxing experts predicted the match would be the richest fight in boxing history and would generate $300 million."

"Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tickets for the fight went on sale on April 23 after an agreement had been reached over ticket allocation. Only 500 tickets went on sale to the public, priced at $1,500, $2,500, $3,500, $5,000 and $7,500 for the 16,800 capacity MGM Grand. The tickets that went on sale sold out within a minute. As per the contract, the first $160 million of revenue and the revenue above $180 million from the fight was split 60/40 between the fighters, with Mayweather receiving the larger 60% share. Revenue between $160 million and $180 million was to be split 51/49, with the 51% share going to the winner. Both fighters were expected to earn at least $100 million in revenue from their participation. Although the event was jointly promoted by Mayweather Promotions and Top Rank, the contract named Mayweather Promotions as the lead promoter of the fight. Both fighters agreed to undergo drug testing by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, including random blood and urine testing prior to the fight, a test following the fight and a ban from professional boxing for four years if they test positive. Neither fighter has failed a drug test during their professional career."
"Kenny Bayless served as the in-ring referee, as chosen by the Nevada Athletic Commission. Bayless has previously officiated five of Mayweather's past bouts and seven of Pacquiao's and he earned a record $25,000 for officiating this fight. Burt Clements, Dave Moretti and Glenn Feldman served as judges. The U.S. national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", was performed by Jamie Foxx. The Philippine national anthem, ""Lupang Hinirang"", was performed by Filipino-American singer Gail Banawis, joined by The Word Chorale—a choir of Filipino pastors."
"A large number of celebrities were in attendance; singer Justin Bieber was among Mayweather's entourage, while Pacquiao was joined by comedian Jimmy Kimmel—who had discussed the possibility of entering with him when Pacquiao appeared on his talk show ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"". Kimmel wore an outfit parodying Bieber's wardrobe from a pre-fight press conference and photobombed a pre-fight photo taken by Pacquiao. Other figures in attendance included Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Charles Barkley, Mike Tyson, Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, Michael J. Fox, Donald Trump, Jake Gyllenhaal, Amir Khan, Drew Barrymore, Jesse Jackson, Russell Westbrook, Mark Wahlberg, Lewis Hamilton, Leonardo DiCaprio, Don Cheadle, Michael Jordan, Sugar Ray Leonard, Paris Hilton, Nicki Minaj, Meek Mill, Ben Affleck, The Jonas Brothers, Michael Keaton, Tom Brady, Magic Johnson, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Evander Holyfield, Mariah Carey, Sting, 50 Cent and others."
"As both Pacquiao and Mayweather had exclusive relationships with the broadcasters, HBO and Showtime, at the time of the fight, the telecast of the fight was a joint production between HBO World Championship Boxing and Showtime Championship Boxing. This marked the first collaboration between the two American premium television services since Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson in 2002. It was executive produced and directed by Showtime's David Dinkins Jr. and Bob Dunphy and featured a mix of Showtime and HBO personalities. The ringside announcers for the fight included Roy Jones Jr. (HBO), Al Bernstein (Showtime) and Jim Lampley (HBO) provided analysis. Max Kellerman (HBO) and Jim Gray (Showtime) covered the locker rooms of Pacquiao and Mayweather, respectively. James Brown and Paulie Malignaggi of Showtime hosted the pre-fight show."
"The broadcast was, in most regions, distributed as a pay-per-view event. In the United States, the PPV cost was USD 89.95 (with an additional $10 charge for HD), a 40% increase over the PPV cost of Mayweather's 2013 fight against Canelo Álvarez. Rights to screen the fight in commercial venues such as bars and restaurants were administered by G&G Sports, with costs based upon venue size and other factors, reaching as high as $5,000 for a 257-seat establishment. Due to concerns that they may not have been able to recoup the cost of the PPV through cover charges and drink sales, some bars decided against screening the fight at all. Both HBO and Showtime aired encores of the fight the following Saturday, May 9, 2015."
"Both Showtime and HBO broadcast documentary specials focusing on the two fighters as part of the lead-up to the fight; Showtime produced the Mayweather-focused ""Inside Mayweather vs. Pacquiao""—with three episodes focusing on Mayweather's preparations for the event and an epilogue which aired the week following the fight, while HBO aired a one-hour Pacquiao-focused ""Mayweather/Pacquiao: At Last"", as well as encores of past Pacquiao fights. Showtime's sister outlet CBS Sports Network also aired supplemental programming, including encores of ""Inside Mayweather vs. Pacquiao"" and past Mayweather fights, live coverage of the weigh-in, special broadcasts of ""The Doug Gottlieb Show"" and ""Boomer and Carton"" from Las Vegas and coverage of the post-fight press conference."
"In Pacquiao's native country of the Philippines, Solar Entertainment held broadcast rights to the fight, reportedly paying $10 million (PHP 440 million). The telecast was made available via commercial free pay-per-view on the television providers Cignal and SkyCable, and at the locations of theatre chain SM Cinema (including IMAX theaters) and the Mall of Asia Arena. Unlike previous Pacquiao fights, whose free-to-air rights were held by GMA Network as part of a sub-licensing arrangement, a ""slightly-delayed"" telecast of the fight was simulcast by Solar Sports, GMA and the rival commercial networks ABS-CBN and TV5. Solar Sports President Wilson Tieng said that Pacquiao personally requested the joint broadcast due to its historic nature, and that ""everybody agreed to set aside all their differences to make sure that this will become the biggest event ever in Philippine television history."" GMA held exclusive radio rights to the fight."
"In Europe, generally, the fight was broadcast via PPV (Austria, United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Spain). Only a few TV holders in Europe decided otherwise – TVP (Poland), Sport 1 (Czech Republic and Hungary) and Discovery Italy (Deejay TV and DMAX). Sky Sports Box Office won exclusive television rights in the UK to the bout, and produced a four episode broadcast leading up to the event titled ""Mayweather vs. Pacquiao: Countdown""."
"Sportsmax TV and Cleeng offered the fight via PPV in 19 Caribbean countries, including Barbados, Jamaica, Surinam and Trinidad & Tobago."
"Due to the high profile of the event and the high price of the PPV, there were significant concerns surrounding piracy of the fight's telecast by either bars (which were required to purchase a higher-priced commercial license to televise the event, and were not legally allowed to purchase it through their television provider) or by online streaming services, with ""TorrentFreak"" going on to report that Mayweather vs. Pacquiao was ""destined to become the most pirated live sports event in history"". Organizers were especially concerned about the mobile broadcasting apps Meerkat and Periscope due to their relative ease of use and accessibility, as viewers could simply film their television screen with their phones to make a stream available."
"Alongside monitoring activities during the event, actions were also preemptively taken against several sites that advertised plans to illegally stream the fight. In the Philippines, the Philippine National Police's Anti-Cybercrime Group arrested the operator of a streaming service after a complaint by ABS-CBN and was granted a temporary restraining order in a Florida court for its infringements of copyrights and trademarks. HBO and Showtime filed a similar lawsuit against two other streaming services that advertised an intent to offer the fight under (which allows for preemptive claims of copyright infringement against those conspiring to infringe the copyrights of a broadcast) and a court issued a restraining order against the sites and all parties in ""active concert or participation with any of them, including any and all service providers who receive notice of this order"". The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the wide reach of the order, arguing that the clause of ""any and all service providers who receive notice of this order"" was comparable to the provisions of the previously proposed Stop Online Piracy Act, theorizing that other parties not originally named could become subject to the injunction by merely receiving notice of the order."
"A large number of Periscope streams were used to broadcast the fight, either indirectly with a focus on reactions from viewing parties, or simply rebroadcasting television feeds of the fight. One stream reportedly peaked at around 10,000 viewers, although these streams had inconsistent uptime due either to connection issues or to being reported and taken down by the service. Representatives of both Meerkat and Periscope reported that they acted upon takedown notices received throughout the evening. ESPN's Ryan McGee dubbed Periscope the ""winner"" of the fight due to the prominence it received through this manner. Dick Costolo, CEO of microblogging service and Periscope parent company Twitter, made a similar remark; although it was initially assumed to be in reference to the illegal streams, he clarified that it was actually in reference to HBO's usage of the service to stream behind-the-scenes from the fighters' locker rooms."
"The winner of the fight received a newly created belt by the WBC. The belt, valued at $1 million, is an exact replica of the current belt, except it has thousands of emeralds in place of the gold plating for the center logo. The belt also contains the faces of both Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao, along with the faces of the former WBC President, José Sulaimán and boxing legend Muhammad Ali. Two belts were initially made for the fight. The green emerald belt won the public fan vote over the black onyx belt with a vote of 53% to 47%."
"Both fighters wore eight-ounce (230 g) gloves with brands of their choosing. Mayweather wore custom Grant gloves with a multicolored paisley pattern, red & purple trim and the letters TBE (The Best Ever) on the cuff. Pacquiao wore standard red Cleto Reyes gloves with black & white trim. In Pacquiao's third professional loss to Érik Morales, he was forced to use Winning brand gloves the first time around. Pacquiao's complaints were that the gloves felt like ""pillows"" and they did not give him the same power as his Reyes ""puncher's gloves."" More recently, Mayweather had glove issues in his first bout with Marcos Maidana, stating that Maidana's Everlast MX gloves did not provide sufficient padding for the knuckles. The issue was later resolved with Marcos Maidana resorting to using Everlast Powerlock type gloves, leaving Maidana's trainer, Robert Garcia, unhappy with the negotiation."
